17,2018-02-14,Grasim,"Grasim Industries, an Aditya Birla Group firm, reports a consolidated net profit of Rs786.87 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December, mainly on account of higher expenses and loss from subsidiaries

New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries on Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs786.87 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, mainly on account of higher expenses and loss from subsidiaries. 
New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries on Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs786.87 crore for the quarter ended December 2017, mainly on account of higher expenses and loss from subsidiaries.
The company had posted a net profit of  ₹ 52.33 crore during the October-December period of the previous fiscal, Grasim Industries said in a regulatory filing. Total income during the quarter under review stood at  ₹ 5,523.75 crore. It was  ₹ 9,743.51 crore in the corresponding period in the previous fiscal.
The company said figures for the period are not comparable due to merger of Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd and acquisition of cement plants by its subsidiary Ultratech Cement from Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Jaypee Cement Corporation last year. 
Revenue is not comparable on account of GST implementation from 1 July, 2017.
Grasim Industries said the reported consolidated profit after tax for the quarter is lower compared to the previous period mainly on account of share of the company in the net loss of Idea Cellular Ltd, an associate firm.
The domestic viscose staple fibre (VSF) market demand remained buoyant with sales volume up by 9% YoY, the company said, adding that the uptrend in domestic caustic soda prices continued in the current quarter, driven by supply related issues in China and Europe and robust demand from major consuming segments (alumina and textile).
“UltraTech reported an increase in consolidated net revenue by 34% YoY to Rs8,019 crore and EBITDA by 17% to Rs1,494 crore in the quarter,"" Grasim Industries said.
On outlook, the company said the VSF business will continue to focus on expanding the market in India by partnering with the textile value chain.
“The demand for caustic soda in India is expected to grow with rising consumption from the alumina and textile sectors,"" it added.
On cement business, it said government spending on infrastructure, rural and affordable housing will be the key demand drivers."

New Delhi: Grasim Industries has received green nod for expanding the production of viscose staple fibre and captive power at Kharach unit in Bharuch, Gujarat, that would entail an investment of Rs1,800 crore, according to an official source. 
The company has four VSF (viscose staple fibre) plants in India, of which two are in Gujarat, one each in Kharach and Vilayat in Bharuch district. Last month, the company had received the environment clearance for expansion of Vilayat plant. 
Now, the company’s Birla Cellulosic unit has received the green light for expansion of its Kharach plant. In a letter issued to Grasim Industries, the union environment ministry said it has given clearance to the company’s proposal for expanding Kharach unit subject to compliance of certain conditions. 
The company plans to raise the production capacity of VSF from 1,27,750 tonne per annum (TPA) to 2,33,600 TPA, while that of the captive power plant from 25 MW to 45MW. According to the proposal, Birla Cellulosic will undertake the proposed expansion within the existing plant area in 242.81 hectare. 
The estimated project cost is Rs1,800 crore. The company wants to expand its VSF production capacity to meet the increased demand of man-made fibres in the country. The other products presently manufactured include sulphuric Acid, carbon disulphide and sodium sulphate. 
The Solven Spun Cellulosic Fibre unit and coal-based captive power plant are yet to be commissioned."

Mumbai: Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries will invest over Rs13,000 crore in its textile and cement businesses over the next 24-36 months, as the company looks to increase capacity and modernise production, a senior official of the group said on Wednesday.
On a standalone basis, the total capex for Grasim Industries’ textile business stands at Rs6,427 crore, which is to be utilised by the company till financial year 2021, Aditya Birla Group’s chief financial officer Sushil Agarwal said.
“The board of directors (of the company) today also approved an additional Rs1,000 crore investment into the chemical business, taking Grasim Industries’ standalone capex plan (for its textile business) to Rs7,427 crore (till FY2021),"" Agarwal said.
Grasim Industries, which also includes the group’s cement business, UltraTech, will invest Rs5,900 crore on capex to modernise its existing cement plants and carry out environmental upgradation and ramp up capacity of assets it acquired from Jaiprakash Associates.
On a consolidated basis, Grasim Industries will invest more than Rs13,327 crore in capex into its textile and cement businesses till financial year 2021.
“Cement plants belonging to Jaiprakash Associates were running at 15-20% capacity when we acquired them in June last year,"" Agarwal said, adding that the Kumar Mangalam Birla-led company has been able to turn around the assets and run them at 75% capacity in less than a year.
“On average, Indian cement plants run at 75% capacity. However, UltraTech plants run at over 85% capacity,"" Agarwal said. “The aim is to run Jaiprakash Associates’ cement plant at over 85% capacity in future,"" he said.
Grasim Industries plans to fund almost the capex from its cash flows, but it could look to raise debt if the circumstances require the company to do so.
“Grasim Industries, having generated Rs3,500 crore as EBITDA during FY18, has surplus cash on its balance sheet. Our balance sheet also allows us an option to raise up to Rs12,000 crore in debt to grow, in case of a short-term mismatch,"" Agarwal said, adding that the priority of the company would be to fund its capital expenditure from its cash flows. 
Grasim Industries on Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of Rs853.62 crore for the quarter ended March 2018. Revenue rose 47.8 % at Rs4,605.55 crore during the same period.
The company is expected to focus on its viscose staple fibre (VSF) business to register growth and expand its market in India.
“Viscose is eating out of other fiber markets. Our domestic fiber business has grown by 22% (annually) during the March 2018 quarter,"" said Grasim’s managing director Dilip Gaur, adding that the bulk of the growth in the textile business is expected to come from the company’s VSF business in the future.
Meanwhile, the merger of Idea Cellular, the telecom arm of the Aditya Birla Group, with the Indian arm of global telecom major Vodafone Plc, is expected to be completed soon.
“The Idea-Vodafone merger is on track and should happen soon though it is very difficult to put a date on it as the final approval is pending with the department of telecommunications,"" said Sushil Agarwal, adding that he is hopeful that the consumption in the country would pick up over the next couple of years."
13,2018-05-24,Grasim,"The Competition Commission has ordered a probe against Aditya Birla group firm Grasim Industries for alleged abuse of dominant position with regard to the sale of viscose staple fibre

New Delhi: The Competition Commission has ordered a probe against Aditya Birla group firm Grasim Industries for alleged abuse of dominant position with regard to the sale of viscose staple fibre (VSF). 
New Delhi: The Competition Commission has ordered a probe against Aditya Birla group firm Grasim Industries for alleged abuse of dominant position with regard to the sale of viscose staple fibre (VSF).
The ruling has come following three separate complaints filed with the fair trade regulator. 
Since the “subject matter"" of the three complaints was same, CCI had clubbed them and passed a common order.
 After finding prima-facie evidence of competition norm violations, the regulator has directed its investigation arm — the Director General (DG) — to conduct an investigation against the company.
The allegations pertained to the conduct of Grasim Industries in imposing discriminatory conditions on sale of VSF, monitoring the customers by collecting details of their consumption, production and sales and practising unfair policies with respect to discounts offered, among others.
For the cases, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) considered the market for “provision for sale of viscose stable fibre in India"" as the relevant one.
In its order dated 16 May, CCI observed that Grasim Industries is “offering various discounts/ incentives/ rebates, inter alia quantity discount, continuity discount, umbrella discount, comfort blend discount etc"". 
Before giving discounts, the firm compels its customers to disclose information regarding their production capacities, list of their suppliers, buyers, their turnover, and balance sheet as a pre-condition for supply of VSF, CCI said. 
Noting that Grasim Industries is able to impose such conditions on the VSF buyers owing to its “dominance in the VSF market in India"", CCI said the company appears to be “prima facie"" violating the provisions of Section 4 of the Competition Act. Section 4 pertains to abuse of dominant market position. 
One of the complainants had alleged that the firm had arbitrarily withdrawn all sales terms (credits and discounts) agreed between the two parties and ultimately refused to supply VSF to it.
CCI said that the withdrawal of sales terms and discounts would leave the product of the complainant at a price point at which no takers would be available.
The complainant appears to be discriminated vis-à-vis similarly placed customers to whom discount is being provided by Grasim Industries, the regulator added. “... nothing stated in this order shall tantamount to final expression of opinion on the merits of the case and the DG shall conduct the investigation without being swayed in any manner whatsoever by the observations made herein,"" CCI said. 
Under the Competition Commission of India (General) Regulations, the regulator had granted confidentiality over the identity of the three complainants, as per the order."

Kapania has been leading operations of Idea Cellular as managing director and chief executive officer since 2011. However, the company has been posting losses since October-December quarter of 2016-17. In its last financial result before the merger with Vodafone India, Idea Cellular reported a total comprehensive income of  ₹ 263.6 crore during the April-June quarter, mainly on account of a one-time gain from the sale of mobile towers. The company had posted loss of  ₹ 816 crore in the same period a year ago.
Kapania will also be made a member of the group’s cement and aluminium business review councils, the source added."

Mumbai: Robust quarterly production and sales volume led Grasim Industries, the Aditya Birla Group’s textile and chemicals manufacturing company, report a 25% rise in consolidated net profit to  ₹ 1,116 crore during the April-June quarter. The June-quarter consolidated results are not comparable to those of the year-ago period because the previous year’s results do not include the results of the erstwhile Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd, which was merged intro Grasim on 1 July 2017.

The June-quarter consolidated results are not comparable to those of the year-ago period because the previous year’s results do not include the results of the erstwhile Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd, which was merged intro Grasim on 1 July 2017.
On a like-to-like basis, standalone net profit for the quarter stood at  ₹ 643 crore, up 85% from the  ₹ 347 crore a year ago, the company’s best ever performance.
Net revenue for the viscose business was  ₹ 2,480 crore, higher by 35% and EBITDA came in at  ₹ 586 crore, up 68%. The VSF (viscose staple fibre) business reported its highest-ever quarterly production and sales volume of 134KT (kilotonnes) and 132KT, respectively. The share of domestic sales in overall sales rose to 82% in the first quarter, compared with 69% in the year-ago period, primarily driven by the expansion of the domestic market and in-house brand Liva.
“Liva has 33 brand partners and if it were a standalone fashion brand, it would be the largest in India,"" Grasim Industries Managing Director Dilip Gaur told Mint in an interview. “We are in the process of building manufacturing capabilities for Liva in Indonesia, after which we will also look at Turkey and Bangladesh.""
Net revenue from the chemicals business for the quarter rose 46% year on year to  ₹ 1,579 crore, and EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) increased 103% to  ₹ 495 crore. At the board meeting on Tuesday, the management approved the expansion plans for caustic soda and speciality chemicals at existing locations for total capital expenditure of  ₹ 1,112 crore. This would lead to a 14% increase in caustic soda capacity to 1,310 KTPA (kilo tonnes per annum) by 2020-22.
This brings the company’s standalone capital expenditure plan to  ₹ 7,539 crore, the majority of which will be funded by internal accruals during 2019 to 2021.
Grasim holds significant shareholding in Aditya Birla group companies Idea Cellular, UltraTech and Aditya Birla Financial Services, which contribute to the company’s consolidated earnings.
“Directionally however,"" said Sushil Agarwal, group chief financial officer, “The standalone business’s performance is improving quarter on quarter and accounting for a bigger share. This quarter, 58% of our net profit was from the standalone business.""

New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries on Wednesday reported a consolidated net loss of Rs1,299.86 crore for the quarter ended September 2018 on account of an exception item related to the merger of Vodafone with Idea Cellular.
It had posted a net profit of Rs799.03 crore during the July-September period of last fiscal, Grasim Industries said in a BSE filing.
Its revenue from operations was up 23.76% to Rs16,795 crore during the period under review as against Rs13,570.45 crore of the corresponding quarter last fiscal.
With merger of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular into Vodafone Idea Ltd, Idea’s share in profit of VIL has not been consolidated with effect from August 31 2018, the company said.
“The exceptional item of Rs2,003 crore represents the difference between book value and fair value of Vodafone Idea Ltd as on 30 August 2018. This has been charged to the Profit and Loss Account, consequent to Vodafone Idea Ltd ceasing to be an Associate,"" the company said.
Its total expenses were at Rs15,460.72 crore.

9,2018-11-16,Grasim,"Grasim Industries's various  commitments and connections mean that there are other risks to consider while buying the stock

Grasim Industries Ltd’s shares fell by more than 8% after it announced its highest Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ever. Ebitda in its stand-alone business rose an impressive 36% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,070 crore. 
Grasim Industries Ltd’s shares fell by more than 8% after it announced its highest Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ever. Ebitda in its stand-alone business rose an impressive 36% year-on-year to  ₹ 1,070 crore.
But Grasim’s fortunes aren’t merely determined by the performance of the viscose staple fibre and chemicals businesses. It is also a holding company that houses stakes in cement, telecom and financial services firms within the Aditya Birla Group.
Investors’ latest worry is that Grasim’s 11.55% stake in Vodafone Idea Ltd is proving to be a bigger drag than what they had feared. The telecom firm announced fundraising plans worth  ₹ 25,000 crore on Wednesday, and Grasim’s share is likely to be around  ₹ 2,900 crore.
“Grasim would like to maintain its current stake in the company as it finds current valuations in the telecom sector very attractive. It will also consider the valuations while deciding on subscription to any rights issue by Vodafone Idea,"" analysts at Edelweiss wrote in a note to clients after attending Grasim’s conference call with investors. 
As it is, the company has had to write down its investment in Vodafone Idea by about  ₹ 2,000 crore, thanks to the huge drop in the telecom firm’s valuations this year. 
Investors’ reaction to the fundraising plans clearly show they see it as good money going after bad. Not only did Grasim’s shares fall on Thursday, but even Vodafone Idea’s shares fell by more than 10%. This is despite the news that the promoters are planning to bring in $2.5 billion to strengthen the company’s balance sheet.
It’s likely that the company may need to infuse capital into Aditya Birla Capital Ltd as well to support its growth. These potential capital commitments are likely to act as an overhang on the Grasim stock, says analysts at Edelweiss.
For investors, it simply means there is no easy way to benefit from the growth in the core business. Grasim’s various other commitments and connections mean that there are various other risks to consider while buying the stock.
It’s little wonder that the viscose staple fibre and the chemicals business are valued at a high discount. After applying a 50% haircut, the value of its various holdings in group firms adds up to about  ₹ 43,000 crore. With Grasim’s market cap at  ₹ 53,000 crore currently, this means the core business is valued at about 4.2 times estimated earnings for the year till March 2020, using earnings estimates from Edelweiss."

New Delhi: Aditya Birla Group firm Grasim Industries Ltd on Monday said it has inked a pact to acquire chlor-alkali business of KPR Industries by way of a slump sale for a cash consideration of  ₹253 crore.
The company, which has inked a definitive agreement to acquire the business, said the transaction will be funded through internal accruals. KPR Industries’ chlor-alkali business comprises an under-construction 200 tonnes per day project at Balabhadrapuram, Andhra Pradesh.
As part of the deal, Grasim would take over the assets and identified liabilities associated with the business.
KPR Industries, on the other hand, will utilize the capital towards a full and final settlement of the lenders’ dues.
“This acquisition is a strategic fit, and further strengthens our group’s leadership in the chlor-alkali sector. Caustic soda is a critical input in the aluminium sector. Given the expansion plans for the aluminium businesses, it will serve as an excellent sourcing point for leading aluminium players,"" Birla Carbon Business chief executive officer Santrupt B. Misra said in a statement.
The acquisition is in line with Grasim’s strategy to strengthen operations on the east coast of the country, said the company.
“Further, the purchase of a partially-completed project vis-a-vis a greenfield project will translate into a shorter time-to-market,"" it added.
Once operationalized, the project, along with other ongoing expansion projects, will enhance Grasim’s caustic soda capacity to 1.22 million tonnes per annum.
Caustic soda is one of the essential inputs for the manufacture of alumina. It is also used widely in various other industries—viscose staple fibre, water treatment, pharma, chemicals, etc.
The chlor-alkali division of Grasim is already operating seven chlor-alkali plants across India.
On Monday, Grasim Industries' shares fell 0.9% to  ₹700.20 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex shed 0.87% to end the day at 35,498.44 points."

Bharti Infratel, Indus Towers merger faces govt clearance delays
The proposed merger between Bharti Infratel Ltd and Indus Towers Ltd cannot be completed by 24 October as the company is still awaiting a key government approval, Mint reported citing Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta. A new committee is expected to meet on Thursday to evaluate “all possible options"" for future strategy. “The delay in getting this approval is because of the procedure involved,"" Gupta said in a post-earnings call on Tuesday. Gupta’s statement comes a day after Bharti Infratel informed the stock exchanges that its board had noted that all the requisite government approvals had not been received till date, and conditions precedent and processes were not completed. The board’s decision is expected on 24 October. In April 2018, the two tower companies had agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company, barring state-owned China Tower. The proposed combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers. Its nearest rival in India will be ATC with 78,000 towers. Once the merger is completed, the two companies have envisaged that Airtel will hold between 33.8% and 37.2% in the combined entity. Vodafone Group Plc will own between 26.7% and 29.4%. Airtel and Vodafone will have equal rights in the merged entity.
IHH Healthcare to exit two hospital JVs in India
Caught in the legal crosshairs that has put its Fortis acquisition in a limbo even after a year of its announcement, Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare is planning to reduce its India footprint by selling two major assets back to their original founder-promoters, The Economic Times reported citing multiple people aware of the development. It has initiated discussions to cash out of its 62.2% stake in Hyderabad-based Continental Hospitals and 74% in Global Hospitals back to the promoter family. Hyderabad based Continental Hospital has a capacity of 750 beds while Global Hospitals has a capacity of over 2,000 beds under hospitals in Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai. IHH is believed to be open to divesting its stakes at almost half the value at which it originally bought them. Continental’s founder Gurunath Reddy and family has been trying to rope in a strategic partner who can help in buying back shares from the Malaysian group. Dr Ravindranath of Global Hospitals has been in talks with various private equity investors for backing his buyback transactions. Alleged mismanagement and differences between promoters and IHH are the major reasons behind IHH’s move to exit. The performances of these chains have also come down in the recent past.

Shares of banks and Grasim Industries slipped on Thursday after the Supreme Court upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT), which effectively means telecom operators may have to pay the government  ₹92000 crore in past dues.
The order comes at a time when Indian banks grapple with mounting non-performing assets and have seen their valuations erode.
On Thursday, Yes Bank ended 5.8% lower, State Bank of India 4.7%%, Indusind Bank 4%, RBL Bank 3%, Federal Bank 2.8%. BSE Bankex fell 1.2%.
Shares of Grasim Industries, which has an exposure to the telecom sector via its 11.55% stake in Vodafone Idea, slumped 5%.
The order is a huge blow to private telcos, who have been running losses for the past many quarters and show no signs of making money in the near future.
Vodafone Idea slumped 22%, but Bharti Airtel pared losses and gained 3%.
""Bharti Airtel shares are up even though it will be impacted by the SC order; this is because investors are pricing in a two-player market, with the assumption that Vodafone Idea will not be able to survive under the weight of the penalty,"" said analysts at two domestic institutional brokerages requesting anonymity.
AGR is the basis on which department of telecommunications (DoT) calculates levies payable by operators and it has been a bone of contention between the telcos and the government. Telecom operators are liable to pay around 3-5% and 8% of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT.
The matter had been under litigation for 14 years with operators arguing that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisting that AGR should include all revenues earned by an operator, including that from non-core telecom operations."

Its revenue from operation was at  ₹18,430.27 crore, up 3%, during the quarter under review as against  ₹17,892.42 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.
""Consolidated EBITDA at  ₹3,180 crore recorded a growth of 7% Y-o-Y and PAT (before exceptional items and one-time deferred tax benefit) was up by 6% Y-o-Y to  ₹639 crore driven by superior performance of the company's subsidiaries, UltraTech Cement Limited and Aditya Birla Capital Limited.

Its revenue from Viscose segment was at  ₹2,431.42 crore, down 6.67%, to  ₹2,605.36 crore of Q2/FY 2018-19.
""The weakness in the domestic VSF realisations impacted this quarter's profitability. The benefit of falling input costs like pulp prices will get reflected in the coming quarters due to inventory time lag,"" said Grasim Industries.
While, its cement business UltraTech' revenue was at  ₹9,620.47 crore, up 4.01%, as against  ₹9,249.26 crore.
""UltraTech completed the acquisition of Century Textiles and Industries cement business... With this acquisition, UltraTech's cement manufacturing capacity stands augmented to 117.4 million tonnes per annum (MTPA), including its overseas capacity. This makes UltraTech the 3rd largest cement company in the world, outside of China,"" the company said.
Revenue from Chemicals during the quarter was at  ₹1,347.30 crore, down 16.44%, as against  ₹1,612.38 crore.
""Softening of Caustic Soda prices globally has led to decline in the domestic prices, resulting in lower profitability on YoY basis,"" said Grasim.
While its Financial Services segment revenue reported a 12.72% increase at  ₹3,960.86 crore during the period from  ₹3,513.59 crore a year ago.
Revenue from others segment was at  ₹1,305.60 crore, up 13.32%, as against  ₹1,152.10 crore.
On the outlook, Grasim said its VSF business will continue to focus on expanding the market in India and its chemical business is under an expansion mode for both chlor-alkali and specialty chemicals. On UltraTech, it said: ""The company with its presence across the country is the best positioned to take advantage of the revival in cement demand, despite the anomalies that may get created in demand patterns in some parts of the country due to extraneous reasons.""""Grasim is incurring capex to increase capacities across its key business lines and is potentially well positioned to leverage the next phase of the economic growth,"" the company said.
Shares of Grasim Industries Ltd on Thursday settled at  ₹734.30 apiece on the BSE, down 0.64% from the previous close."
