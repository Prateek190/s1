386,2018-01-03,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki has defied the global law of the automobile industry, that large multinationals eventually always dominate car markets

The latest numbers on car sales threw up one clear winner in India’s three-million-strong passenger vehicle market. Sales at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India’s largest car maker, grew 12.1% in December even as even as Hyundai Motor India Ltd, its nearest rival, posted flat sales. 
The latest numbers on car sales threw up one clear winner in India’s three-million-strong passenger vehicle market. Sales at Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India’s largest car maker, grew 12.1% in December even as even as Hyundai Motor India Ltd, its nearest rival, posted flat sales.
Maruti continuing success is truly mind boggling. The company has a market share over 50% in one of the world’s fastest growing market populated by the biggest names in the business. The company has defied the global law of the automobile industry, that large multinationals eventually always dominate markets. In a highly consolidated business, a handful of major corporations own nearly all of the world’s major car brands.
Thus, in Brazil, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles leads the market with 18% share followed by General Motors (GM) and Volkswagen. In Russia, Renault Nissan is the clear market leader with 33.5% share followed by Volkswagen. Local car maker Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ) has only a 3.9% share. The South African market is also dominated by Volkswagen Toyota.
Even more fascinating is the 30 million-unit-strong Chinese car market, the largest in the world, which is dominated by foreign brands in joint ventures with local companies. EIU estimates show that these JVs are the ten largest automobile manufacturers in the Chinese market. Volkswagen which has JVs with SAIC and First Automobile Works (FAW), leads the market with sales of four million vehicles followed by GM, which through its 10 JVs sold 3.8m vehicles in the Chinese market in 2016.
No major emerging market has a home-grown leader not even when as in the case of Lada in Russia or the Proton in Malaysia or the Yugoslav Yugo, the government itself threw its weight behind them. Eventually the economies of scale in sourcing components and the benefits of having a large installed base rule out small emerging players, no matter what their pedigree.
There is no better example of this than the Malaysian National Car Project which was conceived in 1979 by the country’s then prime minister Mahathir Mohamad and formally incorporated as Proton (Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Berhad) in 1983. Mahathir backed the project calling it “a symbol of Malaysians as a dignified people"" and for years the state provided generous funding besides making efforts to take it to the US market. Despite initial success (by 1986 Proton had a 64% share of the domestic market for cars below 1,600cc) the project soon turned into a white elephant and was losing millions of dollars when it was sold to Chinese auto maker Geely Holding Group Co. last year.
Just how did Maruti Suzuki manage to avoid this fate? At its inception in the early 1980s as Sanjay Gandhi’s pet project, Maruti received preferential treatment including access to scarce capital, easier capacity constraints and indigenization levels and most important, protection from competition. By the time the market was opened to competition from abroad, it had found its feet.
The company is now controlled by Suzuki Motor Corp. but it was a resounding success even before 2013 when the Japanese company raised its stake to 56%. Indeed, the tussle over the stake hike was a reflection of the company’s strong financials.
Over the years the company has taken advantage of economies of scale. The cost-efficient production model all companies covet is optimal only when a plant is operating at high capacity utilization levels. As growth rates have slowed, multinationals like GM and Ford have found their small market shares making manufacturing unviable. GM announced its decision to pull out of the country last while Ford has been a laggard. Maruti with its multiple products at virtually every price point has been the clear gainer from the failures of these global giants. It is really a case off going from strength to strength though how it handles the coming challenge of electric vehicles could test its mettle.
Maruti’s success also leads to the piquant question, one that First Global’s Shankar Sharma has been raising persistently. Is early-stage protectionism a pre-requisite for creating national champions? In a series of tweets last November he pointed to the success of companies like Bharti Airtel as well as Indian private banks as the “Best example of what protection can deliver: highly restricted foreign competition, easy access to capital. Huge domestic market. Result: highest profitability in the world. Global size market caps"". 
It is a reflection of how far India has travelled down the liberalization road that his views are considered contrarian in today’s market."
384,2018-01-09,Maruti,"The traffic safety management system will feature advanced cameras including Red Light Violation Detection System, Speed Violation Detection System and Automatic Number Plate Recognition system

New Delhi: In an initiative in the corporate social responsibility domain, India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Limited on Tuesday joined hands with Delhi Police to implement a traffic safety management system (TSMS) in the national capital. 
New Delhi: In an initiative in the corporate social responsibility domain, India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Limited on Tuesday joined hands with Delhi Police to implement a traffic safety management system (TSMS) in the national capital.
The traffic management system will be set up along the capital’s Ring Road corridor from Dhaula Kuan to Sarai Kale Khan—a stretch of around 14-km. A memorandum of agreement (MoA) in this regard was signed between Delhi Police and Maruti Suzuki in the presence of Nitin Gadkari, minister for road transport and highways, and shipping and water resources, river development and Ganga rejuvenation and Anil Baijal, Lt Governor of Delhi.
“I am confident that a successful technology model in the capital city will encourage its adoption in other parts of the country, and make our roads safer. Delhi Police, which has been thinking far ahead of us in the area of Intelligent Traffic Management, has already given us much guidance on the technology and its execution,"" said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and chief executive of Maruti Suzuki India Limited.
The TSMS project, the first of its kind in New Delhi, is in line with the union government’s focus to make roads safe and bring down accidents and fatalities.
“The TSMS will feature advanced cameras including Red Light Violation Detection System (RLVDS), Speed Violation Detection System (SVDS) and Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system. With these advanced camera systems it will be possible to simultaneously capture red-light violation as well as speed violation by a vehicle,"" the company said in a statement.
Maruti Suzuki will spend nearly Rs15 crore on this project which is likely to become operational in the next one year. In addition, Maruti Suzuki and Delhi Police also plan to engage with academic institutions and social groups to spread awareness on traffic enforcement systems and safe driving practices in the national capital."

Mumbai: India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Monday said it will introduce a new design language through a compact car that will have a bold presence with “distinct SUV like characters"".
The company called it #ConceptFutureS.
“Compact is beautiful, #ConceptFutureS beautifully carries forward this Suzuki slogan and creates its own positioning by breaking away from the conventional proportions of a compact car,"" the company said in a statement.
The concept of the car will be showcased during February Auto Expo.
“The increasing preference for UVs and their bold architecture inspired our design team to study a new character for compact cars. ConceptFutureS could mark a distinctive shift in how compact cars are shaped and designed in India in the future,"" said C.V. Raman, senior executive director (engineering), Maruti Suzuki India.
The design boasts of an upright stance, commanding higher seating and ground clearance, horizontal hood giving it a unique aggressive stance and posture—traits of an SUV that Indian customers seem to have adored during the last 10 years.
“The sketch exudes confidence and aggressive demeanour,"" the company said.
At 1.19pm, Maruti Suzuki India shares traded 0.16% up at Rs9,449.50 on BSE, while the Sensex rose 0.54% to 34,338.74 points."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, on Wednesday raised the prices of its cars by between Rs1,700 and Rs17,000 across its entire product range.  
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, on Wednesday raised the prices of its cars by between Rs1,700 and Rs17,000 across its entire product range. 
Maruti has followed rivals Hyundai Motor India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, which have increased prices to factor in a rise in commodity and other input prices.
Honda Cars India Ltd, the local arm of the Japanese carmaker, has also raised prices in the range of Rs6,000-32,000 across segments to offset the rise in input costs.
“Maruti Suzuki India Limited today announced a price increase ranging from Rs1,700/- to Rs17,000/- (ex-showroom-Delhi) across models, owing to an increase in commodity and other administrative and distribution costs. The new prices are effective from 10th January 2018,"" the company said in a statement.
In December, Hyundai, the second largest carmaker in the country, decided to increase the price of its products by 2% across segments.
Tata Motors and other carmakers also raised prices from the start of the calendar year.
Companies usually anticipate the likely increase in the prices of commodities in the coming year and decide the extent of increase in prices at the start of the year."
382,2018-01-17,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki is looking for lithium suppliers for a lithium ion battery plant in Gujarat and planning to build a brand new electric car for India, says CEO Kenichi Ayukawa

New Delhi: Thirty-four years after rolling out the country’s first people’s car, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is back at the drawing board. The trigger: the coming shift to emission-free electric vehicles (EVs), the kind of change that comes once in a lifetime. 
New Delhi: Thirty-four years after rolling out the country’s first people’s car, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is back at the drawing board. The trigger: the coming shift to emission-free electric vehicles (EVs), the kind of change that comes once in a lifetime.
The company is looking for lithium suppliers for a lithium ion battery plant in Gujarat, planning to build a brand new electric car for India, and working with its dealers to set up charging networks, managing director and chief executive officer Kenichi Ayukawa said in an interview. The efforts are part of Maruti’s initiatives to move towards an electric car portfolio.
“In a sense, we are trying to challenge ourselves as the time has come to change the game. Hence, we have to review (our strategy) and start again from zero,"" Ayukawa said. “We need to decide if we want to buy (lithium) from a (Latin) American country or some other country. We need to find a source for that.""
EVs account for less than 1% of global auto sales, but their threat is forcing the world’s biggest automakers—including Maruti, India’s largest carmaker—to reinvent themselves.
The company is also running a nation-wide survey to understand the needs and expectations of customers in the EV segment.
Seeking government support, Ayukawa said that if the supply of lithium is constrained, it will hinder the country’s EV programme. “If we cannot get lithium, we cannot make such kind of a product.""
Getting lithium is one thing, safe handling is another. “Lithium ion batteries can be very dangerous—it can lead to fire,"" Ayukawa said. While the lithium supply falls in place, Maruti will focus on developing the EV.
The company will also need to figure out how the batteries can be used. Such systems need to be in place before introducing EVs, he added.
It is also critical to keep costs under control. “It will be impossible for people to buy a Rs5 lakh car if that becomes a Rs20 lakh car. Nobody could buy that,"" Ayukawa added.
“Dealers will have to handle a new kind of technology. So we will have to educate the people at the service centres. That will take some time,"" he said.
Ayukawa claims the Suzuki battery plant coming up in Gujarat will give it the first-mover advantage; however, local rivals Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd are already ahead in the EV game. Besides, Maruti will enjoy none of the benefits of the licence regime that prevailed when it was still a fledgling automaker.
The Indian government has been categorical about promoting fully electric vehicles. It has clearly dissuaded mild, full or plug-in hybrid vehicles by substantially increasing taxes under the goods and services tax. The government has stated its intent to move to an all-electric fleet by 2030. 
Ayukawa understands that the Indian government is looking for a solution to cut pollution levels and the move to introduce an electric fleet is aimed in that direction.
“The point is that they are also looking for a good solution and so are we. So, we have to collaborate and find out a good solution. But I think that is not an easy work and it takes time,"" Ayukawa said.
A shift to EVs will help reduce pollutants and fuel imports. This assumes significance given India’s energy import bill of around $150 billion—this is expected to reach $300 billion by 2030. India imports around 80% of its oil and 18% of its natural gas requirements."

Maruti’s market share in the passenger vehicle segment since recovered from 38% in 2012 to 51% in the first three quarters of the current financial year and that has propelled the company’s stock to an all time high—breaching the Rs10,000 mark—and made it the sixth most valuable company on BSE. Maruti Suzuki is going back to the drawing board again as the India automobile industry stands at the cusp of a shift to electric mobility. In an interview, Ayukawa suggests it will be a challenge for Maruti Suzuki to establish an ecosystem for electric vehicles (EVs)—just as it was a challenge in 1983 when it started to manufacture vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE).

The model will be available in both petrol and diesel engine options. While the petrol variant will have a 1.2 litre engine, the diesel option is powered by a 1.3 litre engine, the company said.
The new Swift is 40 mm wider and has a 20 mm longer wheel base with more cabin space, headroom and luggage space than the current generation car, Maruti Suzuki said. The luggage space has increased by 58 litres, around 28% more than the second generation Swift.
“The all new Swift with its distinctive design, advanced technology, uplifting performance and enduring driver experience will bring disruption in the premium hatchback segment,"" said R.S. Kalsi, senior executive director (marketing and sales) at Maruti Suzuki India. In its newest avatar, the Swift undergoes a bold transformation to meet the aspiration of young and ever changing customer, he added. “We are delighted to open bookings for the all-new Swift and look forward to a grand launch at the Auto Expo 2018.""

Pune: The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India plans to introduce around four new products in the next 12 to 18 months to build further on five years of successive double digit sales growth. 
The company expects to close the ongoing fiscal with double digit sales growth. Its sales in the domestic market during the April-December period grew by 15.5% at 12,26,418 units as against 10,61,873 units in the year-ago period. It will launch the all-new version of its popular hatchback Swift at the upcoming Auto Expo to be held from 9-14 February. 
According to sources, besides the new Swift, the company plans to introduce a new refreshed version of its mid-sized sedan, Ciaz and multiple purpose vehicle Ertiga in the coming months. “An all new version of compact car Wagon R is also in the pipeline but its launch timeline hasn’t been fixed,"" a source said. 
Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Director (Marketing and Sales) R S Kalsi, however, declined to comment on the company’s launch programme for the next fiscal. “That’s a continuous process and we cannot comment on which one will come when,"" he told PTI when asked about the upcoming new product introductions in the market. 
Commenting on the company’s performance in the ongoing fiscal, he said in the April-December period the company’s sales have grown by 15.3% but the growth rate will be lesser in the fourth quarter due to high base effect of the year-ago period. “We will end the year on healthy double digit growth. Last six years we have been growing more than the industry. The best part is that this will be the fifth year of double digit growth in a row, which is quite an achievement,"" Kalsi said. 
He said the company has been able to sustain its growth momentum in the last few years despite challenges of two consecutive droughts in many parts of India that had an impact on rural markets and policy disruption such as demonetisation and impact of GST implementation. 
Currently the industry growth is at 8.13% and MSI is confident that it would be ahead of the industry again, he added. When asked about the outlook for 2018-19, Kalsi said, “We expect the similar momentum to continue for the industry. We do not foresee any disruption"". However, for Maruti Suzuki, he said, “We are yet to present our budget to the top management, we are yet to work out our budget for next year. So, commenting on a number for next year will not be possible"". 
The company is confident that new products like the upcoming Swift will help in adding more volumes. “On the first year of its launch Swift did one lakh units. Subsequent to that, the outgoing Swift has been selling on an average of 15,000 units a month. This (the new one) being many steps above that, we expect the market demand will be more than that,"" Kalsi added. 
The company’s parent Suzuki has spent around  ₹ 800 crore on the development of the new Swift. The new vehicle will so be produced at Suzuki’s Gujarat plant along with Baleno, besides MSI’s Manesar plant."

New Delhi: At first, the Delhi Auto Expo used to be all about small, affordable cars targeted at first-time buyers. Then, as customer preferences changed, India’s only automobile show started featuring big, bulky sports utility vehicles (SUVs) aimed at an upwardly mobile, aspirational class.
The trend is set to change again. The 2018 Auto Expo next month will see a marked shift towards electric cars and vehicles that run on other eco-friendly technologies.
“The show will be beyond just electric vehicles (EVs). Expect a host of new and futuristic technologies on the showcase,"" said Vishnu Mathur, director general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, the industry lobby group that organizes the show.
Automakers are shifting their medium- and long-term focus away from diesel and petrol engines as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government pushes for an all-electric fleet of vehicles on the country’s roads by 2030, seeking to cut carbon emissions and curb oil imports.
At the 2018 Auto Expo, which will run from 9-14 February, India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd will showcase its first ever EV concept known as #Concept E-Survivor, which is expected to be introduced in the Indian market in 2020. The car is being developed by Suzuki Motor Corp., Maruti’s parent, in collaboration with Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest automobile maker.
Maruti will also exhibit a new hybrid vehicle which has been under development. It is known as the next-gen HEV.
“This change has happened since the technology in the automobile sector is moving towards electric vehicles. Now, the pace at which it will move nobody knows and the government has made clear its willingness to shift towards electric vehicles. With this kind of a show, it is certain that carmakers are ready to embrace EV technology,"" R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, explained.
Renault India Pvt. Ltd, the local unit of French automaker Renault SA, will showcase one pure electric car which is expected to be launched in India by 2022, according to its mid-term plan (2017-2022). The company will also display hybrid and plug-in hybrid cars.
“Being a global leader in electric vehicles, Renault will showcase its prowess from its global portfolio. Also on display would be the existing range of Renault India product portfolio with innovative themes,"" the company said in a statement.
Hyundai Motor India Ltd will showcase electric cars that it sells globally under the Ioniq brand. New entrant Kia Motors Corp. is expected to display its entire range of hybrid and electric vehicles.

At the Auto Expo, the emphasis will be on sustainable mobility, going beyond electric vehicles, said Avik Chattopadhyay, founder of Expereal, a branding strategy firm.
“Japan emphasizes plug-in hybrid vehicles while European countries are promoting hydrogen or fuel cell-run vehicles apart from electric ones. China, on the other hand, has taken the lead in terms of battery-run electric vehicles. India has to decide which way to move. The auto industry is ready to embrace the disruption and move towards zero-emission vehicles,"" said Chattopadhyay."

375,2018-01-26,Maruti,"But in a move that can boost future earnings, Maruti Suzuki's board on Thursday approved a new method of calculating royalty payments to Suzuki Motor

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said quarterly profit rose 3% from a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimates, as the tax outgo of the country’s largest car maker rose and income from activities such as financial investments slumped.  
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said quarterly profit rose 3% from a year earlier, missing analysts’ estimates, as the tax outgo of the country’s largest car maker rose and income from activities such as financial investments slumped. 
Net profit rose to Rs1,799 crore for the quarter ended 31 December from Rs1,747.2 crore in the year earlier, the company said on Thursday. That fell short of the Rs2,006.5 crore profit estimate in a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.
Net sales for the quarter increased by 13.9% to Rs18,940 crore. Operating profit or Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) rose 22.1% to Rs3,037.8 crore as result of the cost savings implemented by the company. Operating margin expanded by 104 basis points to 16% from 14.96% in the year ago period. 
The New Delhi-based car maker sold 11.3% more vehicles during the quarter.
In a step that will boost earnings, Maruti Suzuki’s board on Thursday approved a new method of calculating royalty. The company pays royalty to its parent Suzuki Motor Corp. The new formula has to be now approved by the board of its Japanese parent. 
Maruti Suzuki has devised the new formula based on the improvement in the company’s research and development capability and reduced reliance on the parent company for technology.
The new method will be applicable on all new models launched by Maruti Suzuki since January 2017, starting with the urban compact hatchback Ignis. Maruti Suzuki pays royalty for some of its products in Indian rupees, which protects the company’s earnings from adverse currency fluctuations. 
Maruti’s royalty payments stood at 5.6% of its net sales in the quarter ended 31 December.
“With the new calculation we are looking forward to the reduction in royalty payments. It will result in reduction in royalty payments for all future models and anything regarding R&D on the new models is to be adjusted suitably. It was in discussion for a long time and the board gave its approval for the same today,"" said Ajay Seth, chief financial officer, in a post-earnings conference call with investors. 
Other income in the December quarter decreased by 58.9% to Rs244.9 crore. Total tax expense of the company increased by 13.9% to Rs768.4 crore as the investment allowance that the company got in the year-ago period was not applicable in the quarter ended 31 December and R&D benefits—tax exemptions given for developing vehicles in India—were reduced to 150% from 200% by the government. Raw material costs continued to be high as input prices rose. 
According to Seth, the increase in commodity prices offset the cost reduction measures undertaken by the company. 
“In terms of the commodity price increase there will be pain in the future. The realization per units has been increasing but it has stabled right now and going forward it is not going to increase substantially,"" explained Seth. 
Maruti is poised to continue outpacing the passenger vehicle industry growth with a strong product pipeline and by expanding capacity at its Gujarat plant, said Bharat Gianani, an analyst with brokerage Sharekhan.
“With the company approving revision in royalty calculation on new models (likely to result in lower royalty expenses) and lower discounting on back of new model launches, we expect strong double digit earnings growth going ahead,"" said Gianani."
374,2018-01-26,Maruti,"Right now, concerns on the Street are not to do with Maruti Suzuki's ability to sell cars, but capacity constraints in the near term that may subdue sales growth

True, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd missed the Street’s December quarter estimates on net profit that came in 10% lower than Bloomberg’s average estimate. But this is unlikely to impact valuations because the drop in net profit was due to the adverse mark-to-market impact on investments held and a higher-than-expected tax outflow.

But this is unlikely to impact valuations because the drop in net profit was due to the adverse mark-to-market impact on investments held and a higher-than-expected tax outflow.
Set this aside and the company’s operating performance was bang in line with estimates, leaving little to be desired by the investor. The 22% year-on-year growth in operating profit at Rs3,037.8 crore is commendable, considering its large base and the highly competitive domestic market scenario for passenger vehicles.
Maruti Suzuki sold 11% more vehicles when compared to the previous-year period and its realization too rose by 3%.
The car maker that today rolls out one out of every two passenger cars sold in the country grew its market share from 38% to 50% in the last five years mainly through new launches that filled gaps in the passenger vehicle segment. Cashing in on steadily rising demand, Maruti Suzuki’s average discount per vehicle too has steadily fallen as the share of new launches in its kitty increased. 
Analysts say that the share of new launches has risen from 32% in fiscal year 2017 (FY17) to 40% at the beginning of calendar year 2018. Besides, the rate of success of new launches too has been relatively higher than that of the competition, which perhaps supports higher realization.
Hence, even on a higher base, the company clocked an 11% growth in sales and 3% higher realization when compared to a year back. 
However, operating profitability got a leg-up from lower promotion expenses and forex benefits that helped to partially offset rising commodity prices. Operating margin jumped by 100 basis points to 16%. A basis point is 0.01%.
The company’s ability to sustain profit margins that trickle down into higher earnings is important to sustain its premium valuations in the auto universe. After the strong rally on the back of good results in the September quarter, the Maruti Suzuki stock returned 60% in 52 weeks, double that of the Sensex. However, after touching the Rs10,000-mark a few weeks ago, the stock has been steadily sliding down. Even at Rs9,277, it trades at a rich 25 times the estimated earnings per share for FY19.
Right now, concerns on the Street are not to do with Maruti Suzuki’s ability to sell its vehicles, but the capacity constraints in the near term that may subdue sales growth. So far, the company’s strategy to improve its product mix has helped offset capacity constraints and retain its profit margins. That said, according to a report by Kotak Securities Ltd, the car maker’s operating margin is hovering around historical highs (since FY05). Its return on equity and return on capital employed are the highest in a decade.
Will these improve further from the current levels? The carrot that dangles before analysts now is the reduction in royalty paid to its Japanese parent on new models launched in the future. This could be the next trigger for margin expansion, even as the gradual capacity expansion brings in the benefits of operating leverage. 
Although it’s hard to fix a time horizon when these factors would result in margin gains, they are certainly key for the next round of rerating in the stock."
373,2018-01-29,Maruti,"Shares of Maruti Suzuki surge over 3.6% after the company said its board approved reducing royalty rates for new models

Mumbai: Shares of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Monday surged over 3.6% after the company said its board approved reducing royalty rates for new models. 
Mumbai: Shares of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Monday surged over 3.6% after the company said its board approved reducing royalty rates for new models.
The stock touched a high of Rs9,609.95 on the BSE and gained as much as 3.59% in intraday trade. At 9.56am, it was trading at Rs9,588.35 on the BSE, up 3.35% from its previous close, while India’s benchmark Sensex rose 0.81% to 36,343.36 points.
“This is long term positive for the stock. While the quantum of reduction has not been disclosed, we estimate more than 25% of sales in FY19 should have a lower royalty (without factoring any new model post the new Swift). Overall, we remain positive on Maruti’s market share and earnings growth potential and see strong quarterly performance and successful negotiation for a lower royalty charge with Suzuki as key near-term stock price catalysts,"" said HSBC Global Research in a note to its investors.
The new method will be applicable on all new models launched by Maruti Suzuki since January 2017, starting with the urban compact hatchback Ignis. Maruti Suzuki pays royalty for some of its products in Indian rupees, which protects the company’s earnings from adverse currency fluctuations, Mint reported.
“Currently, the company pays around 5% of revenues to Suzuki as royalty, and assuming that is reduced to 3% on new models, that translates to a 50 bps (basis points) tailwind for margins in FY19e. Not just the amount, but many other nuances are still unclear. There is an existing arrangement to reduce royalties in line with the ratio of work Maruti contributes to the R&D of the vehicle; for instance on Brezza, it was already much lower,"" the report added.
HSBC Global has maintained its buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs10,400 a share on the back of its better long-term earnings outlook.
Brokerage firm UBS estimates a 100-200 bps royalty reduction on new models can add 40-80 bps to the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin over fiscal year 2018-20. The brokerage house has upgraded the stock to “buy"" from “neutral"" and increased its target price to Rs11,000 from Rs9,100 earlier.
The company on Thursday reported a 3% rise in its net profit to Rs1,799 crore for the December quarter against Rs1,747.20 crore a year ago. Net sales for the quarter increased by 13.9% to Rs18,940 crore. Operating profit or Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) rose 22.1% to Rs3,037.8 crore as a result of the cost savings implemented by the company. Operating margin expanded by 104 bps to 16% from 14.96% in the year-ago period.
Of the 50 brokers tracking the Maruti stock on Bloomberg, 41 have a “buy"" rating, nine have a “hold"" rating and two asked investors to sell the stock."
372,2018-01-31,Maruti,"Hyundai plans to launch its first electric car in India by 2019, a year before Maruti Suzuki, but hasn't yet decided whether it'll be an Ioniq or a new vehicle on an SUV platform, says CEO Y.K. Koo

New Delhi: Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd, India’s second largest car maker, plans to launch its first electric car in India by 2019, a year earlier than arch rival Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to enter the segment. 
New Delhi: Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd, India’s second largest car maker, plans to launch its first electric car in India by 2019, a year earlier than arch rival Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to enter the segment.
The company has not decided whether it would bring its electric car brand Ioniq or introduce a new vehicle on a sport utility vehicle (SUV) platform, Y.K. Koo, managing director and chief executive of the Indian unit of the South Korean car maker, said in an interview to Mint.
If things go according to plan, Hyundai will be the first foreign passenger vehicle maker to launch its electric vehicle in India.
“The product will be brought to India in a complete knocked down version (CKD) because we are not much assured of the success of EV products in the Indian market but to showcase that we have the technology. We are bringing this EV product as CKD to test the market,"" said Koo.
India is the fourth largest market for Hyundai Motor Co. after the US, China and South Korea. In 2017, the Indian subsidiary contributed 15% of the total sales of the parent company globally against 13.6% in 2016. 
According to business portal Business Korea, Hyundai and its subsidiary Kia sold 12,992 electric vehicles in 2016. The total number of electric cars sold in 2017 is not yet available.
Koo insisted there is a need for a clear road map for electric vehicles. “We need a clear picture from the government but we cannot wait. Still, we are waiting for a detailed road map to be proposed and developed by the Niti Aayog,"" Koo said.
Globally, Hyundai sells fully battery-powered electric vehicles, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles under the Ioniq brand. The South Korean car maker is also expected to showcase two of its electric cars during the forthcoming Auto Expo scheduled to be held in Greater Noida in February.
Hyundai, unlike Maruti Suzuki, is not planning to establish its own charging stations as it would be expensive and the onus to do that is on the local government, Koo said.
“If we have to establish charging stations then it will be very expensive. OEMs should develop the products, bring technology and price it aggressively but the road map for charging infrastructure should be built by the government and then we will follow. The government should develop infrastructure and should guide us about some GST (goods and services tax) benefit and other things,"" said Koo.
The company has requested the government to reduce the existing GST rate on electric and hybrid vehicles and give some subsidy on lithium-ion batteries.
“It is a fairly good move by Hyundai to be the first foreign manufacturer to launch electric vehicles in India. The government is in the policy making stage and there is nothing concrete on the ground. If Hyundai indeed becomes the first one to launch electric vehicles then it can leverage its first-mover advantage and it will also boost their credentials in front of the policy makers,"" said Anil Sharma, principal analyst, at IHS Markit, a forecasting firm."

New Delhi: Vehicle sales rose in January from a year earlier, boosted by a low base in the year-ago period because of the impact of the government’s decision to withdraw high-value banknotes in November 2016.
A recovery in demand in rural and semi urban markets also aided vehicle sales.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest vehicle maker, reported a 5% increase in dispatches to 140,600 units on the back of high base last year because of demand for its Baleno (premium hatchback) and Vitara Brezza (a compact SUV) models. The company’s dispatches of cars to dealers were, however, affected by a shutdown in some of the company’s plants for yearly maintenance.
Sales of Alto and Wagon R fell 12.2%, while those of its compact cars—Baleno, Dzire Swift and Celerio—increased by 21.6%. The increase in taxes on hybrid vehicles and the introduction of the new Verna (a midsize sedan) by Hyundai Motor India Ltd led to a 22.5% decline in Ciaz (a mid size sedan) sales.
Utility vehicle sales surged 26.8% in January, led by demand for Vitara Brezza.
The country’s second largest carmaker Hyundai Motor India registered a 8.35% increase in sales to 45,508 units. Mumbai-based Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported a 17% growth to 23,686 units.
On the back of demand for its hatchback Tiago and compact SUV Nexon, passenger vehicle sales of Tata Motors Ltd increased by 55% to 20,055 units. On the other hand, Japanese carmaker Honda saw its sales volume decline by 4.8% to 148,383 units.
Improving macro-economic environment, easy availability of finance options by financial institutions and lower base in the corresponding period have resulted in continued growth in sales of heavy vehicles.
Tata Motors reported a 13% increase in volume to 12,804 units. Chennai-based Ashok Leyland also saw wholesale volume increase by 13% to 13,643 units during the period.
In two wheelers, Honda Motorcycles and Scooter India Pvt Ltd (HMSI) reported a 33% increase in sales to 517,732 on the back of a huge 40% rise in scooter sales.
TVS Motors saw domestic sales increase by 31.9% in January on the back of 22% growth in scooters and 63.7% increase in motorcycles sales as a result of recovery in executive and economy segment motorcycle sales and healthy response from its new product Apache RR 310 in the premium segment.
“Maruti sales were a little bit subdued due to the plant closure while its encouraging to see other vehicle makers report healthy growth despite the price increases. This shows the strength in the Indian market. The sales numbers are in line with our expectations,"" said Anil Sharma, principal analyst, IHS Markit."

New Delhi: With new technologies reshaping the future of automobile industry, Maruti Suzuki India is keeping options open to partner with tech firms locally and play a part in parent Suzuki’s future product development, according to its Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa.  
New Delhi: With new technologies reshaping the future of automobile industry, Maruti Suzuki India is keeping options open to partner with tech firms locally and play a part in parent Suzuki’s future product development, according to its Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa. 
While the maximum focus of the company, which is slated to launch an electric vehicle (EVs) in 2020 in India, will be EVs in future, efforts will also be accelerated to develop more hybrids and other alternate fuel vehicles. “I think there are such kind of opportunities in the future,"" Ayukawa told PTI in an interview. 
He was responding to a query on whether Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) would consider partnering local new age technology firms for future product development, which could also flow to parent Suzuki Motor Corporation. Ayukawa said MSI has been depending on parent Suzuki for technology but it has been able to grow its own R&D prowess and has started playing bigger role in product development. 
An example of it is the development of popular compact SUV Vitara Brezza, the development for which was led by Indian engineers. Going forward, he said, “through us, those kind of technology development will happen further"" and MSI will collaborate group-wise with Suzuki to develop new technology. Elaborating the importance of such initiatives, Ayukawa said, “We have a market here (in India) and in order to be match market (expectations) we have to develop those kind of technologies."" 
While the key technology is there, he said “implementing marketwise technology is little bit different"" and MSI will be responsible for that part. Emergence of new technologies such as autonomous driving and ride hailing apps along with call for electric vehicles and eco-friendly technologies are proving to be disruptive factors for the automobile industry. Increasingly, global automotive firms are going for partnerships. 
Waiting for EV policy—Ayukawa said although the company is firm on its target of launching an electric vehicle in India by 2020, MSI is waiting for a clear policy road map from the government to accelerate its preparation for the new technology. “Although the government is providing some sort of support in the form of lower GST, is it enough or not? Those kind of discussions are still going on,"" he said. 
Highlighting the issue of battery charging stations, he said, “At this moment nobody will buy an electric vehicle without battery charging stations. How they are going to implement?"" He said the company will also have to assess the feasibility of rolling out EVs in a big way in the absence of charging infrastructure. “It is very difficult to have such standalone (charging) facilities in rural areas. Maybe we will start with in some big cities. At this moment, there are many unknown factors and is not east to say,"" Ayukawa said. 
MSI’s approach will be to address the ecosystem in EVs, starting from lithium ion battery manufacturing, EV manufacturing, charging infrastructure to recycling of the batteries. “We have to take care of total customer requirement,"" Ayukawa said, adding at the moment it was too early to talk about what kind of investments would be required for such an overall approach. When asked if MSI would consider a separate sales network for EVs, he said, “I don’t deny that kind of idea but at this moment it is too early to say. We have to study (the market).""
Push for hybrids and alternate fuel technology—While the focus is on EVs, Ayukawa also said MSI would continue to push for hybrids and other alternate fuels such as ethanol or bio-diesel. “Otherwise we cannot improve the current condition. We have the responsibility to improve fuel efficiency and develop eco-friendly product,"" he said. 
Ayukawa further said, “In future, I don’t know when, but almost in all vehicles we will be improving as much possible with those kind of technologies. Otherwise we can’t improve total vehicle fuel efficiency."" One of the alternatives is hybrid, he said, adding “Of course we will try to improve the existing ICEs further more, that is one more option""."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest car maker by volumes, unveiled its new concept known as Concept Future S which will translate into a new compact hatchback car. 
The design for the new concept has been developed entirely in the research and development facility in India. The Concept Future S will be the second car after Vitara Brezza (a compact sports utility vehicle or SUV) to be designed entirely in India. 
Maruti Suzuki first showcased its concept future in 2004 which translated to Swift (a hatchback). 
“Compact is the natural choice of India’s car customers. Compact needs a fresh design language, one that is bold, confident and dynamic. Our designers have created this brand new design, aggressive on the outside, and bold and inviting interiors. Nothing like this has ever been attempted before on a vehicle this size. Concept Future S will define the next generation of design for compact vehicles in India,"" said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. 
“With its unique aggressive stance and posture and bold and exciting interiors, Concept Future S is set to redefine compact vehicle design in India. Designed in-house by Maruti Suzuki, Concept Future S epitomizes the next level of design evolution in terms of proportions, body sculpting and stimulating fusion of bold patterns and superior accent colours,"" the company said in a press release.
Maruti Suzuki will start working on the Concept Future S based on the response the company elicits from potential customers at the Auto Expo. 
The Delhi-based car maker has incorporated certain attributes of a compact SUV in the new concept as the company thinks growth in sales in the passenger vehicle segment will be driven by the utility vehicle segment.
e-Survivor
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd also showcased its first design concept of electric vehicle e-Survivor at the Auto Expo.
Maruti Suzuki’s parent Suzuki Motor Corporation plans to launch the first electric vehicle in India by 2020. It is currently developing electric vehicle technology with Toyota Motor Corporation. 
Suzuki will also set up a lithium ion battery plant in Gujarat in a joint venture with Toshiba and Denso. 
According to Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and CEO of Maruti Suzuki, the company is actively studying the factors that will improve acceptance of electric vehicles, and what consumers across India desire from EVs.
“Concept e-Survivor symbolizes our commitment to clean technologies of the future. Maruti Suzuki will launch its first Electric Vehicle in India in 2020. At the same time, we recognize that there is a larger vision behind electrification of powertrains,"" Ayukawa said. 
Maruti Suzuki also showcased a working model of the next generation hybrid technology of Suzuki as the company will work on a wide range of electrified products in the future."

New Delhi: Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Thursday launched the third-generation variant of its best-selling Swift hatchback at the Delhi Auto Expo. 
New Delhi: Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Thursday launched the third-generation variant of its best-selling Swift hatchback at the Delhi Auto Expo.
Launched in India in 2005, the Swift has been one of the top-selling models in the country, clocking a cumulative 1.8 million units in sales, but has been sidelined in the past two to three years by Maruti’s own Baleno and Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s i10 Grand and i20 Elite. 
“The third generation of the Swift will drive us in the coming years,"" said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and chief executive at Maruti Suzuki, at the launch.
The model is equipped with Maruti’s auto gear shift technology, which would enhance fuel efficiency and convenience, according to Ayukawa. 
With over 50% of Swift buyers purchasing their first car, the Swift is aimed at the young urban car buyer. 
“With its sporty stance, bold attitude and exciting performance, we are confident the Swift will be much appreciated,"" Ayukawa said.
With a base price of Rs4,99,000 (ex-showroom, New Delhi), the Swift is one of the most competitively priced hatchbacks in the country. 
The refreshed Swift is built on a modified version of the fifth-generation Heartect platform shared by the Baleno and Swift Dzire. While the engine options are unchanged from the earlier variant, the platform makes the car lighter, stronger and more peppy to drive, said R.S. Kalsi, senior executive director, marketing and sales. 
The car also complies with the comprehensive safety norms set to kick in this year and is available in petrol and diesel variants with the company’s auto gear shift technology.
The model is the first to be launched under Maruti’s Arena network, described as “more inclusive and digital"" by Kalsi.
Kalsi is confident of meeting demand with the Hansalpur plant in Gujarat set to produce 150,000 units this year and 250,000 units by the next, he told Mint during an interaction in January."

If the shift from the first-generation to the second-generation Maruti Suzuki Swift was a small evolution, the third generation is an evolutionary leap. Anyone familiar with the old Swifts can, however, still identify this one at a glance, despite so much of it being different. 
If the shift from the first-generation to the second-generation Maruti Suzuki Swift was a small evolution, the third generation is an evolutionary leap. Anyone familiar with the old Swifts can, however, still identify this one at a glance, despite so much of it being different.
The headlamps are still swept back, with a more pod-like design with a distinct LED running lamp and projector lamps on the top variant. Similarly, the tail-lamps flow back, but this time they’re more three-dimensional. The other Swift signature is the floating roof, which is now enhanced by a black bifurcation in the thick C-pillar at the back; the rear-door handle is now housed here.
The interiors are all-black, rather than beige-and-black. There are a few more cool new bits, like the circular central AC vents and the big rotary controls for climate control, which operate with a solid, well-damped feel. There is a new instrument cluster with twin-hooded binnacles for the speedo and tacho and red-ringed highlights. Sadly, the Dzire’s rather basic-looking central multi-info display returns; we were hoping for the Baleno’s high-resolution screen.
The equipment, predictably, more or less mirrors the additions we saw on the new Dzire. In the top Z+ variant, we have a 7-inch SmartPlay touch screen, with Apple CarPlay, Android Auto and an integrated navigation system. There’s auto climate control, auto head-lamps, a rear-view camera, voice commands, keyless entry and go, LED projector head-lamps and daytime running lamps. It’s a little disappointing that the automatic versions aren’t available in the Z+ variant, as the Z variant they are available in misses out on some desirable equipment, like the touch screen, rear-view camera and LED lamps (just plain-looking halogens here). Still, it gets more than just the basics. What is nice, however, is the focus on safety; all Swifts get dual airbags, ABS, seat-belt pretensioners and ISOFIX child-seat mounts as standard.
When it comes to space and comfort, the front half of the cabin, again, is identical to the Dzire’s. The seats are large and well contoured, but you realize soon enough into your drive that they’re cushioned a bit too much, which could be uncomfortable for some over long distances. The driver’s seat is height-adjustable though, and the sporty, flat-bottomed steering wheel is tilt-adjustable too."

Volume growth marginally missed expectations as the favourable base effect of demonetisation has waned, an analyst said. However, sustained demand from non-metro areas is expected to help car makers in the coming months, he added.
“Rural recovery is playing out well and helping offset saturated demand from the metros. First-time buyers are also significantly adding to volumes,"" said Shamsher Dewan, vice-president (corporate sector ratings) at Icra Ltd.
Icra has forecast an 8-9% growth in passenger vehicles for the fiscal year, he added. 
Market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 13.3% year-on-year rise in domestic sales to 136,648 units, led by sustained demand for premium hatchback Baleno.
Sales growth for the month was led by the compact segment—including the Baleno and other hatchbacks such as Swift and Ignis—rising 38.7% to 65,213 units from a year ago.
The utility vehicle (UV) segment, led by compact SUVs Vitara Brezza and S-Cross, rose 13.8% to 20,324 units.

Sales at Mahindra came in at 22,389 units, an 8.1% rise from a year ago. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive business at the Mumbai-based automaker, expects the “sustained momentum and demand"" to continue in March as well.
Tata Motors posted a 45% jump in sales, clocking 17,771 units, owing to a favourable base effect and consumer acceptance of new models, including the Nexon and Hexa in the UV segment, according to Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles unit at Tata Group flagship.
“We are expanding our customer base across segments and we look forward to sustaining this growth rate and maintain cautious optimism,"" he added.
Sales at Toyota Kirloskar advanced by a marginal 2.78% to 11,864 units. N. Raja, deputy managing director at TKM, a joint venture between Toyota Motor Corp. of Japan and the Kirloskar group, said the company hopes to boost its sales momentum with the launch of the Yaris sedan in May 2018.

New Delhi: Country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSI) on Monday said its highest selling model Alto has crossed the 35 lakh cumulative sales milestone. 
Brand Alto has clocked a growth rate of 6% in 2017-18, MSI said in a statement, adding that it has garnered a market share of 33% in the ongoing fiscal. 
The Alto has been the highest selling car in the domestic market for the past fourteen years, it said. “In 2017-18, nearly 55% of customers have selected Alto as their first car purchase. Interestingly, 25% of Alto buyers are buying it as an additional car,"" MSI senior executive director (marketing & sales) R.S. Kalsi said. 
Nearly 44% of Alto sales contribution comes from young customers less than 35 years of age. This contribution has grown 4% in the past three years, the company said. Kalsi said since 2006, Alto is adding 5 lakh new customers every two years. 
In 2008, it clocked 10 lakh unit sales and in 2010, it touched 15 lakh units, he added."
361,2018-03-13,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki had previously used a six-speed gearbox in the S-Cross but with limited success

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is reportedly planning to relaunch a six-speed gearbox car this year as it seeks to shore up the use of such vehicles in the near future, a media report said on Tuesday. 
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is reportedly planning to relaunch a six-speed gearbox car this year as it seeks to shore up the use of such vehicles in the near future, a media report said on Tuesday.
The new variant, codenamed MF30, would substantially boost the overall driving performance of the car, moneycontrol.com reported.
The MF30 would be the Indian automaker’s another attempt to win over customers with a six-speed car in the country, since the current models in its stable are entirely built on five-speed gearboxes.
Earlier, it had used six-speed gearboxes in its previous S-Cross cars but with limited success. Now the new variant would most likely be introduced in the new Swift hatchback, which the company launched last month with a five-speed gearbox, the report said.
“Maruti is looking to shore up the use of six-speed transmissions in a gradual way. Starting with 50,000 units in the first year the demand is projected to go to 400,000 units per year by 2020,"" the report said citing an industry source. The car’s six-speed transmission is expected to enhance its fuel efficiency while at the same time run at a higher speed but at a lower RPM.
Maruti Suzuki is not the only one to offer six-speed transmission, its rivals like Hyundai is already employing it in cars like Elite i20, Verna, Elantra and Creta.
Companies such as Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra, Renault and jeep also also offer six-speed transmission cars such as the Nexon, Duster, Jeep Compass and Mahindra XUV 500."

New Delhi: C.S. Santosh’s run during the opening day of the Maruti Suzuki Desert Storm 2018 in Bikaner on Tuesday showed what difference experience and good form can make. Riding for the Hero MotoSports Team, the 35-year-old Bengalurean set the pace on Day 1 and completed the 86.5km special in 1 hour and 10 minutes and finished the day in pole position.
Santosh made good of the new Hero 450 RR bike to fight off competition from the international and domestic riders.
“Today was the first day of the Desert Storm with two short stages, the second one being a night stage. It was really fast from the word go and I tried to give it my best,"" said the former champion at the rally and the first Indian to participate in the Dakar Rally. “Overall I had a pretty good first day today with everything working well for me. Looking forward to some good racing in the next few days.
The second leg will task the riders with 496km run stage comprising 136km of special stages, all in desert riding conditions, from Bikaner to Jaisalmer. And although the rally is often unpredictable, looking at the performance on Day 1, Santosh seems to be a favourite to win.
In 2015, Santosh became the first Indian to participate in the Dakar Rally, arguably the most dangerous in the world, and even managed to complete it in his first attempt. This year he finished 35th overall."
359,2018-03-23,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki has captured a 28.6% share of the utility vehicles market even as Mahindra's share fell to 25% from an invincible 56% in 2011-12

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017. 
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s full throttle drive to capture the No. 1 position in utility vehicles (UVs) bore fruit after seven years as it raced past market leader Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd to capture a 28.6% share. As for Mahindra, its share of the UV market toppled from what was almost an invincible 56% in fiscal year 2012 (FY12) to 25% in the nine months ended December 2017.
Of course, it is certain that Mahindra has not given up the battle. In a recent Investor Day presentation at Mahindra Research Valley, the senior management focused on the auto business. The host of launches lined up in the UV segment in the coming months indicates that the company hopes to stage a comeback and regain its lost market share. But this is easier said than done.
Note that when Maruti Suzuki was steadily conquering the UV market by tweaking its range and launching relatively cheaper compact UVs, such as the Vitara Brezza and Ignis, Mahindra was caught napping. Lack of products in the compact segment was its biggest failure. And now, the road ahead is arduous and rife with competition. South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Co. is a strong competitor with deep pockets. It has garnered nearly a fifth of the UV market in just two years. There is also Toyota Motor Corp. that is keen on expanding its presence in the Indian market from the present 12%.
Therefore, Mahindra’s struggle would be far greater than what it was seven years ago, when it was the market supremo. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “If Mahindra is targeting a market share of 30% in UVs, it appears achievable."" That said, it is highly unlikely that the company will regain its stronghold with a 50%-plus market share in UVs.
Add to this, the costs of advertising and marketing to keep abreast of competition especially from Maruti Suzuki—whose reach is relatively greater—might dent profitability unless the new launches rake in strong sales volume. As such, the share of its auto division in the overall Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) has declined from two-thirds to one-third, ever since it lost ground in UVs. Profit margins have ebbed too.
Thankfully, Mahindra’s farm equipment division’s stellar growth rate over the last two years on the back of a favourable monsoon and a growing rural economy, has partially offset the pain in the auto division.
From an investor standpoint therefore, FY19 would be the make or break year for the auto segment. With Maruti Suzuki being a strong force to contend with and in the lead position, it is a tough road ahead for Mahindra. 
This explains why Mahindra’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio has been sticky at around 17, in spite of two strong growth years for the farm equipment division."
358,2018-03-30,Maruti,"While Suzuki will supply its Baleno and Vitara Brezza to Toyota, it will source Toyota's Corolla and sell it through Maruti Suzuki dealerships

New Delhi: Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. on Thursday agreed to sell each other’s cars in India, where Suzuki outsells Toyota models 11-to-1, deepening the partnership between the two companies. 
New Delhi: Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. on Thursday agreed to sell each other’s cars in India, where Suzuki outsells Toyota models 11-to-1, deepening the partnership between the two companies.
While Suzuki will supply its best-selling models such as compact car Baleno and small sports utility vehicle Vitara Brezza to Toyota, small car specialist Suzuki will source Toyota’s popular sedan Corolla and sell it through the dealership network of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd—its local unit. 
“Details on each model, such as the schedule of the start of supply, number of supplied units, vehicle specifications, and supply pricing, will be considered at a later stage,"" the companies said in a joint statement, adding that the announcement is a part of “a basic agreement toward the mutual supply of hybrid and other vehicles between the two companies for the Indian market"". The two carmakers first made an announcement on 6 February 2017, when they concluded a memorandum toward business partnership. The latest move follows a research and development alliance announced by the two companies a year ago. 
The coming together of Toyota, the world’s largest automobile company, and Suzuki, which dominates the Indian market, underlines the importance of the local passenger vehicle market that is expected to triple to 9.4 million units by 2026 from 3.2 million now if the economy grows at an average rate of 5.8% a year, according to the government’s Auto Mission Plan 2016-26. 
While the companies refrained from calling it “cross-badging"" of their products, Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said that Vitara Brezza and Baleno would be tweaked outwardly so that they do not look identical when Toyota sells them and a similar strategy would be adopted by Toyota for its Corolla sedan. 
“In terms of functionality, though, the vehicles would not change at all,"" Bhargava said.
To be sure, cross-badging as a concept has not been successful in India when it was first tried by the Renault-Nissan alliance and later by Volkswagen and Skoda. Models such as Nissan Sunny and its twin Renault Scala, Nissan Micra and Renault Pulse and Volkswagen Vento and its twin Skoda Rapid failed to live up to customers’ expectations.
Deepesh Rathore, the London-based co-founder of Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors, said that Toyota would do well to improve interiors and some features such as navigation systems before selling Baleno and Brezza under its stable."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger car maker, said March domestic passenger car sales rose 13.3% from a year earlier to 147,170 units, led by growth across segments.
The utility vehicle (UV) segment, not included under passenger cars, grew 24.3% to 22,764 units in March, driven by sales of Maruti’s Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models.
It is typically observed in March that auto firms dispatch more to their dealerships in a bid to liquidate unsold stock before closing accounts for the fiscal year. 
Auto makers in India report dispatches to dealerships as sales.
The compact car segment comprising Baleno, Swift and Ignis hatchbacks clocked sales of 68,885 units, rising 13.5% from a year-ago. 
Sales in the mini car segment, comprising old workhorses Alto and WagonR, rose 21.1% to 37,511 units.

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker by volume, reported a 10% year-on-year jump in net profit to Rs1,882.1 crore for the quarter ending 31 March, on the back of increased demand from rural and semi-urban markets, improved product mix and realizations due to reduction in discounts.  
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker by volume, reported a 10% year-on-year jump in net profit to Rs1,882.1 crore for the quarter ending 31 March, on the back of increased demand from rural and semi-urban markets, improved product mix and realizations due to reduction in discounts. 
However, net profit fell short of Bloomberg estimates of Rs2,085.50 crore due to a substantial increase in commodity prices, advertisement and Auto Expo-related expenses and overall taxes paid during the quarter. 
The Delhi-based firm reported an 11.4% increase in the number of vehicles sold during the quarter from last year, courtesy the increase in demand for its offerings such as the Baleno (premium hatchback), the Vitara Brezza (compact sports utility vehicle), the new Dzire (compact sedan) and the new Swift (hatchback). Its entry-level vehicles also reported a growth of 5.6% on a huge base, indicating a turnaround in the rural economy. 
Consequently, in the quarter, the company reported a 14.4% year-on-year increase in net sales to Rs20,594.3 crore. Operating profit (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 24.4% to Rs2,312.5 crore due to higher sales volumes and cost-reduction efforts. 
Due to the introduction of new models, discounts offered by the company also reduced to Rs1,39,000 per unit, compared with Rs1,51,000 a year ago. As a result, the average realization per unit also increased to Rs4.06 lakh compared with Rs3.93 lakh a year ago. 
Royalty payments are also expected to decrease in the next few years as the board of parent company Suzuki Motor Corp. has approved a new royalty structure whereby Maruti Suzuki will be given exemptions for research and development work done in India, and payments will be capped at 5% of the company’s net sales. This insulates the company from any future fluctuations in the exchange rate. 
“Maruti Suzuki reported in-line results for Q4FY2018. Strong volume growth coupled with higher realizations due to a better product mix boosted the top line. Regardless of higher employee costs and other expenses, MSIL managed to improve margins on a year-on-year basis due to price hikes and operating leverage,"" said Bharat Gianani, research analyst at Sharekhan. 
“We expect that by 2021, all the existing cars in our portfolio will be covered by the new royalty formula. As of now, Ignis, the new Dzire and Swift are the vehicles to be covered by the new formula. I hope in the coming years the royalty payments by the company will be reduced, though we can’t say by how much they will come down,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki. 
For the full year, the company reported a 16.7% year-on-year increase in net sales to Rs78,104.8 crore while operating profit rose by 20.1% to Rs9,303.6 crore. Net profit for the fiscal year increased by 5.1% to Rs7,721.8 crore."

352,2018-04-28,Maruti,"For Maruti Suzuki, the cost pressures that dragged net profit down during the March quarter are mostly one-offs

To be sure, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s March quarter results took some of the steam out of its stock. It closed 2% lower, as costs weighed on profits. While net revenues were higher on the back of skyrocketing sales that beat industry growth rates, net profit fell significantly short of Bloomberg estimates, with margins too being squeezed. It’s a disappointment for investors.  
To be sure, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s March quarter results took some of the steam out of its stock. It closed 2% lower, as costs weighed on profits. While net revenues were higher on the back of skyrocketing sales that beat industry growth rates, net profit fell significantly short of Bloomberg estimates, with margins too being squeezed. It’s a disappointment for investors. 
That said, here’s why the rich valuation of its stock that trades at 22 times the estimated earnings for FY2020, is unlikely to ebb in the near term: 
The cost pressures that dragged net profit down during the March quarter are mostly one-offs. Adverse foreign exchange movements increased royalty payments to its parent, Suzuki Motor Corp. Being the last quarter of the year, changes in gratuity and variable pay led to higher employee costs, which expanded by 50 basis points as a percentage of sales, when compared to the year-ago period. Meanwhile, new launches and the annual Auto Expo led to higher advertising and marketing costs, while higher power and fuel costs too added to inflated expenses. 
These expenses hurt the operating margin. At 14.2%, it was only a shade better than a year ago, but fell drastically short of Bloomberg’s forecast of 15.5%. 
Add to this the huge jump in interest costs during the quarter, which too was a one-off expense towards dues paid to landowners of the Manesar plant as compensation, according to court orders. This was not all. The quarter also saw a higher tax outgo. That the net profit of Rs1,818 crore therefore missed analysts’ forecasts is not surprising. 
Investors should realize that most of the cost pressures, barring that of rising raw material costs, are one-offs. Besides, there are positives that could back Maruti’s premium valuation on the Street. The management appears confident that the firm would continue to beat industry growth rates. Maruti has posted double-digit growth in sales volumes over the last four years. 
Further, the firm’s strategic shift into higher-end vehicles in the last couple of years will lead to better realizations that could support margins. Its nimble-footed product launches have helped reduce the discounts offered. The average discount per vehicle of Rs13,880 during the March quarter was a huge cutback from earlier quarters, underscoring its brand equity amid stiff competition. Of course, the utility vehicle business that it has recently ventured into is likely to add to marketing costs. 
Topping all this is the news that the company has revised the terms of royalty, where for all new models Maruti would pay its parent royalty in rupee terms and also be reimbursed with some margin for research and development work in India. This implies lower royalty in the quarters ahead and lower risk of foreign exchange fluctuations, which in turn would lower the risk to profit margins. 
In other words, while the March quarter had several misses on profit and profit margins, it is unlikely to shake investor confidence in the stock."
350,2018-04-29,Maruti,"After the sales of a certain model reaches a threshold, to be set by the parent, the royalty to be paid by Maruti will come down, boosting the company's operating margin

New Delhi: The new royalty payment arrangement between Suzuki Motor Corp. and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is expected to be beneficial for both the Japanese parent and its most valuable subsidiary in India, as the local unit is expected to outpace industry growth in India in the next few years. 
New Delhi: The new royalty payment arrangement between Suzuki Motor Corp. and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is expected to be beneficial for both the Japanese parent and its most valuable subsidiary in India, as the local unit is expected to outpace industry growth in India in the next few years.
According to the new pattern announced after the fourth quarter earnings, royalty payment of Maruti Suzuki has been delinked from the fluctuations in the currency market. Also, after the sales of a certain model reaches a threshold—to be set by the parent—the royalty to be paid by Maruti will come down, boosting the company’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), or operating margin. 
Suzuki will also reimburse the money that Maruti spends for research and development work in India, which will also strengthen the books of its subsidiary. 
The Suzuki Motor Corp. board has already cleared the new arrangement. The new royalty pattern was approved by the board of Maruti Suzuki after the third quarter results of FY18.
According to R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, as the Indian market continues to grow, the amount of royalty would also have grown proportionately. “Now, when we reach a particular number of volumes automatically the royalty will be reduced. So, we have an advantage."" 
“It’s an arrangement that will be beneficial for both Maruti and Suzuki. Though Suzuki will get a royalty at a lower rate, the actual amount they receive as royalty will be more as Maruti sells more cars in the Indian market,"" Bhargava said in a phone interview to Mint.
Had it not been for the new pattern, the royalty that Maruti pays would have consistently increased in the future as the size of the Indian automobile market is tipped to grow annually at 9-10% in the next 4-5 years. 
On the other hand, Suzuki, which depends on Maruti for a significant share of its revenue, will get more royalty, though at a lower rate, as the new arrangement states reduction in royalty payments once a certain level of volumes has been achieved.
Also, there is a cap of 5% in royalty payments in rupee terms in the new system, which would help the company expand its margins at a time when overall increase in costs due to new model launches and high commodity prices, especially of oil and steel, have taken a toll on the margins.
The new pattern will cover only the last three offerings of the company—Ignis, the new Dzire, and the Swift. 
Ajay Seth, chief financial officer of Maruti Suzuki, said in a press conference on Friday that by 2021, it is expected that most of the offerings of the company will be covered by the new arrangement.
“Maruti Suzuki will launch the new Ertiga (a multi-utility vehicle) probably next year and the full model change of Ciaz (a mid size sedan) will be launched by 2020. The new Alto (a mini car) will also be launched when the new emission norms will kick in. So by 2021, most of the offerings will be refreshed and will come under the new arrangement,"" said a person aware of the company’s plans for the next few years.
The new norms though, will help the company become operationally more efficient in financial terms. According to an analyst at a foreign brokerage, if the royalty payment comes down to 5% or below the from the current level, there will be a 50-60 basis points operating margin expansion, which will help the company. One basis point is 0.01%.
If the prices of commodities like steel and especially oil continue at the current levels, then the reduction in royalty will be an advantage in the long run. Also, in the Rohtak R&D hub of the company, a lot of development work is taking place on upcoming vehicles, which will be reimbursed by Suzuki.
“There is an incentive on our part to sell more and more and there is an incentive for Suzuki as well. So, it is not unfair on anyone. As the Indian market grows, likelihood of reaching the cut-off point becomes a reality. It is difficult to estimate the reduction for us since all the new models are not covered by the new pattern yet,"" added Bhargava."

The company, which currently has a network of around 2,625 dealerships across the country, is also aiming for a double digit growth in the current fiscal. “We are continuously increasing our sales network. This fiscal we plan to increase the number of outlets by at least 10%,"" MSI Senior Executive Director, Marketing and Sales, R S Kalsi said. 
The company added around 350 sales outlets in 2017-18, he added. The company would add outlets under its various retail channels like Nexa and Arena, besides enhancing the network for its light commercial vehicle Super Carry, Kalsi said. 
The company sold over 10,000 units of its LCV Super Carry from over 100 outlets last year. Kalsi said Super Carry sales would be even better this fiscal with network in place across the country.

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to go full throttle to develop various kinds of alternate technologies, including CNG-powered cars and hybrid vehicles, and not just electric vehicles, a top company official said. 
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to go full throttle to develop various kinds of alternate technologies, including CNG-powered cars and hybrid vehicles, and not just electric vehicles, a top company official said.
The carmaker, which already has a market share of 50% in the domestic passenger vehicle segment, is keen to partner government or oil companies in order to push for CNG-powered vehicles in the country.
“We are going to try and push this acceleration in use of CNG, hybrid and other alternate technologies. We are going to push all technologies, and not limit ourselves to one technology,"" Maruti Suzuki India chairman RC Bhargava said.
He said the company wants to help reduce oil import and air pollution and that its view is similar to that of the government. “We want to have clean cars in the country, we want to reduce oil import and we want to reduce pollution. Our objective is same as that of the government. For doing that we do not want to put all our hopes on battery cost reduction. We want to look at other alternate technologies as well,"" Bhargava said.
Without waiting for the cost of electric vehicles to come down, Maruti Suzuki India wants to go out for alternatives like CNG in the country. “The government has already put the use of CNG for transportation at higher priority than its use for power generation...We would like to use CNG for cars as far as possible. CNG is best suited for small cars,"" Bhargava said.
He said if small cars were to be electrified it would require substantial reduction in battery cost which means technology of some sort has to come for the rescue. He added that Indian market is different from any other market in the world, with 75% of its cars costing less than Rs5 lakh.
“There is no market in the world where there is such dominance of small cars. The implication for electric cars is that, at today’s battery costs, price of the vehicle goes up by Rs6-7 lakh. Now, on Rs5 lakh cars YoY, add another Rs6-7 lakh; do you think anybody would buy? Affordability becomes a huge problem,"" Bhargava said.
He further added, “While certainly we need to push electric cars, but we should not forget CNG, hybrids, ethanol and methanol. Our view is to keep all options open, put all these options in front of customer and then let him/her decide what is best suited for his/her requirements,"" Bhargava said.
All such vehicles, run on alternative fuels and technologies, help in reducing oil imports and air pollution. So it doesn’t matter if it is achieved by electric vehicle or CNG car, he added. Bhargava said the company would even try to work out a joint programme with oil companies for CNG push in the country.
“Oil companies and we can co-ordinate our actions. They expand the sale outlets we expand the production of CNG cars, so both go hand-in-hand in a coordinated manner,"" he added."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Tuesday said it is asking customers of 52,686 new Swift and Baleno models to undertake a service campaign to inspect for a possible fault in brake vacuum hose. 
New Swift and Baleno units manufactured between 1 December, 2017 and 16 March, 2018 will be covered in this campaign, MSI said in communication to customers on its website. 
A total of 44,982 units of new Swift, which was launched in February this year, and 7,704 units of Baleno are covered under the service campaign. 
Brake vacuum hose is a rubber pipe that creates and releases vacuum while applying brake but it has no impact on braking and braking distance. 
When contacted, a company official said the exercise did not amount to a recall as the issue did not relate to safety. 
Service campaigns are undertaken globally by automobile companies to rectify faults that may potentially cause inconvenience to customers, the company said. Customers will be contacted by dealers for inspection and replacement of the faulty part, MSI added. 
“The inspection and replacement will be done free of cost for the customer,"" the company said. 
Automobile manufacturers in India follow a voluntary recall policy adopted by industry body SIAM in July 2012 under which if a company is of the opinion that there is a manufacturing defect that compromises safety of vehicles, it will voluntarily rectify the problem free of cost to the customer."

The AGS variants are in addition to the model’s manual transmission trims which continue to sell in the market. The refreshed Vitara Brezza now comes with enhanced safety features and a number of internal and external changes, the company said. 
“We have enhanced its (Vitara Brezza’s) allure to meet aspirations of our young customers. They now have the option of AGS, the acclaimed two-pedal technology, for enhanced convenience,"" MSI senior executive director (Marketing and Sales), R. S. Kalsi said in a statement. 
AGS has been very well accepted by customers, and sales of AGS variants in the Maruti Suzuki portfolio have tripled in three years, he added. By making this technology available on Vitara Brezza, together with a refreshed design, the company expects the model to become even more attractive, Kalsi said. 
Besides new black alloy wheels and all black interiors, the updated Vitara Brezza now also complies with advanced safety regulations, including pedestrian safety, ahead of regulation timelines, MSI said. 
The refreshed model comes with various safety features like ISOFIX child restraint system, high speed warning alert, dual air bags, ABS with EBD, reverse parking sensors and front seat belt pre-tensioners and force limiters. 
These safety features have now been made standard across all variants of the model, MSI said. The vehicle is already certified for offset and side impact crash tests since its launch, it added. 
MSI sells around 12,300 units of Vitara Brezza on an average per month. During last fiscal, it sold 1,48,462 units of the model. The company so far has sold around 2.75 lakh units of the vehicle since launch."

New Delhi: Most of the $1.5 billion allocated by Suzuki Motor Corp. for its research and development (R&D) activities will be spent on its most profitable unit Maruti Suzuki and help the Indian firm maintain its 50% market share amid increasing competition from European and Korean manufacturers.  
New Delhi: Most of the $1.5 billion allocated by Suzuki Motor Corp. for its research and development (R&D) activities will be spent on its most profitable unit Maruti Suzuki and help the Indian firm maintain its 50% market share amid increasing competition from European and Korean manufacturers. 
The money will be used to upgrade Maruti Suzuki’s existing models to Bharat Stage VI emission norms—most stringent globally—by 2019, to develop an entire range of hybrid vehicles and other alternative technologies, two people aware of the matter said.
Reuters on 10 May reported that Osamu Suzuki, chairman, Suzuki Motor Corp., in a post-earnings conference call said the company needs to find ways to maintain its current market share in India till 2030 when the Indian passenger vehicle market is tipped to touch the 10-million mark annually.
According to one person aware of the matter, Maruti Suzuki has a huge task at hand in upgrading its existing 14 models to comply with the BS-VI emission norms, which will takes effect on 1 April 2020. 
A full range of hybrid vehicles—from the current SHVS or mild hybrid, to full hybrid and plug-in ones—will also be developed by the company in association with Toyota.
“The company will focus on making the full range of hybrids as meeting the CAFE (corporate average fuel efficiency) norms will be impossible without hybrids,"" said this person.
The new spends on R&D will take a toll on Suzuki’s earnings (and of Maruti Suzuki to an extent) for the financial year ending 31 March 2019. 
The operating income of the company would decrease by 9.1% to 340 billion yen as a consequence of higher research and development expenses and appreciation of yen against the dollar. The net income or the net profit of the company would decrease by 5% to 205 billion yen, Suzuki said in a forecast. 
In FY18, Suzuki’s net sales grew by 18% to 3757.2 billion yen, while operating profit jumped by 40% to 374.2 billion yen. Consequently, net income increased by 34.9% to 215.7 billion—the highest since 1977—on the back of surging sales in India and recovery in European markets.
The company would also invest in developing electric vehicles and related infrastructure like charging stations and making other components of electric vehicles. The development of more fuel efficient gasoline engines is also on the cards, said the second person.
In a first, Suzuki has also tweaked its organization structure globally to include a new department to develop electric vehicles.
“Suzuki has the technology, but it is not adequate enough to meet the competition. Hence, investment needs to be there. New technologies have to be developed as the government of India is very serious about it,"" R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki, said.
The Indian government initially planned to promote only electric vehicles and wanted to shift 30% of the total vehicles on the road to electric by 2030.
“Developing these technologies is not a one-day affair and it takes a long time. The company will have to work on these things for a long time now. By 2030, if 20%-30% vehicles shift to electric then the rest 70% will leave a huge opportunity for hybrids to grow as they will pollute less,"" said the second person."

New Delhi: Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp. plans to expand production capacity by as many as 2.5 million cars a year in the decade to 2030 as it lays the groundwork to maintain its dominance in India, where it sells one in two cars. 
New Delhi: Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp. plans to expand production capacity by as many as 2.5 million cars a year in the decade to 2030 as it lays the groundwork to maintain its dominance in India, where it sells one in two cars.
The capacity expansion, the biggest ever planned by Suzuki or its local unit in India, will be divided into two phases, two people aware of the plans said, requesting anonymity. Suzuki will first expand its Gujarat plant by adding capacity to make 750,000 cars starting 2020. In the second phase, it will build a new plant, Suzuki’s fourth after those in Gurgaon, Manesar and Gujarat. The new factory, location of which has not been identified, will have a capacity of approximately 1.5 million units and is expected to be announced around 2025, the people said. 
On completion of the two phases, Suzuki’s total vehicle manufacturing capacity in India will be about 4.5 million or more than double the 1.75 million vehicles it makes now (1.5 million in Gurgaon and Manesar and 250,000 in Gujarat).
The management of Maruti Suzuki told some suppliers about the expansion plan at a recent meeting in Abu Dhabi.
Maruti Suzuki plans to sell 5 million passenger vehicles annually by 2030, Osamu Suzuki, chairman of Maruti’s parent, said at a post-earnings conference call earlier this month.
An email sent to Maruti Suzuki on Tuesday remained unanswered till press time.
By 2025, Maruti Suzuki aims to sell 3 million units—about the current size of the Indian market.
“Suzuki plans to invest in expanding its existing capacity in Gujarat, otherwise it will be difficult to meet the three million-mark by 2025. The company is also planning how to maintain the dominance beyond that period, for which they need another plant,"" said one of the two people cited above.
Production of the new version of the Ciaz—a mid-size sedan—expected to be launched in 2020, will be shifted to the Gujarat plant as well, this person added.
According to the second person, who was also present at the annual vendor conference, the management has told vendors about its plan to hold on to its 50% market share and implicitly, this means that investment in the future capacity is in the offing.
Suzuki intends to invest $1.5 billion in research and development, mostly to ward off competition from Korean and European rivals in India. Mint reported earlier that Suzuki is also looking to invest in developing a range of hybrid vehicles and more efficient gasoline engines for the domestic market in the next decade."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s vendors need to collectively invest Rs1.5-2 trillion in the decade starting 2020, to keep pace with investments the carmaker’s parent company, Suzuki Motor Corp., would make in India.
Suzuki’s investments would be geared towards achieving its target of selling five million cars in the country by 2030.
A group of tier-I vendors, formed last month to deliberate on the topic of “corporate excellence"", made a presentation to the management of Maruti Suzuki regarding the projected cash flow from parts suppliers.
This comes against the backdrop of Maruti Suzuki’s management expressing concern about the ability of the vendors to match the company’s growth trajectory, two people aware of the development said on condition of anonymity. 
During its vendor meet in Abu Dhabi last month, the top management of the company had aired concerns about whether the vendors would be able to expand their respective capacities and make new investments in line with the company’s own investment in the next decade.
The group of vendors said they needed to increase their investments substantially to Rs1.5-2 trillion.
To maintain its dominance, Suzuki Motor Corp. will invest $1.5 million in fiscal 2019 to develop future products for the Indian market, which include an entire range of hybrid vehicles and gasoline engines. 
As reported earlier, Suzuki has also planned massive capacity expansion for its Indian subsidiary. 
According to the first person mentioned above, most of the vendors beyond tier-I do not have the appetite to make huge investments due to reasons such as high cost of capital and weak balance sheets.
“A lot of vendors of Maruti Suzuki are not in a financially sound position, hence they may not be able to make huge investments required to stay on course with Maruti’s ambitions,"" the first person said. “The lack of vendor investment in Gujarat is also an example."" 
Maruti Suzuki has more than 420 vendors in India and according to the two persons mentioned above, only 75-80 of them are present in Gujarat. 
Most of the tier-I suppliers have moved or just started investing in the state, but those in tier-II and beyond are yet to make their investments there.
“Maruti Suzuki and its parent company have a robust plan in place to protect their turf in India and the management thinks the lack of capacity from vendors can be a challenge for the company in future,"" the second person said.
“The management has advised the vendors to keep investing in the core automobile business and not to put it in some other businesses,"" the person mentioned above added.
According to a senior industry executive, the 12-12.5% average earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) of companies in the components industry is a concern. The borrowing cost is around 12% and the Reserve Bank of India is not in the mood to lower the repo rate, if crude stays at the same level to curb inflation.
“The concerns regarding the investment appetite of vendors, barring some, are quite genuine and Maruti in the long run could change its vendors or source more components from the established players or the Japanese ones. Also there will be some consolidation amongst the vendors as well going forward,"" said the senior executive requesting not to be named.
Maruti Suzuki declined to comment."

The compact car segment made up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki sales in May—growing 50.8% to 77,263 units—on the back of demand for the 2018 Swift and continued interest in premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire.
The sports utility vehicles (SUV) segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, also contributed with a 13.4% rise in sales to 25,629 units over May last year.
An automatic variant of the Vitara Brezza was launched last month.
Sales of entry-level small cars Alto and WagonR, and the mid-sized sedan Ciaz, continued to be in the red, declining 3.1% and 14.8%, respectively.
With new cars and refreshes, including the launch of the next-generation Ciaz later this fiscal, Maruti Suzuki is expected to maintain its leadership position this year.

Mumbai: It was smooth sailing for automakers during the month of May as new launches buoyed sales, spurred by robust retail demand on the back of continued economic recovery.
India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Honda Cars India Ltd, collectively sold 243,856 units during the month, up 20.6% from 202,187 units a year ago.
Automakers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. New model launches by five of the seven carmakers reporting sales led to a jump in numbers because they filled inventory channels.
Moreover, a broader economic recovery, led by non-metro geographies, also spurred demand. This uptick in demand was reflected in the 7.7% GDP growth during the three months ended March, up from 7.2% in the December quarter. Growth had been lagging below 7% since demonetization in November 2016.
To be sure, the broader manufacturing industry cooled off in May. The Nikkei manufacturing purchasing managers’ index fell to 51.2 in the month from 51.6 in April, led by weaker domestic demand and output expansion, said Sonal Varma, managing director and chief India economist, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, in a 1 June note.
The index remained above 50, which indicates growth, for the tenth month in a row.
Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) jumped 23% to 144,780 units in May over the year-ago period, as the compact car segment led growth with a 50.8% jump to 77,263 units. The local arm of Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp. is facing robust demand for the next-generation Swift, premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire in this segment.
The utility vehicles segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, also contributed with a 13.4% rise in sales to 25,629 units over May last year. An automatic transmission variant of the Brezza was launched during the month.
However, old workhorses Alto and WagonR and the mid-sized sedan Ciaz continued to be in the red, declining 3.1% and 14.8%, respectively.
With new variants of the three models, in addition to the next-gen Ertiga MUV (multi-utility vehicle), to be launched later this fiscal, Maruti is expected to maintain its leadership position in the short term, analysts said.
The local arm of South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co. reported a 7.14% rise in sales to 45,008 units in May, on the back of next-generation models such as compact SUV Creta and Elite i20 hatchback launched during the month. The Grand i10 hatchback and Verna mid-sized sedan also continued to drive growth, according to Rakesh Srivastava, director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Sales at homegrown automaker Mahindra were almost flat at 20,715 units during “the relatively subdued month"", according to Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive division at the firm.
“With the forecast of an upcoming normal monsoon, we are confident of good growth in the coming months,"" he added.
It was a “challenging"" month for Tata Motors as well, with “retail slowing down"", according to Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicles business at the firm. However, the Tata group flagship posted a 61.11% jump in sales to 17,489 units during the month on the back of continued demand for the new crop of models, namely the Nexon compact SUV and Hexa SUV, followed by the Tiago hatchback and Tigor sedan.
Pareek said the automatic transmission variant of the Nexon, launched during May, has received “an overwhelming response"", adding that Tata “will continue to strive towards driving volumes and increasing market share as part of the ongoing turnaround journey"".
The maker of the City sedan, Honda Cars India, reported a 40.66% rise in sales to 15,864 units, on the back of the next-generation Amaze sedan launched in May, according to Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at the firm.
Going forward, the prediction of a normal monsoon across the country by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) will buttress demand, in addition to the government’s continued focus on developing infrastructure and the rural sector.
However, higher prices of raw materials such as oil and steel may weigh on profit margins and build inflationary pressures, said Varma of Nomura.

Suzuki achieved this feat through its most profitable subsidiary Maruti Suzuki in 35 years and five months, while it took 45 years and nine months to do the same in Japan.
Maruti Suzuki is the biggest subsidiary of Suzuki and contributes more than half of the total volumes at a parent level. 
According to Suzuki, Alto has been the most manufactured vehicle in India and a record 3.17 million vehicles were sold in the domestic market. 
Suzuki started manufacturing cars in India from 1983 as Maruti Udyog when it operated as a joint venture. In April 2013, Suzuki decided to buy majority share in Maruti. 
Having maintained its dominance over the Indian automobile market in FY18, Suzuki is now getting into the electric vehicle space in India in collaboration with Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan. 
It has also ventured into the small commercial vehicle space by launching Carry. 
“Today the production is held at Gurgaon and Manesar plants of Maruti Suzuki and the Gujarat plant of Suzuki Motor Gujarat, Suzuki’s 100% subsidiary to produce automobiles in India. At these three production sites, 16 models are being produced including the Dzire, Baleno, Alto, Swift, Wagon R and Vitara Brezza,"" said Suzuki in a note on its website."

New Delhi: The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has stopped production of diesel version of its premium hatchback Ignis due to low demand.  
New Delhi: The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has stopped production of diesel version of its premium hatchback Ignis due to low demand. 
The company, which launched the model in January last year, has sold more than 72,000 units so far. The automaker registered average monthly sales of over 4,500 units of Ignis during the January-May 2018 period. 
When contacted an MSI spokesperson told PTI: “Maruti Suzuki listens to customers’ demand and accordingly makes efforts to meet their evolving aspirations. Therefore, it is business prudence to keep the number of variants in line with customers’ requirements."" 
Ignis is retailed through company’s premium NEXA channel and helps MSI in expanding its range and presence, with an eye on the future, the spokesperson added. Ignis was the third model to be sold through Nexa dealerships. 
With the launch of the Ignis the company consciously tried to shed its image of a small car maker for a typical middle class Indian family. The model would now be available with 1.2 litre petrol engine mated to both manual and automatic transmissions. The 1.3 litre diesel versions have been discontinued.
The petrol variants of the model are priced between Rs4.66 lakh and Rs7.04 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi)."
335,2018-06-15,Maruti,"In May, Maruti Suzuki's compact SUV sales rose 13.36% to 25,629 units, but these figures are nowhere close to the segment's historical 20%-plus growth

Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki Ltd’s slowing growth in the compact utility vehicle segment flows primarily from capacity constraints in the production of Vitara Brezza that dominates the segment, a person aware of the matter said. 
Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki Ltd’s slowing growth in the compact utility vehicle segment flows primarily from capacity constraints in the production of Vitara Brezza that dominates the segment, a person aware of the matter said.
According to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Maruti Suzuki has been losing steam in the sub-4 metre UV category (commonly called the compact utility vehicle segment) since April, when the automaker posted flat growth in sales. The Vitara Brezza is the largest selling model in this segment.
In May, Maruti Suzuki’s sales in this category rose 13.36% from a year ago to 25,629 units, but these figures are nowhere close to the segment’s historical 20%-plus growth. Apart from Vitara Brezza, Maruti Suzuki also sells the S-Cross, Ertiga and Gypsy models in the segment. In April, Maruti Suzuki’s sales in the segment rose marginally to 20,804 units over 20,638 a year ago. Meanwhile, rivals have edged ahead.
According to the person cited earlier, who spoke on condition of anonymity, introduction of the third-generation Swift hatchback has taken away production capacity at Maruti Suzuki’s Hansalpur plant in Gujarat from the Brezza. Other models in the category, namely the Gypsy, S-Cross and Ertiga, are unlikely to have been affected since they are manufactured at the Gurugram plant, this person added.
Maruti Suzuki did not respond to emailed queries till press time.
In a statement on Wednesday, Maruti Suzuki claimed the third-generation Swift is India’s fastest-selling car, clocking 100,000 units in 145 days.
On the back of several facelifts, including the Swift, and a low base of the previous year owing to the goods and service tax, passenger car sales in May advanced at 19.6%, the fastest monthly growth in at least a year.
The Swift has been one of the most popular cars in India, selling 1.89 million units since launch in 2005. With the latest facelift, the peppy hatchback is clawing its way back to the top, after being sidelined by Maruti Suzuki’s own premium hatchback Baleno and Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s i10 Grand and i20 Elite models.
Analysts believe the Vitara Brezza is now unlikely to beat the market as it is reaching a “stable"" run rate at the end of its model life cycle. According to an analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the model will need much more than an automatic transmission variant launched in early May.
“The Brezza will find it difficult to grow the segment now, since it is well into its second year. As competition heats up in the segment, Maruti Suzuki can maintain its share but will probably not be able to grow it"", said Jigar Shah, chief executive and head of research at brokerage firm Maybank Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
However, the preference for compact SUVs will continue, said both analysts, adding that capacity expansion, of 100,000 units at Hansalpur this fiscal, which also produces the Baleno, will certainly help matters. They do not see a major impact on Maruti Suzuki’s topline or margin growth owing to constrained capacity in the short term."

Mehsana, Gujarat: India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to make 7.5 lakh more cars at its Gujarat plant by by 2020, a top company official said Wednesday, taking the total production capacity on the three assembly lines to 22.5 lakh units a year. It is also initiating a process to study ways in which production can be expanded beyond 22.5 lakh units after 2020.

It is also initiating a process to study ways in which production can be expanded beyond 22.5 lakh units after 2020.
The first assembly line of Suzuki-owned Hansalpur (Gujarat) plant has already started rolling out cars. It has a production capacity of 2.5 lakh units per annum. The second production line with similar 2.5 lakh production capacity, is expected to be operational by 2018-end, Maruti Suzuki MD and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa told reporters in Mehsana. “After that we are planning a third factory; maybe it is coming around 2020,"" he added.
On 14 June, Mint reported that capacity constraints at Maruti Suzuki are weighing on sales of its cars in the compact utility vehicle segment. According to data from Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Maruti Suzuki has been losing steam in the sub-4 metre UV category (commonly called the compact utility vehicle segment) since April, when the automaker posted flat growth in sales. The Vitara Brezza is the largest selling model in this segment.
Ayukawa said the company plans to have around 5,000-6,000 workforce at the three units. He was speaking on the sidelines of the passing out of the first batch of Japan-India Institute for Manufacturing (JIM) at Ganpat Vidyanagar, Mehsana.
Maruti Suzuki already has a production capacity of 15 lakh units per annum across its two plants at Gurgaon and Manesar. Suzuki recently achieved the 20 million vehicle sales-mark in India, faster than it had done so in Japan, Mint reported on 4 June.
“First we will try 20 lakh total sales, including exports. After that we will target 20 lakh unit sales in the domestic market only,"" Ayukawa said, elaborating on the 2020 plan. “I believe 22.5 lakh capacity could be enough, but after 2020 and 2021, how we are going to manage our business expansion that we have to start a study for a long-term plan"".
Suzuki has also planned to launch electric cars in the same time frame, i.e. 2020-21, Mint reported on 6 June. The Japanese carmaker aims to produce as many as 35,000 electric cars annually in India starting 2020-21, when it rolls out the first of these cars in the country, two people familiar with the matter had said.
On Wednesday, more than 250 students graduated from the Japan-India Institute for Manufacturing (JIM) at Ganpat Vidyanagar, Mehsana. The institute is part of Maruti Suzuki’s corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives for skill development. JIM is a result of the collaboration between India and Japan to create a pool of 30,000 skilled manpower for manufacturing in India. Maruti Suzuki has invested more than  ₹  6 crore in setting up and running the JIM.
“Blessed by the prime ministers of India and Japan, JIM at Mehsana is a step to equip youngsters in Gujarat with skills that are directly connected with the growing manufacturing industry,"" Ayukawa said."
332,2018-07-04,Maruti,"Hyundai, which competes with Maruti Suzuki, plans to chart a new course in India by offering cars that connect well with the country's millennial demography

New Delhi: Hyundai Motor India Ltd, which launched its tall-boy hatchback Santro for the masses in 1998, is repositioning itself as a modern, premium brand after completing 20 years in India. Going forward, Hyundai plans to add superior technology features, offer premium design and leverage customer data to offer customised solutions. Apart from product, the company is also revamping its dealerships and service centres—making them more tech-savvy to enhance customer experience. 
New Delhi: Hyundai Motor India Ltd, which launched its tall-boy hatchback Santro for the masses in 1998, is repositioning itself as a modern, premium brand after completing 20 years in India. Going forward, Hyundai plans to add superior technology features, offer premium design and leverage customer data to offer customised solutions. Apart from product, the company is also revamping its dealerships and service centres—making them more tech-savvy to enhance customer experience.
“When we first entered India, our aim was to establish Hyundai as a mass brand. Having completed two decades, we want to now position Hyundai as a modern premium brand,"" said Puneet Anand, senior general manager (marketing) and group head, Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
The South Korean carmaker, which gave serious competition to market leader Maruti Suzuki in India, plans to chart a new course by connecting with millennial consumers through innovating in design, technology and look and feel of its products. According to Anand, customers are willing to pay a 15% premium for a Hyundai product.
“Our last four products including Grand i10, Elite i20, Creta and Verna have made Hyundai an aspirational brand, which is reaching out to young millennials. Our focus has been to introduce features like wireless charger, telematics, Apple Car Play, bluetooth and touchscreen to make our cars truly a communicative platform,"" he said.
On the communication front, the automobile firm has been running an advertising campaign Brilliant Moments which harps on the nostalgia associated with one’s first car. The digital campaign features a grandfather who is visibly disturbed to part with Hyundai Accent, his first car which helped him create numerous memories.
With time, the auto brand said that it is also changing the way it talks to customers. Keeping its long-standing association with actor Shah Rukh Khan intact, the brand will now create an interesting mix of values based and product centric campaigns. “While Shah Rukh Khan will feature in ads where company’s overall vision and social messaging like road safety will be highlighted, we will continue to launch product centric functional ads,""said Anand.
Hyundai, which grew at 8.2% in the first half of 2018 over last year, will be launching a small car (rumoured to be called Santro) ahead of the festive season in October this year. It is also slated to launch a compact sports SUV in the first quarter of 2019.
Also read: Auto firms fall back on old brand names for new models
The company’s strategy of having a large number of small cars in the portfolio has clicked, with it enjoying over 16% market share in passenger vehicles. It currently has nine car models across segments, including the Eon, Grand i10, Elite i20, Active i20, Xcent, Verna, Elantra, Creta and Tucson.
Ambi Parameswaran, brand strategist and founder of Brand-Building.com, recalled that when Santro was launched in July 1998, it got a modest response. Tata Indica, which was launched in December that year, received tremendous response because it created a dissonance in the consumer brain that Maruti 800 is too small a car.
“However, Indica deliveries took time and dealers asked customers to switch to Santro and that’s how Indica’s loss turned out to be Santro’s gain. Once that shift happened, Hyundai made sure that Santro matched customer expectations. They kept improving their services and subsequently launched new models,"" he said.
Hyundai also gave India many firsts—a power steering in a small car (Santro) in 1998, bringing CRDi diesel engine technology in the Accent 2002 model and creating the premium hatchback category through its i20 car model. “Initially they were lucky but they continued delivering on quality, range of cars and value for money proposition,"" said Parameswaran.
Agreed Jitender Dabas, chief strategy officer, McCann Worldgroup India. “Hyundai has certainly moved up by launching more stylish and design-led models like Elite i20 and its product innovation has taken it ahead in India,"" Dabas said.
“I believe Hyundai is a product success story instead of an advertising success story. They kept on innovating in design, technology and comfort in their new models so much so that they have put the pressure back on Maruti Suzuki to better its act and launch more design-led car models. Suzuki had to go beyond its dealer network and servicing promise and launch premium cars like the Vitara Brezza to maintain its leadership,"" he said."
334,2018-07-05,Maruti,"One-year forward valuations of market leaders Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp have come off from the highs scaled a year ago

Auto sales have been booming for three consecutive months ended June in fiscal year 2019. Reports from industry and analysts give a sense of underlying confidence that the year will be one of bumper auto sales across most segments. 
Auto sales have been booming for three consecutive months ended June in fiscal year 2019. Reports from industry and analysts give a sense of underlying confidence that the year will be one of bumper auto sales across most segments.
Yet, barring random spurts, the shares of auto firms have been southbound. Some explain this in the context of an overall weak sentiment on the Street over the last few weeks. In any case, the Nifty Auto index has fallen by 10.3% since January, underperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 that has risen during the period. 
What gives? 
The macroeconomic headwinds in the road ahead pose a risk to earnings growth. Foremost among all is the incessant rise in fuel cost. Both petrol and diesel prices that account for a significant part of vehicle maintenance costs have jumped 7% and 13%, respectively, in the current calendar year.
That’s not all. The interest rate spike after four long years will increase the cost of finance for vehicle owners. Both these factors are unlikely to change course in the near term. These will affect the cost of ownership and may lead to demand moderation after a few quarters. 
The Street is unsure whether higher sales are translating into higher profitability. Commodity prices that ruled high throughout FY17 and FY18 are likely to impact Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins in the quarters ahead. 
This was partly mirrored even in the quarter ended March 2018. In its report, brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd while analysing the sector’s performance stated, “With commodity prices being around 15% higher year-on-year and 2% higher quarter-on-quarter, operating margins for most companies failed to meet our expectations despite significant operating leverage, given the strong volume growth."" 
A similar situation in the coming quarters may limit earnings expansion. 
Besides, June sales were on a low base of the year-ago period, when the new goods and services tax roll-out led to cutback in despatches.
These imponderables are currently weighing on valuations. Note that one-year forward valuations of passenger vehicles market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and two-wheeler firms Hero MotoCorp Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd have come off from the highs scaled a year ago. 
That said, demand for vehicles remains robust and is likely to continue into the forthcoming festive season. If auto firms have pricing power and can increase vehicle prices to match cost pressures, perhaps valuations will catch up again."
331,2018-07-13,Maruti,"The longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries will replace the traditional lead-based ones in cars sold by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd

New Delhi: Suzuki Motor Corp. will fit premium cars sold by its Indian unit with lithium-ion batteries sourced from the parent’s upcoming Gujarat battery plant, starting FY21, two people aware of the development said. 
New Delhi: Suzuki Motor Corp. will fit premium cars sold by its Indian unit with lithium-ion batteries sourced from the parent’s upcoming Gujarat battery plant, starting FY21, two people aware of the development said.
The longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries will replace the traditional lead-based ones in cars sold by unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. The lithium-ion batteries will be fitted in the Swift hatchback and all models that are more expensive than it, these people said, requesting anonymity.
Suzuki expects that the benefits of doing so will be two-fold: it will be more cost-effective than sourcing lead batteries, and will also help the Gujarat battery plant achieve economies of scale. 
“This move would give Suzuki economies of scale since Maruti sells 50% of the total cars in India. Even if they manage to fit 1 million cars with lithium-ion batteries, it will be huge in number. Also, it will be cheaper than sourcing lead batteries from vendors and prices of lead are always on the rise,"" said one of the two people cited above.
Suzuki is setting up the battery manufacturing plant in a joint venture with Toshiba Corp. and Denso Corp. at an estimated investment of  ₹ 1,152 crore.
Batteries from the Gujarat plant will also be used for electric two-wheelers to be introduced by Suzuki in India in the coming years. The company plans to launch an electric two-wheeler in India by 2020. 
Almost all electric vehicles in the country run on imported batteries, mostly from China. 
“I think Maruti Suzuki will be the first manufacturer to provide lithium-ion battery in cars in India in mass models. These small steps ahead of time have helped the company remained in leadership position in the market,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, vehicle sales forecasting, IHS Markit.
A lead battery is, at present, available for  ₹ 10,000-12,000 while a lithium-ion battery costs around  ₹ 16,000-17,000. Operationally though, a lead battery has a life-cycle of just a year while a lithium-ion one will run as long as five years. 
“Lead prices are increasing every day while lithium prices are expected to be around just $120 or almost the price of lead by 2021. If Suzuki can internally source this component, the cost benefit will be huge given the number of cars Maruti Suzuki sells. Apart from that, the company is investing in hybrids and electric technology where these batteries will be required,"" the second person said. 
A spokesperson for Maruti Suzuki said the company will not be able to comment on queries emailed to it.
The Union government also wants the usage of lead to be reduced substantially in inverters and automobiles because of environmental concerns. The department of heavy industries, in its draft for the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India scheme, has withdrawn subsidies for vehicles fitted with lead batteries.
With Toyota also involved with Suzuki at a global level, the latter can also supply these batteries to hybrid vehicles manufactured by Toyota in India, according to the first person cited above. This will help Toyota in reducing the cost of its vehicles."
330,2018-07-17,Maruti,"Placed between the Alto and Wagon R, Maruti Suzuki's entry-level car code-named Y1K will have a petrol engine capacity of 800-1,000 cc

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the seller of every second car in the country, plans to introduce its first entry-level car in India in more than two decades, as a revival in rural consumption is expected to boost demand for such vehicles.  
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the seller of every second car in the country, plans to introduce its first entry-level car in India in more than two decades, as a revival in rural consumption is expected to boost demand for such vehicles. 
The made-in-India car, code-named Y1K, is in the development stage at the company’s newly built research and development facility in Rohtak, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. The new product will only have a petrol engine capacity ranging between 800cc and 1,000cc, they said, requesting anonymity.
The challenge is to make sure that the car meets all the regulatory norms when it hits the market in 2020, around the time when safety and Bharat Stage VI emission norms—the most stringent in the world— take effect in the country, the people said. 
“The car will set a new benchmark for entry-level products in the country,"" said one of the two people, referring to the perception that India’s small cars may no longer be small—in terms of both size and price tags—once new regulations on safety and emissions come into force. 
Many of the models will need to be re-engineered, necessitating structural reforms such as using more steel to allow vehicles to meet new crash-test norms, adding airbags and anti-lock braking systems for increased safety, and installing diesel particulate filters and selective catalytic reduction technology in diesel cars to help them meet the Bharat Stage VI emission norms. 
“The other challenge is to meet the price points as these changes will increase space and thus cost,"" said the person cited above. 
A Maruti Suzuki spokesperson declined to comment on future products and technology. 
Maruti’s move to introduce a new entry-level vehicle also comes at a time when the market share of such small cars is declining. The share of mini-cars such as Alto and Eon in overall passenger vehicle sales has declined from 35% in 2010 to 18% in the year ended 31 March 2018.
The new product will be placed between Maruti’s entry-level offerings Alto and Wagon R.
The company is hoping to be ready with the prototype of the model by early 2020 so that it can be introduced in the market the same year, said the second person.
Maruti’s managing director Kenichi Ayukawa has maintained that small cars will continue to be the bread and butter of his company, even as the Japanese company’s foray into mid-sized SUVs and sedans has increased its margins and profits in the last two years.
“Small is beautiful and good enough for a product,"" Ayukawa had told Mint in an interview earlier this year. “Customer demand is changing very fast. Any time, they want an affordable and good product... that is a basic. With the economic situation in the country changing, minds of customers are also changing. We have to find out what they are expecting. But affordability continues to be a very important aspect. That remains the bottom line of the Indian market,"" Ayukawa said about changing preference of the Indian consumers. 
“The safety norms will increase the price but that would not hit Maruti as much as it will other manufacturers since it has economies of scale,"" said Deepesh Rathore, co-founder and director, Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.
“Also, there is space for a new product and Maruti must have learnt from Renault Kwid, which came with an SUV-type look. The customers of this segment don’t have many choices as well,"" Rathore added.
Maruti first launched its small car, Maruti 800 in 1983, kicking off a revolution in the country both in terms of numbers sold and also by defining an entirely new category of cars. The unit of Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp. then launched its second product in the segment, Alto, in 2000, which also become a household name and overtook its predecessor Maruti 800 as the highest selling vehicle in the country in 2004. A re-engineered version of Alto was launched in 2012.
According to the second person, a refreshed version of Alto is also expected to be introduced by 2021 and the new Wagon R will be in the market before that."

The feat was achieved in 34 years and 6 months since production started in December 1983, the company said in a statement.
 Maruti Suzuki is the first car-maker in the country to cross the milestone.
“The 20 million production milestone is testimony of the trust in brand Maruti Suzuki,"" said Maruti Suzuki Managing Director and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa.
Of the 20 million vehicles, 14.37 million were manufactured in Gurugram, while 5.62 million vehicles rolled out of the Manesar facility, the company added.
Maruti Suzuki had reached the production milestone of 1 million vehicles in March 1994. In April 2005, it reached 5 million and in March 2011 10 million. “In the next seven years, the company achieved 20 million production,"" Maruti Suzuki said.
Maruti Suzuki sells 16 vehicle models in India. It also exports to over 100 countries, including markets like Europe, Japan, Asia, Africa and Latin America.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest car maker by volumes, entered the connected car space with its first embedded telematic control technology, the Suzuki Connect, which will be available at the Nexa chain of premium dealerships. The new technology has been developed by both Maruti and parent Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), specifically for the Indian market. 
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest car maker by volumes, entered the connected car space with its first embedded telematic control technology, the Suzuki Connect, which will be available at the Nexa chain of premium dealerships. The new technology has been developed by both Maruti and parent Suzuki Motor Corporation (SMC), specifically for the Indian market.
Most of Suzuki’s Japanese competitors, such as Honda and Nissan, have already launched their respective telematic technologies, but none were specifically made for India. The new technology will be available for vehicles that are sold from traditional dealerships by the end of this fiscal year.
According to R.S. Kalsi, the global connected car market grew by 18% last year, but in India it is still at a very nascent stage. “By 2020 the connected car market in India will be 2.6% of the total cars parked,"" he added.
The company had been working on the technology for more than one year and has tested it across 42 cities in the country. Maruti has partnered with Vodafone for providing the network service for this technology.
“We have been working on this technology for a long time and the volumes our products generate will also give us the economies of scale. This is a technology built specifically for India and this is a first. When we launch our hybrid and electric cars, this technology can be improved upon and can be used. It’s always good to have a base,"" said a senior executive of the company, requesting anonymity.
The new technology will come with emergency alert, location sharing, preventive functional call and live vehicle tracking. According to C.V.

“We did conduct a research before working on this technology and it was based on safety, security and performance of the vehicle,"" added Raman.
The company is expected to accumulate substantial data from its customers and protecting that information is going to be quite a task. “One of the significant features of ‘Suzuki Connect’ is that it is ‘deeply embedded’ and is very difficult to tamper with. Over 2,800 technicians have been trained to install the equipment on cars. Suzuki Connect utilizes a Telematics Control Unit (TCU), which exchanges information through cellular network with a centralised server connected to NEXA customer care,"" the company said in a press note."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest car maker by volume, will recall 1,279 units of the recently launched Swift hatchback and Dzire compact sedan to inspect a possible fault in the airbag controller unit. 
According to the company, 566 units of Swift and 713 units of the Dzire manufactured between 7 May and 5 July, 2018, may be recalled.
The press note said owners of the new Swift and new Dzire models can visit the company website and fill in the chassis number on the computer screen to check the status. 
“Starting 25 July 2018 owners of the vehicles included in this recall campaign will be contacted by Maruti Suzuki dealers for inspection and replacement of the faulty part free of cost. Customers may also contact the nearest Maruti Suzuki dealer workshop to ascertain if their vehicle is among the above vehicles,"" it added.
In May, Maruti had recalled 52,686 units of the popular hatchbacks, Swift and Baleno, to rectify a possible fault in the brake vacuum hose. The new Swift and Dzire have met with resounding success ever since the models were launched in India earlier this year."

A poll of 23 analysts by Bloomberg expected the local subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corp. to post a profit of  ₹  2,268.5 crore on net sales of  ₹  22,466.5 crore.
The Q1 results, however, are not comparable to the previous year’s earnings because they are disclosed net of the goods and services tax (GST) introduced on 1 July 2017, Maruti Suzuki said in the filling.
Maruti Suzuki’s operating profit (earnings before interest and taxes) rose by 59.7% to  ₹  2,631.3 crore while total revenue from operations rose 13.6% to  ₹  22,459 crore.
The New Delhi-based firm sold 463,840 cars in the domestic market during Q1, a 25.9% increase over last year, given continued robust demand for models such as the Baleno hatchback, the Vitara Brezza, the new Dzire and the new Swift.
Maruti Suzuki’s operations are key for Suzuki as it provides the bulk of the Japanese automaker’s revenues, and has a market value of more than $43 billion, around 1-1/2 times that of its parent.
Suzuki this year announced an agreement with Toyota Motor Corp. for the Indian market, by which Suzuki will supply the Baleno hatchback and Vitara Brezza to Toyota, while Toyota will produce the Corolla sedan for Suzuki.

The Maruti Suzuki India Ltd stock fell 3.7% to  ₹ 9,396.65 on Thursday, after the company declared its June quarter results. The marginal miss in profitability and a wide miss in net profit, when compared to Bloomberg’s analysts’ average forecast, did not go down well with the Street. However, the performance looks to be a temporary blip and is unlikely to impact the company’s long-term earnings trajectory. 
The Maruti Suzuki India Ltd stock fell 3.7% to  ₹ 9,396.65 on Thursday, after the company declared its June quarter results. The marginal miss in profitability and a wide miss in net profit, when compared to Bloomberg’s analysts’ average forecast, did not go down well with the Street. However, the performance looks to be a temporary blip and is unlikely to impact the company’s long-term earnings trajectory.
Here are a few takeaways from the results:
First, the net profit of  ₹ 1,975.30 crore that missed the forecast by 12% was dragged down by an adverse mark-to-market impact on invested surplus. The consequent 60% year-on-year drop in other income pulled down net profit. Given that this is notional and that it may change in the subsequent quarters, it is less material to valuations.
Second, the 14.9% Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin, which was slightly lower than the forecast of 15.3%, was a satisfactory 160 basis points higher than in the year-ago period. According to Bharat Gianani, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, “Lower discounting (year-on-year) and good operating leverage along with a low base pushed up Ebitda margin for the quarter."" 
Further, adverse currency movement and commodity prices during the quarter also hurt profit margins. The management in its conference call said that commodity prices have shown stability in the recent past. While it skirted the question on price hikes in the near term, analysts reckon that this is possible to protect margins."

Mumbai: Passenger car sales, which had a stellar run since January 2018 on the back of new launches and a recovery in rural demand, saw a slowdown in July because of a high base in the same month last year and a planned inventory reduction by auto makers ahead of the launch of new models and refreshes during the festive season beginning later this month.

A nationwide transporters’ strike in mid-July also impacted production and distribution of vehicles. Auto makers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. 
India’s top five carmakers, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, collectively sold 236,947 units during the month, up 1.14% from 233,643 units a year ago.
During July last year, inventory stocking was unusually high as consumers deferred purchases in the preceding months expecting a lower tax outgo post the implementation of the goods and service tax on 1 July. 
The slowdown in sales this month is an aberration as underlying retail demand, primarily from semi-urban and rural areas, has remained stable as expected, analysts said. 
“As auto makers look to fill inventory channels with new products for the festive season in August and September, they did not push inventory aggressively in July,"" said Darshini Kansara, deputy manager, industry research at CARE Ratings Ltd.
“The rural recovery is still positive, as is the broader economy. The recent MSP (minimum support price) hike, near-normal monsoon, and revision in the central government employees’ dearness allowance are positive factors,"" Kansara said.
Passenger car market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a marginal fall in domestic car sales (excluding vans and commercial vehicles) to 136,636 units in July from 137,584 units a year ago, the first decline since December 2016. 
Sales of the premium sedan of the local subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corp. stood at 48 units in July as compared to 6,377 units a year ago. The company plans to introduce the next-gen Ciaz on 20 August.
Other segments also reported lower-than-expected sales. The compact car segment, which makes up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki sales, grew 17.8% to 74,373 units because of the demand for the 2018 Swift hatchback and continued interest in premium hatchback Baleno and compact sedan Dzire. In the past few months, this segment had been reporting growth upwards of 20%.
The sport utility vehicles (SUV) segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, posted a 4.9% decline to 24,5050 units over July last year.
Sales of entry-level cars Alto and WagonR declined even further by 10.9% to 37,710 units.
Hyundai Motor India clocked 43,481 units in sales during July, an 1.1% growth over the year-ago period, on the back of refreshed models such as the Creta compact SUV, Verna sedan and Elite i20 hatchback, according to Y.K. Koo, managing director and chief executive at the local subsidiary of the South Korean carmaker.
“A positive growth trend is visible with the stabilisation of macroeconomic factors and a good monsoon, along with increase in customer confidence and sentiment towards new vehicle purchases,"" he said.
Honda Cars India clocked a 16.9% rise in sales to 19,970 units during July on the back of greater production of the Amaze compact sedan and sustained momentum for the City sedan and WR-V SUV, said Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at the firm.
The maker of the rugged Bolero SUV, Mahindra, posted an 5.96% decline in sales to 19,781 units during the month. Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive sector at the firm cited “certain uncertainties with the truckers’ strike and sluggishness on the retail front"" as challenges during the month. The firm is “confident of seeing a turnaround in the overall buying sentiment"" as the festive season approaches, he said.
Analysts expect the quarters ending September and December to contribute handsomely to sales on the back of the festive season, a positive economic environment, stable inflation and interest rates, and expectations of a normal monsoon, though rising crude oil and commodity prices may play spoilsport.
Kansara of CARE Ratings expects passenger vehicle sales to clock 8-10% growth for the fiscal."

However, this month’s sales are expected to be an aberration as Maruti Suzuki is expected to maintain its leadership position this year on the back of a refreshed product portfolio.
Motorcycle and three-wheeler manufacturer Bajaj Auto Ltd also reported its domestic motorcycle sales in July, which grew by 22.1% to 201,433 units.
The government’s focus on developing infrastructure and the rural sector, coupled with expectations of a normal monsoon, are likely to boost the overall economy and thus, the automobile industry."
320,2018-08-02,Maruti,"Operating profit at Suzuki jumped 37% to 116.5 billion yen ($1 billion) for April-June, versus 85.1 billion yen a year earlier

Tokyo: Suzuki Motor Corp on Thursday posted a record-high operating profit in the first quarter, outpacing expectations on the back of a strong rise in global automobile sales, particularly in its biggest market India, where it is represented by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Operating profit at Japan’s fourth-largest automaker jumped 37% to 116.5 billion yen ($1 billion) for April-June, versus 85.1 billion yen a year earlier. The result was stronger than an average of 97.3 billion yen based on seven analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The result was stronger than an average of 97.3 billion yen based on seven analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Vehicle sales jumped 26% to 464,000 units in India, where the Swift subcompact, Baleno compact hatchback and Vitara Brezza compact sport utility vehicle are among the best-selling cars. Suzuki accounts for roughly half the passenger vehicles sold in India through a majority stake in Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest carmaker.
Overall sales in Asia, which comprise roughly 65% of global vehicles sales, rose 21% to 570,000 units. At home, they rose 8.5% to 173,000 units.
In the first quarter, higher steel prices increased the automaker’s raw materials costs, shaving 2.3 billion yen off operating profit.
Suzuki is on track to post record global vehicle sales of 3.3 million units for the year to March, but it is also anticipating a 9.1% slide in global operating profit, as it ramps up R&D spending to develop new technologies such as electric vehicles to defend its dominance in India.
As rival Japanese automakers brace for the possibility of US auto tariffs, Suzuki is shielded from such restrictions as it does not market cars in the United States. However, the automaker said that it would be vigilant for any trickle-down impact such restrictions could have on other markets.
To protect its market share amid the rise of electric cars, Suzuki is partnering with Toyota Motor Corp. to leverage Toyota’s firepower to help it develop and market EVs in India.
The two automakers have also agreed to produce cars for each other in India as Toyota aims to increase its market share in the country."

The company, which is planning a price hike this month to offset adverse impacts of commodity cost increase, fluctuations in foreign exchange and fuel price rise, does not see the step impacting its sales significantly.
“We will continue with our annual target of double-digit growth. I am optimistic about the future growth,"" Maruti Suzuki’s senior executive director (Marketing and Sales) R.S. Kalsi said, adding that the optimism stems from the fact that India is witnessing good monsoon for a second consecutive year.
Besides, Kalsi said, the rise in minimum support price (MSP) of crops augurs well for the rural economy from where demand is expected to grow during the festive season.
“By October, money will come through these crops and the increase in MSP prices will ring in a lot of wealth circulation,"" he said. “We are quite happy about the future scenario of the passenger car industry.""
On July sales, when the company reported a marginal decline at 164,369 units as against 165,346 units in the same month last year, Kalsi said it was an aberration due to high base effect of last year.
Maruti Suzuki’s domestic sales were up marginally at 154,150 units last month as against 154,001 units in July last year.
According to Kalsi, if the June-July period was taken together, Maruti Suzuki’s sales growth would be 17% over the year-ago period. “That is a more realistic trend and talks about the prevailing market sentiments.""
In the first quarter of this fiscal, Maruti Suzuki sold 490,479 vehicles, a growth of 24.3% over the same period of the previous year. Sales in the domestic market stood at 463,840 units, a growth of 25.9%. Kalsi also expressed optimism that a planned price hike this month will not affect the company’s sales.
Maruti Suzuki had last week said that it would hike prices of its vehicles across models this month to offset adverse impacts of rise in commodity costs, foreign exchange fluctuations and fuel price increases."

Toyota will start hawking the Baleno through its own dealership network from the first quarter of next fiscal year, the people who didn’t want to be named said. 
New Delhi: Suzuki Motor Corp. is likely to supply as many as 25,000 Maruti Suzuki Baleno premium hatchbacks each year to Toyota Motor Corp. as the car gets set to become the first cross-badged product of the auto makers, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Toyota will start hawking the Baleno through its own dealership network from the first quarter of next fiscal year, the people who didn’t want to be named said.
To start with, Suzuki will supply 20,000 to 25,000 Baleno cars each year to Toyota’s local unit, the people said. The vehicle, which is currently produced at Suzuki’s factory in Gujarat, will undergo some minor changes in its exteriors and interiors such as head lamps, tail lamps and front grill, they said.
“The decision has already been taken by both the headquarters in Japan and the first vehicle to be launched will be Baleno,"" said the first person cited above. “The changes to be made have already been approved as well and both the companies have already decided on the number of vehicles to be supplied.""
Spokespeople for the local units of Suzuki and Toyota—Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd—declined to comment.
Since its launch in 2015, the Baleno has turned to be a chartbuster Maruti Suzuki product with average monthly sales of 15,000 cars.
The sourcing of the Baleno follows a pact between Toyota and Suzuki in March this year for the two Japanese companies to sell each other’s vehicles in India. Suzuki will later also supply its compact sport-utility vehicle Vitara Brezza to Toyota. In return, Suzuki would source Toyota’s Corolla sedan and sell it through Maruti’s dealer network.
Suzuki and Toyota will have a task on their hands as cross-badging as a concept in India hasn’t set the sales charts on fire.
The Renault-Nissan Alliance, and Volkswagen and Skoda, tried a similar strategy with models such as Renault Duster and Nissan Terrano SUVs, and Volkswagen Vento and Skoda Rapid sedans among others.
For Toyota, the Baleno will give it a deeper presence in India’s high-volume but most-competitive hatchback segment. It will also be able to make use of spare capacity at its plant in Karnataka in the near future once Suzuki starts making the Baleno there. Toyota currently makes the Etios Liva hatchback in India.
“Toyota anyways doesn’t have any major investment plans in India until 2020 and Baleno is a product which is being exported to other countries including Japan hence there will be no issue regarding quality,"" the second person said.
Puneet Gupta, associate director at IHS Markit said choosing Baleno makes sense for both the companies, especially Toyota, which would need a smaller gasoline engine car to meet new corporate average fuel efficiency norms.
“Baleno is a well-accepted product in India now and it is expected that adding a product like that will help Toyota in getting volumes in a segment where they are not present,"" Gupta said."

According to details on the Ciaz facelift available so far, the mid-sized sedan sports a rounder look upfront, with a smoother chrome-lined grille that fuses with the new LED headlights. The bonnet is also reworked that flows upwards from the grille.
The front bumper is also reworked and sports a wider air dam that connects directly with the fog lamp inserts. The top-spec model gets chrome door handles and a new design for the diamond-cut alloy wheels. At the back, except for new inserts for the LED tail-lamps and chrome detailing on the rear bumper, the overall styling remains the same.
On the inside, the Ciaz facelift is expected to a new instrument cluster and a multi-info display, an updated infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and new upholstery as well. Feature additions on the top-spec Ciaz come in the form of cruise control; auto headlights are expected too.

The country’s largest carmaker expects such a platform to help generate sales leads, one person aware of the plans said, as online queries generate data and user information that can be shared with its own dealers. Currently, the platforms share such data with dealers of various carmakers.
“Most of the customers in the urban or in the semi-urban cities and towns do extensive research before going to the dealerships and most of them also compare products of their choice with other offerings in the same category on these websites,"" the person mentioned above said on condition of anonymity. “In the end, a customer has to put his or her mobile number and email address, and the lead generated goes to the dealer of that company as well as others. So, Maruti with this new website would not have to share the customer data that gets generated online.""
Maruti Suzuki, which makes one of every two cars sold in India, has put in place a team of engineers to develop the platform that will not be used by the company for commercial use, but will benefit dealers. Dealers will play an essential role in operating this platform, said the person mentioned above.
“This decision makes sense for Maruti as it may be losing some customers to competitors, though Maruti also gets to know about the customers who want to buy a product of a rival organisation. Most of the customers will invariably look for Maruti’s products and others can have access to the data,"" said the person mentioned above.
Maruti Suzuki controlled almost 51% of the domestic automobile market at the end of the June quarter, and is taking steps to consolidate its position.
Automobile manufacturers have restricted themselves to manufacturing and marketing the products while the sales is left to the dealers. It will be interesting to see how Maruti Suzuki tries to change that, said Anil Sharma, associate director at Markets and Markets, a global consulting firm.
An email sent to Maruti Suzuki remained unanswered till the time of going to press.
“The investment required for the venture must be minuscule and will not be of a concern for a huge corporate like Maruti Suzuki. The concern is genuine since enquiries get shared with rival companies and sometimes, the customer gets calls from dealerships and sometimes from multiple dealerships of the same company,"" explained Sharma."

The price change varies across models and is up to  ₹ 6,100 (ex-showroom Delhi), the company said in a statement. 
The new prices are effective from Thursday, it added. MSI sells a range of vehicles from entry level Alto 800 to mid-sized sedan Ciaz. These were priced between  ₹ 2.51 lakh and  ₹ 11.51 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) before the hike. 
Earlier this month, MSI senior executive director (marketing and sales) R.S. Kalsi had said the company has been analysing the adverse movement of commodity prices which were going towards the higher side. 
Besides, the foreign exchange rate had impacted the company adversely, while the fuel prices too have increased, adding to the logistics costs, he added. 
German luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz on Thursday also announced to hike prices of its vehicles across models by up to 4% from September. 
Other companies such as Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors and Honda Cars India have also announced price hikes from this month citing rising input cost.

Hyundai Motor India Ltd, meanwhile, lived up to its tag as India’s second largest carmaker as three of its cars—the Elite i20 (10,822 units), Grand i10 (10,775 units) and Creta (10,423 units)—made it to the Top 10 list.

“With fresh changes, we are confident that the Ciaz facelift will present a complete package in line with aspirations of evolving customers,"" Maruti Suzuki India CEO Kenichi Ayukawa said in Bengaluru. 
Maruti Suzuki has always strived to bring newer, advanced and greener technologies in India, Ayukawa said. “The new Ciaz, powered by K15 smart hybrid gasoline engine, is testament of the same.""
Over the past four years, the Ciaz has redefined the sedan segment with its class-leading space, design and sophistication, Ayukawa said.

New Delhi: In its quest to improve dealer profitability, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has created a royalty vertical in its spare parts department wherein the company will offer the option to its vendors—such as tyre makers, engine oil suppliers and battery makers—to sell their wares directly through authorized dealerships and service centres, said two people familiar with the matter. 
New Delhi: In its quest to improve dealer profitability, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has created a royalty vertical in its spare parts department wherein the company will offer the option to its vendors—such as tyre makers, engine oil suppliers and battery makers—to sell their wares directly through authorized dealerships and service centres, said two people familiar with the matter.
In return, the country’s largest car maker would charge a certain amount as royalty from the suppliers, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
The initiative is expected to be a win-win for both parties as it would boost profitability at dealerships while offering an additional source of revenue to Maruti Suzuki, the people said.
The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit expects dealer revenue from repairs and servicing to decline in the future, as the build quality of its cars improve. The latest initiative is, therefore, aimed at ensuring dealers receive additional revenue and stay profitable. 
Dealers currently earn almost 70% of their profit from servicing vehicles.
“The quality of Maruti Suzuki products have improved substantially over the last few years especially when the company ventured into the premium segment,"" said the first person cited above. “With the introduction of new emission and safety norms from next year, the quality of products will further improve. So, the need to service vehicles would also further decline.""
The new vertical is led by Gaurav Sharma from Maruti’s accessories sourcing department, both the people said.
A spokesperson for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd declined to comment.
The latest step is considered as the second round of key initiatives at Maruti Suzuki to boost dealer financials as it will add to the retailing muscle of its suppliers. The suppliers currently sell their products in the aftermarket through their exclusive or multi-brand dealerships.
Maruti Suzuki had earlier introduced the True Value brand of used car and vehicle financing business, which are run by its dealers.
The first person said improving car quality would result in Maruti dealers losing a “significant part of the revenue in the longer term"". “Hence, this decision to sell spare parts through its own dealerships makes sense,"" the person said.
Advent of electric and hybrid vehicles in India with lesser number of moving parts compared with fossil-fuel vehicles is also expected to bring down vehicle servicing needs including of Maruti Suzuki. Suzuki plans to start selling its first electric car in India in 2020 in alliance with Toyota Motor Corp.
“This move makes sense since it will give additional revenue to dealers but the cost of these parts should not increase when it is sold at Maruti dealerships,"" Anil Sharma, associate director at MarketsandMarkets, a market research firm. “For customers also, it would be beneficial if these products can be bought under one roof.""
Sharma said dealer profits have been under pressure for the last five years mainly due an increase in realty costs and declining revenue from servicing cars. Meanwhile, as the auto industry undergoes substantial changes in terms of product development and reaching potential customers through digital platforms, Maruti is taking several steps to maintain the well-being of its channel partners. 
The company has started to upgrade its existing non-Nexa showrooms to the Arena concept, which will use digital platforms to meet diverse customer needs. 
Mint on 10 August reported that Maruti Suzuki is building a website where car buyers can compare prices, in a direct challenge to platforms such as CarWale and CarDekho, which provide similar services. The carmaker expects such a platform to help generate sales leads as online queries generate data and user information that can be shared with its own dealers."

Kia has already discussed its plans to develop the two products—codenamed KP1 and KP2—with its vendors in India after receiving an approval from its headquarters in South Korea, said the people cited above.
“The hatchback that Kia is planning to bring into the Indian market will compete directly with Hyundai Elite i20 and Maruti Suzuki Baleno.

“In the midsize sedan segment also, the company will throw a challenge to the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz facelift and Hyundai Verna as the quality of the products will be good and the management of Kia both in India and Korea know the India market well enough,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Kia Motors India didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.
The domestic passenger vehicle market mainly comprises hatchbacks, sedans and compact SUVs. All the segments are dominated by Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, the country’s first and the second-largest car maker. SUVs have outpaced car sales growth in the past few years.

New Delhi: India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd will try to develop cars that will run on alternate fuels like ethanol and methanol along with the company’s efforts to launch battery-led pure electric cars and hybrid vehicles in the domestic market, said chairman R.C. Bhargava during the company’s 37th annual general meeting (AGM) in New Delhi today. 
New Delhi: India’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd will try to develop cars that will run on alternate fuels like ethanol and methanol along with the company’s efforts to launch battery-led pure electric cars and hybrid vehicles in the domestic market, said chairman R.C. Bhargava during the company’s 37th annual general meeting (AGM) in New Delhi today.
Apart from that the Delhi-based carmaker is planning to introduce more CNG engines for its cars in the years ahead in its effort to reduce carbon emissions from its vehicles.
According to Bhargava, the development of a policy for electric mobility is essential and electrification of the small cars continues to be a challenge for the industry since it will be more expensive than the ones that run on internal combustion engines.
“Trade war between countries and United States’ sanction on Iran have had an adverse impact on commodity cost. Hence the union government’s decision to push for electric vehicles is good,"" said Bhargava.
In the last financial year Suzuki Motor Corp., Maruti Suzuki’s parent company, took significant steps towards electric mobility by starting a collaboration with Toyota Motor Corp. for development of small electric vehicles for the Indian market. The company also announced a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat in a joint venture with Denso Corporation and Toshiba Corp.
Bhargava, though, is of the opinion that electric vehicles may not be able to curb the increasing levels of air pollution in the national capital region centred on Delhi since cars contribute just 2% of the overall pollution.
“The cooperation between Suzuki and Toyota is because we want to give the best technology to the customers and also for the overall benefit of the nation,"" Bhargava told shareholders."

Mumbai: Rising interest rates and higher car prices could hit consumer sentiment this festival season, even as demand is likely to be subdued in Kerala, where the worst floods in more than a century have left more than 380 people dead, according to dealers and auto company executives. Barring July, car sales have grown at a fast pace since January on the back of a recovery in rural demand and a slew of product launches and upgrades.  
Mumbai: Rising interest rates and higher car prices could hit consumer sentiment this festival season, even as demand is likely to be subdued in Kerala, where the worst floods in more than a century have left more than 380 people dead, according to dealers and auto company executives. Barring July, car sales have grown at a fast pace since January on the back of a recovery in rural demand and a slew of product launches and upgrades. 
Car sales in India are considered as factory dispatches to dealerships. Auto makers may have to trim dealer inventory if retail demand fails to keep pace.
The festival season, which started with Onam this month and will end with Diwali in November, is crucial for companies as consumers traditionally consider it auspicious for big-ticket purchases such as cars.
Factors such as two straight RBI repo rate hikes in June and August and nine straight months of retail inflation above the central bank’s medium-term target of 4% are likely to affect consumer sentiment, said executives at dealerships.
“Enquiries have reduced by about 20% compared to the same period last year as consumers are concerned about uncertain fuel and food prices. We are expecting a subdued festive season despite new launches,"" said a Honda Cars India Ltd dealer in New Delhi, adding that about 40% of car buyers take loans. 
A Maruti Suzuki Nexa dealership executive in western Mumbai concurred. “Enquiries and footfalls are marginally lower than last year, though we have high expectations owing to new products and festive schemes. There is a delay in intent to purchase because even car prices have risen,"" the executive said.
The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) June consumer confidence survey of over 5,000 individuals in six metropolitan cities found that 83% of respondents believe prices would rise 12 months from now, with only 48.2% of respondents expecting general economic conditions to improve a year hence. As many as 27.7% expect economic conditions to worsen.
In its August monetary policy, the Reserve Bank of India retained its neutral policy stance, citing uncertainty on the future course of inflation because of volatile food prices and the central and state governments’ pay commission decisions, thus reducing the prospect of a near-term rate cut. 
N. Raja, deputy managing director at Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, said the current consumer sentiment is a “challenge"" since “rates are going up and most car customers have home and car loans"", but he expects rising rural and urban incomes to support demand.
“It’s all sentimental even though the rate hike is not that large. Slowly it is hitting (sales),"" Raja said. He expects a “big sentiment challenge"" in Kerala where sales tend to “at least double"" during Onam.
Others such as Honda, Hyundai Motor India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd generate 5-10% of sales from Kerala but are bullish on the rest of the country on the back of new launches, near-normal monsoons and a hike in the minimum support price for key crops.
“Interest rates going up can be a dampener to demand, and will pan out over some time,"" said Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director of sales and marketing at Honda. 
He said the company is still “very bullish"" on the festive season due to new launches such as the Amaze sedan and CR-V sport-utility vehicle.
Mahindra, too, is “confident of seeing increased traction in the overall buying sentiment"" on the back of new launches such as the Mahindra Marazzo multi-utility vehicle and good rainfall, said Veejay Ram Nakra, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at the automotive division.
Analysts, too, are wary of rising fuel prices and interest rates playing spoilsport.
“These factors are definitely a concern, there could be some moderation in sales compared to last year because of rising fuel prices and interest rates,"" said Shruti Saboo, associate director, India Ratings and Research, adding that high-volume entry-level cars (where Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is the market leader), would be “worst affected"" due to higher price sensitivity.
However, rising incomes across the board and new launches would be positive factors, she said.

306,2018-09-05,Maruti,"Suzuki, through its subsidiary Maruti Suzuki, aims to roughly triple its sales in India to 5 million cars annually by 2030

Shares of Suzuki Motor Corp. advanced after the Japanese carmaker said it’s exiting China, abandoning a market where it struggled to gain traction and allowing it focus on Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which accounts for half of the country’s car market. 
Shares of Suzuki Motor Corp. advanced after the Japanese carmaker said it’s exiting China, abandoning a market where it struggled to gain traction and allowing it focus on Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which accounts for half of the country’s car market.
Suzuki’s China exit highlights the cut-throat nature of the Chinese market, where quick changes in customer tastes can leave carmakers exposed. Suzuki’s lineup of mainly smaller cars became less competitive after consumers in the world’s biggest auto market shifted purchases to larger sedans and SUVs amid rising incomes.
While an admission of defeat, the move paves the way for a sharpened focus on India, a market Suzuki dominates and where it aims to roughly triple sales to 5 million vehicles annually by 2030. The exit also allows Suzuki to avoid spending on development of new vehicles to meet China’s tightening environmental regulations, analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note today.
“We see strategic merit in Suzuki’s accelerated moves to narrow its business focus to core areas,"" Goldman analysts led by Kota Yuzawa said in the note, reiterating their buy rating on the stock.
Shares of Suzuki advanced 1.7% as of the lunch-time trading break in Tokyo. They have added 13% this year. In Mumbai, Maruti Suzuki shares were down 0.15% to  ₹  8,860.00.
The Japanese mini-car specialist announced Tuesday is was dissolving its last remaining Chinese joint venture, transferring its 50% stake in Changan Suzuki to Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. as soon as legal proceedings are completed. It cancelled its other Chinese partnership in June.
In a sign of the pressures facing carmakers in China, Changan Suzuki was included in a public list of 30 companies licensed to manufacture so-called new-energy vehicles that haven’t produced any units in the past 12 months or more. Strict quotas on NEVs—which include pure electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids—come into force in China from next year, toward a goal of having them make up a fifth of new car sales by 2025.
By contrast, although India has set a goal to have more than 30% of vehicles running on electricity by 2030, it doesn’t yet have a policy road map for how to get there and the country’s infrastructure is far from being ready to support such a fleet.
ALSO READ | After China exit, Maruti is all that Suzuki may have
Whereas Maruti Suzuki has its name on about one of every two cars sold on the subcontinent, Changan Suzuki had seen its market share fall below 0.4% in China last year, according to Bloomberg Intelligence data. Even the addition of SUVs to the Chinese lineup couldn’t temper the decline.
The Suzuki name isn’t vanishing from China entirely—partner Chongqing Changan Automobile Co. will continue to make and sell vehicles with that brand in the country. That could make a potential return for the Japanese company easier in the future."
305,2018-09-06,Maruti,"Maruti's MD Kenichi Ayukawa urges component manufacturers to gear up for multi-locations facilities and align investments accordingly

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said auto makers in the country will have to build factories nationwide, including at new untapped regions, to diversify their production bases and meet an expected more than threefold surge in sales by 2030. 
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said auto makers in the country will have to build factories nationwide, including at new untapped regions, to diversify their production bases and meet an expected more than threefold surge in sales by 2030.
“Multi-location plants will be a business necessity for both OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and component manufacturers to grow and de-risk our business,"" Kenichi Ayukawa, Maruti’s managing director, said at the annual conference of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India.
India’s automotive industry is mainly dominated by the hubs of Gurugram and Manesar belt in Haryana, Gujarat and Chennai, with pockets of automotive manufacturing presence in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh. 
Citing the example of Gurugram, where the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit began its journey in the 1980s, Ayukawa said “many such auto-clusters have to be developed throughout the country"".
“This will help us sustain the next phase of growth and insulate us from unforeseen business risks. I urge component manufacturers to gear up for multi-locations facilities and align investments accordingly,"" Ayukawa said.
The new regions would need the latest infrastructure and other facilities to make it attractive for people to reside, he added.
An 8-9% expansion of the Indian economy would grow the passenger vehicle industry to about 10 million units a year by 2030 from about 3.2 million units, Ayukawa said. 
The government expects the passenger vehicle market to triple to 9.4 million units by 2026 from 3.2 million currently if the economy grows at an average of 5.8% a year, said a document titled Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2016-26. 
A 7.5% annual expansion of the economy will expand the market further to 13.4 million units, making it the world’s second largest after China. 
On the same premise, the commercial vehicle industry is expected to grow to 2 million and 3.9 million units, respectively, from 700,000 at the end of 2014-15. 
The two-wheeler market is likely to grow to between 50.6 million and 55.5 million units from the 18.5 million units currently.
To achieve the projections, the auto industry will need additional investments of  ₹ 4.5 trillion to  ₹ 5.5 trillion.
“As you note, the scale of operations before us will increase nearly three times of the present levels. Clearly, we have to triple our efforts to meet the growth in volumes. It implies a transformation in our mind set and change in our outlook. Our businesses will therefore, need to be re-looked and aligned to new scale of operations,"" Ayukawa said.
Over the next decade, the auto sector is expected to contribute more than of 12% of India’s gross domestic product (GDP), up from 7% now, and comprise more than 40% of the manufacturing sector, compared with 16% now, according to Automotive Mission Plan 2016-26.
Auto industry will contribute about 13% of total excise duty collection. The projections come at a time when the government is seeking to attract foreign investment in manufacturing through the Make in India initiative. Share of manufacturing in GDP has stagnated at about 15% in the past decade.
Ayukawa also stressed on the need to invest in new technologies. 
“Even if we look at a small EV penetration by 2030, still a large volume of (internal combustion) engines will need some form of electrification. So, please have a good appetite for new technologies, its research and adoption to Indian market conditions,"" he said.
“Efforts are needed to set up a complete ecosystem from procurement of raw materials to charging infrastructure and recycling of the batteries. Similarly, connected cars will require special infrastructure at another level,"" he added."
304,2018-09-21,Maruti,"Mahindra lost the crown of India's top SUV maker last year to Maruti Suzuki, whose compact SUV model Vitara Brezza has been a runaway success

New Delhi: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is renewing its focus on introducing bigger sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles as it seeks to avoid a deeper foothold in the increasingly crowded market for compact SUVs, said four people aware of the plans. Three of four new products of Mahindra would be bigger SUVs or MPVs, the people said on condition of anonymity. The shift in strategy follows subdued demand for compact SUVs introduced by Mahindra in the past few years, the people said. 
New Delhi: Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is renewing its focus on introducing bigger sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and multi-purpose vehicles as it seeks to avoid a deeper foothold in the increasingly crowded market for compact SUVs, said four people aware of the plans. Three of four new products of Mahindra would be bigger SUVs or MPVs, the people said on condition of anonymity. The shift in strategy follows subdued demand for compact SUVs introduced by Mahindra in the past few years, the people said.
Mahindra lost the crown of India’s top SUV maker last year to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, whose compact SUV model Vitara Brezza has been a runaway success.
Mahindra, in comparison, has largely struggled to find enough buyers for the four compact SUV models it has introduced since 2014—TUV 300, KUV 100, Quanto and Nuvo Sport. Such SUVs measure up to four metres in length and have petrol and diesel engine capacities of up to 1200cc and 1500cc respectively.
The first person cited above said Mahindra has realized that bigger SUVs are still very much relevant in India since vehicles such as Toyota Innova Crysta and Fortuner, and the Jeep Compass have been doing well.
“If you look at the products Mahindra will launch in the next two years, including the recently-launched Marazzo, most of the offerings except one will be above four metres. This strategy makes sense since Mahindra still leads the space when it comes to bigger SUVs,"" said the person mentioned above requesting anonymity.
Earlier in September, Mahindra began selling the Marazzo multi-purpose vehicle. It is expected to shortly introduce a full-size SUV code-named Y400, which is based on the Rexton model of its South Korean unit, SsangYong Motor Co. Mahindra is also developing another SUV that will compete with Hyundai Creta , said the second person cited above.
The person said Mahindra is also developing a seven-seater version of the TUV 300 for a potential launch in 2019.
“It has always been our endeavour to be present in all segments of the UV category,"" said a spokesperson for Mahindra in response to an emailed query.
“We will launch products that meet regulatory standards and match customer requirements, at regular intervals"", the spokesperson said, adding that the SUV segment is “evolving and growing"".
Faced with an onslaught of compact SUVs from Maruti Suzuki, Ford Motor Co., and Tata Motors Ltd., among others, Mahindra’s market share in the utility vehicle segment more than halved to 25.38% in FY18 from a peak of 55.59% in FY12.
Hyundai Motor India Ltd. and Kia Motors India are also expected to enter this segment in the next few years.
Sales of the TUV 300 grew 10.5% in FY18 to 29,018 units, while the KUV 100 recorded a 28% drop to 25,542 units. It sold only 254 units of Quanto last year.
To be sure, Mahindra won’t completely shun the compact SUV segment and is developing a model code-named S201, based on SsangYong’s compact SUV Tivoli, said the third person cited above.
“The thinking within the company is that we should stick to our strengths and rely on the partnership with Ford to experiment in the weaker segments,"" the person said, referring to the September 2017 initial agreement between the two companies to develop a compact SUV, among other initiatives. 
Another factor which led to the realignment of the compact SUV strategy is an impending price hike post 2020. “Post the implementation of the safety and emission norms in 2020, prices are sure to rise. We think we will be able to hedge ourselves against this risk by playing in a segment where buyers are less price sensitive,"" said the fourth person cited above.
Sales of large and mid-sized SUVs in India is forecast to grow at a compounded annual rate of 14.37% from 2018 to 2021, according to research firm IHS Markit. It forecast compact SUV sales to grow at a slower 11.17%.
“The compact SUV segment is where the action is in today’s market. No OEM, including Mahindra, should take their eyes off it. Being strongly present in a fast-growing segment will immensely help them and even arrest market share decline,"" said Deepesh Rathore, co-founder and director at London-based Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors."

Domestic car sales rose by 90 units to 136,876 units during September from 136,786 units in the year-ago period. These figures do not include sales of Maruti Suzuki’s Omni and Eeco vans, and light commercial vehicle Super Carry.

Domestic car sales rose by 90 units to 136,876 units during September from 136,786 units in the year-ago period. These figures do not include sales of Maruti Suzuki’s Omni and Eeco vans, and light commercial vehicle Super Carry. 
The local subsidiary of Suzuki Motor Corp. reported a decline in sales in July and August after several months of robust demand for its wide range of cars, on the back of erratic monsoon across the country and devastating floods in Kerala. Maruti attributes about 8% of its retail sales from the flood-stricken state. 
Automakers in India consider dispatches to dealerships as sales. 
Analysts had expected India’s largest carmaker to report a moderate rise sales during the month in order to build inventory ahead of the festive season beginning on 10 October, but subdued retails for the past two months (as Mint reported on 26 September) could have held back dispatches. The first 10 days of October, marking the Shraadh period, are considered inauspicious for making big-ticket purchases such as cars, gold and real estate. 
For the fiscal so far, Maruti has introduced facelifts of popular models such as the Swift hatchback, DZire compact sedan and Ciaz mid-sized sedan, expecting a robust growth to end the year with a double-digit growth. 
The compact car segment, which makes up the bulk of Maruti Suzuki sales, rose 1.7% to 74,011 units in September. With the exception of July and August, this segment had been reporting growth upwards of 20% in the past few months. 
While sales of entry-level cars Alto and WagonR fell 9.1% to 34,971 units during the month, the sports utility vehicles (SUV) segment, including the best-selling Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models, posted a rise of 8.7% to 21,639 units over last year. Sales of the Ciaz grew 11.5% to 6,246 units in September. 
However, with the onset of the festive season this month, Maruti Suzuki is expected to report a double-digit rise in sales for the fiscal and maintain its leadership position on the back of a refreshed product portfolio. 
Meanwhile, Pune-based Bajaj Auto Ltd posted a 10.35% rise in domestic motorcycle sales to 273,029 units on the back of an aggressive bid to corner a larger share of India’s motorcycle market."

301,2018-10-09,Maruti,"GNCAP found that Maruti Suzuki Swift's body shell integrity was 'unstable' and 'not capable of withstanding further loadings'

Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s popular Swift hatchback, now in its third generation in India, scored a dismal two out of five stars in the Global New Car Assessment Programme’s (GNCAP’s) crash tests conducted as part of its “Safer Cars For India"" campaign, a report released on Monday by the international body showed.  
Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s popular Swift hatchback, now in its third generation in India, scored a dismal two out of five stars in the Global New Car Assessment Programme’s (GNCAP’s) crash tests conducted as part of its “Safer Cars For India"" campaign, a report released on Monday by the international body showed. 
“The latest version of the Maruti Suzuki Swift, with standard double airbags (for adults seated in front) and ISOFIX (i-size) anchorages (for child safety on the rear seat), reached two stars in adult occupant protection and two stars for child occupant protection,"" the report said.
An NCAP is a government or institutional car safety programme that evaluates the safety capabilities of new automobile designs. GNCAP, located in London, coordinates between various NCAPs around the world in addition to conducting its own safety tests.
While the adult safety rating of the India-specific Swift (manufactured locally) was compromised because of “high compression to the driver’s chest, unstable structure and poor protection for the feet, explained by pedal displacement on the driver’s side"", the child safety rating was explained by poor protection to the head and chest of the 18-month-old and three-year-old dummies.
GNCAP found that the Swift’s body shell integrity was “unstable"" and “not capable of withstanding further loadings"".
Tested at the global norm of 64 km per hour against India’s 56 km per hour, the Indian version of the Swift was found wanting in the frontal crash test as compared to its European variant, as it does not offer features such as side-body and curtain airbags, and electronic stability control (ESC). While these are standard on the European model, they are not even offered in the price-sensitive Indian market by Maruti Suzuki.
“The latest version of the Swift sold in India has improved and it is good to see dual airbags as standard. This confirms the beneficial effect of the government’s new crash test regulations. But performance of the Swift sold in Europe and Japan shows that a better safety performance is still possible, so Global NCAP would like to see Maruti Suzuki aim higher,"" David Ward, GNCAP secretary general, said in the report.
The absence of a four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) was also one of the key reasons for the poor rating, GNCAP said.
First launched in India in 2005, the Swift has been one of the top-selling models in the country, clocking a cumulative 1.8 million units in sales up to the launch of its third generation variant in February. In June, Maruti Suzuki said the model had clocked 100,000 units in sales. With a base price of  ₹  499,000 (ex-showroom, New Delhi), the Swift is one of the most competitively priced hatchbacks in the country. 
India has one of the highest road fatality rates in the world, with more than 150,000 people killed in traffic accidents each year. On its part, the government has mandated a piecemeal implementation of stricter safety norms. 
Last October, the transport ministry approved the mandatory installation of airbags and speed limit reminders in all cars from 1 July 2019, in addition to seat belt reminders, reverse parking sensors and a manual override switch for central locking systems. From October 2019, all cars will also have to comply with norms related to a full frontal impact, offset frontal impact and a side impact.
At present, these features are available primarily on top-end variants.
In the past, Maruti Suzuki had committed to adhere 75-80% of its portfolio to these norms, a year ahead of the deadline.
Analysts say the tag of an “unsafe car"" declared by such global tests will not deter sales in the domestic market as Indians are still value-conscious.
“There is no data to say that customers are willing to change their purchase decisions even though some cars are declared unsafe,"" said Deepesh Rathore, co-founder and director at London-based Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors, citing the examples of the best-selling Hyundai Grand i10 and Maruti Suzuki Alto models, which received only one GNCAP star in their respective tests.
Considering the maker of the Baleno hatchback produces upwards of one lakh units a month, Maruti Suzuki’s build quality is one of the best in India, Rathore said, adding that such high sales by the firm “are a testimony"" to its car quality."
299,2018-10-10,Maruti,"The new Hyundai Santro will go up against Maruti Suzuki Alto, Tata Tiago and Renault Kwid

Chennai: Hyundai Motor India Ltd will bring back its popular small car brand Santro in India, as the country’s second-largest carmaker by market share seeks to intensify its competition with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and others in this segment. The Santro will go on sale later this month, coinciding with Hyundai’s completion of two decades of operations. The latest car will be a completely new Santro, which first went on sale in September 1998, before it was phased out in 2014. 
Chennai: Hyundai Motor India Ltd will bring back its popular small car brand Santro in India, as the country’s second-largest carmaker by market share seeks to intensify its competition with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and others in this segment. The Santro will go on sale later this month, coinciding with Hyundai’s completion of two decades of operations. The latest car will be a completely new Santro, which first went on sale in September 1998, before it was phased out in 2014.
Hyundai’s decision to reintroduce the brand is considered a crucial attempt by the company to claw back market share it lost to rivals in the small car segment, with the key being Maruti Suzuki. The company also realizes that building a brand in India from scratch is an uphill task and not many could manage it successfully.
The new Santro will also have to compete with models from Renault and Tata Motors, among others.
The new Santro will be Hyundai’s first new model in the small-car segment after nearly six years. It had introduced the Eon in October 2012. The new Santro is also Hyundai’s first new model after the 2015 launch of Creta, a sports utility vehicle.
The time has come for Hyundai to enter or re-enter the segment where the company has no presence at the moment, said Y.K. Koo, managing director, Hyundai Motor India Ltd. With the introduction of the Santro, the company would have a formidable line-up of products, he said.
Hyundai expects to manufacture 8,000-10,000 units of the new Santro each month, and achieve a 17% share of the domestic market this fiscal. Its market share has been stagnant at around 16.5% in the past two years due to the lack of new products in the mass-market segment and production constraints at its factory in Chennai.
Over the same period, Maruti Suzuki expanded its domestic market share from 47% to 51% as of the last fiscal.
Santro’s reintroduction comes at a time of subdued auto demand due to worsening macroeconomic factors such as higher crude oil prices and the weakening of the rupee against the dollar, which have hit consumer sentiment.
Koo is undeterred by the negative sentiment in the market. He expects the new Santro to help Hyundai gain at least 30% share of the compact-car segment as it will also attract a lot of first-time car buyers.
“New and good products will always create good demand, though the market is not much positive as of now,"" he said. “The last three months, the growth in sales has been negative. The Kerala floods, oil price rise and rise in third-party insurance premiums may have had a negative impact.""
The new hatchback will be produced in Chennai and shipped to Europe, Latin America and Africa. Also with the new Santro, Hyundai will make the global debut of its in-house automated manual transmission technology (AMT).
“Santro was a big responsibility on us and our engineers were actively involved with the development centres outside India,"" said a senior Hyundai executive, who did not wish to be named.
The ride for the Santro, though, may not be smooth as Tata Motors’ Tiago and Maruti’s Alto have been dominating sales in the segment.
The Santro’s return is a positive development as the brand resonates well, especially among customers, after declining sales volumes for Hyundai Eon, said Anil Sharma, associate director at MarketsandMarkets, a market research firm. “The challenge for Hyundai is to expand capacity as the demand in the market is also not very stable as market leader Maruti Suzuki has also been impacted,"" Sharma said. “The next 12 months are not looking rosy for the automobile industry but it won’t be very difficult to sell the Santro since it is a small budget car."""

 New Delhi: Hyundai Motor Co. on Tuesday brought back the entry-level Santro small car to India two decades after it was first introduced as the South Korean carmaker mounts one of its strongest-ever efforts to challenge the domination of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd in rural markets and small towns. The re-launch of the Santro, however, comes at a time when high auto fuel prices, increased loan rates, and worsening macroeconomic factors have crimped consumer demand. 
 New Delhi: Hyundai Motor Co. on Tuesday brought back the entry-level Santro small car to India two decades after it was first introduced as the South Korean carmaker mounts one of its strongest-ever efforts to challenge the domination of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd in rural markets and small towns. The re-launch of the Santro, however, comes at a time when high auto fuel prices, increased loan rates, and worsening macroeconomic factors have crimped consumer demand.
Hyundai generates about 20% of its total sales from rural and semi-urban areas.
In comparison, Maruti Suzuki garners about 30%-35% of its sales volume from such regions because of its range of fuel-efficient, small cars such as the Alto, WagonR and Celerio and a vast retail network.
Y.K. Koo, managing director, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, said the new Santro will be pushed more in the semi-urban and rural markets as the company would try to attract more first-time car buyers. “For Santro, the priority market is rural and the first-time buyers, and whatever the number of customers we get from the metro cities will be additional. This is the right product to attract the rural as well as the semi-urban markets as the Santro has the lowest cost of maintenance among its competitors,"" said Koo.
Despite having a fairly popular product in the Santro when it was introduced in 1998, Hyundai remained a distant No. 2 in India as it could not offer much of a challenge to Maruti Suzuki’s wide range of small cars, especially in the hinterlands.
The Santro was discontinued in 2014, and barring the Eon, Hyundai did not have any affordable small car in the Indian market, leading most consumers to opt for Maruti Suzuki.
Hyundai will discontinue the Eon by December, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said in August. The i10, Hyundai’s other small car in the sub-₹5 lakh bracket, was discontinued in early 2017.
Hyundai’s plan to target the rural market comes at a time when three consecutive years of abundant rains and the Union government’s focus on improving rural infrastructure and benefits like loan waivers to farmers is leading to a revival in the rural economy.
 ALSO READ | Rural growth rate overtakes urban in India automobile sales
Hyundai’s market share has been stagnant at 15% to 16% over the last few years mainly because of capacity constraints at its factory in Chennai and lack of new products. 
Maruti has about a 51% market share. The new Santro will help Hyundai reach a market share of 17%, Koo said earlier this month.
“The share of ‘A’ segment hatchbacks has decreased in urban markets as customers are looking to go for products at the higher price points. The rural markets also have been performing well as the purchasing power of the populace has increased. Hence, this is the right strategy for Hyundai as the number of individuals who will look to upgrade to a car will be more in the smaller towns and rural markets,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at global information provider IHS Markit.
Despite prevailing weak consumer sentiments, Koo believes it is the right time to launch the Santro as it is affordable and has low maintenance cost.

This will also push demand in semi-urban rural markets, he said, adding that in urban areas the new Santro will be purchased by a consumer as a replacement for an existing car.
“This product will be very strong in the rural markets where demand has recovered and the buying power in the semi urban and rural markets are growing. So, this is the right product to attract the rural as well as the semi-urban markets,"" said Koo.
“This vehicle has the potential to be the preferred choice of the first-time customer in the rural and semi-urban markets,"" said a senior Hyundai official, requesting anonymity. “We lacked an affordable compact car in the last few years and now that has been addressed,"" the official said."

New Delhi: Skirting around the expensive job of creating new automobile brands, India’s top carmakers Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd have revived two of their most successful brands established over the past couple of decades. Ahead of Diwali, South Korea’s Hyundai brought back its most popular brand, Santro, with a brand new hatchback. 
New Delhi: Skirting around the expensive job of creating new automobile brands, India’s top carmakers Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Pvt. Ltd have revived two of their most successful brands established over the past couple of decades. Ahead of Diwali, South Korea’s Hyundai brought back its most popular brand, Santro, with a brand new hatchback.
The revival originated from intense competition in the small car segment from firms such as Maruti and Tata Motors Ltd. The Santro has also established a strong brand association with middle-class Indians since first going on sale in 1998 before being discontinued in 2014.
On the other hand, market leader Maruti Suzuki tried to re-establish the connection with the same segment of customers with a new advertisement for its most popular car, the Alto. In the ad campaign, it tried to showcase the significance and connect of the Alto brand with existing and prospective customers in small cities and towns. The Alto ad also included popular characters who have featured in some of its most iconic advertisements over the past three decades.
Other auto makers have not been as fortunate as Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai, with several struggling to establish their brands, imperative for the long-term success of a product.
R.S. Kalsi, senior executive director, marketing and sales at Maruti Suzuki, said the Alto has been a success over the past 19 years and that it needed to evolve to stay relevant.
“We included some of the characters from our iconic advertisements so that our old and new customers could still relate to the product,"" said Kalsi.
“Alto as a product has undergone significant changes in the past two decades, and the ways to communicate with customers have also changed. A successful brand always has to walk the talk. We have invested in the brand and have made it popular to an extent that it is still the most preferred choice of first-time buyers,"" he said.
The latest Alto ad was viewed almost 50 million times across digital platforms, according to Maruti. 
Hyundai’s brand ambassador and Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, describing Santro as a known, trusted and loved brand, said it is good that the firm decided to revive it with a new platform and technology. “When they first approached me, I thought it’s a South Korean company launching a new small car with a strange name, Santro. So, let’s give it a try. Also, I was at the cusp of starting a family and just made it big. So, Santro stood for all that values naturally and it still does. A middle-class boy who made it big and will start a family is thinking of buying a car,"" said Shah Rukh in an interview with Mint.
In a market troubled by weak consumer sentiments due to factors such as high fuel prices, the Santro garnered more than 20,000 bookings ahead of its launch. “Indian buyers do not have use and discard psyche. In the auto industry, durability, solidity are relevant and consumers are of the use and repeat mindset,"" said Harish Bijoor, chief executive, Harsh Bijoor Consults Inc.
“Hyundai has tried to reinvent the memory of Santro and Maruti also tried to dig into the past looking for some emotive plugs for consumers for Alto. In auto industry, at the top end, there is brand promiscuity but in the middle and lower end, there is a loyalty factor. That’s the key insight that Maruti and Hyundai have used,"" he said."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Wednesday launched an all-new Ertiga with prices starting at  ₹ 7.44 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi. It goes up against the likes of Honda BR-V and Mahindra Marazzo in the mass market multi-purpose vehicle space, which are available in a price range of  ₹ 9.45 lakh and  ₹ 13.9 lakh.
The Ertiga’s petrol variants, including two automatic trims, are powered by an all-new 1.5-litre engine and are priced between  ₹ 7.44 lakh and  ₹ 9.95 lakh. The diesel variants have the same 1.3-litre engine as the earlier version and are tagged between  ₹ 8.84 lakh and  ₹ 10.9 lakh.

The petrol variant now features a new 1.5-litre engine with smart hybrid technology and lithium-ion battery. According to Maruti Suzuki, the new platform has made the Ertiga stronger and more rigid, thereby enhancing its safety and improving NVH levels.
“The next-gen Ertiga has been designed with thoughtful features and great attention to detail, keeping in mind the requirements of our ever evolving customers,"" said Maruti Suzuki CEO Kenichi Ayukawa. “I’m confident that our customers will appreciate best-in-class fuel efficiency, which has increased by nearly 10% for the petrol variant,"" Ayukawa said.

Maruti Suzuki Ertiga 2018: Features and Specifications
The new Ertiga has received a significant facelift—and is visibly at par with the looks of its main contenders, the Mahindra Marazzo and Honda BR-V. It is more squared-off on the front, with a more aggressive grille and headlamps. The rear-end has been remastered as well, with tail lamps that extend all the way to the spoiler.
The dimensions of the Ertiga have also grown: it’s longer by 99mm, wider by 40mm and taller by 5mm. The wheelbase, however, has remained the same at 2,740mm.
Despite the bump in external dimensions, boot space has shrunk. It now stands at 32 litres.
At the heart of this MPV are two engines: one new and one old.
The petrol motor is the all-new 1.5-litre, inline-four K15B producing 103bhp of power and 138Nm of torque. This is mated with either five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmissions.
The diesel engine remains the same: 1.3-litre DDiS which produces 90bhp of power and 200Nm of torque and is mated to a five-speed manual transmission. There are no automatic diesel options available.
Maruti Suzuki claims it offers best-in-class fuel efficiency that is 10% higher than the outgoing model. The manual petrol variant makes 19.34kmpl while the automatic makes 18.69kmpl. The diesel Ertiga has a fuel efficiency of 25.47 kmpl.
The insides of the Ertiga are now more contemporary. It is now at par with its Maruti siblings, in terms of cabin niceties. The MPV gets a new dashboard, infotainment system (Apple CarPlay and Android Auto ready), instrument cluster, flat-bottom steering wheel, Cruise Control and faux wood inserts.
The new Ertiga comes in five paints jobs—Pearl Metallic Auburn Red, Metallic Magma Grey, Real Metallic Oxford Blue, Pearl Arctic White and Metallic Silky Silver.

“The idea is to give another mobility option, especially to the middle class who want to upgrade from two-wheelers. A person cannot carry family members in a three-wheeler, therefore, quadricycles are being allowed in the private category. The move will help them to upgrade to four-wheelers and move around with family,"" said a senior transport ministry official, requesting anonymity.
The ministry official, however, said such quadricycles will not be allowed for transporting cargo or luggage. Bajaj Auto Ltd’s Qute, the first locally produced quadricycle, had initially hit regulatory hurdles due to safety concerns. Others such as Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd are also expected to launch similar products over the next couple of years. 
Now, with the centre giving a go-ahead on the sale of quadricycles for personal use, top auto makers such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd, will have to revamp their strategy on entry-level cars, given quadricycles are expected to be far cheaper.
 In June, the transport ministry headed by Nitin Gadkari, had approved the launch of quadricycles, which weigh less than 475 kg. 
Avik Chattopadhayay, an auto industry veteran, and founder of brand consultancy firm Expereal, said quadricycles will pose a serious challenge to entry level cars. “Quadricycle is a modern version of a three wheeler and in future these vehicles will all become quadricycles. Some companies have been trying to push their wheelers as a mode of personal transport for some years now and I think these vehicles should be encouraged in electric mode.""
An emailed query to Bajaj Auto remained unanswered till press time, while officials at industry body, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, declined to comment.
A section of industry insiders, however, are not happy with the move. They argued that while the government is trying to improve the safety standards of vehicles for Indian roads, quadricycles may not even meet the basic safety norms. 
“Quadricycles should have been restricted only for commercial purposes since they don’t meet the emission and safety norms of passenger cars. The regulators have been lenient and have diluted the norms for vehicles in this segment. When the objective is to launch safer vehicles, then there is no reason to allow these vehicles,"" said a senior executive of a leading passenger vehicle manufacturer. According to a senior industry executive, requesting anonymity, quadricycles were only meant to replace auto rickshaws, and are not for personal use. “There will be restrictions on these vehicles. For example, one cannot take them on highways. So, it will not be a lucrative proposition for any buyer."""

288,2018-11-28,Maruti,"The BSE Auto index shed 20% between July and end-October before recovering marginally this month. Maruti Suzuki shares have underperformed too, on account of lower car sales

A festive season that lacked sparkle for domestic automobile sales has raised alarm bells among investors. During the 42-day festive period, registrations of vehicles in the domestic market—an indicator of retail sales and consumer sentiment—was down by as much as 11% year-on-year, according to data from analytics firm Crisil Ltd. Passenger vehicles displayed the sharpest decline of 14% in registrations. What’s worrisome is that it is normally a peak period for new vehicle registrations in the country. Worse, the decline comes on the heels of sales contraction in the three months of July, August and September.

Worse, the decline comes on the heels of sales contraction in the three months of July, August and September.
The hope was that auto sales will pick up in the festive season. Add to this, dealer inventory—which is normally at 30-35 days during this period—is higher at 40 days.
Perhaps, the trend mirrors the tightness in liquidity in the Indian economy over the last few months. Interest rates have hardened and insurance costs are up, and so are vehicle prices. All of this adds to cost of ownership along with the big jump in fuel costs.
This apart, there were more facelifts (refreshes) than new models launched during this festive season, which did not enthuse customers enough to purchase new vehicles.
Obviously, the strain in auto sales has taken a toll on the share prices of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The BSE Auto index shed 20% between July and end-October before recovering marginally this month. Likewise, shares of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which makes one out of every two cars sold in the country, also fell on lacklustre sales.
Crisil Research has cut its sales growth forecasts for passenger vehicles from the earlier 9-11% to 7-9% in fiscal year 2019. Some brokerage firms have lowered their forecasts too.
The slowdown in auto sales during the festive season may force OEMs to offer higher discounts and schemes to promote sales in the coming months. This may lead to a margin squeeze, in turn hurting profits. As such, the drop in share prices of auto companies looks justified, especially those with high exposure to passenger vehicles."

This is the fourth instance in the past five months when Maruti Suzuki posted a drop in sales, reflecting the weak retail demand scenario in India due to unfavourable macroeconomic factors and regulatory changes.
Utility vehicle maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, on the other hand, reported a marginal rise in domestic passenger vehicles sales to 16,188 units in November, compared with 16,030 units a year ago. 
Rajan Wadhera, president of the automotive sector at the firm, cited “adverse"" macroeconomic conditions for the impact on growth projections this fiscal for the automotive industry. “Going forward, we hope that decrease in fuel prices and improving liquidity will drive demand for passenger vehicles. At Mahindra, we remain upbeat due to our new product launches of the Marazzo (multi-purpose vehicle), Alturas G4 (premium SUV) and the upcoming launch of our new (compact) SUV codenamed S201."" 
Automakers in India report dispatches to dealerships as sales.
The compact segment comprising Baleno, Swift and Ignis hatchbacks clocked sales of 72,533 units, posting the highest rise of 10.8% over the year ago, apart from the utility vehicles category, which also posted a rise of 1.9% to 23,512 units.
Maruti Suzuki is the largest seller of utility vehicles in India, with models such as the Vistara Brezza and S-Cross in its portfolio.
The sharpest fall, of 21.6%, was reported by the mini segment comprising old workhorses Alto and WagonR, which posted 29,954 units in sales. The mid-sedan Ciaz, which was recently given a facelift, also posted a decline of 4.8% to 3,838 units.
Analysts and industry executives expect car sales for the current financial year to clock 7-8% growth, revised downward from a double-digit growth estimate at the beginning of the year. Maruti Suzuki is likely to follow suit. 
After an 11% decline in vehicle registrations during the festive season this year, which accounts for nearly 30% of annual auto sales, the chances of a recovery in the remaining four months of the fiscal are slim."

Tata Motors
Tata Motors too will jack up its car prices by up to  ₹ 40,000 from new year’s day, just days ahead of the launch its most premium offering—the Tata Harrier. The reason: rising input costs and costlier fuel. The company’s car models range from Tata Nano to Hexa SUV priced between  ₹ 2.36 lakh and  ₹ 17.97 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

Honda Cars India too has jumped onto the price hike bandwagon to partially offset the impact of rising input costs. The company, which sells the Amaze and City sedans in India, is currently working out the quantum of the price hike. “Our input costs are up by 4% already due to rise in input costs.

283,2018-12-18,Maruti,"Haryana has offered Maruti Suzuki at least seven locations, including Rohtak, Karnal, Faridabad and Dharuhera, to choose from for a new car plant

Mumbai/New Delhi: The Haryana government has offered Maruti Suzuki India Ltd at least seven locations to choose from for a new car plant being planned by the country’s largest carmaker. The local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. wants to shift out of its oldest factory in the country, in Delhi’s bustling suburb of Gurgaon, amid traffic congestion and complaints from residents and civic bodies. The Haryana government has offered new sites in Rohtak, Karnal, Faridabad and Dharuhera, among others, to Maruti, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: The Haryana government has offered Maruti Suzuki India Ltd at least seven locations to choose from for a new car plant being planned by the country’s largest carmaker. The local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. wants to shift out of its oldest factory in the country, in Delhi’s bustling suburb of Gurgaon, amid traffic congestion and complaints from residents and civic bodies. The Haryana government has offered new sites in Rohtak, Karnal, Faridabad and Dharuhera, among others, to Maruti, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The alternative locations were offered after Maruti Suzuki rejected a 1,300 acre site in Sohna, around 40km from Gurgaon, after its engineers found the site was not conducive to construct a car factory.
The engineers found “excessive amount of sulphur and salt"" in the soil, which was not suitable to build a heavy industry facility, the first person said on condition of anonymity. “Most notably, the area was found to be low-lying, with very high levels of groundwater. Water would come out in about half a metre of digging,"" added the person.
A spokesman for Maruti Suzuki declined to comment.
If Maruti Suzuki decides to build its new car plant in Haryana, it is estimated to require an additional investment of about  ₹ 12,000 crore. These would include the cost of procuring land and building four assembly lines capable of producing one million cars a year.
“The India market is expected to grow at a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of more than 7%, so it is inevitable for Suzuki to keep their investment plans going on in India,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, vehicle forecasting, IHS Markit Ltd. “This will also encourage their suppliers and associated partners to plan their own investments. With so much of disruptions happening (in the car industry), all the suppliers are sceptical about new investments and are just waiting and watching.""
Since it opened the factory at Gurgaon in the early 1980s, Maruti Suzuki has constructed a second plant in Haryana, at Manesar, and its third factory in the country, in Gujarat.
The automaker is seeking 800-1,000 acres, preferably close to its Gurgaon factory, to reduce likely resistance from its workers on relocation. It told the Haryana government that the site should be well-connected by roads and railways and should not be in low-lying areas, the second person said.
Maruti Suzuki is likely to build residential quarters, hospitals, schools and other amenities for its employees in and around the facility.
The current manufacturing facility of the company in Gurgaon is on a 300 acre plot. The land offered in Sohna was close to the Western Peripheral Expressway—also known as the Kundli-Manesar-Palwal Expressway—40km from Maruti Suzuki’s second factory in Manesar. Haryana government stopped the public bidding for the 1,300 acres near Sohna once Maruti Suzuki showed interest.

Gurgaon and Manesar are prime manufacturing zones for Maruti Suzuki. The firm built its vendor ecosystem around Gurgaon, expanding it to Manesar in 2008.
Present-day Gurgaon largely came up around the Maruti Suzuki factory. But as Gurgaon transformed in the decades that followed, with the entry of multinational companies, the company began to receive complaints from civic bodies and residents, who said its presence in the heart of the city led to traffic congestion due to heavy trucks that deliver parts to the plant and transport fully-built cars out.
In 2012, Maruti Suzuki decided on a phase-wise dismantling of the Gurgaon plant. Mint was the first to report this in March 2012. Maruti Suzuki has significantly reduced production at this plant from its original capacity of 700,000 vehicles a year."

New Delhi: The country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI), on Wednesday reduced its sales forecast for the ongoing fiscal to 8% from an earlier projection of double-digit growth. The company cited low demand in the second half of the year due to high interest rates, increased insurance cost and fuel prices for its downward revision, besides its lack of new model launch in the volume segment.  
New Delhi: The country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI), on Wednesday reduced its sales forecast for the ongoing fiscal to 8% from an earlier projection of double-digit growth. The company cited low demand in the second half of the year due to high interest rates, increased insurance cost and fuel prices for its downward revision, besides its lack of new model launch in the volume segment. 
Citing historical instances of sales being lower in a pre-election year and picking up substantially again in the election year, the company said it was hopeful of better sales in the next fiscal.
Interacting with reporters here, MSI chairman R C Bhargava also said in preparation for transition to BS-VI emission norms, MSI will stop production of majority of its BS-IV models by December 2019.
“In the last five months after the first quarter, sales have been flat for Maruti, while the industry saw negative growth. The question therefore is what happens next.""
Bhargava said the company was offering attractive packages to customers to push retail sales in December to reduce dealer inventory, which coupled with a new model launch planned in January-March 2019, would help MSI reverse the trend of declining sales. “In the wholesales, we expect sales to go up by 5% in January-March quarter.""
In the first half of the current fiscal, the company had posted sales growth of 10.5%, whereas it was flat in the third quarter.
“So, we are looking at a growth of around 8% for the ongoing fiscal,"" he said. Earlier this year, the company had said it was looking at a double-digit sales growth in the current fiscal.
MSI senior executive director (sales and marketing) R.S. Kalsi said external factors such as higher interest rates, fuel prices and increase in insurance cost at the time of vehicle purchase had affected consumer sentiment, thereby impacting demand. “Internally, we also had to cut down production of the old version of our best-selling MPV Ertiga ahead of the launch of a new version,"" Kalsi added.
Giving a historical perspective of passenger vehicle sales in a pre-election year, Bhargava said: ""We did an analysis of the past numbers and the conclusion was that in the last two pre-election years sales always fell."" 
“In election years, sales always go up substantially. So we have to see next year,"" Bhargava said. MSI’s sales growth was also partly affected this year due to the absence of a new model launch in the volume segment.
“In the January-March period of next year we will have a new model, which will again push volumes for us,"" he said. The newly launched Ertiga would also contribute substantially since it had been received well in the market, he added.
According to Kalsi, Ertiga received bookings of 23,000. It currently has a waiting period of eight weeks.
Commenting on the company’s plans for transition to BS-VI, Bhargava said:""Our plan is for all new models to be introduced in the next fiscal to be BS-VI. The production of majority of existing BS-IV models will come to a stop by December 2019."" BS-IV vehicles will be produced only on demand from customers from December 2019, he added. 
The Supreme Court had ordered that sales of all BS-IV vehicles will stop from March 31, 2020 and from April 1, 2020, only BS-VI vehicles would be sold across the country due to increased pollution issues.
When asked about Maruti Suzuki’s plans to shift its mother plant at Gurugram, Bhargava said it was still in talks with the Haryana government for an alternate location. “As of now there is no progress on that front,"" he said. MSI CEO and Managing Director Kenichi Ayukawa said the company was considering an alternate location only within Haryana and not in other states, considering the presence of its supplier base in the state.

New Delhi: As carmakers the world over struggle to develop affordable small electric vehicles, the Indian government should invest in increasing infrastructure for distribution of CNG and promote hybrid technology in the interim to reduce car emissions in the country, R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said on Wednesday. 
New Delhi: As carmakers the world over struggle to develop affordable small electric vehicles, the Indian government should invest in increasing infrastructure for distribution of CNG and promote hybrid technology in the interim to reduce car emissions in the country, R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said on Wednesday.
He also suggested that providing subsidies will not be a viable way to make small electric cars affordable with rich vehicle owners pocketing most the subsidies.
“CNG is the most affordable and clean, fuel. Then why not use the funds to increase the distribution centres for CNG? The sales of such vehicles have grown by almost 50% this fiscal year,"" said Bhargava. 
Realizing the problem of shifting directly to electric vehicles, the Union government has shown an inclination towards reducing taxes on hybrid vehicles. The government is also contemplating imposing a cess on traditional vehicles to generate funds for electric vehicles.
According to Bhargava, two-thirds of the petrol consumption is by two-wheelers the focus should be on converting these vehicles and that the government should not impose taxes on four-wheelers to incentivize electric two-wheelers.
“One has to find an intermediate solution and hybrid vehicles are needed since they emit less carbon and will result in a 30% cut in oil imports in the future. Nobody is making any headway in electric vehicles and in Europe maybe 30% of the total vehicles will be electric by 2030. And remember, conditions in Europe are much more suited compared to India when it comes to adopting electric vehicles,"" said Bhargava.
Suzuki Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Co. have collaborated to make small electric and hybrid cars for the Indian market which will be launched in 2019. Maruti Suzuki, Suzuki’s Indian subsidiary, has already started testing 50 units of an electric version of its Wagon R car in Indian conditions."

India’s largest carmaker is working on greater localization of parts for such vehicles while it prepares for the opening of a lithium ion battery plant in Gujarat being built jointly by the Suzuki-Toyota alliance. Maruti Suzuki currently sells a mild hybrid version of its Ciaz sedan. 
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has started work on its first full hybrid car, with the government finally signalling its intention to offer incentives for hybrid cars, along with electric cars. India’s largest carmaker is working on greater localization of parts for such vehicles while it prepares for the opening of a lithium ion battery plant in Gujarat being built jointly by the Suzuki-Toyota alliance. Maruti Suzuki currently sells a mild hybrid version of its Ciaz sedan.
Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director of Maruti Suzuki India, said on Wednesday that the company is expecting tax benefits from the union government for hybrid cars.
“We are pushing for localization of components like lithium ion batteries and others. We are already in the process of implementing the battery plant and are planning for a strong hybrid vehicle as well,"" Ayukawa said in an interview on the sidelines of a press conference. “We are trying to collaborate with Toyota in pushing the hybrid system nationwide if the government supports (with some cuts in tax rates).""
The government was initially inclined to offer the incentives only to electric cars in a bid to promote the sale of such eco-friendly vehicles and arrest rampant pollution in its major cities. However, relentless lobbying by Japanese companies in favour of hybrid cars led to a shift in the stance.
Subsequently, the ministry of road transport and highways recommended a reduction in the rate of goods and services tax (GST) on hybrid cars. The department of heavy industry also sought incentives for 10,000 hybrid vehicles in the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME).
The prime minister’s office is also in favour of incentivizing manufacture of lithium ion batteries that can be used for both hybrid and electric vehicles.
Suzuki and Toyota have formed a partnership to develop small electric and hybrid vehicles for the Indian market and it is expected that Suzuki will collaborate with Toyota for the first full hybrid car that will be launched by the company in India.
Suzuki has two alliances—one where it will produce lithium-ion batteries in Gujarat in collaboration with Denso Corp. and Toshiba Corp.; and another with the world’s largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp., to sell electric cars in India by 2020.

“Globally, Toyota is the best when it comes to hybrid technology and we are trying to learn (from them). We will try to collaborate. We, at Suzuki, also have some system but Toyota’s technology is very advanced. We have to learn a lot of things,"" said Ayukawa. “The hybrid technology is still not so much cheaper,"" he said. “So, for small cars, we have to consider a different option.""
Carmakers, especially those from Japan, are lobbying the government to popularize hybrid vehicles as this will give them enough room to develop electric vehicles while reducing vehicle emissions and comply with stricter emission rules set to be enforced from 2022 under corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) norms.

From 1 April 2017, India adopted CAFE norms, which require cars to be 30% or more fuel-efficient from 2022 and 10% or more by 2021.
“Going forward, the government may offer incentives on manufacturing lithium ion batteries in the electric vehicle policy and tax rates on hybrid vehicles may also come down. So it makes sense for companies to invest in hybrid before moving to complete electric,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, passenger vehicle forecast, IHS Markit, a global consultancy firm.
The government has been urging automakers to cut emissions from new vehicles.
“We have always been saying that hybrid technology needs to be encouraged till the time we can develop the electric technology. It helps reduce carbon emissions and will result in fuel import reduction by almost 30%,"" Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said at the press meet."

Mahindra’s Korean subsidiary SsangYong has sold over 2.6 lakh Tivoli in over 50 countries since its launch in 2015.
The compact SUV segment currently accounts for about 60% of overall SUV volumes, Mahindra managing director Pawan Goenka said, adding that the carmaker is looking to corner about 15% market share of the segment with the new vehicle.
“We have given some very advanced and unique features in our XUV300. So, within the Compact SUV segment, we are going to position it as the premium product,"" Goenka told reporters. As of now, the company does not have a very strong product in the compact SUV segment and XUV300 will fill this gap.
Mahindra currently sells three compact SUVs, namely the KUV 100, TUV 300 and Quanto, productions of which it wants to cease, Mint reported on 21 September.
The compact SUV segment, dominated by Maruti Suzuki’s Vitara Brezza, has been growing at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 44% over the last five years while the current market size its stands at around 35-40,000 vehicles per month.
“It is a fast growing market and we want to capture a sizable markets share out of the segment,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive sector) at Mahindra and Mahindra.
The 5-seater XUV300 will be manufactured at Mahindra’s Nashik facility.
Goenka said that the company plans to launch the new vehicle in overseas markets alongwith its rollout in the domestic market. He also said that the company is working on the an electric version, which is expected to hit the market in 2020."

According to data by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), Maruti Suzuki sold 22,191 Swift cars in November as against 13,337 units in the year-ago period when it ranked sixth.
Retaining the second place in November was Maruti Suzuki Dzire with 21,037 units sold as against 22,492 units in November 2017. Maruti Suzuki Baleno retained its third spot with 18,649 units. It had sold 17,769 units in November last year. The Alto came in fourth with 14,378 units, Vitara Brezza fifth with 14,378 units and Wagon R sixth with 11,311 units.
Breaking the Maruti Suzuki juggernaut was Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s Elite i20 that came in seventh with 10,555 units, followed by Hyundai Creta at eighth with 9,677 units and Hyundai Grand i10 at ninth with 9,252 units sold.
The recently launched Hyundai Santro rounded up the Top 10 cars list (essentially, a Maruti-Hyundai affair) with 9,009 cars sold in November. The Hyundai Santro was re-launched in October after it was discontinued in December 2014.
Overall car sales were muted in November, as companies adjusted their inventory after a weak festive season. Subdued consumer sentiment, volatile fuel prices and inflation are likely to remain demand dampeners but new model launches in the coming months are expected to help drive sales.
The coming months, however, will also bring with them car price hikes. Carmakers—from Maruti Suzuki to BMW AG—have announced price hikes from 1 January 2019 across all models."
276,2018-12-24,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki considers Haryana as its 'mother state' and will scout for another location in the state only, says MD and CEO Kenichi Ayukawa

New Delhi: The country’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is seeking a land parcel of around 700 acres in Haryana for shifting its Gurgaon plant, a top company official said. The company considers Haryana as its “mother state"" and will scout for another location in the state only, considering the presence of its supplier base. “Already, Manesar plant is spread across 700 acres so we are looking at a similar kind of land (for shifting Gurgaon plant),"" Maruti Suzuki’s managing director and chief executive, Kenichi Ayukawa, told the Press Trust of India.

Mint was the first to report on Maruti Suzuki’s plans to shift out operations from Gurgaon, amid traffic congestion and complaints from residents and civic bodies. With the rapid development of the Delhi suburb, the company now finds its plant in the middle of a bustling city which has made it difficult for trucks carrying raw materials and finished products move in and out of the plant.
The Haryana government has offered new sites in Rohtak, Karnal, Faridabad and Dharuhera, among others, to Maruti Suzuki, the 14 December report had said.
The company has not set any timeline for shifting the plant and the focus right now is to locate a good land parcel, Ayukawa told PTI.
When asked if the company is looking to establish the new plant in Haryana itself, Ayukawa said: “First we have to discuss with the Haryana (government) people...because Haryana is our mother state...first we have to focus in that area...besides, we also have a lot of suppliers here (Haryana)...we have to manage that also."" So far, Maruti Suzuki has received positive response from the Haryana government over the issue.
When asked to comment on the planned investment in the new plant, Ayukawa said it would depend on the production capacity which is yet to be decided.
If Maruti Suzuki decides to build its new car plant in Haryana, it is estimated to require an additional investment of about  ₹ 12,000 crore, the 14 December Mint report had said. These would include the cost of procuring land and building four assembly lines capable of producing one million cars a year.
It was at the Gurgaon plant that the then Maruti Udyog Ltd began its India journey in 1983 by rolling out its first model—the Maruti 800. At present, the plant rolls out many of the company’s popular models, including the Alto and Wagon R, with an estimated annual capacity of around 7 lakh cars.
Besides Gurgaon, Maruti Suzuki has another car plant in Haryana at Manesar. Both Gurgaon and Manesar plants have a production capacity of 15.5 lakh units per annum.
Its parent Suzuki Motor Corp. has also set up a facility in Gujarat. The first line with a capacity of 2.5 lakh units is in full production and the second one will be commissioned early next year.
Work has also started on the third line and the expected commissioning is early 2020. Maruti Suzuki is targeting annual production of 3 million units by 2025."

275,2018-12-25,Maruti,"Change is in the air for Maruti Suzuki's first car plant in Gurgaon that gave birth to the people's carand millennium city

New Delhi: In the second half of 2018, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd began thinking of life beyond Gurugram. It had become far too cumbersome to continue manufacturing cars in the middle of a city which had turned into a bustling megapolis in the blink of an eye. This marks the end of an era—Maruti’s spell in Gurgaon, which dates back to the early 1980s, is an ode to India’s economic transformation. 
New Delhi: In the second half of 2018, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd began thinking of life beyond Gurugram. It had become far too cumbersome to continue manufacturing cars in the middle of a city which had turned into a bustling megapolis in the blink of an eye. This marks the end of an era—Maruti’s spell in Gurgaon, which dates back to the early 1980s, is an ode to India’s economic transformation.
India of the early 1980s was a strange place. It was a time when the central government thought it knew how best to manufacture passenger cars; when defective fuel pumps in Maruti 800’s early fleet became a matter of parliamentary debate; and when India’s nascent forays into the realm of global automotive competence had to first bypass the pesky problem of dust (Maruti found its home in the southern edge of Delhi by keeping the air pressure inside the shop floor artificially higher than outside at all times).
For a long time, the existence of Maruti in 2018 was far from a certainty. That could be said about Gurgaon too, which began as a dusty, barren backyard of Delhi and got its initial boost by playing host to a spunky Indo-Japanese joint venture company which grew into one of the world’s largest small carmakers. With the birth of the millennium city and the ‘people’s car’ so entwined, it’s hardly surprising that the Gurgaon-based Maruti plant evokes much nostalgia. What Jamshedpur is to Tata Steel Ltd, Gurgaon is to Maruti.
Reminiscing about the good old days at a recent company event, Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said when Osamu Suzuki (of Suzuki Motor Co.) first came to visit the under-construction campus, he was quite taken aback to see it being overrun with monkeys. “He asked me how we would make cars here if the monkeys continue to be around?"" said Bhargava.
“I told Mr. Suzuki that Maruti is another name for Lord Hanuman and assured him that once manufacturing started, they will all leave the place. As predicted, the monkeys vanished once the plant was commissioned,"" he added.
That oft-repeated, possibly apocryphal story is a good yardstick for the myth and magic realism that has come to be associated with Maruti’s rise. However, the reality of modern-day, congested Gurgaon doesn’t leave much room for magic.
“When Maruti started making cars, there was no National Highway (NH) 8 and Gurgaon was a village. Today, if you take the NH 8 on a normal day, it is perennially chocked with traffic due to the truck movement that takes place between the plants of Maruti and its suppliers,"" said a person who has been associated with the carmaker since its inception, requesting not to be named. When residents in the vicinity began to repeatedly lodge complaints with the civic body, the writing on the wall was clear.
The existing factory in Gurgaon will probably still be used for manufacturing engines and testing vehicles. But new cars will no longer roll out of the campus."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to shut its diesel engine assembly plant in Gurgaon in the biggest sign yet of a grim future for diesel cars in India. The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit might either convert the diesel engine line in its Gurgaon plant to produce petrol engines or add an assembly line for petrol engines at its plant in Manesar, said three people directly aware of the development. Both the factories are located in Haryana. 
New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to shut its diesel engine assembly plant in Gurgaon in the biggest sign yet of a grim future for diesel cars in India. The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit might either convert the diesel engine line in its Gurgaon plant to produce petrol engines or add an assembly line for petrol engines at its plant in Manesar, said three people directly aware of the development. Both the factories are located in Haryana.
Maruti’s move highlights waning demand for diesel vehicles in India and its plans to aggressively tap the market for petrol and CNG cars, as well as ecofriendly hybrid cars and electric cars. India’s largest carmaker is expected to gain the most from a deepening partnership between its parent Suzuki and Toyota Motor Corp., which covers various areas—including the production of hybrid and electric cars.
Sale of diesel cars is expected to fall sharply in India once the more stringent Bharat Stage VI (BS VI) emission norms come into force from 1 April 2020. Upgrading of existing BS IV diesel engines to BS VI would make them much costlier, potentially affecting demand, said the people cited above.
Maruti currently assembles a 1.3-litre diesel engine sourced from Fiat in Gurgaon. The engine powers some of its highest-selling models such as Baleno, Vitara Brezza and Ertiga. The Gurgaon plant also makes an 800cc diesel engine, which has been developed in-house and is currently offered on Maruti’s Super Carry light truck.
The diesel assembly line in Gurgaon has a capacity of approximately 170,000 engines per annum. The automaker also produces Fiat’s 1.3-litre diesel engine at its Manesar factory, which has an annual capacity of around 300,000 units.
Meanwhile, Maruti plans to stop using the 1.3-litre diesel engine for its cars, replacing it with a 1.5-litre diesel engine developed in-house by Suzuki, the people said, requesting anonymity.
“In the long run, Maruti will not offer the 1.3-litre diesel engine any more and in the medium term, the diesel engine assembly line in Manesar will suffice for the demand in the market,"" said one of the three people cited earlier.
Maruti, like other carmakers, is witnessing a shift in customer preference for diesel cars, as they are considered more polluting than those that run on petrol. Diesel cars still cost more than petrol models, while the price differential between the two fuels has vastly narrowed in recent years.
Maruti didn’t respond to an email sent on Wednesday.
The share of petrol cars in India has risen from 47% in FY14 to 60% in FY18, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). During the same period, the share of diesel vehicles fell from 53% to 40%.
Suzuki has already started working on a full hybrid car for India and has earmarked a record $1.4 billion for research and development, the lion’s share of which will be deployed for the development of hybrid and electric cars in FY19. The company has also requested the Union government to expand the retail outlets for CNG, with sales of Maruti’s CNG vehicles growing 50% so far this fiscal.
Companies such as Groupe Renault SA and Daimler AG have reduced manufacturing of diesel vehicles in Europe as consumers move towards petrol, hybrid and electric cars. Maruti will become the first automaker in India to effect a significant cut in diesel car production after the BS VI norms are implemented.
“Globally, diesel as a fuel has come under regulatory scanner and urban buyers are informed about this. Hence, they are staying away from diesel vehicles,"" said Anil Sharma, associate director at market researcher MarketsandMarkets. “Also, with BS VI emission norms, per unit cost of developing diesel engines will rise significantly, which will be passed on to the consumers. As a result, the automakers are cutting down their diesel engine capacities.""
Last year, Maruti stopped offering the 800cc diesel engine option on its small car models, such as the Celerio, due to lower-than-expected sales.
The first person cited earlier said most carmakers in India were seeking to cut diesel vehicle production on expectations that demand would fall over the next couple of years.
In 2012, the board of Maruti decided to invest in the diesel engine plant in Gurgaon due to surging demand for diesel cars in India. In 2015, Maruti renewed its agreement with Fiat for the 1.3-litre diesel engine.
“Senior executives in Maruti are of the opinion that the diesel engine manufacturing capacity in Manesar will be enough for the company to cater to the demand in the coming years,"" the second person said on condition of anonymity. “Also, to convert an existing engine assembly line it takes a year and a half. So the reduction in diesel engines will not be immediate.""
R.C. Bhargava, Maruti’s chairman, said in a press conference on 19 December that the company was witnessing lower sales of diesel cars this fiscal, and would produce diesel cars based on customer requirements and market demand. The company, however, posted a 50% jump in sales of CNG vehicles so far in this fiscal, he said."

In March last year, the two Japanese companies had concluded a basic agreement for supplying hybrid and other vehicles to each other in the Indian market.
As per the agreement, Suzuki supplies premium hatchback Baleno and compact SUV Vitara Brezza to Toyota, while Toyota supplies sedan Corolla to Suzuki.
“In the second half of next fiscal, Toyota will launch its version of Baleno. There will be external tweaks for a different look but it will be more like the existing one,"" a source said.
When contacted Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM), the Indian arm of Toyota, it did not comment on the timeline for the launch.
“Under the Toyota-Suzuki tieup, each company will sell mutually supplied vehicles under their own respective brands and nameplates. Beyond that, at this point in time, we are not in a position to discuss further details such as vehicle specifications of our future product plans,"" Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice President Atsushi Oki told PTI.
He said Toyota will further boost its outlook on component localisation in support to “Make in India"" initiative to achieve cost effectiveness.
On how Toyota would position its version of Baleno in the market in terms of pricing, Oki said, “We understand the price sensitivity of Indian market. We will continue to keep up the price momentum in these directions. At this point in time, details on pricing are under discussion.""At present, Maruti Suzuki sells the Baleno in the price range of  ₹ 5.42 lakh and  ₹ 8.53 lakh.
Last week, Toyata and Suzuki agreed to expand the scope of their collaboration and discuss new joint projects in the fields of technological development, vehicle production, and market development.
Under the agreement, TKM would manufacture models developed by Suzuki for sale in India through their respective brand networks.
Moreover, the two firms are looking at cooperation in exports of models developed by Suzuki, including those produced by TKM, from India to Africa and other markets through their global sales networks.
In February 2017, Toyota and Suzuki had concluded a memorandum towards business partnership and since then, they have been exploring concrete projects for collaboration in areas including environmental technology, safety technology, information technology, and the mutual supply of products and components.
Subsequently, in November 2017 the companies announced an MoU to consider a cooperative structure for introducing battery electric vehicles in India around 2020.

269,2019-01-14,Maruti,"Showroom sales of Maruti Suzuki in December stood at around 220,000 units, which is 18.18% higher than in year-ago period

New Delhi: India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki Ltd, pumped up discounts last month, boosting December retail sales to its highest ever and considerably trimming its inventory. 
New Delhi: India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki Ltd, pumped up discounts last month, boosting December retail sales to its highest ever and considerably trimming its inventory.
Maruti’s showroom sales in December was around 220,000 units, 18.18% higher than around 180,000 units sold in the same month a year ago, according to two people aware of the development.
This is also the company’s highest ever retail monthly sales, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Like other carmakers in India, Maruti does not provide retail sales and counts despatches to dealerships as sales.
Maruti increased discounts as it wanted to start the new year with a lower inventory, the first of the two people said.
“Lots of customers postponed their vehicle purchases in 2018 because of the rise in petrol and diesel prices and the adverse impact of the NBFC (non-banking financial company) crisis on availability of credit and the decline in the stock market. Now, with such huge discounts being offered on every vehicle, customers realized it was the best time to buy a vehicle,"" this person said.
An email sent to Maruti Suzuki’s spokespersons on Friday remained unanswered. 
The meltdown at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd towards the end of last year led to a credit crunch among NBFCs, squeezing loans for retail borrowers including car buyers.
According to the people mentioned earlier, the company offered significant discounts on all products at its Arena and Nexa chain of dealerships, aided by a slight recovery in customer sentiment in the second half of December.
Among others, Maruti offered a  ₹ 25,000 discount on its compact SUV Vitara Brezza, one of India’s top-selling models with a waiting period of more than a month, said one of the two people cited earlier. On premium products such as the new Ciaz sedan and the S–Cross crossover, discounts ranged from  ₹ 70,000 to  ₹ 90,000. Maruti was already offering high discounts on Swift, Dzire and Baleno, among others, despite most of these cars being bestsellers in their respective sub-segments.
The sales feat comes at a time of slump and might have helped Maruti reduce inventory, but the effect of discounts is bound to show up in the company’s realization per unit in the October-December quarter.
According to the second person cited earlier, Maruti reports its sales figures to parent Suzuki Motor Corp. at the end of the year, and was forced to offer deep discounts since the second half of 2018 was quite a disaster for the automobile industry.
The company has corrected production of vehicles in the last two months and shut its plant for a week in December for annual maintenance.
“The January wholesale numbers that will be reported by the company will give an actual picture of the reduced inventory. Apart from the huge discounts, Maruti’s retail sales numbers also point towards the slight recovery in the customer sentiment,"" said the second person.
According to Avik Chattopadhyay, founder of brand consultancy firm Expereal, retail sales numbers in December have always been healthy due to the high discounts offered and also since customers don’t want to buy vehicles manufactured in the previous year as that would mean a 10-15% reduction in resale value.
“It is a good strategy adopted by the company because to sell these vehicles in 2019, the discounts required to attract customers would be almost double, since Indian customers don’t want to buy vehicles manufactured in the previous year unless discounts are steep,"" explained Chattopadhayay."

265,2019-01-26,Maruti,"Q3 profit numbers lagged estimates. Net profit fell to  ₹1,489.30 crore from  ₹1,799 crore a year agoNet sales rose by 1.99% year-on-year to  ₹19,668.3 crore

NEW DELHI :
Net profit at Maruti Suzui India Ltd, India’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer by sales, fell 17.2% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the December quarter, the company said on Friday, putting the result down to several negative factors coming together at once.
Net profit fell to  ₹1,489.30 crore from  ₹1,799 crore a year ago as retail automobile sales during the last festive season hit a six-year low amid increases in crude prices, insurance costs and high interest rates on vehicle loans. The bottomline was also hit by high commodity and staff costs, as well as mounting expenses for marketing new vehicles launched during the quarter.
Falling sales meant Maruti increased average discounts to  ₹24,300 per unit to move unsold vehicles piling up at dealers. The average discounts were  ₹19,200 per unit in the nine months from April to December in the same fiscal year. This, in turn, hit the financials and it missed Bloomberg’s net profit estimate of around  ₹1,731.90 crore.
Worsening macroeconomic factors saw the number of vehicles sold by Maruti Suzuki during the quarter fall by 0.6% y-o-y to 42,8643 units. As a result, net sales only rose by 1.99% y-o-y to  ₹19,668.3 crore.
With the sharp jump in expenses and flat growth in the top-line, profitability as measured by Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) declined by 36.5% y-o-y to  ₹1,910.5 crore and margins contracted by 590 basis points (bps) to 9.7% from 15.6% in the year-ago quarter. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
According to Ajay Seth, chief financial officer, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the third quarter was exceptional as all the negative factors impacted together.
“Some of the impacts are reversible and some of them need to be seen in the context of the market conditions. Discounts offered by the competition were much higher than what we offered. Now we have low inventory and, going forward, if the retail and wholesales match then this impact will come down,"" Seth said in a conference call with analysts.
Commodity costs increased by 400bps to 74% of net sales, while other expenses, including marketing and advertising for new products, increased significantly by 310 bps to 15%. As a result of a wage settlement in one of its manufacturing plants, employee cost rose by 110 bps to 4.7% of net sales, the car maker said.
Maruti Suzuki’s advertising cost went up because of the launch of a new SUV, the Ertiga, and a new version of hatchback WagonR. As result of the huge discounts, dealers released 90,000 units of unsold inventory in December. Consequently, the Delhi- based manufacturer started the January to March quarter with just 15 days worth of stocks with dealerships.
R.S. Kalsi, senior executive director, Maruti Suzuki, said although the domestic market is under pressure, there are signs of hope—the minimum support price for crops has been increased alongside a good monsoon, which may positively impact sales. “In the beginning of the year growth was expected to be 8% and till now it has been just 4% for the industry. For Maruti the volume growth has been around 7%. So we will outperform the industry,"" said Kalsi.
“Operating deleverage due to subdued volumes, increase in commodity prices, higher discounting, adverse forex movement led to steep drop in the margins. Given the weak operating performance, net profit dropped by 17% y-o-y and missed estimates by a huge margin. Going ahead, Maruti’s volumes and margins are likely to remain under pressure in near term as consumer sentiment continues to remain weak,"" said Bharat Gianani, research analyst, Share Khan.
The stock closed at  ₹6,516.35, down 7.40%, on BSE."

New Delhi: The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India Monday launched an updated version of its popular premium hatchback Baleno, priced between  ₹5.4 lakh and  ₹8.77 lakh.
The updated Baleno features a new sporty front grill with wider stance, apart from having precision cut smoked two tone 16 inch alloy wheels, Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) said in a statement.
Besides, it also has a new infotainment system with rear parking camera integration, navigation with live traffic and vehicle information, and alerts on the screen further add to the driving convenience, it added.
Commenting on the launch, MSI Senior Executive Director, Marketing and Sales R S Kalsi said, ""Keeping our customer centric philosophy at the core of product conceptualization, this new Baleno will further enhance the brand’s appeal"".
He said the Baleno has been a resounding success for Maruti Suzuki in the highly competitive premium hatchback segment.
""Recently, it has achieved another landmark in its journey by achieving a milestone of 5 lakh sales within a record time of 38 months,"" Kalsi added.
The Baleno continues to be available in both 1.2 litre petrol and 1.3 litre diesel engines options.

Maruti Suzuki shares fell more than 8% on Friday and hit a 52-week low. Note that some analysts have downgraded earnings estimates by as much as 8-10% each year for the next three fiscal years. A moot question is if this spells gloom for the country’s auto industry too.

Maruti Suzuki shares fell more than 8% on Friday and hit a 52-week low. Note that some analysts have downgraded earnings estimates by as much as 8-10% each year for the next three fiscal years. A moot question is if this spells gloom for the country’s auto industry too.
For investors, increasing competitive intensity, margin pressures and weak consumer sentiments are likely to keep excitement off the road for auto stocks for some time. After all, Maruti Suzuki is still the clear market leader and sets the tone for the rest of the industry.
While there were many reasons for the drop in margins, they all boiled down to one worrying factor—a slowdown in sales. To counter this and clear inventory with dealers, Maruti Suzuki offered a princely  ₹24,300 average discount per vehicle, the highest ever by the company. The discount was about 30-36% higher on a sequential and year-on-year basis. Clearly, the carmaker, which enjoys the country’s largest dealer network and product portfolio, struggled to sell its cars.
It goes without saying that the high discounts reflect stiff competitive business conditions for auto companies. Some analysts reckon that Maruti Suzuki has shifted into the slow lane, after unleashing a slew of products over the last three years. With competitors now gearing up for new launches and even reinventing the marketing strategy, competitive intensity may only increase. For instance, Tata Motors Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd are launching new products in the higher end, while Hyundai Motor India Ltd has plans to enhance its mid-segment. The moot question then is whether the situation will lead to market share erosion for Maruti Suzuki that outsells every other carmaker in the country today.
Heightened competition also implies that Maruti Suzuki’s marketing and advertising costs are likely to remain elevated for some time now. Note that the substantial increase in other expenses for the December quarter was led by higher marketing costs. That said, a small part of the margin contraction was due to one-time employee settlement expenses. Margin pressure led to a 36% year-on-year decline in earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).
But not all is lost. Falling raw material costs can bring some relief and Ebitda margin may inch up in the coming quarter from the December quarter levels. “But it is unlikely to regain the impressive 15-16% levels soon,"" says Prayesh Jain, executive vice president (auto and auto components) at Yes Securities Ltd.
It does appear like Maruti Suzuki has lost its mojo, which obviously has worrying implications for the sector as well. According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, “Unlike in FY15-18, most of its models are now available without waiting period. Most of the product gaps have been plugged too. This is likely to pressurise margin, unless demand revives.""
That said, Maruti Suzuki is not the lone ranger on this road. Both the industry and analysts have lowered FY19 growth estimates for passenger vehicles down to nearly 4.5% from 8% earlier. Weak demand and stiff competition could well put the car segment’s margins under pressure in the forthcoming quarters. Plus, fixed costs are expected to increase owing to the new technological changes to comply with new emission norms in a year from now.
The Maruti Suzuki stock currently trades at almost 21 times its estimated earnings for the next fiscal year, based on data from Bloomberg. Including the drop in the share price on Friday, the stock is 26% lower so far in FY19, suggesting poor confidence in the growth outlook for the both the company and the sector."
262,2019-02-01,Maruti,"Maruti, Hyundai, Mahindra and Tata Motors report flat growth or decline in wholesalesMost of the passenger vehicle manufacturers still have substantial inventory with dealers

Passenger vehicle manufacturers took to a cautious approach while dispatching vehicles to the respective dealerships in January, as retail sales continue to decline due to subdued customer sentiment across the country. The top four passenger vehicles manufacturers – Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd , Mahindra and Mahindra ltd and Tata Motors Ltd – reported flat growth or decline in wholesales in order to balance the inventory at dealerships.
The wholesales of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd--country’s largest vehicle manufacture – increased by 1% year-on-year to 140,600 units, indicating that all is not well for the automotive industry. Hyundai also reported a marginal increase of 0.6% y-o-y to 45,803 units in its wholesale dispatches.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd also saw its sales increase by just 1% y-o-y to 23,872 units while Tata Motors saw volumes decline sharply by 11% y-o-y to 17,826 units.
Honda Cars India Ltd has been the only exception since its sales increased by a whopping 23% y-o-y to 18,261 units.
“The first month of the new calendar year continues to be on an overall growth path. There is buoyancy in rural growth, commodity costs are levelling, fuel prices are coming down and we see improvement in forex movement, which in turn will drive positive customer sentiment,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, Mahindra and Mahindra.
Wholesales over the last two months have been under pressure since the automobile companies have been correcting the inventory piled up at dealerships since decline in customer sentiment resulted in worst retail sales in six year during the festival period of Navaratri and Diwali.
Most of the passenger vehicle manufacturers still have substantial inventory with dealers which will prevent them from pushing more wholesales on the dealers.
On the other hand, wholesales of commercial vehicles continue to decline as result of the liquidity crisis in non-banking financial corporations and introduction of the new truck axle norms which has increased the load carrying capacity of the vehicles.
Tata Motors Ltd--country’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturer--reported a staggering 9% y-o-y decline in sales to 11,694 units. Overall, sales of commercial vehicles also declined by 6% y-o-y to 37,089 units.
Ashok Leyland Ltd--country’s second largest commercial vehicle manufacturer--though reported a 13% increase in medium and heavy vehicle sales after double digit decline in the last two months.
“Domestic sales of commercial vehicles have dipped by 6% this month as compared to January 2018. The muted growth of the CV Industry is due to the low customer sentiments with the base effect also playing a role in the in H2 FY19 . Factors like higher interest rates and lagged effect of axle load norms continues to affect our MHCV segment with a drop of 9% in January 2019,"" said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicles, business unit, Tata Motors."
261,2019-02-04,Maruti,"Govt’s assurance of extending incentives to hybrids encourages carmakersThe carmakers are expected to initially offer the hybrid technology in locally produced midsize sedans

Suzuki Motor Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. have started developing strong or full hybrid cars for India and are expected to introduce them by the end of 2021, said two people with direct knowledge of the development.
The Japanese automakers have been encouraged by the Union government’s assurance that it will not differentiate between hybrid and electric vehicles while offering financial incentives to makers of eco-friendly vehicles.
The carmakers are expected to initially offer the hybrid technology in locally produced midsize sedans, the people cited above said, requesting anonymity.
Japanese companies have been mostly focusing on petrol-electric hybrids, despite a rising global trend towards battery-powered electric vehicles. The companies are now collectively lobbying the Indian government to extend financial incentives offered on electric vehicles to hybrid vehicles as well. They argue that hybrid vehicles are more fuel-efficient than those that run on petrol and diesel, while emitting substantially less carbon.
As part of its aim to curb rampant pollution in cities, the government plans to promote the local manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries that can be used for both hybrid and electric vehicles.
Toyota and Suzuki, as part of their partnership to develop hybrid vehicles for India, have started developing a common platform, primarily developed by Toyota and code-named GAC. The platform would be used by both companies to make their respective hybrid vehicles for India and other markets, the people said.
Honda has also finally decided on its plan to introduce hybrid vehicles in India and its first full hybrid vehicle would be the next generation City (a midsize sedan), the people said. They said the company had officially conveyed its plans to stakeholders associated with product development.
The next generation City model would be launched in India by 2020 with petrol and diesel engine options, followed by the hybrid variant in 2021, the people said.
“It makes sense for the company to introduce hybrid technology through its most popular product. Most of the Japanese players are working on making this strong hybrid technology affordable in India,"" said one of the two people cited earlier.
“We have plans to introduce hybrid vehicles in India within three years. It will take some time to make electric vehicles affordable and, until that moment, to contribute to a pollution-free society, I think hybrid will be the bridge to electric vehicles,"" Gaku Nakanishi, president and chief executive of Honda Cars India Ltd, said in an interview in October 2018.
Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and chief executive of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said in December that the company had started working on a strong hybrid vehicle for India.
A spokesperson for Honda Cars India declined to comment.
Suvranil Majumdar, project lead-electric mobility at International Finance Corp., said launching strong hybrids in India was a stop-gap arrangement for most of the Japanese companies until they successfully develop electric vehicles for Indian conditions.
“Most of these companies have electric vehicle strategy in place for India in the future. Hybrids are more efficient than diesel- or petrol-run vehicles, so they are trying to use hybrids as an intermediate step towards full electrification,"" said Majumdar.
The road transport and highways ministry has already recommended lowering of the goods and services tax on hybrid vehicles from the current 43%. The heavy industries ministry in its proposal for the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles in India (FAME) scheme wants to initially offer incentives for 10,000 hybrid vehicles.
According to the second person cited earlier, Toyota and Suzuki are working on how to make their hybrid cars more affordable for India and, now with the government changing its stance on hybrids, the companies are confident of securing incentives for their vehicles.
“It’s likely that both the companies will introduce this (hybrid) technology through a product in the sedan segment and (this) will be around 2021–2022,"" said the second person.
A spokesperson for Maruti Suzuki declined to comment. Atsushi Oki, vice-president of Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, declined to elaborate on the collaboration with Suzuki. “Details on each model such as the schedule of the start of supply, number of supplied units, vehicle specifications, etc. are currently under discussion,"" said Oki.
On 21 January 2019, Mint reported that Toyota and Suzuki were trying to reduce the cost of development of hybrid and electric vehicles by sharing development costs."
260,2019-02-06,Maruti,"Carmaker hopes CNG cars will account for 12% of sales by 2022, asks dealers to bid for pumpsMaruti plans to increase the sales of CNG vehicles, which will be followed by hybrid and electric models

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is doubling down on compressed natural gas (CNG)-powered vehicles as the nation’s largest carmaker steps up efforts to meet the upcoming fuel efficiency norms aimed at curbing extensive air pollution in major cities.
The Indian unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. has asked dealerships to bid for licences to set up their own CNG dispensing stations to keep pace with the company’s plan of selling about 200,000 CNG passenger vehicles annually by 2022 by introducing more models that run on the eco-friendly fuel, four people aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.
Maruti’s strategy to focus on vehicles that run on cleaner fuels stems from the Union government’s plan to introduce Bharat Stage VI emission norms in 2020 and subsequently stricter fuel efficiency rules in the second phase of the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms by 2022.
The norms require cars to become 10% or more fuel efficient between 2017 and 2021 and 30% or more fuel efficient from 2022. The mileage improvement will be decided on the basis of litres of fuel consumed by a vehicle to run 100km. CNG is regarded as an affordable way to meet the norms, especially with diesel coming under the scanner from the courts and authorities.
Maruti’s internal target of selling 200,000 CNG vehicles by 2022 will comprise about 10-12% of its annual sales, the people cited earlier said. The company has sold about half a million CNG cars between 2010 and 2018.
But with inadequate infrastructure for distributing CNG in India, Maruti wants its dealers to bid for licences to set up fuel retail outlets across the country, said the people.
“CNG vehicles will be beneficial in the short term and Maruti being the largest manufacturer with products in the portfolio will create an ecosystem with the help of other stakeholders,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director-vehicle sales forecasting at IHS Markit. “Since the vision of the government is also to build a huge network of CNG pumps across the country, Maruti’s plans seem to be in sync with the government.""
Some of Maruti’s products such as the Ertiga multipurpose vehicle, Swift hatchback and Dzire compact sedan might also be offered with CNG options, the people said.
Maruti currently offers seven models with CNG options, the most by any carmaker in India.
Other makers of CNG cars in India include Honda Cars India Ltd and Hyundia Motor India Ltd.
A spokesman for Maruti declined to comment.
The government, in its efforts to arrest rising air pollution levels, has also been urging auto makers to develop environment-friendly vehicles, and is expected to install 10,000 CNG stations by 2030.
Maruti had to expedite efforts to sell more CNG cars as it would otherwise be difficult to meet the stricter fuel efficiency norms in 2022, one of the people cited earlier said.
“The target to sell around 200,000 CNG vehicles every year by 2022 is not an ambitious one if the infrastructure improves across India,"" said the person cited above. “A lot of cities still don’t have access to CNG, which is the biggest impediment towards increasing sales of such vehicles."" 
Hence, Maruti plans to increase the sales of CNG vehicles, which will be followed by hybrid and electric models. Maruti’s parent, Suzuki, and Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. are collaborating on producing full hybrid cars, which are expected to be launched in India by the end of 2021.
“The company will not invest on behalf of the dealers since the dealers are profitable enough to invest in setting up CNG pumps on their own,"" the second person cited earlier said. “This move was an imperative for Maruti as it will not have substantial volumes from hybrid and electric vehicles by 2020 to compensate for the petrol and diesel vehicle production."" 
Currently, most of the CNG vehicles are used commercially by cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber.
According to the third person, CNG is more affordable than petrol and diesel and sales had zoomed after cab services and other public transport vehicles in the national capital region were made to compulsorily operate only CNG vehicles.
“If similar steps can be taken by other state governments, then Maruti stands to benefit with its existing range of CNG vehicles,"" said the third person cited earlier."

New Delhi: Govt is considering extending by four months a compliance deadline on tougher import rules for steel that are aimed at forcing automakers to use locally made alloy, said two sources familiar with the matter.
Compliance to the new rules had been set for February 17, which was an extension of two months, but strict adherence to the regulations would have stalled production for India's auto industry, a federal minister has warned.
India's auto manufacturing sector is dominated by Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Ford Motor Co.
Carmakers continue to rely on imports because they say local steel companies do not manufacture the grades they need, said Sugato Sen, deputy director general of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
SIAM counts Maruti Suzuki, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen, BMW and others as members.
Auto companies want an extension until the end of 2019.
""There are some grades that are not manufactured in India and we may allow those to be kept out of quality control for some more time,"" a senior steel ministry official told Reuters on condition of anonymity, as the discussions are not public.
The steel ministry did not immediately reply to a Reuters email seeking further comment.
The ministry had previously objected to an extension as it would delay Prime Minister Narendra Modi's drive to check imports. It also wants to show the success of its manufacturing programme, which is aimed at building a domestic industrial base to boost jobs and growth.

258,2019-02-15,Maruti,"Maruti’s talks with Suzuki include whether it should completely stop producing diesel cars in IndiaMahindra wants to offer petrol variants across models, barring the Bolero, says managing director Pawan Goenka

New Delhi/Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd are working on plans to gradually reduce dependence on diesel cars as regulations and market sentiment builds up against the use of the fossil fuel in India—home to some of the world’s most polluted cities.
Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest passenger vehicle maker, is in discussions with parent Suzuki Motor Corp. on the future of diesel cars in the country which include whether the company should completely cease producing diesel vehicles, said three people aware of the development. Instead, the company wants to expand its offerings of cars that run on compressed natural gas (CNG), the people said.
Meanwhile, Mahindra, which is heavily dependent on diesel vehicles, plans to start offering petrol engine options across its entire range, except the Bolero model, said Mahindra’s managing director Pawan Goenka. 
It is also contemplating whether to stop making light commercial vehicles, comprising products which run on small, one-cylinder diesel engines, said Goenka.
But unlike Maruti Suzuki, India’s second largest SUV maker will continue to offer diesel engines primarily because it feels consumer demand sustaining, especially for the large SUV models.
The moves by the automakers underscore a shift in demand towards petrol and other ecofriendly vehicles in India due to factors such as the narrowing price differential between petrol and diesel. Petrol was 17.2% costlier than diesel on 1 January 2018. The differential narrowed to just 7.1% on 13 February 2019.
Stringent government rules, especially the move towards stricter Bharat Stage-VI emission norms from 1 April 2020, are also making auto makers rethink their strategies. In addition, the corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) norms require vehicles to cut their emissions significantly and yet offer higher mileage. Diesel vehicles are at odds on these parameters.
The three people cited above said Suzuki is inclined towards completely stopping production of diesel cars in India and wants to invest significantly in CNG as an alternative fuel. Maruti is resisting the move since it will adversely hit sales. The two parties are yet to arrive at a consensus, the people said.
Mint had on 6 February reported that Maruti Suzuki has asked dealerships to bid for licences to set up their own CNG dispensing stations to keep pace with the company’s plan of selling about 200,000 CNG passenger vehicles annually by 2022 by introducing more models that run on the eco-friendly fuel.
A fourth person, and a parts supplier to Maruti, said Fiat India has informed Maruti that it will not be able to produce and supply 1.3 litre diesel engines after 31 March 2020 when the BS-VI norms are enforced. The 1.3 litre engine, which only meets the existing BS-IV norms, is used in Maruti models such as Swift, Ertiga, Baleno, S-Cross and Ciaz.
Maruti is, meanwhile, readying its own 1.5-litre BS-VI diesel engine that is expected to be launched this financial year. However, it may be a daunting task for the company to offer the engine across all its existing diesel vehicle models by the end of March 2020. Its development has been hit by several technical problems.
Maruti did not respond to emailed queries.
Goenka said having a petrol engine in the light commercial vehicle segment is not viable for operators owing to lower fuel efficiency compared with diesel, and if one adds the cost of developing a BS-VI engine.
“What happens post BS-VI is a question that everybody asks. I have said that for small SUVs, and small cars, probably there will be a significant switch towards petrol, but for large SUVs, I think it will be diesel. Where the line is drawn between mid and large, we do not know. A 1.2-litre engine will certainly become more petrol. A 2-litre engine will certainly be diesel. The 1.5-1.6 litre is on the edge and where it goes we don’t know,"" Goenka said.
As much as 20-30% of sales in the passenger car segment come from diesel engines, while the share is as high as 82% in SUVs. “Therefore, we started working long ago to ensure that after 2020 April, it does not matter to us whether the demand is for petrol or diesel. We will have good engines in both. In fact, we will probably have the freshest portfolio of engines in India with 1.2-litre, 1.5-litre and 2.2-litre engines. All three will come in diesel and petrol,"" Goenka said.
The factors which are forcing these changes go beyond the narrowing price differential between diesel and petrol, and extend to the rise of environment, social and governance (ESG) funds, wherein fund managers globally are reluctant to invest in companies that have exposure to any environmental risks. With the European Union making ESG funds mandatory in public markets, India, too, is catching up fast.
ESG investing constitutes investments that, while seeking positive returns, consider and evaluate the long-term impact that business practices have on society, the environment and the performance of the business itself.
Abhay Laijawala, managing director and fund manager at Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, which launched a $1 billion ESG fund last week, said an auto company, especially with exposure to diesel, runs high risk of regulatory action on air quality issues.
“So despite company meeting ESG criteria, we won’t have it in portfolio because it is a risk although it is a very good stock,"" Laijawala said."
257,2019-02-20,Maruti,"India has plans to set up 10,000 CNG distribution stations by 2030 to slash the usage of diesel and petrolMaruti Suzuki and Hyundai are lobbying with the government to promote CNG cars

New Delhi/Mumbai: India is preparing for a major thrust on the development and use of vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) in yet another effort to curb rising levels of vehicular pollution in its cities.
The government plans to use CNG and LNG as an alternative to both diesel and petrol until automakers develop efficient and affordable electric vehicles, as part of the move, according to the minutes of a meeting of a committee of secretaries in January, which was also attended by officials from the Prime Minister’s Office. The minutes were seen by Mint.
The commerce ministry’s department of industrial planning and promotion (DIPP) is working on ways to expedite security and other approvals needed from the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation (PESO) to set up new CNG and LNG retail outlets. The government has begun talks with commercial vehicle makers, through GAIL (India) Ltd, the country’s largest gas distributor, to incentivize the development of such eco-friendly vehicles.
The oil ministry is meanwhile partnering other ministries to prepare a road map to open more LNG and CNG pumps on highways and intra-city corridors.
Rajiv Kumar Mathur, executive director, corporate affairs and risk management, GAIL (India), said talks are on with commercial vehicle makers to encourage them to build facilities for LNG-based trucks and buses.
“The idea is to demonstrate that LNG-based automobiles are cost-effective and beneficial for anyone who buys them. So, we are trying to incentivise the manufacturers by saying that, if you manufacture them, we would buy them from you to tell the world that there is something that is more efficient,"" he said.
Petronet LNG Ltd, India’s largest importer of liquid gas, too has plans to set up an LNG eco-structure—infrastructure where there are gas-filling stations, service stations, and storage.
By creating an infrastructure, companies want to excite people to convert to LNG.
Creating the eco-structure will need an investment of around  ₹15,000 crore over the next decade. Petronet LNG, for instance, has identified 4,000km of highways (Delhi-Mumbai-Bengaluru-Chennai) where it would initially set up around 20 LNG re-filling outlets. Petronet last year roped in Gujarat to run 20 state buses and Kerala State Road Transport Corporation to run 10 of their buses on LNG.
Suvranil Majumdar, project lead, electric mobility, International Finance Corp., termed the move to encourage LNG and CNG vehicles as a short-term strategy and said in the long-term the government should focus on promoting electric buses in cities.
“This initiative to push more CNG and LNG vehicles is quite confusing for manufacturers as one should not expect them to invest in hybrid, electric and other alternative fuels at the same time. Now, the state governments have also firmed up policies to acquire electric vehicles within city limits. So, there shouldn’t be a shift in the long-term aim to move to zero emission vehicles,"" he said.
Companies such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd are focusing on CNG vehicles and have been lobbying with the government to promote such vehicles.
Mint had on 6 February reported Maruti Suzuki has asked dealers to bid for licences to open their own CNG dispensing stations to keep pace with the company’s plan of selling about 200,000 CNG cars annually by 2022 by introducing more models that run on the fuel. The government has announced plans to set up 10,000 CNG distribution stations by 2030 to slash the usage of diesel and petrol.

New Delhi: Tata Motors Ltd on Monday said it plans to launch a premium hatchback, named Altroz, in mid-2019. The production version of the Altroz, which was showcased as the 45X Concept at the Auto Expo 2018, will be unveiled at the upcoming Geneva Motors Show 2019, Tata Motors said in a statement.
The Tata Altroz will compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Hyundai i20 and Honda Jazz among others which are priced between  ₹5.45 lakh and  ₹9.34 lakh(ex-showroom Delhi).
The upcoming model will redefine the premium hatchback segment for the industry, Tata Motors president (passenger vehicles) Mayank Pareek said.
""We are excited to introduce this product to our customers and are gearing up for its commercial launch in mid-2019,"" he added.
The Altroz will be an amalgamation of futuristic design, advanced technology, class leading connectivity, thrilling performance and smart packaging, Pareek said.

255,2019-02-26,Maruti,"Most fleet operators do not want to pay a premium of over 20% for electric variants, finds a Maruti surveyThe next wave of growth in the automobile sector in the couple of decades ahead will come from shared mobility and electric vehicle

NEW DELHI :
Most fleet operators in India are unwilling to pay a premium of more than 20% for an electric variant of a vehicle compared to the cost of one running on an internal combustion engine, according to a survey conducted by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
Fleet operators would also prefer the vehicles to be fully charged within 45-60 minutes and have a range of 150-200km on a single charge in on-road conditions. The survey of 30 big customers in India, including Ola, Uber and Zoomcar, was carried out to understand their expectations about operating electric vehicles.
While higher cost of electric vehicles and inadequate charging infrastructure remain the biggest barriers for greater adoption, with battery costs dropping steeply as production scales, electric vehicles are expected to gain popularity among fleet operators.
A significant share of the total sales of Maruti Suzuki, which is expected to launch its first electric vehicle in 2020, comes from cab aggregators and commercial fleet operators. The company wanted to maintain its dominant position in the commercial segment through its electric vehicles in the decades ahead, two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
An email sent to Maruti Suzuki on Monday did not elicit a response.
The company had in December 2017 said that it would conduct a survey to gauge customers’ expectations from electric vehicles.
“It is quite obvious from the survey that cab aggregators wouldn’t want to pay a substantially higher price than that of a traditional vehicle and there should be no range anxiety since that would impact their business,"" said one of the two people cited earlier.
According to estimates of researcher IHS Markit, around 12% of the new vehicle sales in India by 2030 will be generated by taxi aggregators, which justifies Maruti’s focus on the needs of commercial fleet operators.
“Most fleet owners will not want to pay more than what they pay now. The 15-20% premium is also because the operational cost is comparatively low. Otherwise, no one would want to pay a penny more for electric vehicles in the commercial segment,"" said the second person. “Also, cab aggregators need simple but efficient vehicles with good mileage.""
The next wave of growth in the automobile sector in the couple of decades ahead will come from shared mobility and electric vehicles, according to Puneet Gupta, associate director (vehicle sales projection) at IHS Markit.
“Maruti being the undisputed leader in commercial channel sales will try to know what their big fleet customers expect to maintain their leadership position in the coming decade,"" Gupta said. “In fact, the new product development process of the company has been designed keeping in mind different aspects of shared mobility and the needs of retail customers. In the future, shared mobility will be a big chunk of new vehicle sales and none of the companies wants to walk away from the segment.""
Parent Suzuki Motor Corp. has started testing 50 units of the electric variant of its popular hatchback Wagon R in India that is set to be launched in 2020.
Cab operators are concerned about the on-road running capacity of the vehicles, according to the second person. The concern is more about the vehicle being able to run more than 150km in extreme traffic conditions, when a lot of clutch and brake use comes into play."

New Delhi: Wholesale despatches of automobiles across segments remained subdued in February as vehicle manufacturers cut production amid a slump in overall economic activity. Auto sales of major manufacturers were almost flat or declined in February while those of commercial vehicles fell because of a lack of credit and new axle norms.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, reported a 0.9% year-on-year growth in sales to 136,912 units. This is the third straight month in which the Maruti Suzuki’s vehicle production growth has stayed flat.
Mumbai-based Tata Motors Ltd also reported a meagre 2% year-on-year increase in sales to 18,110 units, while Honda Cars India Ltd reported a 16% y-o-y growth in dispatches to 13,527 units, but from a very low base. Toyota Kirloskar Motor India Ltd also reported a 0.87% decline in sales to 11,760 units during the month.
Among the top four passenger vehicle manufacturers, only Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd managed to grow vehicle dispatches by double digits as sales grew by 17% to 26,109 units because of the launch of its new compact utility vehicle XUV300.
“The month of February has augured well for Mahindra as we have witnessed a strong double digit growth of 16% in our utility vehicle portfolio, on the back of our newly launched XUV300 model. Further, the overall growth for the month has been around 10%. On a year-to-date basis too, we have shown a strong growth of 12% at an overall level,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive business) at Mahindra.
“Passenger vehicle sales remained muted in February 2019. Given high discounts and several new launches in the recent months, there are some signs of recovery at the dealership level. However, full recovery is still some time away. With the country entering an election phase, consumer sentiment will continue to remain cautious in the near term, which will weigh on the passenger vehicle demand,"" said Ashish Modani, assistant vice president, corporate sector ratings, Icra Ltd.
In the commercial vehicle segment, sales continue to remain muted as financing options remain limited for fleet owners, after the liquidity crisis in non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and the introduction of new axle norms for heavy and medium trucks.
The biggest commercial vehicle manufacturer in the country, Tata Motors, reported a 5% drop in sales to 39,111 units, while Ashok Leyland Ltd , the second largest manufacturer, saw volumes increase by just 1% to 17,352 units.
The medium and heavy truck sales of Tata Motors decreased significantly by 18% year-on-year to 12,437 units, while for Ashok Leyland it fell by 2% year-on-year to 12,874 units during the month.
“The market continues to exhibit subdued demand on the back of high interest rates, lagged effect of the implementation of revised axle load norms, and slowing economic activity, resulting in a decline of 5% in commercial vehicle sales volume,"" said Girish Wagh, president, commercial vehicle business unit, Tata Motors Ltd.
“The MHCV (medium and heavy commercial vehicles) segment has declined by 18%. However, our new product introductions with increased axle load norms is gaining traction as customers are seeing the clear advantages of the superior operating economics,"" he added.

250,2019-03-07,Maruti,"As consumers turn away from diesel cars, auto makers are redrawing their plans to prepare for a diesel-free future

New Delhi: When 29-year-old Arunima Bose’s family bought a car nearly five years ago, opting for diesel was a no-brainer. In the halcyon era of 2014, diesel variants were selling by the dozen, fuelled, in part, by a huge price difference between petrol and diesel. That era of diesel is about to hit a hard brake, and in such a dramatic fashion, that what happens to diesel might be the first tangible signs of the costs and pace of change associated with the world’s fastest growing economy’s push towards cleaner fuels.
Last month, Mint reported that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, is in discussions with its parent Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan on whether to stop development and production of diesel vehicles.
Automakers are, in part, being pushed by choices expressed by people like Bose. “I would want to consider an electric vehicle (EV) when I buy my next car,"" she says. “But I don’t think they will be affordable. So, petrol will be the preferred choice,"" adds Bose, who is a banking industry professional based in Kolkata.
As the Indian government has pushed through with stricter emission and fuel efficiency norms to deal with alarming pollution levels in most cities, vehicles with diesel engines may become a relic of the past by as early as the next decade. For automakers, the development cost of diesel powertrains or engines would almost double in the next five years, while the ever-narrowing price difference at the fuel pump will not make diesel cars a viable prospect for customers either.
India is set to embrace Bharat Stage (BS)-VI (equivalent of Euro 6) emission norms from 1 April 2020, while stricter fuel efficiency norms will kick in from 2022. Around the same time, Real Driving Emissions (RDE) tests will also be introduced, wherein greenhouse gas emission from vehicles will be tested in on-road conditions. According to industry executives and experts, these regulatory changes will sound the death knell for diesel as an engine fuel in India.
Uncertain environment
India is among the few large car markets in the world where diesel vehicles found significant traction and diesel vehicles constituted almost 60% of the total sales till about a few years ago as the price of diesel was regulated by the government and the difference in price between diesel and petrol was quite significant. Ever since diesel prices were left to be decided by market forces, customers started shifting towards petrol-driven vehicles in droves. Almost 70% of the sub-four-metre vehicles (small cars) sold at present in the domestic market run on petrol engines.
According to R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, electrification is the only option for light commercial vehicles while heavy vehicles like buses can be electrified or might run on liquefied natural gas (LNG), depending on the development and operational costs. “When converted to BS-VI [standards], the cost of a diesel engine will increase by almost  ₹1.25 lakh to  ₹1.5 lakh. Overall, the difference in price of a diesel and petrol vehicle will be almost  ₹2.5 lakhs. Then, what do you expect the customers to do? CNG (compressed natural gas) can be a replacement for both diesel and petrol and is already in use,"" Bhargava said.
Essentially, BS-VI would upturn the cost dynamics completely. As the acceptable standard of fuel pipe emission changes, individual car users will be forced to pay a portion of the cost of keeping the air cleaner. And that simple regulatory change will alter the economics of what is “cheap"".
If diesel survives, its refuge would be in segments like the bigger sport utility vehicles (SUVs) or multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs), since customers at higher price points would not be constrained by the affordability factor.
“Diesel has been a fuel of choice because it is cheaper and the fuel economy was better. Today, to make a diesel engine BS-VI complaint is not very difficult but the cost of development is going to be much more expensive compared to a gasoline engine,"" said Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director, sales and marketing, Honda Cars India Ltd.
“And with RDE coming in, this cost will go up even further. Hence, the attractiveness of diesel engines will further go down and I assume that will have some kind of an impact on the share of diesel because even now, the share of diesel cars has been progressively coming down in the last three years,"" explained Goel.
Global impact
These anticipated changes in the Indian market will leave an inevitable ripple effect on the rest of the world. Apart from India being a major auto component manufacturer, Indians also buy an estimated three million cars every year (or about six new ones every minute). The changing cost dynamics and the Indian consumer’s shifting preferences will leave a significant global imprint, particularly on the small car market.
Nearly three-fourths of cars sold in the country are small cars and the segment is also the most price sensitive. And globally, this is the segment that is expected to be at the vanguard of the push toward petrol or CNG in the short term and to hybrid or electric technologies in the long run.
“What happens post BS-VI is a question that everybody asks,"" said Pawan Goenka, managing director (MD) of Mahindra and Mahindra, in an interview to Mint in February. “Where the line is drawn between mid and large, we do not know. A 1.2-litre engine will certainly become more petrol. A 2-litre engine will certainly be diesel still. The 1.5-1.6 litre is on the edge and where it goes we don’t know,"" he added.
According to a senior engineer with one of the automobile companies, after the introduction of new regulations, the total demand for diesel vehicles may come down to just 15-17% of the new vehicle sales. “Diesel will not be dead though it will be marginalized. In Europe as well, after the implementation of the Euro 6 emission norms, diesel demand nosedived in the hatchback and entry-level SUV segment and the same will happen in India. Diesel engines complying with BS-VI norms though will be as environment-friendly as petrol,"" he added, requesting not to be identified.
Premium carmakers like Mercedes Benz, AB Volvo, BMW—the ones with a heavy diesel portfolio—have also committed a substantial percentage of their sales in the next decade from electrified cars as customers in the higher echelon have become extremely sensitive to investing in technology that is considered environment-friendly.
Apart from automakers and customers, certain hedge funds and foreign portfolio investors have also become wary of buying stocks of companies which will have too much exposure to diesel in its portfolio in the years to come, since it is considered a pollutant.
Pressure to go clean
A recent Greenpeace and AirVisual analysis of air pollution readings from 3,000 cities around the world found that 22 of the world’s 30 worst cities are in India. “This has an impact not only on citizens’ health but also on the country’s economy,"" said Suvranil Majumdar, project lead, electric vehicles, International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank Group. The push to reduce the number of polluting internal combustion engines is understandable, he said.
Diesel vehicle demand and sales hit a major roadblock when the Supreme Court banned the registrations of vehicles with diesel engine size of 2 litres and above in the National Capital Region, taking into consideration the alarming levels of pollution. The National Green Tribunal also restricted the use of diesel vehicles to ten years.
The union government is also trying to promote CNG-driven vehicles as an alternative to diesel in the short term until an ecosystem for EVs develops. By 2030, the union government will install 10,000 CNG pumps across the country to reduce the shortage of retail outlets. Through its public sector units like Gas Authority of India Ltd, the government also wants to promote the usage of LNG-based commercial vehicles.
On the back of such a hostile regulatory environment against diesel vehicles, automakers have justifiably taken a very cautious approach towards investing in the development or procurement of diesel engines of varying sizes in their future product portfolio.
The global demonization of diesel technology amplified when diesel vehicles manufactured by the German auto giant, Volkswagen AG, were caught flouting emission norms by using a cheat device in leading markets across the world in 2015. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker was caught cheating in India as well but the local emission norms were not as stringent as the developed markets of the US and Europe.
The checks on polluting diesel have only heightened since the scandal. Given the limited room to manoeuvre, it is hard to see a future for diesel in India, said Sumit Sawhney, former MD, Renault India Ltd.
The Electric Future
According to a recent Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) report on EVs sales outlook, sales of internal combustion engine-driven vehicles will start declining across markets from 2020, as EVs will gradually start getting more affordable. The upfront cost of developing EVs will become competitive on an unsubsidized basis starting 2024.
“Our latest forecast shows the sale of EVs increasing from a record 1.1 million worldwide in 2017 to 11 million in 2025 and then surging to 30 million in 2030, as they become cheaper to make than internal combustion engine cars. China will lead the transition, with sales accounting for almost 50% of the global EV market in 2025,"" the report said.
The year 2020 will be a landmark one in India’s nascent push towards cleaner fuels. In all likelihood, BS-VI will mark the beginning of the end of diesel vehicles in India. And caught up in an uncertain world environment where the Donald Trump administration in the US is hell-bent on rolling back stringent Obama-era fuel emission norms, a European Union which seems to be willing to pay any cost for cleaner air, and a China that wants to become the global leader in EVs, India’s industry as well as government will be forced to make several hard calls.

New Delhi: Honda Cars India Ltd has taken a detour from the industry-wide focus on churning out SUVs and is betting big on sedans to try and restore its lost glory in the Indian car market. The company is bringing back the Honda Civic, the premium sedan that is also Honda’s biggest seller worldwide, to complete its portfolio of sedans.
Honda’s attempt to regain market share started with the launch of the new version of its compact sedan, the Honda Amaze, which drew customers despite the overall demand in the domestic market falling significantly after September 2018.
The rationale behind bringing back the Civic is to give more options to existing customers of Honda’s most popular Indian product, the mid-sized sedan Honda City, and bolster the company’s portfolio in the premium segment.
Customers are moving towards SUVs, but the launch of the 10th generation Honda Civic has seen the sedan become Honda’s largest selling car globally, especially in the US, overtaking some of Honda’s SUVs, said Rajesh Goel, senior vice-president and director, sales and marketing, Honda Cars India Ltd.
“With the Civic we have a complete line up of the sedans starting with the Amaze and ending with the Honda Accord, though the volumes are very limited in that segment. The sedan volumes in India are still more than the SUVs. Yes, the growth rates are higher in SUVs but in the future also there will be a market for sedans,"" said Goel. “If you look at the global markets, there has been a trend towards SUVs but that doesn’t mean sedans have faded away,"" he said.
Honda has sold 71,059 units of the 2018 Honda Amaze in India in the current fiscal year. Honda City sales declined 27.7% year-on-year to 34,367 units, as a result of the launch of the new generation Maruti Suzuki Ciaz and Hyundai Verna.
Honda’s faith in its sedans for the domestic market is underpinned by the fact that almost a third of the customers of Honda Amaze are first-time buyers.
None of the other vehicle manufacturers, barring the premium ones, have a product portfolio comprising four sedans of different price points and sub-segments. Most of them are investing in developing products such as premium hatchbacks and compact utility vehicles.
Honda’s next generation City is scheduled to hit the Indian markets by 2020 while the full hybrid option is expected to be launched in 2021.
“Our most important product in India has been the City and we had to previously discontinue the Civic because of ‘dieselization’. Also, our Tapukara plant had not been established by then. So we had to focus on the production of the Amaze. So the Civic got discontinued. It was kind of unfair on our part to not offer a natural upgrade to the customers of City who have been our longest-standing and most loyal customers,"" Goel said.
“The strategy to focus on offering a complete range of sedans makes sense for Honda as the demand for sedans still exists, though the growth rate for utility vehicles is much higher at present. For Honda, the customers of City don’t have any choice if they want to upgrade. So the Civic, if priced properly, will help the company retain some of its most loyal customers,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, vehicle sales forecasting, IHS Markit."
248,2019-03-13,Maruti,"Toyota Kenya will sell Suzuki's Alto, Swift, Ciaz, Vitara Brezza and the Jimny through its dealershipsThe vehicles, sporting the Suzuki badge, will be made at Suzuki’s factories in India, Japan and Hungary

New Delhi: Toyota Motor Corp. on Tuesday said it will start selling Suzuki Motor Corp.’s passenger vehicles in Kenya, expanding a tie-up the two Japanese companies made for the Indian market two years ago. A statement on Toyota Kenya’s website said it will retail five car models made by Suzuki through its dealerships in Kenya.
These are the small car Alto, hatchback Swift, mid-size sedan Ciaz, compact utility vehicle Vitara Brezza and a small sport utility vehicle Jimny.
The vehicles will retain the Suzuki badge.
The vehicles will be produced at Suzuki’s factories in India, Japan and Hungary.
“Toyota Kenya has announced a business partnership with Suzuki Motor Corp. and the partnership will see initial five Suzuki models being sold under the Suzuki brand by Kenya distributorship. Toyota has also entered into partnerships with leading banks to offer up to 90% financing with easy payment terms, pocket-friendly monthly instalments and a loan period up to five years,"" the statement said.
Last year, Toyota and Suzuki had announced both companies will jointly explore the African markets, and this business arrangement will be the first step in that direction.
At present, Toyota is the largest vehicle manufacturer in Africa, but it is known for its bigger utility vehicles. Selling Suzuki’s hatchbacks and sedans expands its portfolio, and the arrangement can be repeated in other African countries as well.
Toyota and Suzuki have joined hands to develop hybrid cars and small electric cars together for the Indian markets. They have also agreed to sell each other’s vehicles in India. As part of the process, Toyota will sell Suzuki’s Vitara Brezza and Baleno under its own badge, while Suzuki will sell the Corolla sedan.
Suzuki will start supplying the Baleno to Toyota from the next fiscal year.
Avik Chattopadhayay, founder of Expereal, a brand consultancy firm, said Suzuki has a weak position in markets like Africa but will help Toyota complete its product portfolio and will help it to compete with Chinese and other manufacturers in the lower price point segment.
“This is a win-win situation for both companies. Toyota’s presence is there at a higher price point and Suzuki will be the so-called fighter brand for Toyota in the continent. Toyota because of its portfolio and cost will not able to cater to customers at a price point where Suzuki can. Toyota can get a lot of customers into Suzuki and later upgrade them to Toyota,"" Chattopadhayay said."

245,2019-03-19,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki offers additional liquidity to dealers already saddled with increasing inventoryMargins have been increased by  ₹3,000 per vehicle on Maruti Suzuki's Dzire, Swift and Vitara Brezza

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the nation’s top carmaker, has boosted dealer margins for three of its best-selling cars, underscoring a weak domestic car market and increase in operational expenses at its dealerships saddled with rising inventory.
Margins have been increased by  ₹3,000 per vehicle on Maruti’s Dzire (a compact sedan), Swift (a hatchback) and Vitara Brezza (a compact sport utility vehicle), said three people with direct knowledge of the development.
The step by Maruti Suzuki took effect in January and is expected to offer additional liquidity to dealerships at a time when demand has dropped. The dealers are also facing a credit squeeze after the crisis at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) triggered a liquidity crunch in India’s banking system.
With auto sales slowing since September, dealerships are grappling with unsold stocks even as their operating expenses continued to swell.
To be sure, Maruti Suzuki is the first among India’s top carmakers to lift dealer margins, though the step can be a drag on the company’s profit margins. Maruti Suzuki also increased car prices from 1 January.
The first person cited above said the company is trying to help its dealers at a time of weak demand. “The dealers have been offering huge discounts and inventory has again piled up in February,"" the person said, requesting anonymity. The companies “thought that revival has started from December and January after a bit of a pick-up in retail sales but February sales have slumped again,"" said the person.
A spokesperson for Maruti Suzuki did not respond to emailed queries sent on Monday.
Retail car sales in India fell 8.25% from a year earlier in February to 215,276 units, the sharpest so far this fiscal year, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), an industry body which tracks retail vehicle sales in India. Maruti has also trimmed its sales growth forecast for this fiscal year to 8% from a more than 10% growth forecast at the start of the year.
In January, Maruti dispatched 18,795 Swift cars and 19,073 Dzire cars from its factories to dealerships. It also dispatched 13,172 Vitara Brezza SUVs, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). Based on the January sales performance, the decision to increase dealer margins on the three models would cost Maruti about  ₹15 crore per month.
Puneet Gupta, associate director at researcher IHS Markit, said it is possible for Maruti Suzuki to offer higher dealer margins since it is financially stronger than its rivals although the step would impact the company’s profit in the short term. “As vehicle sales have fallen sharply, this is a way to incentivize dealer partners since they have to maintain high inventory. Automakers in adverse times help their respective dealers and component suppliers when the demand falls in the market,"" said Gupta.
Maruti dealers are also facing rising cost of setting up new showrooms and service centres as well as running existing establishments especially in metro and Tier 1 cities. The dealers have, therefore, been demanding an increase in their margins to enhance their profitability.

The second person cited above said overall operating cost has risen significantly in terms of employee salaries and rent paid for real estate. So, this is also another reason behind the increase in margin.
“This step taken may not have a huge adverse impact on the financials of the company since the prices of the vehicles have also been increased over the last one year. Hence, there won’t be a significant impact,"" explained the person. The person said Dzire, Swift and Vitara Brezza comprise almost 35%-40% of Maruti’s sales volume, and the latest measure would help to stabilize financial health of the dealerships.
Also read | Has Maruti Suzuki lost track or is it the whole car industry?
“Maruti’s dealers were not used to maintaining high level of inventory and operational expenses have also increased due to the increased number of unsold stocks. Also, Maruti wants the dealers to pass some part of this on to the customers as offers,"" said the person requesting anonymity.
With the new incentive, dealer margins on the Dzire, Swift and Vitara Brezza has increased to 8-8.5% from around 6-7% previously, said the third person cited above.
To adjust to the falling retail demand, Maruti Suzuki cut production of vehicles in all its three plants from December.

The higher dealer margin, however, trails Maruti Suzuki’s tepid financial results in the December quarter when it posted a 17% drop in profit due to factors such as weak sales, higher commodity costs and marketing spend.
Average discount on Maruti Suzuki cars increased to  ₹24,300 per unit in December quarter. In comparison, the average discount was  ₹19,200 per vehicle during April-December 2018.

244,2019-03-20,Maruti,"Toyota, Suzuki also plan to produce electric vehicles and compact cars for each other to compete better in the auto industryToyota is helping Suzuki to develop and market electric cars in India, while Suzuki helps Toyota increase its presence here

Nagoya: After cross-badging of the Baleno hatchback and Corolla sedan, Suzuki will produce two compact models for Toyota in India based on its Ciaz and Ertiga models, the Japanese carmakers said on Wednesday, in extension of an alliance announced in 2017. Suzuki will also supply Toyota with petrol engines for compact cars to be sold in Europe.
Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. also plan to produce electric vehicles and compact cars for each other to better compete with fast-changing technologies in the global auto industry.
The agreement builds on a Toyota-Suzuki alliance announced in 2017 under which Toyota is helping Suzuki to develop and market electric cars in India, while Suzuki helps Toyota increase its presence in the fast-growing Indian market.
According to the latest agreement, Suzuki will source hybrid systems for cars it sells worldwide from Toyota, which pioneered hybrid vehicles with the Prius more than 20 years ago, the companies said in a joint statement.
Suzuki's hybrid vehicles for the Indian market will be made using engines and batteries locally produced by Toyota. In addition, Toyota will produce electric vehicles based on its RAV4 SUV crossover and Corolla wagon for Suzuki in the European market.
Suzuki will also produce its Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz, and Ertiga models for Toyota to sell in Africa."
243,2019-03-21,Maruti,"Toyota and Suzuki will also jointly develop a Toyota minivan that will be supplied to Suzuki in IndiaToyota and Suzuki seek to popularize hybrid-electric vehicles in India by sourcing of systems, engines and batteries locally

New Delhi: Suzuki Motor Corp. will use a factory of Toyota Motor Corp. in India to make its compact sport utility vehicle (SUV), Vitara Brezza, from 2022 as the Japanese auto makers deepen their ties in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
The two companies will also seek to popularize ecofriendly hybrid-electric vehicles through sourcing of systems, engines and batteries locally. The auto makers will also jointly develop a a Toyota minivan that will be supplied to Suzuki in India.
“Moving forward, in so far as Toyota and Suzuki continue to fairly and freely compete against each other, both companies intend to consider further collaboration to realize a sustainable future mobility society while respecting all applicable laws,"" the companies said in a joint statement.
Toyota and Suzuki announced their partnership in May last year to develop affordable hybrid and electric vehicles for the Indian market. Both later decided to broaden the ambit of their alliance by agreeing to sell specific models of each other under their own brand names through their dealership networks. 
Suzuki will supply its Baleno hatchback and Vitara Brezza SUV to Toyota, while the former will get to sell the Corolla sedan.
Both companies on Wednesday announced plans to take their alliance to the global level, as part of which Toyota can use Suzuki’s vehicles as affordable, entry-level products in markets where the world’s largest auto maker has a negligible presence.
Under the expanded partnership, Suzuki will supply its Ciaz mid-size sedan and Ertiga minivan to Toyota’s unit in India. Also, Toyota will share its “Toyota Hybrid System"" with Suzuki for joint development of hybrid vehicles.
Toyota and its unit, Denso Corp., will meanwhile work with Suzuki to adopt newly developed Suzuki engines for compact vehicles. The engines will be manufactured at Toyota’s plant in Poland. Meanwhile, models such as the Baleno, Vitara Brezza, Ciaz and Ertiga will also be exported to Africa by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, where they will be retailed by Toyota dealerships.
The two firms also agreed for Toyota to supply two hybrid-electric vehicles to Suzuki in Europe, which will be based on Toyota’s Rav4 and Corolla Wagon vehicle platforms.
On 14 September last year, Mint reported that Toyota’s local unit, Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, is studying the feasibility of making Suzuki vehicles at its second factory on the outskirts of Bengaluru.
The step to make Suzuki vehicles at Toyota’s plant will help boost capacity utilization. That plant currently churns out models such as the Etios Liva and Etios cars, as well as the Yaris sedan, sales of which have remained subdued.
In addition, Toyota’s move to sell two more Suzuki vehicles can let it grow its modest market share in India’s passenger vehicle industry. Toyota had a 4.31% share of India’s 3.08 million domestic market as of end-February, compared with 51.08% for Maruti Suzuki India, the country’s largest carmaker.
Toyota last week announced that it had begun selling models such as the Alto, Swift, Ciaz and Ertiga under the Suzuki brand in Kenya and the pact would be expanded to other key markets in Africa.
Hybrid technologies would play a huge role in many markets, Toyota president Akio Toyoda said in a statement.
“Through our new agreement, we look forward to the wider use of hybrid technologies, not only in India and Europe, but around the world. At the same time, we believe that the expansion of our business partnership with Suzuki—from the mutual supply of vehicles and powertrains to the domains of development and production—will help give us the competitive edge we will need to survive this once-in-a-century period of profound transformation. We intend to strengthen the competitiveness of both our companies by applying our strong points and learning from each other,"" Toyoda said.
“At the time we announced our scope of cooperation in May last year, I spoke that we will strive for success globally,"" said Suzuki chairman Osamu Suzuki. “I have seen progress in the partnership since then, and it is my pleasure to be able to make this announcement today regarding the status of partnership on a global basis, including Europe and Africa. In addition, we appreciate the kind offer from Toyota to let us make use of their hybrid technology. We will continue our utmost efforts.""
The focus on developing hybrid vehicles also points towards the lack of expertise of Japanese companies in the domain of electric vehicles when compared to their Chinese or South Korean competitors.
Suzuki, along with Denso and Toshiba Corp., has formed a joint venture to establish a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat for hybrid vehicles."
241,2019-03-25,Maruti,"Fitch has cut India GDP growth forecast for FY20 to 6.8%—a mere reflection of the slowdown in auto and FMCG sectorsHeavyweights in both the industries—Maruti Suzuki and Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) have a lacklustre outlook on sales

""No winter lasts forever; no spring skips its turn,"" said Hal Borland, a US writer and naturalist. But as far as the Indian economy’s prospects go, it seems to be a prolonged winter this time around, with spring nowhere in sight.
Fitch Ratings has cut India GDP growth forecast for FY20 to 6.8% from 7% in December.
Of course, India isn’t alone. Fitch has lowered growth forecasts for 15 countries, and has cut its global growth forecast for 2019 to 2.8% from 3.1% earlier.
For India, the revision in GDP growth forecast is a mere reflection of the slowdown in several industries such as automobiles and consumer goods. What’s more, there have already been telltale signs of weakness in consumption demand in India.
“A consumption slowdown is underway and a part of it was led by the liquidity crunch in the NBFC (non-banking financial company) space and its impact has been lingering,"" said Tanvee Gupta Jain, chief India economist at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd. “The UBS India-Financial Conditions Index suggests growth momentum could remain sluggish in the March quarter and real GDP growth could range from 6.2% to 6.5% year-on-year, versus 6.6% in the December 2018 quarter.""
For instance, carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd reported flat sales for February compared to those a year earlier. News reports suggest Maruti Suzuki has cut production for this month by as much as 27% year-on-year.
Sales of tractors and two-wheelers have been weak, too.
Likewise, fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) major Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) recently put a check on analysts’ expectations.
“There is some concern on demand as industry growth rates are moderating. This is in contrast to the earlier quarter, where commentary was that demand conditions are stable,"" CLSA analysts said in a note to clients on 15 March, based on their interaction with the HUL management. Analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd say their research suggests sustained demand weakness across the consumer durables space, with increased cashback schemes resulting in some volume offtake.
“The data suggests this cyclical slowdown could extend until the June 2019 quarter, before it starts to recover,"" said Jain. Economists at Nomura concur. “The latest prints of concurrent indicators seem to suggest that the March quarter will mimic the December quarter, but with deterioration also spreading to services, industrial and investment demand. This is also corroborated by Nomura’s proprietary leading indicator, which points to a continued moderation,"" economists at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note on 21 March.
The hope, of course, is that the situation will improve after the general election results are out and the new government takes charge. “Consumption-linked data might get worse in the interim before it improves. We may be in the last two quarters of a consumption slowdown,"" said Sahil Kapoor, chief market strategist at Edelweiss Professional Investor Research.
As pointed out earlier, one of the main reasons for the slowdown in consumption demand is the liquidity crisis at NBFCs that started when Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted last year.
“The flow of funds from the corporate bond and commercial paper market into the NBFC space is slowing down decisively from around 25% per annum CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over FY14-18 to an expected rate of around 8% per annum over FY18-21,"" said Ritika Mankar Mukherjee, senior economist at Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd. This means NBFCs are lending at a slower pace and that too at higher rates, as they pass on the increase in their cost of funding. 
To be sure, the Reserve Bank of India is expected to do its bit to boost consumption. UBS’s Jain foresees a cumulative repo rate cut of 75-100 basis points (bps) in this cycle. This includes the 25 bps easing announced in February. But then, transmission of reduced rates by banks is easier said than done, as pointed out in a Mark to Market column. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Also, as Nomura’s economists point out, “Fiscal and monetary policies are turning expansionary but are unlikely to change the near-term trajectory.""
Apart from domestic growth concerns, the Indian economy has to contend with the global slowdown, which is hurting exports.
Again, the farm income support scheme of  ₹6,000 a year for around 120 million households could help increase rural consumption, but only to a limited extent. In short, there’s no magic wand. It could be a few quarters for this measure to yield the desired results.
Despite this, consumption-focused stocks, especially FMCG, continue to trade at expensive valuations. But sooner or later, a cocktail of these heady mixes will prove to be nauseous, at the least giving valuations a reality check."

New Delhi: JTEKT Corp., one of Japan’s biggest auto parts makers, expects as much as four-fold increase in the revenue share from India following the merger of two local units to create a bigger entity. Hidekazu Omura, chairman, JTEKT Group India, said Indian operations comprise just 2.2% of the parent’s overall revenue and JTEKT would like to see the figure grow to 5% in the medium term and 10% in the long term.
“We would like to manufacture more in India and have also invested in a technical centre so that research and development (R&D) of India-specific products can be done here. We would also like to supply to the other markets from here,"" Omura said.
The merged entity is expected to clock a revenue of  ₹1,750 crore in this fiscal year, increasing it to  ₹2,000 crore in the next few years, according to senior executives of the company.
On 16 March, the board of JTEKT India Ltd approved a share allotment proposal to absorb JTEKT Sona Automotive India Ltd to focus more on investing in research and development of its products in the automotive steering business, optimum utilization of assets and manpower, and cater to demands of vehicle manufacturers.
The merger comes at a time when the domestic automotive market is expected to witness drastic changes in regulations.
Auto makers are also urging their vendors to invest more in research and development and strengthen their financials to keep pace with the changes in the auto industry and sustain their businesses.
JTEKT India started manufacturing automotive steering systems with India’s Sona Group in 1985 and was one of the first component makers to supply to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd when it opened its Gurugram plant.
In 2017, JTEKT took a majority stake after buying 25.1% stake in Sona Koyo Steering Systems Ltd held by the Sona Group and later renamed it JTEKT India.
Sudhir Chopra, director corporate affairs and company secretary, JTEKT India, said the upcoming technical centre will be the first major investment by the company in India for research and development.
As of now, a large chunk of the R&D related work is done in Japan and with the new technical centre, the Indian unit’s reliance on the parent company will be reduced.
JTEKT India is also exploring options to build a factory in Gujarat near Suzuki Motor Corp.’s existing plant, said a senior executive of the company."
240,2019-03-27,Maruti,"There are concerns the Toyota-Suzuki alliance will cannibalize sales of some of Maruti’s premium cars, like the Baleno, Ciaz and BrezzaUnlike in mature markets where brand loyalty is high, India’s passenger vehicle market is just evolving

Investors dislike uncertainty. The collaborative effort between Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. to cross-badge cars has led to ambiguity for Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. What’s more, it comes when demand for passenger vehicles in the country is already subdued.
Not surprisingly, the Street has punished the stock. Maruti Suzuki shares are down 34% from the 52-week high of  ₹9,929. The one-year forward price-earnings multiple fell from a steep 30-32 times a year ago to 23, which happens to be the five-year average for the stock.
Analysts’ latest worry is the implications of the Toyota-Suzuki tie-up for Maruti Suzuki, which will gain from Toyota’s technological expertise in hybrid and electric vehicles, without having to spend on development costs.
But what about the flip side, where Suzuki has agreed to cross-badging of vehicles? Maruti Suzuki will share 25-30% of its products by volumes with Toyota (see chart) in this cross-badging exercise. The company’s premium sedan Baleno, which accounts for about a fifth of total sales volumes, will also roll out with the Toyota badge in the next few months. This is not all. Other premium vehicles in Maruti Suzuki’s basket such as Ciaz and Vitara Brezza will also come under the grand alliance.
In return, the company will launch Toyota’s Corolla about a year from now, which may push sales volumes for Maruti Suzuki, riding on Corolla’s brand equity.
The moot question, however, is if the Toyota-Suzuki partnership will cannibalize sales of Maruti Suzuki’s premium products. Under cross-badging, companies come together to sell a vehicle under different brand names, with some small cosmetic changes. Developmental costs of new models are minimized while brand identity is also retained.
However, past experience hasn’t been very encouraging. Collaborations of Nissan-Renault, Volkswagen-Skoda and some others have not fared well in India. “It will lead to loss of volumes of the entire premium segment range at Maruti, thereby arresting its volume growth,"" according to a report by ICICI Securities Ltd. What Toyota is bringing to the table is of limited benefit to Maruti Suzuki, said the report.
Unlike in mature markets where brand loyalty is high, India’s passenger vehicle market is still evolving. Consumers are lured by price, value for money and fuel efficiency rather than brand loyalty. This is why the risk-reward equation of this collaboration doesn’t look great for Maruti Suzuki at this juncture.
“Access to Toyota’s technology will be key to future-proof Maruti’s long-term prospects, particularly in the electric vehicles segment. However, quid pro quo will inevitably mean concessions by Maruti, Suzuki’s crown jewel, in various forms, which investors need to factor,"" said a report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd."

New Delhi: The board of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle maker by market share, on Wednesday appointed Kenichi Ayukawa as its managing director and chief executive officer for the third straight term.
The board of the Delhi-based company also approved certain aspects of memorandum of understanding (MoU) between its parent company Suzuki Motor Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp., including the supply of Toyota Hybrid System to the company, besides the manufacturing of Vitara Brezza at Toyota’s plant in Bengaluru, and supply of other products to Toyota’s Indian subsidiary.
Ayukawa took charge of Maruti Suzuki in 2013, when it was reeling with labour-related crises and loss of volumes due to the increase in diesel vehicle sales across the country.
He also oversaw the transition of Maruti Suzuki from a small compact hatchback manufacturer to the opening of the Nexa chain of premium dealerships, wherein cars such as the Baleno (a hatchback), Ciaz (a mid-size sedan) and S-Cross (a crossover), are being sold.
Under Ayukawa, the company also improved its financials significantly, with the stock touching the  ₹10,000 mark. Maruti also re-captured 50% market share in India during this time.

235,2019-04-02,Maruti,"Shares of Kansai Nerolac have fallen 5% since Maruti Suzuki announced the production cut in MarchNerolac is the market leader in industrial paints, which forms 45% of its revenue, with the auto industry having the highest share

News that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is cutting production in March has investors in Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd worried. The paint maker’s shares have fallen 5% since, even while the markets have risen.
There are two reasons why Kansai Nerolac would be among the casualties of a slowdown in the automobile sector. One, it is the market leader in the industrial paints segment, which forms 45% of its revenue, with the auto industry having the highest share. Two, Maruti Suzuki is the company’s biggest client. So, this double whammy of sorts would accentuate pressure on its already struggling industrial paints business.
To put things into perspective, Kansai Nerolac’s paint volumes grew in the high double-digits in the December quarter. The growth was largely led by the decorative paints segment. The industrial segment, including automotive, is weak, making it difficult to take price hikes, the company’s management told analysts.
Back then itself, analysts were worried about the delay in price hikes for industrial clients. As a result of the ongoing slowdown, operating margin would remain under check.
Brokerage house CLSA Ltd sees increased risk for industrial segment margins, because price hikes may be difficult in the auto segment given the weak demand. “We cut our earnings per share forecast 2%-4% (following a 6%-7% cut in January 2019), as we trim our growth forecast for industrial and also slightly tone down our margin assumptions,"" it said in a note to clients on 22 March.
On the bright side, the rupee’s appreciation coupled with price increases in the decorative paints business should provide some respite. A stronger rupee means raw material imports would be cheaper. However, that may not be sufficient for a significant improvement in margins. Also, while the price of titanium dioxide, a key input derived from crude oil, has declined from its peak, it remains elevated.
No wonder then that the Kansai Nerolac stock is trading at one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio of 38 times. Valuation-wise, it is far cheaper when compared to peers Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd. It’s evident that the continued weakness in the industrial business has weighed on its valuations.
Of course, the impact on revenue growth can be offset to some extent if the decorative paints business maintains momentum. However, as this column recently pointed out, there are telltale signs of weakness in overall consumption demand in India. So, some analysts caution that the demand for discretionary spending such as painting may also be hit."
234,2019-04-02,Maruti,"MG Motor will release only retail sales data as opposed to most of the competitors, says MG Motor Inda MD Rajeev ChabaMG Motor, a unit of China's SIAC is planning to introduce hybrid and electric vehicles in its first year in India

New Delhi: MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd, the local unit of the iconic British car maker that is now owned by China’s SAIC Motor Corp. Ltd, will start selling cars in India in the next two months. The company is planning to introduce hybrid and electric vehicles in its first year in India.
In an interview, Rajeev Chaba, president and managing director of MG Motor India, said the company will release only retail sales data as opposed to most of the competitors and will start with just a few dealers to ensure profitability in a very competitive market. Edited excerpts:
You have spent almost two decades with General Motors. How different has been your experience till now with MG Motor?
I learnt a lot from General Motors (GM) and the company gave me a lot of exposure in different roles across countries. I was a part of Opel as well when it was launched in India. Here, the brand MG Motor is British but in terms of scale (compared to GM), it is much smaller.
That means a lot of people don’t know about the brand; we have to start from scratch. The good thing about the ownership is that SAIC is the biggest Chinese (car) manufacturer and it has got huge resources, is highly profitable and is one of the future-ready companies in the globe in terms of developing technologies required for electric, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. So, all these resources are available to MG Motor as well.
How will you ensure that MG becomes one of the very few foreign brands that will get the India strategy right?
For most of the global players here in India, the first solution for any problem is a global one. That’s a default setting. For a company like MG though, the first solution is to ask the local management what they want to resolve an adverse situation, rather than offering a global solution. So, that’s a huge difference. Only two companies have managed to crack the Indian market and if you look at their history, it has taken more than just investments to get the strategy right.
They have worked a lot with the local people to understand the local market. For both SAIC and MG, this is one of the few global markets and success here will lead to entry in many other markets.
What will be the strategy regarding setting up dealerships and maintaining their profitability?
Most of the manufacturers did not invest much in dealer processes, customer systems and cost of ownership issues. We need to invest in the fundamentals. We have got probably the best dealers in the country and the best team for sales, service and marketing for our products.
Our policy is that we are going to grow with only a few dealers, though we will give them many outlets. So we may start with 40-45 dealers, but in a number of locations; and after five years, this may increase to 60, not 300 or 400. In Bengaluru, MG will have five outlets but with just one dealer. That means we are selecting dealers carefully and they do have the financial strength to invest in the future. Also, we will always talk about retail sales and not wholesales, and dealer partners are enthused by this decision.
How will you tackle competition from Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai in the initial years?
In our first product, we don’t foresee any competition from Maruti and Hyundai, and it has been very strategically done.
When we looked at this particular segment, it was just one product and now another couple of products have been launched. So, if we get the fundamentals right, then we can lead this segment.
We have told our dealers that they should take care of customer satisfaction and we will take care of their viability.
When it comes to future mobility solutions, what will MG offer the Indian customer?
Very few people know MG the brand in our country, so we need to spread awareness to start with. Then, with technology, expect us to be a disruptive force and we will try to introduce different ways of selling cars and will experiment with technology. We are going to be the first company to offer an affordable mild hybrid in a mass market vehicle. It will be a petrol hybrid and will bridge the gap between petrol and diesel as the price gap will be significantly lower. We will also launch the Hector with an automatic transmission.
To what extent will be the exposure to diesel for the company in India?
It’s a judgement call now and, given the trend currently, after BS-VI comes into effect, diesel vehicles will be even more expensive. So, I think we will have to be very careful about diesel as we go forward and we will have more hybrid and electric vehicles compared to diesel-run products; but in some segments, if diesel is required, we will have the option."
233,2019-04-02,Maruti,"Higher oil prices and a weak rupee are among factors that have affected auto sales in India since SeptemberDecision of most auto firms to reduce production in March quarter to trim their inventory seen as affecting sales

New Delhi: Auto sales in India fell in March due to tepid demand in both urban and rural areas. This has led to most of the automakers, including Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, missing their sales growth projections for the just-ended fiscal year.
Maruti Suzuki said on Monday that its total sales in March fell 0.7% year-on-year to 147,613 vehicles.
Sales for the year ended 31 March increased by a modest 6.1% to about 1.75 million vehicles as the company missed its revised forecast of an 8% growth. This is the first time since FY14 that India’s largest passenger vehicle maker has missed its sales forecast.
Vehicle sales in India are counted as factory dispatches, or wholesales, and not retail sales.
Barring its sole light commercial vehicle model, Carry, the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit recorded a 1.5% year-on-year drop in passenger vehicle sales to 145,013 vehicles in March.
Sales at Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd grew 4% to 27,646 vehicles in March helped by the compact sport-utility vehicle, XUV300, which was launched in February.
For the last fiscal year, Mahindra’s passenger vehicle sales grew by a marginal 2% underscoring a sharp contraction in demand in rural regions. The local unit of Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. recorded a 2.2% y-o-y drop in sales in March to 12,818 units.
“We have closed FY19 with robust double-digit growth of 11% at an overall level, despite strong headwinds faced by the Indian automotive industry this year. This growth has been supported by our three new product launches, which have been well received in the market,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president, automotive sector, M&M, referring to the company’s entire product range comprising passenger vehicles, three-wheelers and commercial vehicles.
One of the factors behind the subdued performance is the decision of most of the companies to reduce production in the March quarter to trim their inventory. Higher oil prices and a weaker rupee are among factors which have affected vehicle sales in India since September. Sales during the festive season fell to a five-year low in 2018.
Honda Cars India Ltd, however, bucked the trend as it reported a 27% jump in sales to 17,202 vehicles in March thanks to demand for its compact sedan Amaze. The company also witnessed an 8% increase in sales in the last fiscal year.
Rajesh Goel, senior vice- president and director, sales and marketing at Honda Cars, said strong sales efforts from dealers and the company in a tough market led to the growth.
Mirroring the slowdown in the manufacturing sector and the overall economy, medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales of Tata Motors—India’s top commercial vehicle maker—fell 9% in March to 15,327 vehicles. Such vehicles are used for transporting goods and people.
Overall sales of Tata’s commercial vehicles—combining M&HCV and light commercial vehicles—grew 4% y-o-y to 50,917 units in March. The company recorded a 12% increase in full-year sales to 1,51,105 vehicles.
Ashok Leyland Ltd, the second-largest commercial vehicle maker, also posted a 7% decline in sales of heavy and medium commercial vehicles in March to 15,235 vehicles. For the full-year, sales increased by 13% on the back of robust growth in the fiscal first half. The weak sentiment continued in the two-wheeler segment with market leader Hero MotoCorp Ltd reporting a 20% drop in sales in March to 581,279 units."
232,2019-04-04,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki will build new showrooms at its own cost and lease them out to dealers, who will bear the operational expensesMaruti Suzuki plans to tap its cash reserves of over  ₹30,000 crore to absorb the bulk fo capital costs of its dealer partners

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to tap its cash reserves of more than  ₹30,000 crore to absorb the bulk of capital costs of its dealers as the nation’s largest carmaker moves to maintain dealer profitability, crucial for preserving its pole position in the world’s fastest growing major car market.
Some of Maruti’s new showrooms would be owned by the firm and leased out to dealer partners, three people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity. The auto maker would incur the capital expenditure for establishing them, while the dealers would bear the operational expenses, the people said.
Maruti Suzuki cars are retailed via Arena and Nexa dealerships across India.
Dealer margins on cars across India have been squeezed as modern vehicles need less frequent repairs and servicing. The new plan aims to boost the financial strength of Maruti’s dealer partners as competition is expected to intensify from existing and new companies.
Maruti plans to gradually grow the number of such dealerships. An internal study by the company has forecast the need for more than 100 new dealer partners for Maruti to sustain its 50% share of the Indian market by 2030. Each dealer partner typically runs more than one showroom.
This is because existing dealers may not have the financial muscle to sustain large capital investments. Real estate and other establishment costs in most of the metro and Tier I cities have become inordinately expensive, said the people cited earlier.
Suzuki Motor Corp.’s most profitable unit also planned to own real estate for its regional offices similar to its headquarters in New Delhi, the people said.
Maruti spokespersons did not respond to emailed queries sent last week.
At present, expenses incurred by dealers include rentals, creating showroom interiors and vehicle workshop. Excluding rentals, it costs  ₹5-6 crore in major cities to open a dealership. Maruti currently has about 2,400 dealerships or showrooms.
“The huge cash reserve of the company cannot be used in a better way than acquiring prime real estate, whose value usually never comes down. Maruti has also invested in buying land parcels across the country for building stockyards and dealerships,"" said one of the three people.
Maruti, the only cash-rich four-wheeler maker in India, first announced in FY17 its plans to buy land for expanding its dealer network and for other purposes. In FY18 as well, the company earmarked a portion of its capital expenditure (capex) for buying land.
Maruti now plans to alter its strategy and invest in setting up dealerships instead of just purchasing land, as dealers, especially in big cities, often complain about the rising costs of operations.
Avik Chattopadhayay, founder of brand consultancy firm Expereal, said investing in real estate is an efficient way to build wealth.
“For a company with cash reserves like Maruti, investing in real estate makes sense and this has been the strategy for quite sometime now,"" he said. “Also, they need to expand dealerships if they have to remain the dominant player since the competition is going to be intense in the next decade. Owning their own office spaces has always been on the agenda of the top management and that’s the reason why the company decided to shift to the Vasant Kunj-based headquarters.""
The third person cited earlier said Maruti’s decision would please its dealers. “For an individual dealer, in any of the major cities,  ₹5-6 crore is the minimum investment. So Maruti’s model is a win-win for both the company and the dealers,"" added the person."
231,2019-04-08,Maruti,"Siam is seeking GST rate cut for cars and bikes to ease incoming pricing pressure due to BS VI emission norms and new safety regulationsAutomobiles, cars and two-wheelers alike, are expected to cost 10-15% due to the new regulations expected to kick in from 1 April 2020

New Delhi: Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), on Monday appealed to the government to cut goods and services tax (GST) on cars and scooters and bikes from 28% to 18% to ease the incoming pricing pressure on the automobile industry. 
Automobiles, cars and two-wheelers alike, are expected to cost 10-15% more from 1 April 2020, when Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) emission norms and new safety regulations are expected to kick in. The industry fears that with the increase in prices, the demand for their products would be impacted. 
Cars, bikes and scooters at present attract peak GST rate of 28% with additional cess ranging from 1% to 15%, depending on the length, engine size and type.
""We want the government to be sensitive to the fact that BS-VI emission introduction (from 1 Apri1 2020) and other safety regulations will add to the cost. If it adds to the cost it is likely to lead to slowdown in the demand,"" Siam president Rajan Wadhera said. 
If the demand goes down, government collection of taxes would also go down, he said.
""Therefore, for a win-win situation, we are seeking a 18% GST on automobiles.""
A price hike of even 10% would impact the sales of two-wheeler segment, which currently witnesses offtake of over 22 million units annually, Wadhera said.
""On passenger vehicles also, the prices are going to go up in the range of 10-15% due to technology and safety enhancements. There also we need serious considerations by government so that it is a win-win situation for all,"" Wadhera said.
Earlier this year, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd's managing director and chief executive officer, Kenichi Ayukawa, had sought GST cut on cars in order to create demand and develop the industry.
Major two-wheeler companies like TVS Motor Co., Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Bajaj Auto had also demanded a GST rate cut on two-wheelers."
230,2019-04-08,Maruti,"Car sales grew 2.7% in 2018-19, the worst performance since FY14 when passenger vehicle sales declined by 6%Scooter sales grew at the slowest pace in 14 years in FY19, underscoring a slowdown in demand in urban markets

New Delhi: India’s passenger vehicle industry reported its worst performance in five years in the just-ended fiscal as higher fuel prices, increase in insurance costs, lack of financing options and farm distress crimped demand. Scooter sales grew at the slowest pace in 14 years, underscoring a slowdown in demand in urban markets.
Sale of cars, sport utility vehicles and minivans grew 2.7% in the year ended 31 March to more than 3.37 million vehicles, shows data issued by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) on Monday. It was the worst performance since FY14 when sales fell 6%.
Vehicle sales in India are counted as wholesales, or factory dispatches.
Considering the continued pressure on sales and prevailing market uncertainty, the industry lobby group has projected a modest 3-5% rise in passenger vehicle sales in FY20. Commercial vehicle sales are forecast to do better, with a 10-12% growth in anticipation of strong advance purchases by fleet owners towards the end of FY20 before the implementation of stricter Bharat Stage-VI emission norms, which will make vehicles costlier. Two-wheeler sales are predicted to grow 5-7%.
Retail demand for passenger vehicles in India slowed faster in the second half of the fiscal, forcing auto makers to cut production amid rising inventory levels. Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd trimmed production by about 20% in March.
Sales were expected to rebound after the conclusion of the general elections, said Siam president Rajan Wadhera. A recovery in demand would, however, be contingent upon factors such as abundant monsoon rain and improvement in credit availability, he said.
“Demand for vehicles have been better in rural compared to urban markets and many original equipment manufacturers had cut production in March and reduced the billing of vehicles. Also, in the urban areas, shared mobility like cab services have resulted in the slowdown in demand,"" he said.
Meanwhile, with urban demand staying subdued, scooter sales fell 0.27% to 6.7 million units in the last fiscal. This was the first drop in the scooter segment since a 1.45% decline in FY06.
Motorcycles fared better, posting a 7.8% increase to nearly 13.6 million units on the back of better demand in rural and semi-urban markets.
In addition to higher petrol prices and increase in product prices by manufacturers, a rise in the cost of third-party insurance prompted many to defer their purchases.
“The general sentiment in the market was down, especially in urban areas, after the increase in insurance cost, which led to an increase of 10% in the total cost of the vehicle,"" said Sugato Sen, additional director general of Siam. “The dip in demand in the urban areas is also reflected in the decline in sales of scooters and passenger vehicles. Rural and semi-urban markets are still performing better than the urban markets.""
Commercial vehicle sales, an indicator of economic activity, climbed 17.55% in the last fiscal to touch the one million sales milestone for the first time.
Medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales grew 15% to 390,740 units, while light commercial vehicle sales increased 19% to 616,579 units.
Robust growth in the commercial vehicle segment in the first half of the fiscal helped to partly offset demand weakness in the second half due to a squeeze in financing options from non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) following the crisis at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, as well as revised axle norms that allowed trucks to carry more freight.
“Adequate finance for vehicle is still not available and is still taking a lot of time,"" Wadhera said. “Finance options that were available in two days, now take 10 days. NBFCs are still very cautious while lending.""
On the retail side, passenger vehicle registrations rose by 3.68% to 3.2 million units, while commercial vehicle registrations jumped 22% to 97,8811 units in FY19, according to the vehicle registration data available on the government’s Vahan website.
Sales of two-wheelers increased by 9.6% to 1.65 million units.
“In FY19, various factors led to a rise in overall cost of ownership, including volatile fuel cost, higher interest rates as well as increased upfront insurance cost. It dampened consumer sentiments, especially in the passenger vehicle and two-wheeler segments. With stabilization of fuel prices and a further rise in interest costs unlikely, Ind-Ra expects consumer sentiments to improve modestly in FY20, especially in the four- and two-wheeler segments,"" said Richa Bulani, senior analyst at India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd."
229,2019-04-09,Maruti,"Companies in the IT and banking sectors are expected to report decent numbersConsumption slowdown, especially in rural India, may weigh on automobile and FMCG earnings

Corporate earnings have been a constant source of disappointment for many quarters now. However, the tide seems to be turning. Bloomberg’s one-year forward consensus estimates for the Nifty’s earnings per share (EPS) are heading north (see chart).
The optimism is driven by the improving health of banks and expanding liquidity conditions. However, the ongoing consumption slowdown and subdued global growth cannot be ignored. In such a scenario, apart from the revenue and profit figures, investors should focus on cues about whether these estimates will sustain.
Automobiles: Tepid demand leading to high inventories can hit the earnings of auto companies. A watch on the demand outlook is, thus, essential. Investors will want to know the production strategies given that BS VI emission norms will be implemented from 1 April 2020. Concerns related to Brexit continue to haunt Tata Motors. Hence, investors would want to keep a watch on the commentary on Jaguar Land Rover.
Aviation: Financial woes at Jet Airways (India) Ltd pushed up airfares for metro routes during the quarter. IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) and SpiceJet Ltd are expected to gain. However, higher yields can be counter-balanced by a decline in the passenger load factor. In February, domestic passenger growth registered its slowest monthly gain in over five years.
Banks, NBFCs: Public sector banks’ recapitalization ratios will be watched. Commentary on unrecognized stresses in corporate loans, and the pace of bad loan resolution through the insolvency framework are crucial. Market share gain for banks from NBFCs is another important indicator. For NBFCs, the key parameters are asset-liability management, the liquidity outlook and the cost of funds.
Cement: March is a strong quarter for the sector. However, government-driven demand could have been impacted by the forthcoming general election. Choppy price trends make commentary on overall pricing important. As input costs ease, the outlook on margins is key. 
FMCG: Commentary on volume growth of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms is crucial after worries of a consumption slowdown have surfaced. Easing input costs make the outlook regarding margin growth important. Investors will be keen to know if ad spend will be trimmed.
Information technology: Usually, the March quarter is weak for the IT sector as customers are into their budgeting term. This time, however, the execution of recently-won deals would aid performance. Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2020 along with deal pipeline will be closely watched. Also, the outlook on the banking and financial services vertical, considering weak global macro conditions, is important. The impact of new stringent US H-1B visa norms on sub-contracting costs and hiring plans too will be crucial.
Real estate: Investors will want to know how the transition to new accounting standards and the new goods and services tax regime have impacted the sector. Buyers may have delayed purchases because of the latter. Launch pipelines and inventory data should be watched. Other vital cues will come from real estate pricing strategies and how debt levels are moving."
228,2019-04-09,Maruti,"Going into previous election cycles, the promise of certainty and a dedicated government has driven sales in the auto sector. This time, it won’t matter if Modi’s party returns—shoppers need to feel like they’ve got the power in their wallets

Heading into an election, India’s enthusiasm for cars and motorcycles has all but evaporated. It’s unlikely to return anytime soon, despite all the grand promises to improve the lives of masses.
Passenger car sales, which have been sliding since last summer, fell another 6% last month while those for two-wheelers—the larger and more profitable market—collapsed 15%. Commercial vehicle sales, which include trucks and buses, also slowed. Overall production in the country’s $70 billion auto industry is slumping. Hero MotoCorp Ltd which commands a third of the market, posted a 20% drop.
This downbeat sentiment should worry investors and policymakers, particularly as Prime Minister Narendra Modi drums up nationalist pride. Inventories are piling up and consumers don't feel like spending. With unemployment soaring, affordability remains a sticking point.
That's partly why India is largely a two-wheeler market, with annual sales of more than 20 million units compared with about 4 million for passenger vehicles.
True, there are lots of cars and motorbikes on the road in India—at close to 30 million and about 170 million, respectively. With more than 1 billion people and low levels of car ownership, this downturn may be a temporary blip, given sales have grown at an average annual rate of 8% to 10% over the past five years.
So why is demand this tepid? Because buyers just can’t spend. That’s particularly the case among younger people, as well as those in rural and smaller urban areas. Hopes are high that Modi’s manifesto will double farmers’ income and create opportunities for India’s youth (which his government thus far has failed to do). Both are unlikely.
Even for those who have money to spend, their choices are, well, boring. Most cars look and feel the same, with models made by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co. dominating the roads. Fancier cars remain inaccessible. On top of that, congestion and pollution are becoming a real menace.
Consumers’ apathy has spread to manufacturers. Despite heavy government protection with import duties, margins are shrinking and companies aren’t re-investing much. While India’s auto sector has outperformed the benchmark stock index for the past decade, it has under-performed by more than 25% since July, Bernstein analysts note.
Until cars become more affordable, demand will waver. One way around this is to boost auto financing. But that’s already a well-trodden path: such loans already back around 70% of passenger car buyers and 50% of the two-wheeler market, according to the Bernstein analysts.

Meanwhile, other outlays continue to pile up. Fuel is expensive and the upfront cost of insurance is also set to rise because of new rules that went into effect in September. With high interest rates, it’s probably imprudent for borrowing to outpace income gains. Consumers aren’t feeling wealthy, and there isn’t much incentive for them to buy.
Going into previous election cycles, the promise of certainty and a dedicated government has driven sales in the auto sector. This time, it won’t matter if Modi’s party returns—shoppers need to feel like they’ve got the power in their wallets.

227,2019-04-10,Maruti,"Auto production in FY19 grew by 6.3%, not even half the growth rate clocked in FY18Soft commodity prices will not aid margins due to weak sales and a negative operating leverage

Mumbai: Automobile sales are decelerating, and incentives and discounts are not helping shore up demand. The uncertain outlook and mounting unsold inventory have compelled companies to cut production in the March quarter. The auto sector is thus faced with earnings downgrades for the next two years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, a leading brokerage firm, in its March quarter preview, has cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all 8 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that it covers. In contrast to the expectations of a turnaround in fortunes during the March quarter, which typically registers strong numbers for the sector, the net profit of almost all auto companies may witness double-digit declines for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Recent data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows that vehicle production in FY19 grew 6.3% year-on-year. This was not even half the growth witnessed in FY18.
The headwinds are strengthening. A truant 2019 monsoon, rampant rural distress led by weak farm income, increasing influence of shared mobility in urban areas, a rise in unemployment and the liquidity crunch are roadblocks to improved consumer sentiment. Pre-election sales of vehicles have also dipped in the past. 
All these point to a weak demand until after the elections.
Therefore, any improvement in sales can be expected only in the second half of FY20, beginning from the festival season, say analysts. There is hope of pre-buying in the March quarter of FY20, just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in. This is likely to substantially increase vehicle costs. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes have coincided with a cyclical downturn that would weigh on demand.
One would have expected some relief in margins on account of softer commodity prices. However, the forthcoming results are not expected to factor much gains. Low sales will translate to low operating leverage, which will weigh on profitability. “Weak demand is bringing in margin pressure from higher customer acquisition costs (marketing), as well as negative operating leverage,"" says IIFL Research.

Retail sales of automobiles in India increased 8% sequentially in March to 1.68 million vehicles as companies offered discounts and other incentives to lure buyers and reduce dealer stocks, showed data issued by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) on Wednesday.
Retail sales however fell compared with March last year because of the high base and prevailing weak market sentiments.
Retail sales of two-wheelers rose 10% month-on-month (m-o-m) in March to 1.32 million units, while those for passenger vehicles grew 5% to 242,708 units.
Sales of commercial vehicles grew at a modest 2% m-o-m to 61,896 units amid the prevailing liquidity crunch at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which has squeezed financing options for fleet owners.
Retail sales of automobiles started to decline since last September when customer sentiments turned negative as crude oil prices started moving north, and the rupee depreciated against the dollar to an all-time high which impacted returns in the stock markets.
The bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, meanwhile, led to a liquidity crunch as NBFCs became over cautious in lending. As a result, vehicle sales fell to a six-year low during Diwali and Navratri last year.
With dealer inventories touching record high, companies had to cut production and offer increased benefits or discounts on vehicles to clear stocks.
The average inventory for passenger vehicles is, however, still in the range of 45-50 days, much higher than the inventory of 30 days typically maintained by most manufacturers, according to FADA. Two-wheeler makers managed to halve their inventories to 45-50 days from almost 90-100 days in January and February by enforcing production cuts at factories.
Showroom sales of passenger vehicles dropped 10% from the year-earlier in March, while sales in the two-wheeler segment fell 7%. Retail sales of commercial vehicles fell around 12% from the year earlier in March.
However, FADA, a lobby group for automobile dealers, said it expects customers to resume automobile purchases after the Lok Sabha elections, which conclude on 23 May.
“We at FADA believe that the worst for the automobile industry is now behind us and expect demand to stay at the current level in the months to come. We believe inquiry to conversion ratio to improve with a stable government at the centre and improvement in the liquidity situation,"" said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president of FADA.
The subdued demand condition prevailing in the market was reflected in the wholesales data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) on Monday.
Factory dispatches of passenger vehicles grew by just 2.7% to 3.37 million units in fiscal year 2019 (FY19)—the slowest since FY14 when sales fell 6%.
Anticipating continued pressure of sales volumes, Siam has projected a growth of around 3-5% in passenger vehicle sales for this fiscal year."
224,2019-04-16,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki is weighing phase-out of diesel cars as BS-VI norms from 1 April 2020 will make them costlier by at least  ₹2 lakhHyundai and Tata Motors will likely to fill in the gap left by Maruti Suzuki with their own BS-VI diesel engines

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is staring at a potential drop in both sales and market share as it weighs a plan to stop selling diesel cars from April next year. India's largest carmaker garners nearly 30%, or about 450,000 units, of its annual sales from diesel cars.
Maruti Suzuki expects to push about half of those buyers to shift to petrol or CNG cars by offering incentives, and also provide CNG options in more models. It, however, fears that the remainder will shift to diesel cars of rival brands, according to an internal projection prepared by senior executives of Maruti.
Maruti is considering the drastic step on the future of its diesel range as the imposition of Bharat Stage VI emission norms from 1 April 2020 would make such vehicles costlier by at least  ₹2 lakh per unit in order to make them comply with the new rules. This is expected to particularly lead most small-car buyers to shift to petrol or CNG models.
Small cars comprise the bulk of Maruti’s sales volume.
R.C. Bhargava, Maruti’s chairman, said the company might stop producing diesel variants of some of the smaller cars as the price difference between petrol and diesel variants would be substantial. He did not say whether the company would completely stop making diesel cars.
“We have to manufacture vehicles according to what is likely to be acceptable to customers. If we have a bigger vehicle, then we may continue. Ultimately, we have to judge what the customers want and develop vehicles accordingly,"" said Bhargava.
According to the internal forecast, Maruti might lose annual sales of 125,000-150,000 vehicles if it did not have any diesel car in its portfolio, as most of its competitors were likely to be ready with BS VI diesel engines by next April, said two people aware of the development.
According to the projection, sales of high-selling Ertiga, Vitara Brezza and S-Cross models will be hit the most if Maruti pulls the plug on diesel cars.
Maruti Suzuki spokespersons didn’t reply to an email sent on Monday.
If Maruti loses market share, it will be the first since 2012-13 for the most profitable unit of Suzuki Motor Corp.
In FY13, Maruti’s market share fell to 39% as diesel vehicle sales picked up at the expense of petrol ones. The company managed to raise its market share to 51% by introducing a slew of vehicles, especially in the above  ₹7 lakh segment.
Suzuki is yet to decide on whether to upgrade its current 1.5-litre diesel engine—launched with the Ciaz sedan in March—to comply with BS-VI norms. The company may, therefore, start FY21 without a diesel engine but introduce one later in the year.
The two people cited earlier said the loss of volumes and market share was projected as the worst-case scenario and that it could be limited if Maruti managed to convert diesel car buyers.
Some senior Maruti executives wanted diesel cars to stay, as rivals Hyundai Motor Co. and Tata Motors Ltd would also have diesel cars, said the first person. “The losses can be contained by the company since the diesel vehicles will be significantly expensive, but converting 30% of the volumes will be tough since some of the customers would still want to buy diesel variants,"" the person added.
Mint reported on 15 February that Maruti was in talks with Suzuki on the future of diesel cars in India that included whether the company should cease production of diesel vehicles.
“Maruti’s absence in the diesel portfolio, especially in B and C segment cars, can impact their market share adversely, but at the same time it is an opportunity for other players,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director-vehicle forecast (South Asia) at IHS Markit. “But we should not forget that Maruti Suzuki understands the pulse of the consumer the best. It looks like the company is banking heavily on CNG cars and on the assumption that consumers will shift to gasoline cars in the years to come.""
He said the share of diesel cars was declining, but they still made up a large share in the overall car market.
The second person quoted above said Maruti’s decision made sense, though it might cause some short-term pain.
“The commercial fleet customers of Maruti may completely shift to CNG to maintain their profitability, but how retail customers will behave nobody knows at the moment,"" the person said. “The launch of the current 1.5-litre engine took more than the expected time and a BS-VI engine needs to be tested for 1 lakh km before it gets launched. So, for Maruti, it is like running against time."""
223,2019-04-19,Maruti,"Auto component makers need to brace up for sharp production cuts in the near term, with their large customers cutting productionCost pressures due to new safety and emission norms may impact profit margins of both auto and auto component firms

Mumbai: It is no secret that the pain of slowdown in the auto sector will trickle down to auto component makers, albeit with a lag. Component makers need to brace up for sharp production cuts in the near term, with their large customers cutting production. They could also face cost pressures because of technological changes in the industry.
The year-on-year revenue growth rate for most firms has slackened since the June quarter, according to Mint’s analysis of the top 25 auto component firms, sorted on the basis of revenue. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) stuttered, too, as operating leverage took a beating with lower sales.
The situation has since worsened. Overall vehicle production in the country was 18.5% lower year-on-year in March, compared with the 18.6% increase in the year-ago period. This reaffirms that the auto sector slowdown is here to stay for some more time. Interest rate cuts and festive seasons have also failed to lift auto sales in the second half of FY19.
“Revenue and profit growth of component firms in FY20 will be a mixed bag depending on their product portfolio, despite the overall slowdown,"" says Pavethra Ponniah, vice-president and sector head (corporate ratings) at Icra Ltd. 
For instance, Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd depends a lot on automotive paints, with Maruti Suzuki India Ltd being its biggest customer. A lower production forecast in the passenger vehicle segment makes a case for lower revenue growth for this company. Two-wheeler maker Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd also hinted at a 15-20% drop in June quarter production because of weak demand and a squeeze on auto financing. Suppliers in the two-wheeler segment will be severely affected as well.
There is also uncertainty because of the forthcoming changes in safety and emission norms. Commodity prices are softening, but cost pressures due to the new technology may impact profit margins of both automobile and component firms. In times of flagging demand, it’s not clear if these higher cost pressures can be passed on easily.
That is not all. Global automobile demand is subdued. According to an Icra report, European passenger car registrations are likely to be lower in 2019. A slowdown is also expected in the US Class 8 truck sales after they scaled peak growth rates this year.
All these factors are dampers for exports of auto component makers as well. Shares of most auto component firms have been falling since January. 
Within the sector, companies with some exposure to the commercial vehicle sector and to the replacement market, such as batteries and tyres, may be better off compared to the rest of the pack."
222,2019-04-19,Maruti,"Hyundai is already in talks with strategic partners to invest in the development of components for electric vehiclesHyundai is also looking to roll out hybrid vehicles in India whenever the market is ready

New Delhi: South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co. is considering the possibility of manufacturing certain electric vehicle (EV) components in India, besides launching hybrid vehicles here, said a senior company executive on Thursday.
Hyundai Motors is already in talks with strategic partners to invest in the development of components for electric vehicles, and believes that there will be adequate demand for hybrid vehicles.
Apart from offering incentives for electric vehicles, the union government has also announced its support for 10,000 units of hybrid vehicles over the next three years, as part of its Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (FAME) scheme.
“The procurement division of our parent company is studying the possibility with some of the suppliers for manufacturing components of electric vehicles in India. We also have our hybrid vehicles in South Korea and US, and will bring them to India when the market is ready,"" said Seon Seob Kim, managing director, Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
Kim said the company is looking to launch its first electric vehicle in India in 2019. The vehicle, which will be brought into the country in a complete knock-down (CKD) form, will be assembled in Hyundai’s Chennai plant.
Among leading vehicle manufacturers, only Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Suzuki Motor Co. have announced their plans to develop components such as lithium-ion batteries and electric powertrains in India.
Besides, Hyundai India is looking to challenge Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on its leadership position in the utility vehicle segment, with the introduction of its first sub-four metre compact utility vehicle, Hyundai Venue.
According to Kim, the company will play an important role in expanding the segment and will eye for the leadership position with the Venue and the Creta.
“We will have a meaningful contribution in this segment with this new product and, with the overall SUV (sport utility vehicle) segment growing, we will look to take leadership position. This segment attracts a lot of young customers, and with Hyundai’s entry, this segment will also expand,"" added Kim, who took charge of the Indian subsidiary in December.
As of now, Hyundai sells 9,000-10,000 units of Creta in the domestic market. The company expects to sell another 8,000-10,000 units of the Venue, which will help it compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza and Mahindra XUV 300.
The compact SUV segment has been the main driver of volume growth in the passenger vehicle segment in India and is being led by Maruti Suzuki’s Vitara Brezza. The Delhi-based manufacturer sells 10,000-11,000 units of the product every month. Others such as Mahindra and Tata Motors Ltd, with the launch of XUV300 and Nexon, respectively, are looking to boost volumes.
Hyundai’s market share in the SUV segment stands at about 13%, while Maruti Suzuki commands around 26% share with the Vitara Brezza and Ertiga.
Apart from electric mobility Hyundai Motor Group is planning to become the biggest mobility solutions service provider in the country with its investment in start-ups such as Revv and Ola Cabs. Hyundai recently launched a subscription-based car leasing service with Revv, while the company will supply electric vehicles to Ola’s fleet in the future as demand for electric vehicles is likely to come from commercial fleet segment."
221,2019-04-22,Maruti,"Is such enthusiasm justified when India’s carmakers are battling slowing sales and production cuts?Passenger vehicle (PV) sales will grow from $40 billion per year in 2017 to $265 billion by 2030, Morgan Stanley says

Collaborative efforts between carmakers are set to gain traction in India. Last week, India’s Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and America’s Ford Motor Co. said they would jointly develop a midsized sport utility vehicle (SUV). About a month ago, the country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd got roped into the cross-badging arrangement that its Japanese parent Suzuki Motor Corp. signed with Toyota Motor Corp. at a global level.
Is such enthusiasm justified when India’s carmakers are battling slowing sales and production cuts?
Passenger vehicle (PV) sales will grow from $40 billion per year in 2017 to $265 billion by 2030, Morgan Stanley says in a research report titled India’s Transport EVolution (2018). The Indian government’s Auto Mission Plan of 2016-26 says the local PV market will triple to 9.4 million units by 2026.
This is not the only reason for such alliances. Amid such skyrocketing growth forecasts, there is the conundrum of stiff competition and technological changes such as BS-VI emission norms and electric vehicles. Besides, the pace of new launches to woo customers requires strong research and development, and deep pockets. Ford Motor’s venture in the country clocked its first profit in FY17, a little more than two decades after it started India operations.
Given this, its alliance to jointly develop a midsized SUV with the country’s largest SUV maker M&M will help it make faster inroads into the market, with relatively lower risk. After all, it is not easy to compete with incumbents such as Maruti Suzuki, which rolls out one in every two cars sold in the country. South Korean Hyundai Motor Co.’s India unit is doing well in the No.2 position.
For Indian counterparts such as M&M and Maruti Suzuki, such collaborations help cope with rapidly changing technology. Toyota-Suzuki’s global alliance aims at jointly developing and marketing electric vehicles and expanding their presence in emerging markets, according to analysts. Therefore, Maruti Suzuki is a neat fit in the equation. Its dealer-showroom presence and small-car expertise gives Toyota room to grow in India and other emerging markets.
India has 3% of global car sales now, but will drive half the added global demand over 2017-30, said the Morgan Stanley report. Growth rates are also coming off in mature markets such as Japan, the US and the UK.
In other words, while every global carmaker will hope to cash in on this market, diversity, size and competition demands nimble-footedness. “Issues such as risk-sharing, technology platform-sharing, access to marketing channels and the need to generate optimum return on capital employed make a case for strategic alliances,"" says Kavan Mukhtyar, partner and leader at PwC India.
Meanwhile, such alliances may bring in adversities of cannibalization of market share and drop in sales volumes, notwithstanding the risk of failed alliances.
At present, the mood is grim as auto sales, including that of PVs, have faced a drubbing. Shares of Indian auto firms have ebbed from the year-ago highs as sales faced a drubbing. However, bets on India’s consumerism are high. As more companies try to enter and expand their Indian footprint, strategic collaborations may be the best way to minimize risk."

March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this week. In the global markets too, earnings will be key for equities. This week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by US companies.
In the US, big companies like Facebook, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft will report earnings this week. Among key Indian companies to declare March quarter earnings this week are Maruti Suzuki, Yes Bank, Hero Motocorp, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Bharti Infratel ACC, SBI Life, HDFC Life.
During this week, the markets are expected to consolidate and then turn volatile due to expiry of April series Futures and Options.
“The near term trend of Nifty is range bound and one may expect this high low range of 11,750-11,550 levels to continue for the next curtailed week. Further upside from here could encounter a resistance at 11,710-11,750 levels in the next week. The expected range or consolidation movement is unlikely to damage the near term uptrend status of the market, ""Nagaraj Shetti Technical Research Analyst HDFC securities.
On Monday, HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries stocks will be in focus after posting their quarterly earnings.
Net profit of Reliance Industries rose 9.79% to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March while revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion in the same period. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.
HDFC Bank Ltd reported a record Q4 net profit of  ₹5885 crore up 22.6% meeting market expectations as the country's biggest lender by market value raked in higher interest and fee income. Asset quality improved slightly, with gross bad loans as a percentage of the total at 1.36 % by the end of March, compared with 1.38 % in the previous quarter and 1.30 % in the same period last year."

Maruti Suzuki Ltd has over past two days launched its popular Baleno and Alto hatchbacks with engines compliant with the Bharat State 6 emission norms, a year before the new norms will be introduced. None of the other vehicle manufacturers has managed to launch cars with BS 6 engines.
The Baleno, a premium hatchback sold through the Nexa channel, will also now be available with the smart hybrid technology, first launched with the mid-size sedan Ciaz and Ertiga, a multi-purpose vehicle. The Baleno is the highest selling premium hatchback in the domestic market and sales in 2018-19 increased by 11.4% to 2,12,330 despite subdued demand during the second half of the year.
The BS 6 version of the Alto, an entry level hatchback, was launched by the company on Tuesday with an 800 cc engine. Some of Maruti’s competitors have phased out their entry-level hatchbacks due to tighter safety and emission norms that come into play in 2019 and 2020.
The Alto has been the most sold vehicle of the company for more than 18 years and in 2018-19 the company sold 2,59000 of them, an increase of just 0.3%.
Maruti is also expected to launch the Dzire and Swift with BS 6 compliant engines in the next few months.
According to R S Kalsi, senior executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki, the new Alto is India’s first BSVI compliant entry segment car with a powerful engine and high fuel efficiency of 22.05 km/l.
“Baleno has been a blockbuster car from day one. We have over 5.5 lakh Baleno customers since its launch in 2015 and have sold more than 2 lakh units in the last fiscal year. We recently upgraded the Baleno,"" he added."

Maruti Suzuki today reported a fall in net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31, hurt by industry-wide weak demand. The carmaker's net profit fell by 4.6% to  ₹1,795.6 crore in the same period previous year.
This quarter was marked by adverse foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, higher depreciation and higher sales promotion expenses, partially offset by cost reduction efforts, the company said.
During the quarter, Maruti registered net sales of  ₹20,737.5 crore, up by 0.7% over the same period previous year."
213,2019-04-25,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki forecast 4-8% sales growth for the current financial yearChallenges of sluggish demand, inventory management ahead of the transition to BS-VI norms, cost escalations and the uncertainty around fuel prices raise concerns on the sales front

Auto stocks faced a rough ride in the past year, with the BSE Auto index shedding nearly one-fourth of its value at a time when the broader markets rose marginally.
If Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s words carry weight, it looks like fiscal year 2020 (FY20) will be another year when the going will be tough.
In the company’s conference call with analysts on Thursday, the management indicated a rough ride in FY20. Maruti Suzuki’s forecast of 4-8% sales growth for the current fiscal year is a damper.

In the company’s conference call with analysts on Thursday, the management indicated a rough ride in FY20. Maruti Suzuki’s forecast of 4-8% sales growth for the current fiscal year is a damper.
True, there was some good news in that the average discount of  ₹15,125 per vehicle offered in the March quarter is much lower than the all-time high discount of  ₹24,300 offered in the December quarter. Besides, inventory levels have normalized since April, with the company aligning production to the slowing demand in the market.
Yet, Maruti Suzuki faces adversities, along with its peers. The most glaring concern is the impact of spiralling fuel prices, which can further affect buyer sentiment. Besides, auto companies face higher costs on account of safety regulation compliance and the new technology demands under BS-VI emission standards.
Further, operating margins will be under pressure due to subdued volumes, higher commodity prices and adverse forex costs. On top of it all, the company has to contend with continued product discounts. In the March quarter, Maruti Suzuki’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin fell 370 basis points to 10.5%, far lower than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of 11.5%.
Besides, Maruti Suzuki also has some internal challenges. The company plans to phase out all diesel vehicles from 1 April 2020 which currently comprises nearly one-fourth of its product portfolio. The impact of this move on the firm’s sales faces uncertainty.
Also, the new assembly line in its Gujarat plant brings with it higher depreciation charges. Fortunately, higher depreciation in the March quarter was partially offset by lower interest costs and relief on tax due to a write-back of earlier provisions and higher other income from investments. As a result, the net profit drop of 4.6% year-on-year was not as severe as the drop in Ebitda, and in-line with what analysts had estimated.
While Maruti Suzuki may not be alone in battling several headwinds, the uncertainties around sales, profits and margins are likely to keep the stock range-bound. True, Maruti Suzuki’s shares are down 33% from a year ago, but its strong leadership position in the market is hard for any competitor to crack. Even so, at  ₹6,903 apiece, the stock trades at 21 times estimated earnings for FY21, which looks a tad rich, given the uncertainties."
214,2019-04-25,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki garners nearly 23% of its annual sales from diesel carsThe carmaker also today announced a hike in prices of some of its models
Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest vehicle manufacturer, today announced that it will stop manufacturing diesel vehicles from April 1, 2020 when the new BS 6 emission norms will be introduced. The high cost of upgrading existing diesel engines to the BS 6 norms propelled the company to take such a decision.
The company will try to focus on compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid technology driven vehicles to compensate the vacuum created by the phasing-out of diesel vehicles.
Mint was the first to report on Feb 14, 2019 that Maruti was in talks with its parent company Suzuki Motor Corporation for discontinuation of diesel vehicles from 2020.
According to R C Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, from April next year the company will stop manufacturing diesel vehicles since substantially higher development cost will not make diesel a viable option for consumers.
“We have taken this decision so that in 2022 we are able to meet the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms and higher share of CNG vehicles will help us comply with the norms. I hope the union government’s policies will help grow the market for CNG vehicles,"" added Bhargava.
Apart from that, the company reported a 4.6% year-on-year decline in net profit to  ₹1,795 crore for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 as a result of high commodity and forex costs and increased discounts offered by the company to attract buyers since vehicle sales remain subdued.
The total vehicle sales of the company increased by just 0.4% year-on-year to 4,28,863 units while the net sales or revenue dropped by 0.7% year on year to 20,737.5 crore. The operating margins contracted by 300 basis points due to increase in commodity cost and discounts.
In the full year FY 19, the New Delhi-based company reported 2.9% decease in net profit to  ₹7,500.6 crore while the revenues grew by just 6.3% to  ₹8,3026.5 crore.
According to Ajay Seth, Maruti's executive director, Finance, overall increased discounts offered to customers and commodity costs had an adverse impact on the financials of the company in FY 19 and the company will cut costs in different part of its operations to stabilise the operating margins in FY 2020."

Mumbai: Based on the recommendations of the Kotak panel, the Securities and Exchange Board of India had decided to restrict royalty payments to 2%. Royalty payment is the fee paid by Indian subsidiaries to overseas parent companies for the usage of the brand.
However, Sebi has received stiff resistance from markets, including the finance ministry. According to the minutes of board meeting held on 27 March, released on its website on Thursday evening, this has forced Sebi to delay its implementation till July. This comes even as Nestle India was forced to take shareholder nod for payment to its Swiss parent company. Nestle managed to get this approved on Thursday through a simple majority.
A lowdown on what is amiss in Sebi's plans:
Contrary to Kotak committee's recommendations
The governance panel had proposed seeking shareholder approval for royalty payment of more than 5% of the consolidated turnover of a listed entity. This was reduced to 2% based on the recommendations of the corporate affairs ministry. ""This is inconsistent with the recommendations of the committee,"" according to market participants.
Runs the risk of rejection by minority shareholders
According to the industry's arguments, royalties are critical for Indian companies specially when it comes to taking advantage of technology and other innovations of their parent companies. ""There could arise a situation where minority shareholders could disapprove royalty payments, which would be a serious impediment in the flow of technology and would hurt a company's competitiveness"".

210,2019-04-29,Maruti,"Maruti, Suzuki plan to invest in startups in India to develop solutions for the shared mobility industryIn India, auto makers are investing in cab aggregators, while developing vehicles more suited for such applications

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and parent Suzuki Motor Corp. are scaling up their bets in the shared mobility industry by developing a multipronged strategy to exploit this rapidly growing market and offset a potential impact on sales of personal vehicles, said two people aware of the plans.
The companies plan to invest in startups in India to develop software solutions for the shared mobility industry comprising both cab aggregators and logistics players for commercial vehicles, said the people cited earlier, requesting anonymity.
Maruti Suzuki has set up a so-called mobility technology department that also works towards developing vehicle models aligned with the needs of cab aggregators, the people said. The department will be headed by Rachapudi Srihari, who was previously the national customer relationship manager at Maruti.
Meanwhile, in an effort seen as supporting Maruti’s venture, Suzuki has opened a new office in Bengaluru, where it has moved some of its employees from Silicon Valley in the US. These executives would also be working with various startups in the mobility space, said the first person cited earlier.
Auto makers globally are expanding their strategies as the fast expanding shared mobility market is expected to impact sales of personal vehicles in the years ahead. This is likely to happen especially in cities where road congestion, higher car prices and parking issues lead more people to choose shared mobility.
In India, auto makers are investing in cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber, while also developing vehicles that are more suited for such applications, including electric and hybrid vehicles.
In March, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group announced an investment of $300 million in India’s biggest cab aggregator, Ola. The deal involves band parking issues lead more people to choose shared mobility.
In India, auto makers are investing in cab aggregators such as Ola and Uber, while also developing vehicles that are more suited for such applications, including electric and hybrid vehicles.
In March, South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group announced an investment of $300 million in India’s biggest cab aggregator, Ola. The deal involves both Hyundai Motor Co. and Kia Motors Corp. to work with the Bengaluru based startup for developing customized electric vehicles and charging stations appropriate for ride-hailing applications. This followed a  ₹100 crore investment made by Hyundai last August in car-sharing platform Revv.
Mint reported on 17 October that Tata Motors Ltd had set up a separate division named Mobility Innovation Hub to explore ways to tap its entire range of passenger and commercial vehicles for offering shared mobility solutions.
The two people cited earlier said Maruti’s long-term objective was to offer “end-to-end solutions"" in the shared mobility space. The company is the biggest supplier of vehicles to cab aggregators in India.
In the beginning, the new department would study various startups in terms of business potential while spearheading the company’s shared mobility activities, they said.
A spokesman for Maruti declined to comment to emailed queries sent on Wednesday.
“Maruti, like some of the other auto makers, has understood the importance of offering mobility solutions directly to the customers. In India, these concepts are at a very nascent stage, but one has to prepare for the future,"" said the first person cited earlier. “The other manufacturers have also been doing the same and Hyundai’s investment in Ola Cabs is an indication.""
The steps by Maruti Suzuki in the shared mobility segment underscored the company’s ability to transform itself in line with changing market conditions, said Puneet Gupta, associate director-vehicle forecast (South Asia) at IHS Markit.
“Fifteen years back, Maruti Suzuki started with new initiatives like entry into used car business, insurance, fleet and accessories business. All of these have been game changers for Maruti Suzuki in the last decade and helped Maruti Suzuki not only maintain their leadership position, but also capture more than 50% market share today,"" Gupta said. “Similarly, we feel Maruti Suzuki’s entry and dedicated focus in areas like mobility, EV (electric vehicle) business would be game changers in the coming years.""
The increasing popularity of shared mobility is likely to slow global vehicle sales as more people will likely choose shared mobility. However, car sales in developing countries are expected to outpace shared mobility’s impact over the next 15 years. Still, through 2030, roughly a third of the expected increase in vehicle sales from urbanization and macroeconomic growth will likely not happen because of shared mobility, according to a McKinsey report.
Auto makers globally are trying to participate in this dynamic market by investing in startups in the mobility ecosystem while supplying custom-made vehicles to these companies.
“Most manufacturers are looking at startups now, but there is risk association with this, since one has to bet on the right startups so that the investment or the association yields value. Hence, a separate division is needed for such projects. Hence Suzuki’s decision to station some of its people in Bengaluru also makes sense,"" said the second person cited earlier."
209,2019-04-29,Maruti,"Suppliers are looking at other options from the carmaker to compensate for the resulting revenue lossesDiesel vehicles contributed about 23% to Maruti’s total sales of 1.75 million vehicles in FY19

MUMBAI :
Bosch Ltd, Continental AG and other vendors to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd are facing business uncertainties following the car maker’s decision to abandon making diesel vehicles from next April.
Those affected are the key engine parts suppliers to diesel powertrains used by India’s largest carmaker in its diesel vehicles, at least four people with knowledge of the matter said. These companies are undergoing a churn in their order books and production plans following Maruti’s decision, the people said, requesting anonymity.
“For Bosch, this is a big blow. The common rail system was a key contributor to our powertrain business in India. Suzuki had hinted us about its plan six-eight months ago. Although this will result into big revenues losses, the company will seek new gasoline-engine specific orders to compensate for the lost business. You will also see a transition in Bosch’s focus, which is now shifting towards electric mobility,"" a senior official from Bosch said, requesting anonymity.
One of the four people cited above said Continental has an assembly line at its plant at Chakan near Pune to make the so-called common rail direct injection or CRDi systems for Maruti Suzuki. “This development will certainly affect their production schedules,"" the person said.
Bosch did not respond to queries while Continental declined to comment to queries emailed on Thursday.
An email sent to Maruti Suzuki remained unanswered till press time.
The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit announced on Thursday its plan to phase out diesel vehicles from 1 April 2020 coinciding with the introduction of stringent Bharat Stage VI norms. It will instead focus on vehicles that run on petrol and compressed natural gas.
Diesel vehicles contributed about 23% to Maruti’s total sales of 1.75 million vehicles in FY19.
The people cited above said key parts suppliers to diesel engines—a Fiat-sourced D13 multijet (commonly known as 1.3 liter DDiS 200) and the in-house developed 1.5 litre DDiS 225—used by Maruti view the diesel phase out plan as a major hit to their businesses.
These suppliers are now looking at other options from the car maker to compensate for the resulting revenue losses, as well as diverting their dedicated production lines and capacity for other vehicle manufacturers and focusing on new technologies among others.
One of the four people said the CRDi system used in modern diesel engines is an “expensive part"" whose suppliers would now be forced to adjust production schedules and find new business opportunities. These include suppliers of key diesel engine parts such as CRDi systems, EGR valves, turbochargers, alternators, starter motors and diesel tanks. Suppliers of pistons, piston rings, cylinder liners, engine blocks and other key parts for diesel engines will also have to re-work their product designs to make them suitable for petrol engines, which will lead to investments in dies and machining of the parts. This will also affect schedules of companies such as Denso, Magneti Marelli Powertrain India and SKH Metals.
A senior industry official, who did not want to be named, said there is an immense churn within Maruti’s supplier community currently. “The carmaker was as it is late to roll out its 1.5 litre diesel engine because it struggled to ensure the engine’s compliance with the BS IV norms. It does not make a business case to further upgrade that engine to meet the BS VI norms. If so, it might cost an additional  ₹1,50,000 to the end consumer. Nevertheless, management decisions are heavily dependent on the ever-changing market dynamics and business cases of a product,"" he said."

204,2019-05-02,Maruti,"Both Maruti and Hyundai reported drop in April salesThis raises concerns both on inventory and demand inertia

If investors expected passenger vehicle (PV) sales to revive in April after a massive inventory clean-up in the March quarter, they will be disappointed. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s sales raced downhill, tumbling 17% from the year-ago period.
Domestic sales drop was worse at 18.2%. Meanwhile, Hyundai Motor India Ltd. failed to bring cheer. Sales on home turf fell 10% year-on-year, although robust exports reduced the magnitude of overall drop.
This does not bode well for the PV industry, considering that Maruti and Hyundai together account for about two-thirds the market share.
Sales break-up from the country’s largest car maker shows the biggest drop of 40% in the mini-car segment. This can be explained by the shift in some models, such as WagonR, to the compact segment. But then, sales in the compact segment, which comprise more than half of Maruti’s passenger vehicle sales, fell 14% year-on-year.
The numbers raise concerns both on inventory and demand inertia, which have struck India’s auto universe. But note that analysts were already factoring in a large drop in sales.
Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd estimated a 16% drop in Maruti’s sales for the month due to lower despatches in the mini segment.
“The weak performance was expected across segments in the domestic market due to the high base effect, purchase deferrals during elections, inventory corrections and funding issues. Volumes should be lower y-o-y despite the favourable timing of the festive season,"" it said in a note to clients.
Industry watchers reckon that higher vehicle prices due to the inclusion of additional safety features from April have perhaps dampened demand.
Meanwhile, the transition in technology due to BS-VI emission norms, which will be enforced from 1 April 2020, and Maruti’s announcement that it would phase out diesel vehicles by 31 March may have put consumers on the back foot.
Some respite for the market leader came from the 6% growth in utility vehicle sales.
The moot question, however, is: Has Maruti lost market share to other incumbents? Numbers from all PV makers will throw light on this front, later this month. Bucking the trend was Honda Cars India Ltd.’s sales grew 23% in April. However, the firm has a small share of the Indian market. Besides, it also added that last year’s base was low on account of a runout of one of its models- Amaze.
Maruti’s shares opened lower on Thursday reiterating subdued growth forecasts for fiscal year 2020."
201,2019-05-03,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki and Hero MotoCorp reported substantial contraction in operating margins in the quarter ended March 31, indicating a tough FY20The increase in commodity costs and discounts also led to reduced profitability 

New Delhi: As a result of significant decline in sales and increase in commodity costs and discounts, the profitability of automobile manufacturers have come under significant pressure in the last quarter of FY19, as most of them are looking to cut costs in several areas of their operations in FY20.
The country’s largest two-wheeler and passenger vehicle manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hero MotoCorp, have reported substantial contraction in operating margins in the quarter ended March 31, indicating a tough FY20.
Maruti Suzuki’s net sales or revenues were down 0.7% to  ₹20,737.5 crore in Q4, while net profit was down 4.6% year-on-year to  ₹1,795 crore. The operating or earning before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margins contracted substantially by 350 basis points to 10.5% during the period.
Ajay Seth, executive director, finance, Maruti Suzuki, said the company will try to cut costs in different aspects of its operations such as sourcing of materials or parts from vendors, employee cost and other overheads to improve profitability.
“When it comes to margins, this quarter is not comparable to the corresponding quarter, given the headwinds we have witnessed due to decline in sales and increase in commodity costs,"" according to Seth.
“We believe that Maruti’s cost-control measures and overall inventory reduction at the industry level would result in lower discounts and bring back pricing power for passenger vehicle makers, going forward. This would help MSIL reach closer to its average EBIDTA margins of around 14% going forward,"" analysts of Reliance Securities said in a report dated 2 May.
For the country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero Moto Corp, the last quarter of FY19 was tough considering that the company had to undergo production cuts to reduce inventory with dealers.
As the revenue during the period decreased 7.9% y-o-y to  ₹7,885 crore and net profit fell 25.5% to  ₹730 crore, operating margins of the company contracted by 240 basis points to 13.6% from 16% in the year-ago period.
“When you sell less vehicles and your costs are fixed, margins will be under pressure. This financial year we are expecting some pre-buying that will help in the second half of the financial year,"" a senior executive of Hero MotoCorp said.
Bangalore-based TVS Motor Company also reported a 19.2% y-o-y decline in net profit to  ₹133.8 crore, while net sales increased 9.2% y-o-y to  ₹4,387.6 crore on account of a meagre 2% increase in total sales.
“We believe that the constant fall in market share and higher inventory would force HMCL to take pricing action. We believe that this situation would encourage the management to take pricing action on select models and also restrict it to pass on full cost escalation of BS-VI in future. Moreover, inventory correction would impact wholesale volumes for FY20. We expect negative impact of competition to continue on HMCL’s margin and profitability,"" the analysts of Reliance Securities said in the report."

April has turned out to be a month of distress for passenger vehicle (PV) and two-wheeler makers because of cautious buyer sentiments during the ongoing general elections. Data compiled by Mint shows that PV and two-wheeler sales declined by about 16% and 17%, respectively, from the year-ago period.
India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, on Wednesday, reported a year-on-year decline of 19.4% in PV sales at 131,749 units, including 364 units sold to other original equipment manufacturers, but excluding the light commercial vehicle sales of 2,319 units.
Across the different PV categories, Maruti Suzuki reported sales of 22,766 units in the mini segment, down 40% compared to 37,794 units in April 2018. Similarly, in the compact segment, sales stood at 72,146 units in April, down 14% from 83,834 units in the year-ago period. It sells Alto and the old WagonR model under its mini segment; and Swift, Baleno, Celerio, the new WagonR, Ignis and Dzire are part of its compact portfolio.
In the mid-size category, where Maruti Suzuki sells the Ciaz sedan, it reported a decline of 45.5% from the year earlier to 2,789 units in April. It had sold 5,116 units of the Ciaz in April 2018.
The company’s utility vehicle (UV) category, which has bucked the downward trend, reported sales of 22,035 units, up 6% against the 20,804 units sold in April last year.
Maruti Suzuki’s UV portfolio includes the Vitara Brezza, Ertiga and S-Cross. The vans category reported a drop of 26.7%, selling 11,649 units last month, against the 15,886 units in April 2018.
Auto analyst Aditya Jhawar from Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, cited three key reasons behind Maruti Suzuki’s downward trend: High base effect from Q1FY19, inventory correction and sluggish demand due to factors, such as liquidity crunch and poor sentiments, among others. “For Maruti Suzuki, the rural markets grew by 10% and urban markets declined by 2% in FY19."" Jhawar added that the Indian market may see an increase in demand for PVs after the elections.
Hyundai Motor India Ltd, India’s second-largest carmaker, reported sales of 42,005 units in April, a decline of 10% from the year earlier. The company is expected to consolidate its market position with the soon-to-be-launched Venue compact sport utility vehicle.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) posted domestic PV sales of 19,966 units, down 9% from a year ago. Its UV segment sales stood at 18,848 units, compared to 20,371 units in April 2018, down 7%. In the cars and vans category, M&M reported sales of 1,118 units, as against 1,556 units in April last year, down 28%. The company said domestic sales also included the numbers sold by its subsidiary, Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd.
“The ongoing elections had subdued purchase sentiment in April. This, according to us, is a temporary phenomenon. We believe, following the elections the auto industry will see a revival in consumer demand. Supported by a normal monsoon, we are confident of seeing higher sales in FY20,"" said Rajan Wadhera, president (automotive sector) at M&M."

India’s auto stocks have lost $42 billion in value in the last 16 months, and some analysts say the rout may not be over.
A gauge of automobile companies has fallen 30 percent since reaching a record in December 2017, and is the worst-performer among 19 sector indexes in the nation’s equity market this year. That’s as the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index rallied to a fresh peak last month.
A slowdown in consumption amid a cash crunch in the banking system has left carmakers with a pile of unsold vehicles in what was one of the world’s fastest-growing auto market until last year. Little surprise then that Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Hero MotoCorp Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. are among the biggest decliners on the Sensex this year, notching losses of up to 20 percent.
“Initial trends are looking weaker than expected,"" Nomura Holdings Inc. analysts Kapil Singh and Siddhartha Bera wrote in a May 2 note. “Most companies in the sector have further earnings risks due to weaker-than-expected demand.""
Passenger vehicle growth in the financial year ended March was the slowest since 2014, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. Maruti Suzuki, the nation’s largest by market share, slid for seven days through Tuesday after saying April revenue declined 17 percent from the year-ago month.
Only two of the 16 companies on the S&P BSE Auto Index have held their heads above water this year: Tata Motors Ltd., the maker of Jaguar Land Rover, rebounded last month after declining to its lowest level since 2011 in February. Bajaj Auto Ltd. is up 11 percent amid an increase in its sales of two-and-three wheelers for the year ended March by a quarter to 5 million units.
Auto companies that have attractive products, are disciplined in managing their inventories and invest in research and development should still outperform during the slowdown, Pramod Kumar and Anubhav Bajpai, analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. wrote in a report.
But they are still cautious: “We don’t see any relief in the near term.""

New Delhi: Auto major Tata Motors may phase out small diesel cars from its portfolio as demand is expected to slow down due to upcoming BS-VI emission norms that would make such vehicles expensive, according to a senior company official.
Already, market leader Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has stated that it would discontinue diesel models from 1 April 2020, when the BS-VI norms kick in, as it expects the increased cost would put most of the diesel cars, especially the smaller ones, out of reach of small car buyers.
Tata Motors currently sells its entry-level hatchback Tiago with 1-litre diesel engine, compact sedan Tigor with 1.05-litre powertrain and older models like the Bolt and the Zest with a 1.3-litre diesel engine.
""We feel that low demand for entry- and mid-size diesel models will not justify the high costs involved in developing a new small capacity engine,"" Tata Motors president passenger vehicles business unit Mayank Pareek told PTI.
Moreover, around 80% of the demand in the said segment is for petrol variants, and thus, the additional required investment does not seem viable, he added.
The company's other products like compact SUV Nexon and recently launched SUV Harrier come with bigger 1.5-litre and 2-litre powertrains respectively and are expected to be upgraded to the next level going ahead.
The company sources the 2-litre diesel engine for Harrier from Fiat.
Pareek said the introduction of BS-VI engines will make the compliance expensive, particularly for small diesel cars.
""Given that these high costs will ultimately have to be passed on to the end customer, the sale of diesel vehicles will logically see a decline in the industry,"" he added.
With diesel cars set to become costlier from the next year with the implementation of stricter BS-VI emission norms, major automakers are contemplating about the future of such vehicles in their portfolios.
Earlier this month, MSI announced phasing out diesel cars from its portfolio with effect from 1 April 2020, coinciding with the transition of the automobile industry to stricter BS VI emission norms.
On the other hand, Ford has said that it will continue to sell diesel models in the country. The automaker, which sells models like EcoSport and Endeavour, said it would be ready with BS VI-compliant diesel powertrains for its model range before the 1 April 2020, deadline.
The Bharat Stage VI (or BS-VI) emission norm would come into force from 1 April 2020, across the country. Currently, the vehicles sold in the country conform to BS IV emission standards.
The Bharat stage emission standards are standards instituted by the government to regulate the output of air pollutants from motor vehicles."

According to the projections made by London based information provider and consultancy firm, IHS Markit, the vehicle sales of the company in the calendar year 2019 will increase by just 2% to 17.9 lakh units and subsequently in 2020, the sales of the company might decline by 3% to 17.3 lakh once the new emission regulations come into effect.
On the other hand, domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, also lowered the volume guidance of the company by 2% in FY 2020 and by 4% in FY 2021. The management of Maruti though is expecting volume growth in FY 2020 to remain in the rage of 4% to 8%.
“We have cut our FY 20 and FY 21 consolidated earnings per share by 2.5% and 4% respectively, as we have trimmed our volume estimates by 2%/4%. Margin estimates have been cut by 60 basis points each in FY20 and FY 21, but we increase our other income estimate,"" said analysts of Motilal Oswal in a report post fourth quarter earnings.
Given the high cost of upgrading the existing diesel engines to BS 6 norms and increasing the gap between the diesel and petrol driven car prices, Suzuki Motor Company decided to phase out all diesel vehicles by March 2020.
“We have taken this decision so that in 2022 we are able to meet the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms and higher share of CNG vehicles will help us comply with the norms. I hope the union government’s policies will help grow the market for CNG vehicles,"" said R C Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, while making the announcement on April 25.
The share of petrol cars in India has risen from 47% in FY14 to 60% in FY18, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). During the same period, the share of diesel vehicles fell from 53% to 40%. In FY 19, almost 23% of the total sales of the company comprised diesel vehicles and analysts think that the company may not be able to shift the entire set of customers to petrol or CNG vehicles.
Mint on 19 April reported that Maruti Suzuki expects to push about half of its diesel car buyers to shift to petrol or CNG cars by offering incentives, and also provide CNG options in more models. It, however, fears that the remainder will shift to diesel cars of rival brands, according to an internal projection prepared by senior executives of Maruti."

Maruti Suzuki’s plan to phase out its diesel car portfolio from April 2020 is not a positive development for us, Schaeffler India CEO Dharmesh Arora confirmed in an analyst conference call on 6 May. He was speaking about the impact India’s largest carmaker’s decision would leave on Schaeffler India’s annual business next year.
Arora said that the change in diesel mix (vis-à-vis petrol) alone will impact about 3% of his company’s (automotive) topline as he sees a drastic drop in the penetration of the diesel vehicles in the overall passenger vehicle segment.
“Declining production of diesel cars is not good news for us as there is a lot more content that goes in a diesel engine as compared to the petrol engine. No production of diesel vehicles from April 2020 will result into loss of big volumes (of associated parts) for us,"" he said while responding to an analyst.
According to Arora, a diesel engine consumes additional content worth  ₹3,000 –  ₹5,000 more than that in a petrol engine, and is costlier in the range of  ₹75,000 –  ₹100,000 over its petrol counterparts. To put this in perspective, diesel vehicles contributed about 23% to Maruti Suzuki’s total sales of 1.75 million vehicles in FY19. Schaeffler India’s revenues will be impacted as per its share in Maruti’s order book, which remains undisclosed at the moment.
“The diesel penetration in the passenger vehicle (PV) segment has declined by 10% when compared to the corresponding period a year ago. It now stands at 26% of the overall PV segment. Upcoming quarters this year may face increased level of volatility in the market during the transition to the BSVI emission norms,"" Arora added.
He, however, is also expecting fresh orders via newer content that may be mandatorily required for petrol engines to ensure compliance with the BSVI norms going forward. On 29 April, Mint had reported that suppliers of key parts such as that of the powertrain and others are facing business uncertainties following Maruti Suzuki’s decision of phasing out its diesel portfolio from, April next year.
Responding to Mint’s query, Schaeffler India said that it supplies several engine and transmission components to Maruti Suzuki. “We supply several engine and transmission components – right from wheel bearings to clutches."" The company, however, did not disclose what new petrol engine specific parts it is looking to supply to Maruti Suzuki to compensate for the outgoing parts business.
Maruti Suzuki is Schaeffler India’s largest customer in the PV segment. The company also supplies parts to Tata Motors, Hyundai Motor India, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and others. Schaeffler India posted total turnover of  ₹4,562 crore in CY18 and  ₹1,172 crore in Q1 CY19 (up 8.2% year-on-year). According to its sales mix of Q1 CY19, mobility solutions contributed 80% while the remaining 20% came from others. Revenues from automotive, industrial and exports stood at 48%, 42% and 10% respectively during the period."

Retail sales of passenger vehicles, an indicator of urban demand, fell by 2% to 242,457 units from 247,278 units in the year earlier.
The drop in retail sales follows an even faster decline in wholesale dispatches reported by the companies in April. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest automobile maker, reported a 19% drop in sales to 133,704 units, while the second-largest, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, posted a volume decline of 10%. The third largest carmaker, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, reported a 9% drop in vehicle dispatches in April.
Commercial vehicle sales fell 16% to 63,360 units owing to a slowdown in economic activity, lack of availability of finance and slow transmission of interest rate reductions.
The new truck axle norms, which allow trucks to carry more freight, along with a high base effect, also had an adverse impact on retail sales of commercial vehicles.
Fada president Ashish Harsharaj Kale said that inventory has come down from the extremely high levels of January and February, but is still well above the normal 30-day period.
“The near-term outlook continues to be negative with the absence of any immediate positive triggers which could affect retail sales.

Average stocks of commercial vehicles with dealers are also in the same range.
According to a statement issued by Fada, most of the vehicle categories reported a decline in sales due to the high base effect in the year-earlier period.
Thirty-nine percent of the members of the lobby group are of the opinion that the current liquidity scenario is quite bad for retail business while 47% think the situation is neither negative nor positive, the survey found.
“The liquidity situation has eased for customers compared to what we had experienced since the bankruptcy announcement of IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd) but for the dealers it is still very tough.

196,2019-05-09,Maruti,"The Indian economy may be heading for a slowdown, according to the worrying numbers posted by automobile and fast moving consumer goods companiesManufacturing and services benchmarks are also sending out a similar warning

Is there reason to fear a slowdown?
Considering the recent numbers reported by companies in India across several sectors, a slowdown this fiscal is a threat. Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest automobile company, has reported 18.7% weaker domestic sales in April than those a year ago. Hindustan Unilever and Dabur India have reported single-digit volume growth year-on-year in the March quarter. The aviation sector in India has also been struggling. Growth in air passenger traffic fell for four straight months till March. In a sign of weakness in the farm sector, domestic sales of Escorts’ tractors were down 18.2% to 4,986 units from those a year ago.
What are the possible reasons?
One reason is the dearth of jobs, along with job insecurity and meagre wage hikes. Note ban is also a big factor. That exercise saw a lot of money being invested in real estate and gold. Many non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) borrowed heavily when the system was flush with cash. As those construction and infrastructure projects that these NBFCs lent to got stuck for various reasons, the developers could not pay them. NBFCs, in turn, could not repay the banks and mutual funds. These NBFCs are unable to lend now. This is hurting consumers, who are already worried because of job insecurity.
Are there structural reasons, too?
The reasons are more than structural. There is insecurity among people as jobs are no longer permanent. They are thus not sure where they would live next. Flat incomes are also a worry.
How do consumers respond?
Consumption patterns change. People reduce consumption of goods other than essentials. More sachets and smaller packets are bought. Some families may opt for “cord cutting"", which means a reduction or doing away with DTH and cable connections. People eat out less. Low-cost houses gain demand. Families that had earlier wanted to buy three-bedroom homes settle for two-bedroom options. People fly less and use trains. All this can hurt companies, leading to job losses as factories need fewer workers to run them.
Is there another devil around?
﻿A lot depends on the monsoon and the new government’s policies. The Met department has predicted near normal rains, while private forecaster Skymet expects a below normal monsoon. If Skymet is correct, farm incomes would be further stressed, adding to the agrarian crisis. Incomes of consumer goods firms would be adversely affected. Inflation could rise and so could government borrowing, further crowding out private investment. Much depends on how the new government tackles the crisis affecting NBFCs."
195,2019-05-09,Maruti,"Maruti reduces production by 9.6% to 163,368 units in April, in March by 20.9%, in February by 8.3%In fiscal year 2019, Maruti Suzuki’s vehicle sales grew 6.1% to around 1.75 million units, the lowest in five years

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle maker, has cut production for the third consecutive month in April underscoring tepid demand for automobiles.
The maker of Swift and Baleno cars reduced production by 9.6% to 163,368 vehicles in April, according to a regulatory filing.
Like most passenger vehicle makers, sales at the local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. have remained subdued since September last year due to weak consumer sentiment caused by factors such as a liquidity squeeze and higher fuel as well as vehicle prices.
In March, the New Delhi-based company cut production by 21% to 136,201 vehicles, following on a 8.3% reduction in February to 148,959 vehicles. Maruti’s top management has guided for a sales growth of 4-8% in this fiscal year.
Bharat Gianani, an analyst at ShareKhan, said the third straight month of production cut by Maruti is a reflection that the passenger vehicle market is continuing to remain under pressure with industry volumes falling 15% in April 2019 due to weak consumer sentiment on account of slowing economic growth, increase in ownership cost due to regulatory insurance and safety features and uncertainty before the general elections.
Maruti first cut production in February as dealers were saddled with inventory ranging from 45-60 days after Diwali last year when car sales lagged expectations. The step was taken to match wholesale dispatches with retail demand.
In FY19, Maruti’s vehicle sales grew 6.1% to around 1.75 million units, the lowest in five years. Data issued by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers showed that total domestic passenger vehicle sales rose a meagre 2.7% in FY19 to nearly 3.38 million vehicles.
Indicating the lack of recovery in urban and rural demand before the announcement of election results, Maruti reported a 19% drop in wholesales, or factory dispatches, to 133,704 vehicles in April, while second-largest, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, posted a 10% decline. The third-largest passenger vehicle maker, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, posted a 9% drop in wholesales in April.
According the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, retail sales of passenger vehicles, an indicator of urban demand, fell 2% from the year earlier in April to 242,457 vehicles, while overall vehicle sales fell 8% during the month.
“Every time before the general elections, vehicle sales across segments slow down and subsequently the market recovers but we cannot expect a quick recovery. This happened in both 2009 and in 2014. The stock market is growing and the Indian economy is also expected to grow. So, the automobile industry cannot remain behind if economy keeps growing,"" R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti, said at the company’s March quarter earnings press conference.
Slowdown in vehicle sales have also impacted Maruti’s financial performance in the last fiscal year with the company reporting a 2.9% drop in net profit to  ₹7,500.6 crore in FY19, while revenue grew 6.3% to  ₹8,3026.5 crore.
“We expect production cuts to continue in the near term due to subdued demand and higher channel inventory. Operating deleverage due to subdued volumes coupled with higher discounting due to increased competition would impact earnings in the near term. We had recently downgraded the stock from Buy to Hold and retain a cautious view on the stock,"" Gianani said."
194,2019-05-12,Maruti,"Honda plans to start rolling out models with upgraded BS-VI engines in both petrol and diesel variants Honda currently has two diesel engines in its line-up

New Delhi: Japanese auto major Honda will continue to offer diesel models in India even after BS-VI emission norms kick in, unlike Maruti Suzuki which has decided to stop selling diesel cars from April 1, 2020.
According to a senior official of Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL), the company plans to upgrade its two diesel engines, which power models like Amaze, City, WR-V, BR-V, Civic and CR-V to conform to stricter BS-VI emission norms.
The auto major plans to start rolling out models with upgraded BS-VI engines in both petrol and diesel from the fourth quarter of this fiscal.
""From our experience, for the fuel choice among petrol or diesel, 80 per cent of customers make a rational choice based on consideration of driving distance and recovery period. However, there are still 20 per cent customers who make an emotional choice towards a particular fuel,"" HCIL Senior Vice President and Director (Marketing & Sales) Rajesh Goel told PTI.
The company will take care of these 20 per cent emotional choice buyers as well, he added.
Goel acknowledged that fuel dynamics will change after BS-VI implementation from the next year with a price gap increasing between petrol and diesel models.
""But we believe the demand for diesel will not vanish immediately. Therefore, we will continue to offer the diesel models in line with market demand and gradually move towards future alternatives,"" he said.
The company currently has two diesel engines in its line-up and they will be made BS-VI compliant, Goel added.
HCIL currently sells Amaze, WR-V, City and BR-V with 1.5 litre diesel engine, while Civic and CR-V are powered by 1.6 litre diesel powertrain. The models are also available with petrol engine options.
With diesel cars set to become costlier from the next year with the implementation of stricter BS-VI emission norms, major automakers are contemplating about the future of such vehicles in their portfolios.
Already, market leader Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has stated that it would discontinue diesel models from 1 April 2020, when the BS-VI norms kick in as it expects the increased cost would put most of the diesel cars especially the smaller ones out of reach of small car buyers.
Besides, Tata Motors has also hinted to phase out small diesel cars from its portfolio as demand is expected to slow down due to upcoming BS-VI emission norms. Ford, on the other hand, has said, it will continue to sell diesel models in the country.
Goel said, the company's progress towards implementation of safety regulations and BS-VI regulations was on course.
""Smooth run-out of BS-IV vehicles and switch over to BS-VI vehicles will be a key task during this financial year. HCIL will progressively introduce BS-VI compliant models from fourth quarter of this fiscal,"" he said.
As for the recently launched models such as Civic and CR-V, petrol variants are already complying with BS-VI norms, he added.
The Bharat Stage VI (or BS-VI) emission norm would come into force from 1 April 2020 across the country. Currently, the vehicles sold in the country conform to BS-IV emission standards.
The Bharat stage emission standards are standards instituted by the government to regulate the output of air pollutants from motor vehicles.

193,2019-05-13,Maruti,"The intent to localize key parts and aggregates in a reasonable time frame will benefit all stakeholdersWhile there is a broad agreement, certain deadlines by which manufacturers have to localize specific items may not be feasible to all

MUMBAI :
Top automakers have cheered the government’s recent push to localise manufacturing for hybrid and electric vehicle (xEV) under the revised norms of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid &) Electric Vehicles Scheme (FAME 2).
This is in sharp contrast to the several instances over the last decade where auto industry stakeholders have clashed with government agencies on multiple fronts such as dual fuel policy, roll out of CNG stations, vehicular pollution, emission norms, safety mandates, as well as the government’s thrust on biofuels and electrification of vehicles.
Mint had on 7 May reported that the latest draft guidelines on FAME list components such as control units, chargers, and AC units that need to be built locally, with specific deadlines, for manufacturers to qualify for subsidies under a government scheme launched to encourage the adoption of such vehicles.
FAME, which was introduced on 1 April 2015, entered its second phase (FAME 2) in April 2019.
The country’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki has already made significant investment in the local xEV supply chain and is setting up an EV battery plant in Gujarat and others are expected to follow suit.
“The intent to localize the key parts and aggregates in a reasonable timeframe will benefit all stakeholders in the long term,"" said Shailesh Chandra, president, electric mobility business and corporate strategy, Tata Motors. “Our team is studying the latest notification to understand its full implications. The government’s approach of defining a PMP (phased manufacturing program) does help bring clarity to the value chain, including the suppliers, to work towards progressive localization,"" he said.
“Tata Motors has a local supplier base available for most of the parts notified under the PMP and is working closely with the identified suppliers to localize the remaining parts,"" he said.
“The PMP under FAME 2 will boost local manufacturing of EV components, including the battery packs, power electronics, and electric motors to be made in India for the world,"" said Mahesh Babu, chief executive officer, Mahindra Electric.
“Our EV strategy is in line with the government’s vision of making India a sustainable EV market,"" said Puneet Anand, senior general manager and group head, marketing, Hyundai Motor India. Mint had reported on 19 April that Hyundai is talking to suppliers to develop EV parts in India.
While there is a broad agreement, certain deadlines by which manufacturers have to localize specific items may not be feasible to all.
“These issues are under discussions with the government and we hope a few alterations will be incorporated,"" said Karthick Athmanathan, head, EV and eMobility solutions, Ashok Leyland. The Chennai-based company said that as part of cost rationalization, aftermarket spare support, and inventory control, it has been engaged with its EV suppliers for the past one year.
Nishant Arya, executive director, JBM Group, also agreed that the move is a positive step towards India’s adoption of EVs but also demands clarity on incentives at the supplier level. “The key requirement here is clarity on incentives on these investments to domestic manufacturers. This shall give them an opportunity to plan and work towards investing in innovation and technology, creating an overall robust ecosystem,"" Arya said.
The incentives under FAME 2 are strictly for localization and not for funding imports, said Vinnie Mehta, director general, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India. He, however, expects the government to relax deadlines for genuine challenges on a case-by-case basis."

As result of the slowdown in the economy because of consumer uncertainty before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and liquidity crunch in the non-banking financial companies, dispatches of passenger vehicles declined 17% year-on-year in April to 247,541 units, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.
Domestic car sales declined 19.9% to 160,279 units in April, while utility vehicles sales fell 6.6% to 73,854 units during the period, according to the data.
In April, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 19% fall in dispatches, while other manufacturers like Hyundai Motor India ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd also reported double digit fall in volumes.
According to Vishnu Mathur, director general, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, some kind of recovery in sales will come only after the general elections are over as consumers resume thinking on discretionary spends.
“Demand in the rural economy is not looking great and it has reflected in the sales of motorcycles which were down by 11.8%. We cannot expect a sudden recovery in sales any time soon,"" added Mathur.
In the commercial vehicle segment, dispatches of heavy and medium duty vehicles declined 13.5% to 24,725 units in April, while light commercial vehicle sales declined a meager 1.1%.
In an indication of subdued demand in rural and urban markets, sales of scooters fell a sharp 25.8% to 489,852 units, while motorcycles sales declined by 11.81% to 1,084,811 units.

190,2019-05-15,Maruti,"Cars may sport Nexa brand; another badge will target younger customersGlobal auto firms have used this structure so they can attract customers for cars at different price points

NEW DELHI :
Suzuki Motor Corp. is exploring the possibility of having two more brands in India, emulating Japanese rivals Honda Motor Co. Ltd, Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd that sell vehicles under more than one brand name.
All vehicles produced by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, currently sport the Suzuki badge. What the company is deliberating is to carve out Nexa, its premium chain of dealerships, into a separate brand, with vehicles under it possibly sporting a new badge in the future. The company is also evaluating the possibility of a third brand to attract consumers in the 25-35 age bracket, two people directly aware of the developments said, requesting anonymity.
Suzuki and Maruti are discussing the revamped strategy, which they feel is critical for the local unit to maintain its dominance of the Indian market through 2030. If implemented, this could be one of the most significant initiatives of Suzuki in its more than three-decade-long presence in India.
“This strategy will be useful for Maruti Suzuki since they need to evolve as a company to sell 4-5 million vehicles by 2030 and such a step is needed to stay ahead of competition,"" said the first person cited earlier. “Suzuki may also get some of Toyota’s vehicles in the Nexa brand as part of the collaboration.""
A spokesperson for Maruti termed the development “incorrect"" in response to emailed queries sent on 7 May.
Toyota and Suzuki have a pact to sell each other’s cars in India. While Suzuki will supply its premium hatchback Baleno and compact sport utility vehicle Vitara Brezza to Toyota, Suzuki will source Toyota’s popular sedan Corolla and sell it through the dealership network of Maruti.
The Nexa chain of dealerships was formed by Maruti in 2015 to sell its premium vehicles such as the Baleno and the S-Cross crossover vehicle. Maruti garnered nearly 20% of its total sales volume in FY19 from Nexa dealerships.
The process of building a separate brand for Nexa would start from 2022-23, when the life cycle of the current products in Nexa would come to an end, said the two people cited earlier. Maruti sells its other models through the Arena network of dealerships.
According to the first person, Maruti Suzuki needs to have a separate brand as it will be difficult to sell at least 4 million vehicles from a single channel.
Globally, companies have followed this structure so that they can attract customers for products at different price points. Toyota has the premium brand Lexus as well as the Daihatsu minicar brand. Nissan sells cars under the Nissan, Datsun and Infiniti brands, while Honda has its namesake as well as the Acura premium brand.
Puneet Gupta, associate director of vehicle forecasting at IHS Markit, said, Indian consumers have shown tremendous confidence and trust in NEXA channel and this has helped Maruti Suzuki move into next orbit of almost 1.9 million cars annually.
“Nexa as a brand can be a master stroke to target premium customers. Consumers are full of aspiration these days and products need to be differentiated not only at the distribution channel, but also from the quality, features and technology perspective,"" Gupta said. “We feel this is a must strategy in case Maruti Suzuki wants to sustain their market share above 50% in India as a sales group.""
The Nexa brand has managed to consolidate Maruti’s position in segments such as premium hatchback and crossover, where customers did not prefer the company’s products earlier.
In FY19, wholesale dispatches of the Baleno rose 11% to 212,330 units, while the S-Cross posted a 22% increase to 37,822 units. Sales of the Ciaz sedan, however, fell 22% to 46,169 units.
The second person cited earlier said that once Nexa was separated as a different brand, the vehicles would share the same platform but have substantial changes in the rest of the structure and this would be quite challenging for Suzuki’s engineering department.
“In companies like Volkswagen, vehicles across the brands share the main platform but have significant changes in the rest of the structure. Suzuki after three or four years may have three brands to cater to different customers,"" the second person said. “They are talking of a separate brand for young customers since Maruti’s offerings have never been an enticing prospect for young customers as opposed to a Hyundai."""
189,2019-05-15,Maruti,"Ministry of Heavy Industries has been trying to push automakers to invest in local manufacturing of electric vehicleThe ministry has now adopted a time bound approach to gradually increase local production of electric vehicles and related parts

The Centre should encourage state transport units to accommodate more electric vehicles in their respective fleets and promote hybrid vehicles besides electric ones to boost domestic production of critical components like lithium batteries, electric motors and others, said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
The Ministry of Heavy Industries has been trying to push automakers to invest in domestic manufacturing of electric vehicles and spare parts to avail the subsidy under the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid vehicles. In March, the government earmarked a  ₹10,000-crore subsidy for promoting electric mobility in India. The ministry has now adopted a time bound approach to gradually increase domestic production of electric vehicles and related parts.
According to Ayukawa, the largest factor which can help localization is volumes. Generating economies of scale is more important than the subsidy itself.
“In cars, the components like battery, motor, inverter etc. are common to electric vehicles, strong hybrid electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. If we also encourage hybrid vehicles then the volume of these core components goes up,"" said Ayukawa while delivering his speech at the Electric vehicle Localisation Conference organised by Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India.
The central government initially was not keen on offering subsides to hybrid vehicles but intense lobbying by Japanese manufacturers convinced the government to offer incentives to strong hybrid vehicles.
“We are looking at a market for electric vehicles worth are  ₹50,000 crore in the next three years. At a macro level, we should look at how India can be a net exporter of components, said A R Sihag, secretary, department of heavy industries.
As the union government has been pushing for more localisation of spare parts, ACMA organised this one day conference to showcase the investment made by component manufacturing companies in the electric vehicle space.
The Centre has been urging manufacturers to invest in setting up manufacturing capacities of electric vehicles in the domestic market.
“From the various notifications of the government, it is clear that the policy direction is progressively towards Make in India and minimum imports. Our cars are almost completely localized, the residual imports are mostly electrical parts and so for further localization of our cars is very important,"" added Ayukawa.
Most start-ups and component manufacturers investing in developing products and related items for electric vehicles are facing challenges from rapid change in technology in this segment which call for more funds for investments in research and development."
188,2019-05-21,Maruti,"In 2017, South Korean firm Hyundai Motor Co's India unit was fined $12.5 million by CCI for antitrust violationsCCI is looking into allegations that Maruti forces its dealers to limit the discounts they offer

New Delhi: India's antitrust regulator, Competition Commission of India (CCI), is looking into allegations that Maruti Suzuki, the country's biggest car maker, resorted to anti-competitive practices by controlling how its dealers discounted cars, three people aware of the matter said.
Maruti Suzuki, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, is a household name in India where it commands a 51% market share. It sold 1.73 million passenger vehicles in the year to March and has nearly 3,000 dealers in the country.
The Competition Commission of India is looking into allegations that Maruti forces its dealers to limit the discounts they offer, effectively stifling competition among them and harming consumers who could have benefited from lower prices if dealers operated freely, the people told Reuters.
It was not clear over which period Maruti allegedly engaged in this conduct, but one of the people with direct knowledge of the case said the CCI has been reviewing the allegations for about 10 months. A final decision on whether there needs to be a full investigation has not been reached, the person added.
The sources declined to be identified as details of the case were not public. Maruti Suzuki and the CCI did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Automakers typically sell cars at wholesale prices to dealers, who sell them to customers at a higher retail price that includes their commissions. It is up to the dealer to offer discounts and take a lower profit margin, which they often do.
Car makers at times set a limit on discounts its dealers could offer to ensure there is no price war among them, two of the sources said, but Indian law says the practice, described as ""resale price maintenance"", is prohibited if it causes ""appreciable adverse effect on competition in India"".
Similar to Hyundai case
In 2017, South Korean firm Hyundai Motor Co's India unit was fined $12.5 million by CCI for antitrust violations including resale price maintenance.
The CCI found Hyundai fixed the maximum amount of discount for its cars and restricted competition among dealers.
Hyundai was also penalising dealers who breached the set discount controls, the CCI said at the time.
""The Maruti case is similar to Hyundai, it's a resale price maintenance issue,"" the person with knowledge of the case said.
An appeals court overturned the fine on Hyundai last year, citing lack of evidence, but the CCI has challenged the ruling at the Supreme Court. The case is still pending.
Karan Singh Chandhiok, a lawyer who represented Hyundai in the case, said the company had argued at the time that it was a smaller player with about a 14% market share and its alleged conduct could not hurt the broader passenger car market.
If the CCI finds merit in allegations against Maruti and launches a full probe, the case could be far stronger than the one against Hyundai as Maruti accounts for more than half of India's car market, an antitrust official told Reuters.
Car makers like Hyundai, Tata Motors and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp all sell cars in India, but Maruti has for decades been the dominant player. One of every two cars sold in India is a Maruti - the company which popularised small cars in the country with its Maruti 800 model.
""Maruti has the market power, if such a big player restricts discounts of dealers, customers are left with fewer options,"" said the antitrust official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media.

187,2019-05-22,Maruti,"Firms such as Japan’s Toyota Motor and Honda Motor have also been investing in hydrogen fuel cell electric vehiclesOthers, such as Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd, have also been investing in hydrogen fuel cell EVs

NEW DELHI :
South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group is placing strong bets on electric vehicles (EVs) that run on hydrogen fuel cells, even as several of its global rivals sharpen their strategies towards lithium-ion battery-based EVs for eco-friendly transport.
“The final solution will probably be hydrogen. Battery electric will only be an interim solution. Especially when you look at the big commercial buses. We are now pushing hydrogen a lot into commercial applications as well. We have a project in Europe where we can beat combustion engines,"" Albert Biermann, head of research and development, Hyundai, said on Tuesday.
Others, such as Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. Ltd, have also been investing in hydrogen fuel cell EVs.
Hyundai has been developing both battery electric, as well as hydrogen fuel cell EVs. In India, it is expected to launch its first EV later this fiscal year.
With the growing focus of companies on EVs, Hyundai is expected to face stiff competition from Nissan Motor Co. Ltd and Volkswagen AG, which recently showcased its ID3 electric hatchback.
Biermann, however, said that Hyundai is leading its competitors from Germany, Japan and the US on innovations in alternative powertrains.
“If I take all this (innovation) into one picture, then we are very much leading (this space). In hydrogen, we are already in second generation and we are increasing production. This year, we have built 7,000 units of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles already. We started with the Ionic hybrid and immediately it was the best in the segment. If you look at our Kona EV, it has almost double the range per kilo watt hour battery compared to all premium electric vehicles coming out of Germany,"" he said on the sidelines of the launch of Hyundai’s sport-utility (SUV) vehicle Venue.
The Venue, which is Hyundai’s smallest SUV globally, starts at  ₹6.5 lakh, extending up to  ₹11.1 lakh. The vehicle will also be sold across developed markets, including the US, Canada and Australia.
The Venue will compete against Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s Vitara Brezza, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s XUV300, Ford Motor Co.’s EcoSport and Tata Motors Ltd’s Nexon in the fast-growing compact SUV segment in India.
As Hyundai seeks to morph itself into a mobility solutions provider from just an automaker, it is exploring ways to make special purpose vehicles for fleet operators in countries like India and understand the business of ride-hailing services. The connected vehicle solutions offered by Hyundai will also help fleet operators run their vehicles efficiently.
Biermann said, in the future, mobility will shift from personal car buyers to fleet services. “We are now investing in mobility services because we can foresee a scenario where private car buyers will be less in the metropolitan areas where mobility would shift away from private car buyers to fleet or ride-hailing service providers. We have to make sure that we understand that business and can be a part of that. This is why we are making such investments.""
Hyundai has invested $300 million in India’s top cab aggregator Ola Cabs, while it invested an undisclosed amount in Revv, a self-drive car rental platform. It has also partnered ALD Automotive, a vehicle leasing platform.
Hyundai plans to establish its presence in various mobility services in India and other markets worldwide, which includes offering connected solutions and electrified vehicles.
The company on Tuesday launched its connected vehicle solutions BlueLink with the Venue.
It is also expected that other products of the company will also be equipped with this technology in the future.
Mint on 2 May reported that Hyundai plans to make Ola Cabs the test bed for a new range of affordable electric vehicles slated for introduction around 2021.
“In some restricted fence areas, there can be early transition into autonomous cars and then you can make a robot taxi or something. At this point, we aren’t there yet. Specially in India, this will not happen any time soon but in other areas it is possible to make special purpose built vehicles for such applications,"" Biermann said."
186,2019-05-28,Maruti,"The move could improve profitability for the firm’s dealers and reduce its overall investment burdenThe small-format dealerships will boost the reach of Maruti’s premium products in small towns

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest vehicle manufacturer by volume, aims to set up small-format and mobile showrooms for its Nexa chain of premium dealerships. The move could improve the profitability for the dealers and reduce the overall investment burden.
The new small-format dealerships will improve the reach of Maruti’s premium products in small towns and rural areas, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
“We have been continuously getting requests from customers seeking the Nexa experience in the cities where we were not present. To serve these customers, we plan to establish smaller Nexa showrooms. These will have a 2-car display facility and will offer the same Nexa experience offered by our current Nexa outlets across the country. These showrooms will help us come closer to customers seeking the Nexa experience and enhance customer convenience,"" a spokesperson of Maruti Suzuki said on Monday in response to an email.
“Nexa is the most successful premium retail network in the country. In less than four years, it has established itself as the country’s fastest-growing retail channel and contributes more than 20% of Maruti Suzuki’s total sales. Nexa is present in over 200 cities with more than 360 outlets. It has more than 9 lakh happy customers,"" said the spokesperson.
The Nexa chain of dealerships is restricted to top cities, as the products typically cater to the well-to-do urban buyers. Return on investment has also been declining as the cost of setting up a Nexa showroom in metros and tier-I cities are substantial because of increased competition, high real estate prices, employee costs and other operational expenses, return on investment has been declining for dealers. Maruti aims to expand its reach to smaller towns and cities through premium dealerships, given that sales volumes in urban centres have been declining because of the emergence of ride-hailing services such as Ola and Uber.
The decision is part of Maruti’s cost-cutting initiative, which also looks to help all stakeholders, including dealers, to increase profits, according to one of the persons mentioned above.
“The small-format outlet will require lower investments and will provide some relief to dealer partners. Also, apart from Nexa, the Arena channel can also be included in the small-format model. Maruti is trying to reduce dealer costs at different levels and some of this will also reflect in workshops,"" the person said.
Maintaining financial viability of dealer partners have been high on the agenda of most vehicle manufacturers, given that dealers have been working with stressed balance sheets.
Maruti had launched the Nexa chain of premium dealerships in 2015 to sell its products priced at more than  ₹6 lakh.
On 4 April, Mint had reported that Maruti will build new showrooms at its own cost and lease them out to dealers to minimize the capital costs of its dealer partners and help them maintain profitability. This company will use its  ₹30,000-crore cash surplus to fund the initiative.
According to the second person, Maruti treats its dealer partners as part of the company and not a third-party. “This move will limit the amount of money that needs to be invested and will be a welcome development for the dealers at a time when banks are reluctant to lend to automobile dealers."

The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) Monday shut production for a day at its plants near here to manage rising inventory levels, sources said.
The company's installed manufacturing capacity at its two plants in Gurgaon and Manesar in Haryana stands at around 15.5 lakh units per annum.
According to the industry sources, the company gave employees at the two plants a day off on Monday as it faced issues regarding stocking of cars.
When contacted over the issue, company officials declined to comment.
Earlier this month, MSI had slashed its vehicle production by around 10 per cent in April. It was the company's third consecutive month of taking a production cut.
It had also reduced production in February and March this year.
Overall passenger vehicle sales in India dropped over 17 per cent in April, the worst monthly fall in nearly eight years, as subdued sentiment and the ongoing liquidity crunch impacted car sales.

New Delhi: To harness solar power for its energy needs Maruti Suzuki India Ltd - country’s largest vehicle manufacturer- on Wednesday announced setting up of a solar power plant with a capacity of 5 megawatt in its manufacturing facility in Gurugram.
The company will invest around  ₹24 crore, and will offset carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the tune of over 5390 tonnes annually, for the next 25 years. This is the second grid based solar power plant for Maruti Suzuki. The first solar power plant was set up in 2014 at Manesar, with 1 MW capacity. In 2018, this solar power plant was further expanded to 1.3 mega watt, Maruti Suzuki said in a press statement issued.
The power generated from the solar power plant will be synchronised with the captive power plant to cater to the internal energy needs of the Gurugram facility.
According to Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director, Maruti Suzuki, solar energy is abundant, versatile and efficient. This solar power initiative is in line with the company’s philosophy to adopt environment friendly technologies and lower CO2 emissions.
“Through this solar power plant facility we will harness renewable energy for our business needs over next 25 years. Maruti Suzuki is committed to expand its environment care initiatives in products, in manufacturing processes and in business operations,"" added Ayukawa.
The energy requirement at Maruti’s manufacturing facilities is met by Natural Gas-based captive power plant, supported by grid power. The new solar power plant will complement the power generating capability at the manufacturing plant."

US stock futures, Asian share markets and oil prices slipped to multi-month lows on Monday on mounting worries growing Sino-US tensions and Washington’s new tariff threats against Mexico could tip the global economy into a recession.
Japan’s Nikkei skidded 1.1% to a four-month low. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was little changed in early trade, but held barely above last week’s four-month low. US stocks dropped on Friday, as the S&P 500 closed out the month with its biggest May slump since 2010, after President Donald Trump's surprise threat of tariffs on Mexico fuelled fears that a trade war on multiple fronts could lead to a recession.
Tensions between the United States and China escalated during the weekend as the two countries clashed over trade, technology and security. A senior Chinese official and trade negotiator said on Sunday the United States cannot use pressure to force a trade deal on China, refusing to be drawn on whether the leaders of the two countries would meet at the G20 summit to work out an agreement later this month.
The standoff between the world’s two largest economies go beyond trade, with tension running high ahead of the 30th anniversary of a bloody Chinese military crackdown on protesters around Beijing’s Tiananmen Square. China’s Defence Minister Wei Fenghe warned the United States not to meddle in security disputes over Taiwan and the South China Sea.
In a sign that Sino-US frictions are putting a big strain on the global economy, South Korea’s exports - seen as a bellwether of world growth- fell 9.4% fall in May, worse than a median forecast for a 5.6% decline, official data showed on Saturday.
Back home, the macro-economic picture is not much different except that investors are expecting the new government to push economy with some big bang reforms. Data released on Friday showed that with growth has slipped to a nearly five-year low of 5.8%. The newly revamped National Statistical Office (NSO) also slashed its full-year growth estimate for 2018-19 from the estimated 7% earlier to 6.8%.
Meanwhile, all eyes are on the monetary policy review this week. The central bank is expected to cut the key policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) as inflation cooled and economic growth slowed to a five-year low, according to economists and bankers surveyed by Mint.
Shares of auto companies are likely to be in focus on Monday as car sales skid again in May while consumer demand remained sluggish. On Saturday, automobile major Maruti Suzuki India said its overall sales including that to original equipment manufacturer (OEM) for May declined by 22% to 134,641 units from 172,512 units' off-take recorded during the corresponding period of the last year.
The global gloomy outlook has prompted traders to increase bets that the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates sooner rather than later. Fed funds rate futures are now almost fully pricing in a rate cut by September, with about 50% chance of a move by July 30-31. The 10-year US Treasuries yield fell to as low as 2.12%, a nadir last seen in September 2017.
In oil markets, US crude futures dropped 1.6% in early trade to $52.64, touching their weakest levels since mid-February. Brent crude futures tumbled 1.6% to $61.01 per barrel, hitting lows last seen in late January. Oil prices were also pressured by a sudden about-face by the Trump administration on Iran. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday Washington is prepared to engage with Iran without pre-conditions about its nuclear program.
In the currency market, the safe-haven yen held firm. The dollar changed hands at 108.19 yen, having dipped to as low as 108.17, its weakest level since mid-January. The euro, which has been declining at a steady pace this year, was little moved $1.1171, off last week’s low of $1.1116.
The Chinese yuan traded at 6.9418 per dollar, near 5-1/2-month lows of 6.9497 touched on May 17. The Mexican peso, hit by Trump’s sudden threat to impose tariffs on Friday, regained some stability, trading at 19.6355 to the dollar, after its 2.5% fall on Friday. Mexico’s president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador hinted on Saturday his country could tighten migration controls to defuse tensions with Trump, saying he expected “good results"" from talks planned in Washington this week.

181,2019-06-06,Maruti,"Tata plans to make inroads into small towns, rural pockets and even villages where not a single car has been sold so farTata Motors is also re-aligning its digital strategy due to the growing influence of digital medium

Tata Motors Ltd has started work on its Turnaround 2.0 plan for passenger vehicles, focused on making deeper forays into India’s hinterland and a more than doubling of its retail network.
The plans involve making inroads into smaller towns, rural pockets and even villages where not a single car has been sold so far. Tata Motors is also re-aligning its digital strategy due to the growing influence of digital medium in guiding decisions of potential buyers.
Mayank Pareek, president of the passenger vehicle business at Tata Motors, said Turnaround 2.0 plan for passenger vehicles involves working on both product and geographic footprints. “Good products are essential but not sufficient for winning a market like India,"" he said.
Rural markets comprise 35% of total passenger vehicle sales at Tata Motors, India’s fourth-largest carmaker.
The company. which is developing vehicles based on the Omega and Alfa platforms, has devised an aggressive strategy to grow its pan-India retail footprint starting with Tier I and II cities.
Tata Motors has a network of 865 outlets, which according to Pareek, covers only 60% of the available domestic market. “We plan to increase our reach through 2,000 outlets in the next three years while the existing network needs to improve its efficiency at sales,"" he said.
Pareek, who is known for driving Maruti Suzuki India Ltd’s retail expansion in his previous stint, split the domestic market into about 651,000 villages, more than 3,800 tehsils and over 650 districts.
“Converting one buyer from each of those villages per year is the plan. We are specifically targeting members who have the ability to pay, like a shopkeeper, who is also a local banker, lends live credit, has his own stock of goods, is one of the most informed residents and also knows about the financial capabilities of his fellow residents in the village,"" explained Pareek, who claims to have travelled to 600 of the 650 districts in his 30 years of working in this sector.
Under its rural matrix, the company is identifying potential car buyers using factors such as a farmer with at least five acres of land ownership or a household owning a tractor.
“There are no proven business models to succeed in a rural market. We meet the regional rural banks to understand the financial capabilities of a specific region,"" he said.
“A granite polisher of Hosur is hardly affected by a bad monsoon. He mines granite, cuts it and sells it. Identifying such microsegments is tough. We are working on 500 such microsegments,"" he said.
Tata Motors is opening new emerging market outlets, which it calls e-outlets, to cater to new belts, including villages where no car has been sold till now.
“I have asked my team to sell one car per village in about 50,000 such villages every year. We will figure out how to work out the finance for them. So, we will have a huge command area concept,"" Pareek said.
For the urban and semi-urban belts, the company is planning a digital push to tap into large base of smartphone users. It is also working on virtual showrooms.
“Our data says that a customer visiting a store already knows more about the market than the salesman selling the car. The bulk of this research is done online. He is just visiting the showroom to smell the rubber and test-drive the vehicle,"" said Pareek, who disclosed plans to set up small digital showrooms in public places such as shopping malls.
Tata Motors is working with group companies and other partners to drive its digitization strategy. Digital enquiry conversion to final sales has increased from 0.5% from 18 months ago to 6.5% in March 2019, according to Pareek.
“Our customer (store) walk-in conversion rate is 17%. Our digital conversion rate will jump to 17-18% in 12-18 months. Digital enquiries are mostly coming from tier I and II cities. 14% of our sales are coming from digital medium,"" he revealed.
On the product side, he said that the company aims to serve 90% of all available segments in the next 3 years, against only 50-55% at present, on the back of incoming products, including premium hatchback Altroz. The company’s passenger vehicle division, which reported break-even at Ebitda level in FY19, plans to have 12-14 nameplates in its passenger vehicle portfolio in three years."

New Delhi: The country’s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has cut vehicle production by over 18 per cent in May, according to a regulatory filing.
It is the company’s fourth consecutive month of taking a production cut.
The car market leader produced a total of 151,188 units in May, including Super Carry LCV, down 18.1 per cent from 184,612 units in the year-ago month, MSI said in the filing.
Barring Super Carry, the company reduced production of all other segments, including that of its big selling compact and mini cars last month.
MSI slashed production of passenger vehicles, including Alto, Swift and Dzire, by 18.88 per cent to 148,095 as compared to 182,571 units in May 2018.
The company cut production of mini segment vehicles by 42.29 per cent to 23,874 units last month as against 41,373 units in the year-ago period.
MSI also slashed production of compact segment cars by 9.54 per cent to 84,705 units in May from 93,641 units in corresponding month of last year.
Production of utility vehicles also witnessed a decline of 3.21 per cent to 24,748 units, as against 25,571 units in May last year.
The company said production of vans declined by 34.99 per cent to 10,934 units last month compared to 16,819 units in May 2018.
MSI had cut production by around 10 per cent across its factories in April. In March, the company had reported a production cut of 20.9 per cent across its factories. In February, the company had cut production by over 8 per cent to 148,959 units from 162,524 units produced in the year-ago month.
Auto manufacturers have been facing muted sales for quite some time now. The slowdown has forced companies to adjust their production schedules to market demand.
Last week, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) said it will shut production across plants for up to 13 days in the ongoing quarter to adjust to market demand.

Tumbling auto sales in May reinforce the gloom surrounding auto firms. Data released by the Society for Indian Automobile Manufacturers Ltd on Tuesday showed a drop in domestic wholesales numbers across segments. This reinforces a weak demand sentiment in the market, even as it implies high inventory and weaker retail sales.
It looks like passenger vehicles (PV) and medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) were worst hit. Sales in May contracted sharply by 20.6% and 19.7% from the year-ago period in these two segments, higher than 17.1% and 13.6% seen in the month of April. That’s not all. Over the past week, seven out of top ten PV firms have announced prodution cuts for the month of June. If some have called it a routine maintenance shutdown, others have stated their intent to align production with dealer inventory levels.
Media reports indicate that PV leaders such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd in the listed universe along with others such as Skoda Auto and Honda Cars India have had to trim production.
In M&HCVs, the fall was led by Tata Motors’ 38% decline, year on year, while Ashok Leyland sales saw a small single-digit contraction.
According to Arya Sen of Jefferies India Pvt Ltd, two-wheeler sales dropped too, but it was less painful than in the month of April.The delayed marriage season helped to improve motorcycle sales during this period.
Yet, there are concerns of production cuts in two-wheelers too, in the future months. Inventory is over 45 days for most companies. Some analysts reckon that the cost of ownership due to new technological compliances will hurt two-wheeler users the most, unless companies bear the burden of higher costs.
According to dealers, the trend has not improved so far in June. Another bad month will imply a weak June quarter performance by auto firms. As such, the Nifty auto index has been toeing the line of falling sales. It is down 25% in a year compared to the Nifty, which has risen by about 10%."
177,2019-06-11,Maruti,"Sales of passenger vehicles register the steepest decline in nearly 18 yearsTop carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki have been forced to close factories temporarily to reduce stocks

Mumbai: Passenger vehicle sales in India posted the steepest drop in nearly 18 years in May amid weak demand and a liquidity crunch faced by non-bank vehicle financiers, prompting major auto makers to cut production.
Sales fell 20.6% in May to 239,347 vehicles from a year earlier, according to data released on Tuesday by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the biggest fall since a 22% decline in September 2001 and the seventh consecutive drop in monthly domestic passenger vehicle sales. Vehicle sales in India are counted as factory dispatches and not retail sales.
With retail demand staying weak for several months, some of the top carmakers such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd have announced temporary factory closures to trim mounting stocks at their dealerships as well as factories.
In the passenger vehicle segment, car sales fell 26% from the year earlier in May to 147,546 units. Sales of utility vehicles and vans fell 5.6% and 27%, respectively.
The “auto industry has been moving towards inventory correction"", said Vishnu Mathur, director general of Siam. “The industry is investing huge amounts of money in R&D (research and development) for upcoming safety and emission norms,"" he said, pointing to new regulations that will come into force from early next year. These rules are leading companies to alter their business models, with the top carmaker, Maruti Suzuki, announcing that it will stop manufacturing diesel cars from 1 April 2020. Others such as Tata Motors and Mahindra have said that they would upgrade most of their diesel engines to the new Bharat Stage VI emission norms from next April while discontinuing a few diesel vehicles.
In the commercial vehicle category, sales declined 10% from the year earlier in May to 68,847 units. Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles fell 20% last month, while light commercial vehicles posted a 3.7% drop.
Two-wheelers also continued to stay in negative territory, with demand staying weak in both rural and urban areas.
Total sales of two-wheelers fell 6.7% from the year earlier in May to nearly 1.73 million units. Factory dispatches of motorcycles declined 4.9% in May to 1.16 million units. Scooter sales dropped 7.9% to 511,724 units.
Two-wheeler sales, especially in urban centres, have remained subdued, underscoring overall weak market sentiment and an absence of jobs, coupled with an increase in vehicle insurance premiums.
The three-wheeler segment, too, posted a decline, falling 5.8% last month to 51,650 units.
With lower sales across segments, overall industry sales of automobiles in India declined 8.6% from the year earlier in May to nearly 2.09 million vehicles.
Total automobile production in India declined 8% from the year earlier in May to more than 2.51 million units. This included a 12% cut in passenger vehicle production and a 10.5% cut in production of commercial vehicles.
On the exports front, passenger cars and motorcycles registered growth rates of 8% and 5%, respectively, according to Siam. A total of 48,447 cars and 265,585 motorcycles were exported last month.
“While the wholesale data continues to drop, the dimension of this downturn is now moving beyond the regular reasons such as negative consumer sentiments, fuel price volatility, increased insurance costs and others. It is time when government intervention is required in the form of demand stimulus and tax rationalization,"" said Sugato Sen, deputy director general of Siam.
Sen suggested the government cut the goods and services tax on all vehicle categories to 18% from the current 28%, reduce corporate tax to 25% from 30%, along with reinstating incentives for R&D investments to arrest the downturn in the automobile sector."

""We are working on price increase on our models from July,"" HCIL Senior Vice President and Director Sales and Marketing Rajesh Goel said.
He said the cost of raw material has gone up in the last few months, but the same is currently being absorbed by the company.
Goel said the company is contemplating to pass on some of the increase in input cost to consumers.
""This price increase is due to accumulated raw material cost increases in the past which we have been absorbing so far and also safety regulation implementation. The increase (vehicle cost) would be up to 1.2%,"" he noted.
This is the second time this year that the company is mulling to increase vehicle prices. The company had announced to hike prices by up to  ₹10,000 across its model range with effect from February this year.
In January, various other automakers had announced to increase vehicle prices. Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) had announced to hike prices by up to  ₹10,000.
Besides MSI, automakers like Toyota Kirloskar Motor and utility vehicle maker Isuzu Motors India had also announced plans to hike prices of their respective models from January.

175,2019-06-20,Maruti,"The French firm is the second carmaker in the country after Maruti to discontinue selling diesel vehiclesCEO Thierry Bolloré says share of diesel vehicles is reducing as a percentage of firm’s overall sales

NEW DELHI :
French auto maker Groupe Renault will stop offering diesel engine options on new vehicles in India, the company’s chief executive officer Thierry Bolloré said on Wednesday.
To begin with, Renault’s latest product, the Triber multi-purpose vehicle, will only be available with a petrol engine when it goes on sale in the next couple of months.
“Today, there is a clear regulatory approach saying that diesel is not anymore welcome. Even the gasoline ICE (internal combustion engines) are not welcome in Europe in the future. The regulation is designed to push the car industry forward to electric vehicles and other electrified power trains. As a consequence, we have decided to limit the development of powertrains in diesel. Even light commercial vehicles very quickly will be electric vehicle oriented. Triber also has no diesel engine,"" Bolore said on the sidelines of the unveiling of the new model.
Bolloré did not specify on the future of Renault’s Duster, Lodgy and Captur vehicle models which are offered with diesel engines in India.
Renault will become the second carmaker in the country to discontinue selling diesel vehicles. Market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd earlier announced its decision to stop selling diesel vehicles from 1 April 2020, coinciding with the introduction of new emission norms.
Renault’s local unit will become the first mass market automobile manufacturer in India to launch a product in the utility vehicle (UV) segment without a diesel engine. Customers in the segment are still inclined towards diesel engines due to factors such as more fuel-efficiency than petrol vehicles. Diesel vehicles currently comprise about 80% of total sales in the segment.
Overall, diesel vehicles make up about 40% of passenger vehicles sold in the domestic market.
Bolloré said the share of diesel vehicles is reducing as a percentage of Renault’s overall sales. In Europe, since 2012, there has been a regular decline in the share of diesel vehicles, which gained speed after 2015.
India will introduce the strictest Bharat Stage VI emission norms from next April. The norms, which are similar to Euro 6, are expected to make diesel engines costlier by  ₹2 lakh to  ₹2.5 lakh compared to petrol ones. Also, from 2022, vehicle manufacturers will have to adhere to the second phase of the Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms and in 2023, the real time emission test will also be introduced.
These regulatory changes will not only make diesel vehicles more expensive but companies producing diesel vehicles are also expected to have tough time limiting greenhouse gas emissions.
“The reality is that we have very flexible lines (assembly). So, we could in the past use our diesel line to manufacture gasoline engines. We have invested enough and could push our diesel lines to continue manufacturing gasoline. We did not have to change our production lines and just had to adapt them, which needed some money but not some unacceptable amount of money,"" Bolloré said.
The Triber, which was unveiled on Wednesday, is aimed at recovering market share Renault lost to rivals over the last couple of years. Renault’s small car Kwid and sport-utility vehicle Duster did manage to make significant inroads in the domestic market but lack of new launches and subdued response to its last product Captur SUV led to a sharp drop in sales.
Bolloré said the company has made mistakes in the past but the fact that India will be the third largest auto market in the near future is a good enough reason for the company to keep investing in the country. He expects Renault India to double its vehicle sales by 2022."
174,2019-06-20,Maruti,"To achieve the goal of becoming the fifth-largest automaker in India in the next 5 years, Kia will introduce four new models over the next 2 yearsKia has so far invested $1.1 billion in India and it will not be able to turn profitable in the near future

NEW DELHI :
Kia Motors Corp., one of the newest entrants in India’s automobile market, will focus more on volumes and market share, and establish the brand instead of chasing profits. The subsidiary of South Korea’s Hyundai Motor Group will also study the government’s plans to build infrastructure and other aspects of electrified mobility before it decides to introduce electrified vehicles in India.
Kookhyun Shim, managing director and chief executive, Kia Motors India, said in an interview that the company will initially aim to establish the brand in this market instead of focussing only on profits. Kia has so far invested $1.1 billion in India and it will not be able to turn profitable in the near future, Shim said.
“Kia’s philosophy is more about being a sustainable brand in India for the long term. We have learnt a lot of lessons from other competitor brands. So, we want to be the most loved in the first stage,"" he added.
Kia’s strategy may help the company attain a foothold in the intensely competitive Indian car market, which is billed to become the world’s third largest by 2025.
On Thursday, the company unveiled its first product for India that will go on sale in the next few months. The Seltos sport-utility vehicle (SUV) is targeted at the robust Indian SUV market, which has players such as Hyundai, Tata Motors Ltd, and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. The segment will witness more competition with the upcoming entry of China’s SAIC Motor Corp. and Groupe PSA of France.
Despite the competition, Kia has set an aggressive target of becoming the fifth-largest automaker in India in the next five years. To achieve its goal, the company will introduce four new models over the next two years.
Kia along with SAIC Motor-owned MG Motor and PSA are the three new auto makers set to enter the domestic market this year and the next. Of the three, Kia has outlined so far the most aggressive strategy for India as it will start its journey with a capacity of 300,000 vehicles a year and 265 touch points—a mix of dealerships and service centres—across 160 cities.
SAIC, through its brand Morris Garages or MG, is looking to create a niche by introducing an affordable electric vehicle in the first year of starting operations in India.
Kia, though, is unlikely to follow that path, and would wait for concrete steps from the Union government before introducing any of their electrified—hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric—vehicles.
“Apart from the announcement related to the subsidies, we have to look at the investment in building related infrastructure and policy on the goods and services taxes and import duties. We see the market from the point of price as well as volumes. That’s why we cannot say anything at the moment,"" Shim said.
The top two car makers—Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai—have announced plans to offer electric vehicles in India in 2019 and 2020.
Kia has also invested in making its plant in Andhra Pradesh ready for electric vehicle assembly.
Besides an aggressive approach with products and covering almost 80% of the domestic market from the start of operations, Kia will impart importance to long-term sustainability and profitability of dealer partners and parts suppliers. “We are ready with 265 touch points in 160 cities that means the dealers have also invested a lot in Kia Motors. We will work closely with our dealers and will care for their profitability. We have experience in managing dealers in many countries and will do our best to maintain the profitability of not only dealers but also our vendors,"" Shim said."

172,2019-06-21,Maruti,"The partnership will allow Maruti Suzuki to provide more comprehensive financing opportunities for dealers as well as customersLeading banks lately introduced strict credit norms for auto dealers due to the numbers of bad loans increasing in the segment

Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, on Friday announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bank of Baroda to improve credit for its dealers and customers.
This development will help calm the nerves of the company’s dealers who are under pressure as some leading private and public sector banks have decided to reduce their exposure to automobile inventory funding.
The partnership with Bank of Baroda will allow Maruti Suzuki to provide more comprehensive financing opportunities to dealers as well as customers. Dealer inventory financing would be in accordance with Bank of Baroda’s existing Supply Chain Finance, said the company in a statement.
The tight liquidity situation in the financial system in the aftermath of the IL&FS crisis and rising bad loans have prompted the banks to take such a decision.
Lenders have introduced strict credit norms for automobile dealers due to the rising cases of bad loans in this segment of the automobile industry. Dealers were asked to provide collateral for credit being extended by banks. The percentage of the collateral depends upon the financial position of a dealer.
Automobile companies have arrangements with banks for providing finance options to prospective customers. Dealers usually borrow money from banks to meet operational expenses.
According to Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki, the company is confident that this collaboration with one of India’s largest public sector banks will “offer finance solutions to our customers and dealer partners"".
“We are delighted to be associated with Maruti Suzuki. Given the huge potential of the auto loan and commercial finance segments, we are hopeful this agreement will strengthen our presence,"" said P S Jayakumar, MD & CEO, Bank of Baroda."

NEW DELHI :
The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India had eight of its models in SIAM's ten best-selling passenger vehicles list in May, even as the overall automobile market witnessed a sharp decline.
The company's popular hatchback Swift was the best-selling model last month clocking 17,039 units, up from fourth spot in the same month last year when it sold 19,208 units, according to Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).
Coming in second was entry level model Alto with sale of 16,394 units as against 21,890 units in year-ago month, retaining the same spot.
MSI's compact sedan Dzire sold 16,196 units last month, occupying third position, down from the top spot in the same month last year when it clocked 24,365 units.
Premium hatchback Baleno sold 15,176 units to be at fourth position, down from third in May last year when it registered 19,398 units.
The new WagonR sold 14,561 units retaining the fifth position held by the old WagonR last May with 15,974 units.
Making it to the top ten list in a long while was the company's utility van Eeco with 11,739 units last month at sixth spot.
Hyundai Motor India's SUV Creta retained its seventh spot last month selling 9,054 units as against 11,004 units in May last year.
The company's premium hatchback Elite i20 sold 8,958 units to be in eighth spot, up from ninth in May last year when it clocked 10,664 units.
Maruti Suzuki's multi-purpose vehicle Ertiga was in the ninth position with 8,864 units followed by compact Vitara Brezza with 8,781 units in tenth.

The overall passenger vehicle wholesales in India had witnessed the steepest decline in nearly 18 years, dropping by over 20 per cent in May to 2,39,347 units against 3,01,238 units in the year-ago month.

170,2019-06-28,Maruti,"Sebi widens definition of ‘encumbrance’ to include negative lien, pledge and non-disposable undertakingsUnder current code, encumbrance includes a pledge of shares, lien or any such transaction

In the wake of increased scrutiny of promoters signing side-deals to raise more debt from banks and mutual funds, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Thursday widened the definition of “encumbrance"" to make it more inclusive.
The definition, when notified, will include any restrictions on free and marketable shares of promoters which affect tradeability of shares. It will also include lien, negative lien, pledge and non-disposable undertakings (NDU).
Under the current takeover code, “encumbrance"" includes a pledge of shares, lien or any such transaction.
“Even today the definition is wide enough but there were certain structures that were escaping scrutiny such as NDU. Now it is being more inclusive to cover all structures,"" said Amarjeet Singh, whole-time member, Sebi, after the market regulator’s board meeting.
Promoters would need to disclose reasons if 20% of their share capital is pledged or 50% of their shareholding in the company.
“To escape the disclosure requirements under present provisions, corporates use many types of complex forms of encumbrances. Widening the scope of encumbrance by including negative lien and NDUs etc would help in tightening norms for disclosure by promoters and will further improve the transparency,"" said Pavan Kumar Vijay, founder of Corporate Professionals, a law firm.
Sebi also tweaked its earlier proposal of capping royalty at 2% to 5% due to a push-back from the industry. The regulator had earlier proposed that any royalty payment above 2% would need a shareholder nod.
The Uday Kotak committee on corporate governance had originally recommended that royalties above 5% should need approval from shareholders.
Even though royalty payments were related-party transactions, they escaped shareholder approval since these did not exceed 10% of revenue or net worth and companies maintained that royalty payments were in the ordinary course of business and on arm’s length terms.
“We had received representation from the industry that it should be retained at 5%. We have agreed to the representation,"" Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi said at a press meet.
In 2017-18, 27 multinational companies (MNCs) paid an aggregate  ₹6,737 crore in royalties, more than half of which was accounted for by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd at  ₹3,818 crore, or 25.8% of profits before tax, proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services India Ltd (IiAS) said in a report dated 27 March.
These royalty payments account for 16% of these 27 MNCs’ pre-tax pre-royalty profits and almost 27% of their aggregate ₹25,040 crore profit after tax.
Another major change is the reintroduction of differential voting rights for new age or technology companies to protect them from a hostile takeover.
There will two categories of shares—superior voting rights shares for promoters and founders and normal shares which will be issued to other shareholders.
Superior shares will have voting rights in the range of 2:1 to 10:1 as compared to normal shares. These shares will give promoters and founders superior rights in the appointment and removal of independent directors and auditors, for transferring control and related party transactions."

168,2019-07-02,Maruti,"Initial reports from automakers suggests a y-o-y decline of over 16% in the segmentMaruti Suzuki reports a decline in sales across categories

MUMBAI :
Passenger vehicle (PV) sales in India continued their downward spiral in June as automakers curbed factory dispatches to control inventory at dealerships.
Initial reports from the top companies suggest a year-on-year (y-o-y) decline of more than 16% for the PV segment and 11% y-o-y drop in two-wheeler sales.
Automobile sales in India are counted as factory dispatches and not retail sales.
The auto industry had anticipated this downtrend for June, but stakeholders are worried as there are no visible signs of recovery as PV sales have fallen 18% y-o-y during Q1FY20.
Domestic sales of market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd fell 17% in June to 111,014 vehicles. The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit reported a decline across all categories including mini cars and sport-utility vehicles although sales of its Ciaz sedan and the light commercial vehicle (LCV) Super Carry increased during the month.
Maruti said it sold 1,830 units of its compact hatchback Baleno to Toyota India. Its total domestic wholesales, including LCV and supply to Toyota, stood at 114,861 units in June, down 15% y-o-y.
Sales at Hyundai Motor India Ltd, the second-largest carmaker, fell 7.3% y-o-y to 42,007 units in June. Meanwhile, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) emerged as the only automaker that posted an increase in PV sales in June with a 4% y-o-y rise to 18,826 vehicles. This included 17,723 utility vehicles, an 8% rise y-o-y.
Veejay Ram Nakra, M&M’s chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, attributed the performance to the recent launch of three new products.
“However, the market sentiment continued to remain subdued, especially in the passenger vehicles segment. We continue to correct our channel inventory both in the personal and commercial vehicle segments in June,"" he said.
Sales at Tata Motors Ltd fell 27% y-o-y in June to 13,351 vehicles. The company also has recorded the steepest decline in Q1FY20 volumes amongst all car makers.
“The auto industry has been de-growing for the past 4 quarters. Customer sentiments remained low due to the overall slowdown in economic growth. Consumer expectations on revised GST rate on cars and limited liquidity availability kept them from firming their buying decision this month,"" said Sibendra Barman, vice president, sales & marketing, passenger vehicle business unit, Tata Motors.
Motilal Oswal Securities said the average inventory levels are stable for Maruti Suzuki at 25-30 days, while it is higher for M&M and Tata Motors at 35-40 days. On the two-wheeler front, it said despite production cuts, inventory levels have increased due to weak demand in June. It forecast that Royal Enfield, which reported a 24% y-o-y drop in sales last month, will continue to see a decline in dispatches.
However, Kavan Mukhtyar, partner & leader, automotive, PricewaterhouseCoopers Pvt. Ltd said the retail story for June 2019 might be relatively better.
“While the wholesale numbers are down clearly because the automakers are cutting factory level dispatches to fix the inventory, the retail story might be better. With a stable government in place, cuts in interest rates, gradually improving consumer sentiments, I expect the retail sales to be in the neutral territory for the overall auto industry,"" he said.
Mukhtyar said also that although the liquidity crunch exists, the worst is over for the industry as the sentiments will only improve from here on.

NEW DELHI :
The Competition Commission has ordered a detailed probe against carmaker Maruti Suzuki for alleged resale price maintenance arrangement with dealers.
Generally, resale price maintenance refers to an arrangement between a buyer and seller wherein the resale price is stipulated by the seller.
In a 10-page order, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) said it is of the considered opinion that a thorough and detailed investigation is required to be ordered to ascertain the factual position and modus operandi resorted to Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL).
The allegations prima-facie reveal a fit case for investigation in respect of the alleged resale price maintenance arrangement put in place by MSIL upon its dealers in contravention of competition norms.
""Agreements restraining competition are generally made in smoke filled rooms and therefore it is difficult to find formal/ written agreements. It is with this objective that the (Competition) Act has stipulated a wider definition of agreement to catch hold of such anti-competitive conduct.
""Therefore, MSIL's submission that there exists no agreement to control discounts, is devoid of substance and merits rejection,"" the order said.

166,2019-07-07,Maruti,"Sops in the budget will narrow the gap in ownership cost of EVs vis-à-vis petrol-, diesel-powered carsThe nudge comes at a time when many vehicle makers are set to hit the market with electric vehicles

Concessions in the Union Budget 2019 to push electric vehicles (EVs) to the fast lane were a bolt from the blue. Neither the industry nor analysts expected a battery of concessions to make EV ownership more viable.
On the contrary, the industry was hoping for incentives such as a lower goods and services tax (GST) rate or direct tax benefits that would boost consumer demand for sectors such as automobiles. The sector, particularly, has been languishing, with sales plummeting for almost a year.
The proposal to lower the GST rate for EVs from 12% to 5% and reduce customs duties on components reinforces the government’s commitment to move ahead on cleaner mobility.
A substantially higher tax exemption on loans incentivizes EV purchases as well.
These steps would help narrow the ownership gap between EVs and vehicles with ICE (internal combustion engine), according to Shailesh Chandra, president (electric mobility business and corporate strategy) at Tata Motors Ltd.
A good thing is that this nudge from the government comes at a time when many original equipment manufacturers across cars and two-wheelers such as Tata Motors, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Bajaj Auto Ltd are set to hit the market with EVs.
The moot question is, whether the current budgetary incentives will steer customers towards buying EVs?
Analysts are not convinced. Yes, the GST cut, along with the customs-duty waiver on components, will bring down EV prices substantially, given that these cost at least 40-50% more than those of ICE vehicles.
However, even with the incentives on loans, analysts reckon that it would take EV owners twice the time to break-even on ownership costs compared to ICE vehicle owners. In other words, the cost of ownership is high even in entry-level segments.
According to Prayesh Jain, executive vice president at Yes Securities Ltd, “While the measures would narrow the cost difference between electric and internal combustion engine vehicles, the key impediment is the lack of charging infrastructure and availability of products with an adequate charging range at affordable prices. We still believe that the EV story in India is for the longer term.""
Besides, short-term woes have been mounting for auto firms. Volumes have contracted in double digits due to a plethora of issues that are still plaguing the sector.
Ebitda margin for most firms are likely to have declined by a steep 150-300 basis points in spite of softer commodity prices compared to the year-ago period. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A report by Motilal Oswal Services Ltd forecasts a drop in the Ebitda margin for the fourth consecutive quarter for auto companies, leading the brokerage firm to cut FY20/FY21 earnings estimates of most companies it covers.
Thus, while the move to put EVs on the fast track is good, getting too excited about it will be a case of putting the cart before the horse."

New Delhi: The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has cut vehicle production for the fifth consecutive month in June, according to a regulatory filing.
The auto major said it slashed total vehicle production, including Super Carry LCV, by 15.6% last month to 1,11,917 units as compared to 1,32,616 units in the year-ago month.
Total passenger vehicle production stood at 1,09,641 units last month, down 16.34% from 1,31,068 units in June 2018.
The auto major cut production of mini segment vehicles, including models like Alto, by 48.2% to 15,087 units last month as against 29,131 units in the year-ago period.
Similarly, it slashed production of compact segment cars like WagonR, Swift and Dzire by 1.46% to 66,436 units in June from 67,426 units earlier.
Production of utility vehicles witnessed a decline of 5.26% to 17,074 units, as against 18,023 units in June last year.
The company said production of vans declined by 27.87% to 8,501 units last month compared to 11,787 units in June 2018.
The car market leader had cut total production by over 18% in May. Similarly, it had slashed production by around 10% across its factories in April.
In March, the company had reported a production cut of 20.9%, while in February the company had reduced production by over 8% to 1,48,959 units from 1,62,524 units produced in the year-ago month.
Auto manufacturers have been facing muted sales for quite some time now. The slowdown has forced companies to adjust their production schedules to market demand.
Automakers like Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) and Tata Motors have also announced adjusting production to tapering market demand to cut down inventories.
In May, overall passenger vehicle wholesales in India witnessed the steepest decline in nearly 18 years, dropping by over 20 per cent amid continued weakness in retail offtake.
The decline in May was the worst since September 2001, when sales had dropped by 21.91%.
In fact, barring October last year, when sales went up 1.55%, passenger vehicle offtake has been in the negative zone in 10 of the last 11 months.
Passenger vehicle retail sales were, however, comparatively better in May. As per automobile dealers' body FADA, retail sales in May dipped 1% to 2,51,049 units as compared to the same period last year.
Both SIAM and FADA are yet to release detailed sales data for June."
164,2019-07-07,Maruti,"Automaker’s move underscores a squeeze on dealer cash flow with PV sales staying muted for monthsBad loans have risen in auto sector as weak retail sales have forced closure of many dealerships

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is in talks with banks to nudge them to ease their strict lending norms and offer retail financing to dealers of the country’s largest carmaker, a senior company executive said.
The move by the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit underscores a squeeze on dealer cash flow with passenger vehicle sales staying muted for several months while banks have cut financing for dealers due to worries whether the loans would be repaid.
Bad loans have risen in the auto sector as weak retail sales have forced the closure of several dealerships. This has led major banks such as the State Bank of India, HDFC Bank and others to tighten credit norms for automobile dealers. The liquidity stress at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) which emerged last September with defaults on debt repayments at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) has worsened the situation.
“We recently tied up with Bank of Baroda and are in close touch with other banks to strengthen funds availability for inventory financing by our dealer partners. We are in talks with all leading banks to further support the industry with increased allocation of funds for auto sector,"" Shashank Srivastava, executive director, marketing and sales, Maruti Suzuki said in an interview.
NBFCs comprise nearly 20% of financing for retail sales and stocks purchase for Maruti dealers, he said, adding as much as 80% of Maruti cars are bought on loans.
Maruti is also trying to strengthen the business model of its dealers by focusing on revenue generation from other streams such as vehicle servicing, insurance, auto accessories and selling used cars through the True Value outlets, Srivastava said.
Automobile sales have stayed subdued since the second half of FY19, prompting automakers to cut production significantly to adjust wholesale with retail demand. Maruti Suzuki has also trimmed its production for four months in a row starting February to reduce dealer stocks.
Srivastava said Maruti Suzuki always been conscious of the profitability and viability of its dealers and that is one of the big factors why its dealers continue to run their business even in the current tough retail scenario. “Maruti Suzuki has a sustainable and robust dealer business model which helps them to generate revenue not only from new car sales but also from other strong revenue streams. There are multiple business opportunities include vehicle service, finance, insurance, spare parts and accessories sales and also our True Value, pre-owned car sales initiative,"" he said.
Mint on 18 June reported that lenders have decided to pare their exposure to automobile dealers due to increased defaults over the last two fiscal years.
Data compiled by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (Fada) showed that 64 dealerships have shut operations in the Greater Mumbai area alone in the last year-and-a-half, with 61 associated with passenger vehicles.
During the same period in the National Capital Region, some 42 dealers have shut shop, with all but one of them having been in the business of selling passenger vehicles. Besides manufacturers like Renault India Pvt. Ltd, Nissan Motor India Pvt. Ltd and Ford Motor India Pvt. Ltd, dealers of leading manufacturers like Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd also feature in the list of companies whose dealerships have closed in the past 18 months.
Due to the uncertainty in the overall financial sector and slowdown in economic activity, Maruti’s sales in the April to June period fell 20% from the year-earlier to 369,985 units. The company has forecast a modest growth of 4-8% in its domestic vehicle sales for this financial year."

Investors' wealth on Monday got depleted by  ₹3.39 lakh crore after the Sensex plummeted 793 points.
Intra-day, the 30-share BSE benchmark index fell sharply by 907.91 points to 38,605.48. It closed at 38,720.57, down 792.82 points, or 2.01%. Here are five plausible reasons why the markets have tanked considerably second day in a row. In the previous two sessions, the market capitalisation of BSE-listed firms plummeted  ₹5,61,772.64 crore. The index had dropped 394.67 points on Friday. Monday was Sensex's biggest single-day loss this year so far.
Union budget overhang: In her maiden Budget Speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said it was the right time to consider an increase in minimum public shareholding from 25% to 35%.
According to traders, the Union Budget proposal on higher tax incidence for foreign portfolio investors and high networth individuals also continued to spook domestic investors.
""Today's market fall has been due to a combination of global and domestic factors. Globally, a positive payroll expansion ahead of estimations has led to a fear of anticipated Fed rate cut not coming through. Domestically, proposals in the Budget to increase the minimum public shareholding levels to 35% was a dampener along with a 20% tax on share buybacks,"" Pradeep Kesavan, senior vice-president, equity strategy, institutional equities, Elara Capital told PTI.

In the broader market, the BSE mid-cap and small-cap indices fell by up to 2.46%.
Heavy selling pressure was seen in auto stocks due to the absence of any conspicuous impetus in the Budget for the beleaguered sector. Hero MotoCorp was down 5.2%, and Maruti Suzuki by 5.1%.
Panic selling: Panic selling weighed in after the Punjab National Bank (PNB) reported a fraud of  ₹3,800 crore by Bhushan Power and Steel, saying the company misappropriated bank funds and manipulated books of accounts to raise funds from the consortium lender banks, ANI reported.
PNB closed 11% lower at  ₹72.80 per share while the State Bank of India was down over 4.1% at  ₹355.25 apiece.
""The market fall today was on account of concerns over future fund flow into the secondary market and scam revelation at PNB (Punjab National Bank). Fears around squeeze in secondary market liquidity is also due to proposed higher public shareholding norms,"" YES Securities President and Research Head Amar Ambani told PTI.
Heavy selling was seen in PSU banks such as Bank of India, Union Bank of India and Canara Bank, which were trading over 8 to 10% lower.
Canara Bank, Syndicate Bank, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda declined in the range of 5 to 8%, IANS reported.
Heavy selloff in global equities: Asian shares were broadly weaker after tracking Wall Street which fell from record highs last week. Shanghai Composite Index ended 2.58% lower, Hang Seng by 1.54%, Nikkei by 0.98% and Kospi tumbling 2.20%.
Investors turned their attention to the upcoming testimony from US Federal Reserve Chairman after a strong jobs report cast doubt on the pace of interest rate cuts.
Share sentiment was also dampened by US investment bank Morgan Stanley's decision to reduce its exposure to global equities due to misgivings about the ability of policy easing to offset weaker economic data, ANI reported.
""Today's market fall has been due to a combination of global and domestic factors.

178,2019-07-10,Maruti,"Firm to skip hybrid tech as an intermediate step towards adoption of electric vehiclesFirm says it plans to set up some charging stations initially, but won’t be responsible for charging infra

Hyundai Motor Co.’s decision to launch the premium electric vehicle Kona as its first offering in the segment in India has been taken with aim of changing the way Indians look at electric cars, said Seon Seob Kim, managing director, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the South Korean auto maker. The company in the process will skip hybrid technology as an intermediate step towards adoption of electric vehicles, as the current tax structure makes manufacturing of strong hybrid vehicles unviable.
The South Korean company will, unlike its Japanese rivals Toyota Motor Co. and Suzuki Motor Co., not invest in a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in India unless there are economies of scale.
Several companies have introduced electric vehicles in India but consumers continue to have reservations about their range and performance, he said.
“The reason why we chose to introduce the Kona EV is because it is already proven in matured markets. It might bring in a change in customer mindset. Initially we will also set up some charging stations in our office and in some dealerships but as an original equipment manufacturer, we are not responsible for setting up charging infrastructure across the country,"" said Kim.
Hyundai will sell the Kona Electric SUV in 16 cities in India from July.
Mint reported on 29 May that Hyundai had three years ago hired consulting firm Deloitte Haskins to work on launching the electric vehicle at a premium price point.
The upcoming premium electric vehicle will have a home charging device designed to help allay concerns of customers about the lack of charging stations in India. Kona EV will have a range of more than 400 kilometres, a first in electric vehicles in India. The Kona along with the Nissan Leaf is considered one of the best electric vehicles in the world in terms of range on offer and vehicle performance.
Unlike Hyundai, its main competitor in India, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has opted for a strategy woven around hybrid vehicles as the intermediate step toward full electrification. The Japanese parent company has finalized an agreement with Toyota Motor Co. for joint development of hybrid and, subsequently, electric vehicles. Suzuki has also invested in a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat in a joint venture with Denso Corp. and Toshiba Corp. Suzuki, though, has started testing its first electric vehicle in India since last year.
However, Hyundai will need to generate volumes in India to justify investing in a lithium ion battery plant as the batteries needed for vehicles like Kona are bigger, resulting in the need for substantial investments, Kim said.
At present Hyundai Motor Co. is the only vehicle manufacturer in the world to offer an entire range of electric vehicles, including hybrids, plug-in hybrids, battery electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel cell powered electric vehicles. The company plans to invest around $1 billion for developing electric products.
“Hybrid technology can be a bridge powertrain and is a very efficient solution. As of now everything depends on the government subsidy and tax structure. At present, the GST levied on such vehicles make it difficult for us to sell them in India and make profit,"" said Kim.
Under the present goods and services tax structure in India, hybrid vehicles attract 43% tax, including 28% of the goods and services tax alongside a 15% cess as most hybrids are bigger than 4 metres in length, as opposed to 12% GST levied on battery electric vehicles.
The government in March announced an outlay of  ₹10,000 crore for promoting electric mobility in India, under the second phase of the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric and Hybrid Vehicles (Fame 2) scheme, including subsidies for vehicles.
Reuters news agency on 6 May reported that the government may ask ride hailing service provider like Ola and Uber to convert 40% of their total fleet to electric in the next six to seven years. In a separate report, The Economic Times reported that the government may ban internal combustion engine-driven two and three wheelers from 2026.
“To solve the increasing pollution level in Indian cities electrification is the right direction but the industry needs a road map from the government regarding electric mobility,"" said Kim."
162,2019-07-23,Maruti,"Carmaker not likely to double capacity at the plant to 1.5 million vehiclesThe move by parent Suzuki comes on the heels of Maruti’s local sales falling 19% in the June quarter

New Delhi: Suzuki Motor Corp. plans to suspend a planned doubling of vehicle manufacturing capacity in Gujarat, reflecting continuing uncertainty in India’s automobile market.
The parent of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, will restrict the capacity to 750,000 vehicles a year instead of increasing it to 1.5 million vehicles a year as planned, said three people directly aware of the development.
Lack of availability of skilled manpower as well as inadequate infrastructure in Gujarat also influenced Suzuki’s decision, the people said on condition of anonymity. The Gujarat plant is owned by Suzuki Motor Gujarat, a unit of Suzuki Motor, and is the first direct investment by the Japanese company in India.
Suzuki initially planned to make 1.5 million vehicles a year in Gujarat, in two separate plants of 750,000 units each. The first factory opened in 2016-17, with two assembly lines of 250,000 units each. The third and final assembly line of 250,000 vehicles is slated for completion later this fiscal.
“The infrastructure around the place where Suzuki built its plant has not developed and getting skilled labour is also a challenge in that part of the country. Also, the overall cost of operations is much higher since Suzuki doesn’t have its entire vendor base there,"" said the first person cited earlier.
A spokesperson for Maruti declined to comment on queries emailed on Monday.
Passenger vehicle sales in India have been weak for about a year because of factors such as volatile fuel prices, high loan rates and a slowing economy. Maruti’s local sales fell 19% in the June quarter, worsening from a 6.1% rise in 2018-19 and a 14.5% increase in 2017-18.
Puneet Gupta, associate director of IHS Markit, said, “Maruti has become cautious regarding its future investments, specially seeing the disruptions erupting in automotive world.""
“Expansion plans will go slow for all automotive manufacturers as long-term road map is missing from policymakers in India. This may be with regards to policies related to electric vehicles or regulations, which are yet to be introduced,"" he said, referring to new norms on vehicle mileage and emissions.
Meanwhile, the issues in Gujarat may also lead Suzuki to choose a location in south India to build a new plant to prepare for a potential surge in demand in the future, said the second person cited earlier.
Maruti has a factory each in Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana, with a total capacity of about 1.5 million vehicles a year.
The second person said Suzuki could in the interim also access the factory of Toyota Motor Corp. on the outskirts of Bengaluru to make Suzuki models at a time when domestic demand may not grow substantially in the next few years.
Suzuki and Toyota currently have a pact to sell each other’s vehicles in India, wherein Toyota will sell Suzuki’s Vitara Brezza and Baleno under its own badge, while Suzuki will sell the Corolla sedan.
While the Baleno hatchback is made in Gujarat, the Vitara Brezza compact sport utility vehicle under a Toyota badge will be made in Bengaluru, along with the Suzuki-branded Corolla sedan.
Suzuki has also invested in setting up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat, along with Toyota’s subsidiary Denso Corp. and Toshiba Corp.
Suzuki’s plans for Gujarat may, however, impact those tier 1 suppliers who built production bases there based on the company’s original manufacturing plan of 1.5 million vehicles.
However, almost half of Maruti’s tier 1 vendors are still not present in Gujarat and supply from other facilities.
The second person cited earlier said Suzuki’s move will help suppliers, who were looking to make investments in Gujarat as they don’t have to make new investments at a time when demand is expected to remain under pressure in the near term.
“Maruti has communicated its decision to most suppliers though there has not been any official announcement as such,"" the second person said. “This also shows decision-making system in the company and how they manage the financial health of the vendor partners. The cost of manufacturing in Gujarat compared to Manesar and Gurgaon is higher."""
159,2019-07-26,Maruti,"The automaker sold 402,594 units in the April-June quarter, down 17.9% from the year-ago periodLower sales volume and higher depreciation expenses hurt net profit numbers

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, on Friday reported its sharpest fall in net profit since the fourth quarter of FY14—a fresh sign of a general slowdown in the auto market.
It also reported significant contraction in operating margin owing to a double-digit decline in vehicle sales and higher depreciation and amortization cost.
The company sold 402,594 units in the April-June quarter, down 17.9% from the year-ago period. The overall slowdown in the economy and lack of credit availability from financial institutions in the aftermath of the liquidity crisis triggered by the IL&FS default contributed to the fall in sales.
Net profit fell 27.3% year-on-year to  ₹1,435.5 crore during the quarter, as overall passenger vehicle sales in India struggled with its steepest fall in two decades. In April-June 2018, it had reported net profit of  ₹1,975.3 crore.
The company’s net sales during the period fell 14.1% to  ₹18,735.2 crore from  ₹21,810.7 crore a year ago.
Maruti, however, managed to beat Bloomberg’s net profit and revenue estimates of  ₹1,338.9 crore and  ₹19,069.2 crore, respectively. This was primarily due to an increase in other income and a fall in other expenses.
The carmaker’s total revenue from operations fell to  ₹19,732.6 crore from  ₹22,470.8 crore in the corresponding period last year.
The company witnessed a sharp rise in expenses due to rising raw material prices, and depreciation and amortization costs. Raw material expenses rose by 410 basis points (bps) to 75.1% of net sales, while depreciation and amortization costs increased 160bps to 4.9% of revenue. Employee costs increased by 110bps.
As a result of higher costs and the slowdown in sales, operating profit, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, fell sharply by 38.8% year-on-year to  ₹2,047.6 crore.
The operating margin in the quarter contracted by 455bps to 10.92% from 15.36% in the corresponding three-month period of fiscal 2018-19.
Other income during the quarter increased by a whopping 179.9% to  ₹763.3 crore, which helped the company arrest the decline in profit. Cost-cutting initiatives and lower royalty payment to its parent Suzuki Motor Co., owing to lower sales, helped decrease other expenses by 4% to  ₹2,740.4 crore.
According to Ajay Seth, chief financial officer, Maruti Suzuki India, though retail sales were under pressure, the company successfully managed to keep operating expenses in control due to cost cuts, including a curb on advertising spends.
“There is some significant uncertainty in the market and, if we see some policy intervention, then there are chances of some recovery in demand,"" added Seth in a conference call with analysts.
“Maruti’s strong product pipeline, success of new launches, leadership and strong management capability would benefit the company’s profitability going forward, while post clarity from management, we may revisit our estimates and view on the stock,"" said Mitul Shah, research analyst, Reliance Securities.
“We seek clarity from the management on the cost structure and cost escalation pass on to customers, as margin continued at this 10% range. However, we expect increase in first time buyers from rural markets and volume improvement on the back of success of new BS-VI launches,"" added Shah.

Maruti Suzuki, country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, is expected to report subdued growth in revenue and net profit in the first quarter of the current financial year as sales across segments registered double-digit decline.
The New Delhi-based vehicle manufacturer will continue to see decline in revenue due to high base in the corresponding period last year and 19% fall in sales in the June quarter.
According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services , Maruti's net sales may decline 15% year-on-year to  ₹190,978 million, while operating profit or EBITDA is expected to decline by 42% to  ₹19,428 million. Net profit of the company is expected to fall 30% to  ₹13,722 million.
At an operating level as well, higher input cost and double-digit production cut through the quarter will continue to hurt the company’s operating profit, with significant contraction likely.
Following the prolonged slowdown in sales of automobiles, Maruti Suzuki decided to reduce production by double digits in the last five months which will have an adverse impact on the financials of the company.
“EBITDA margin for our original equipment manufacturer (ex-JLR) universe is likely to contract for the fourth consecutive quarter by 310bp YoY (-70bp QoQ) to 10.7% due to higher variable marketing expenses and negative operating leverage. While almost all OEMs (except TVSL and TTMT S/A) are likely to see year in year margin contraction, MM and TVSL are expected to deliver a QoQ margin recovery of 80bp and 20bp respectively,"" said analysts of Motilal Oswal in a report.
Maruti Suzuki though announced a price increase of its products across categories during the quarter, due to a rise in input costs and introduction of new safety norms.
Sales of passenger vehicles in April to June quarter of the current financial year declined by 18.4%, sharpest since the third quarter of financial year 2000-2001."

Key companies which are going to announce June quarter earnings today are Maruti Suzuki India, Bajaj Auto, Punjab National Bank, Vedanta, JSW Steel, ABB India, Vodafone Idea, Bajaj Holdings and Mahindra Lifespace Developers.
Meanwhile, a rally in global bonds ran out of steam after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi cautioned about pulling the trigger too quickly even though he signaled another round of monetary easing.

The U.S. 10-year Treasuries yield also rose 3 basis points to 2.079% on Thursday and traded at 2.107% in the following Asian session. Also helping to stem falls in bond yields, new orders for key US-made capital goods surged in June, suggesting some improvement in business investment.
In the currency market, the euro bounced back to at $1.11465 in Asian trade, after sinking to $1.1101 on Thursday, its lowest since May 2017. The yen was little changed against the dollar at 108.67 yen per dollar.
Oil prices held firm on rising tensions between the West and Iran and a big decline in US crude stockpiles, though gains were held in check by worries about slowing growth in major economies.

158,2019-07-27,Maruti,"CNG variant of Ertiga will be the first utility vehicle in India that will not run a petrol or diesel-powered engineMaruti Suzuki is betting big on vehicles powered by CNG engines to replace the diesel ones

Maruti Suzuki India ltd - the country’s largest vehicle manufacturer- on Saturday launched a new variant of its multi-purpose vehicle Ertiga that will run on an engine powered by compressed natural gas (CNG). This will be the first utility vehicle in India that will not run a petrol or diesel-powered engine.
As Maruti plans to phase out diesel engines from its product portfolio, the company is betting big on vehicles powered by CNG engines to replace the diesel ones. The Ertiga CNG variant is an indication of the company’s strategy to move its potential diesel customers towards CNG vehicles, especially the fleet segment buyers.
In India, almost 80% of buyers of sport utility vehicles prefer diesel engines.
Maruti is expected to introduce CNG variants of most of its popular models before April, 2020, when the new Bharat VI emission norms will kick in.
According to the company, it has sold 61,000 units of the the new version of the multi purpose vehicle since it was launched last year.
The union government has been pushing vehicles manufacturers to move towards alternate fuel solutions like Compressed Natural Gas and Liquified Natural Gas in the short term before shifting to electric powertrain in the long run.
The National Democratic Alliance government plans to set up 10000 CNG pumps so that customers can buy such vehicles as an alternate to petrol and diesel vehicles.
Mint on 6 February, reported that Maruti plans to sell 2 lakh diesel vehicles by 2022 as the company thinks CNG can be an effective replacement of diesel and which will also help the company adhere to stringent CAFE norms, to be introduced from 2022.
“The next generation Ertiga is the only MPV in the country to offer factory-fitted CNG option. The factory fitted CNG vehicle comes with standard warranty benefits and convenience of Maruti Suzuki’s service network spread across India. The CNG-powered Ertiga will offer maximum performance with dual ECU (engine control unit) with intelligent-gas port injection system,"" the company said in statement.
According to Shashank Srivastava, executive director, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki, with the CNG-powered Ertiga, customers will be able to enjoy the benefit of better fuel economy and superior technology which is safe, reliable and environment friendly."

Mumbai: Weak sales and subdued quarterly results by most auto original equipment manufacturers (OEM) had set the stage for a fall in auto stocks. A 24 July notification proposing higher vehicle registration fees for new and old vehicles, has fuelled the fall.
Nifty Auto index fell 2-3%, dragged down largely by OEM stocks. OEM stocks have declined 10-20% in the last couple of months, with most of them trading below or close to their 52-week lows.
A report by Nomura Research on the proposed vehicle registration fees said “if the notification goes through, it will hurt sales of the already struggling auto sector. Two-wheelers will be hit harder due to higher cost increase for them of about 2.5% followed by cars and medium and heavy commercial vehicles of around 1%.""
This would further dent demand for automobiles.
Higher insurance cost, road tax, and registration fees are all ex-showroom costs which are not financed. Hence, they have a direct impact on the buyer’s cost. All this comes in the backdrop of June quarter being one of the worst in terms of auto sales across segments.
Meanwhile, April-June results reflect the stress in auto industry. Revenue was flat or lower for most companies, while weak sales volumes and the resultant poor capacity utilisation with production cuts, led to pressure on margins. Cost of raw material as a percentage to sales rose, in spite of softer commodity prices. Passenger car leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd may have weathered the headwinds, but its profitability was hit.
Tata Motors Ltd margins slipped into single digit as weak luxury car sales globally along with falling commercial vehicle sales in domestic markets hit performance. Two-wheeler firms such as Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Company Ltd also reported a fall in their respective margins, but were largely in line with market forecast.
As the market and industry incessantly hanker for sops from the government to boost near-term demand, the government’s thrust is clearly on encouraging the adoption of electric vehicles. If anything, all depends on how the monsoon pans out, and hope that the festival season will boost demand in the short term."
156,2019-07-29,Maruti,"Brokerages have downgraded the stock on concerns that automobile demand may not recover in the festival seasonVehicle manufacturers generate at least a third of their overall retail sales in a fiscal during the festive season

Shares of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd have plunged this year, slammed by worries about future growth at India’s largest carmaker amid changing government rules, especially on electric vehicles, intensifying competition and a demand squeeze.
Maruti’s domestic vehicle sales have fallen more than 19% to 374,481 units in the June quarter, the sharpest drop since the third quarter of 2000-01. This has taken a toll on its financials as well as stock performance.
In 2019, the stock has fallen 25.5%, widely underperforming a 4.49% rise in the Sensex. It also fared poorly last year, falling 23.3% compared with the benchmark Sensex’s 5.91% gain.
“Demand for mass market passenger cars is unlikely to improve in the near future and that is why the stock price is at a its worst possible scenario,"" an analyst with a foreign brokerage said on condition of anonymity. “Fundamentally, the company is strong and will retain its leadership position, but consumption demand is not likely to revive in the near future.""
With the 10-month-long slowdown in the automobile sector showing no sign of abating, several brokerages have downgraded shares of Maruti Suzuki. The brokerages have attributed their decision to concerns that automobile demand is unlikely to recover in the upcoming festive season, while regulatory changes and increased competition will continue to weigh on the stock.
The downgrades come at a time when passenger vehicle sales in India in the three months ended 30 June fell the most since the third quarter of fiscal 2000-01. Maruti, being the market leader, had to cut vehicle production in the past five months.
“On the back of massive slowdown and declining return ratios with lower earnings growth, we lower our estimates and valuation multiple of MSIL to 20x (from 22x earlier),"" Mitul Shah, an analyst at Reliance Securities, wrote in a note to clients. “In view of its fair valuation at current level, we downgrade our recommendation on the stock to ‘Hold’ from ‘Buy’ with a downwardly revised target price of  ₹5,750.""
Maruti Suzuki’s net profit for the three months ended 30 June fell 27% from a year earlier to  ₹1,435.5 crore, the steepest decline in the last five years. Operating profit margin contracted by 455 basis points to 10.92% in the quarter from a year earlier due to higher expenses and lower sales. Net sales during the period fell 14% to  ₹18,735.2 crore.
“We understand the sector is amidst a slowdown, though we were left surprised by lack of any growth guidance from MSIL considering that the festive season is near,"" wrote analysts at ICICI Securities in a note. The brokerage expects Maruti’s margins “to remain under check considering the heightened competitive intensity amidst scarce industry growth"".
ICICI Securities has retained its “Sell"" rating on Maruti, with a 13.5% cut in the target price to  ₹4,103.
According to Bloomberg data on Monday, 34 brokerages have a “Buy"" rating on Maruti. Another 11 brokerages have assigned a “Sell"" rating, with most downgrading the stock from “Hold"" at the start of this year. Another 10 brokerages have a “Hold"" rating, with several downgrading the stock post the weak June quarter results.
In an indication that vehicle sales may remain subdued during the upcoming festival season, Maruti will not push inventories at dealerships before the festive season kicks in as it traditionally does. This decision comes at a time when most dealer partners are financially stressed and as the overall slowdown in the economy continues to keep customers away from showrooms.
“There is no point pushing the stocks in the dealerships when there is no demand in the market. We will take a call regarding production after taking a look at the market situation. We have an inventory of a little more than a month with our dealers since retail sales is under pressure,"" R.S. Kalsi, senior executive director for sales and marketing at Maruti Suzuki, said in a conference call with analysts on Friday.
Manufacturers of four- and two-wheeler segments traditionally start pushing inventory to dealerships from August in anticipation of higher sales during the festival season, which traditionally starts with Onam in August and ends with Diwali in November. Vehicle manufacturers generate at least a third of their overall retail sales in a fiscal during the festival season."
155,2019-07-31,Maruti,"A sharp fall in the Nifty 50’s earnings is not helping ease valuationsThe problem is that the correction has not helped lower valuations in any way

The downward spiral in the Indian stock market could get more acute if the earnings cycle does not turn soon.
A sharp fall in the Nifty 50’s earnings is not helping ease valuations. In fact, valuations have expanded since January 2019.
The Nifty 50’s earnings per share (EPS) hovered about  ₹415 in January 2019, as per data from the National Stock Exchange Ltd. The EPS has since shrunk to  ₹405 if one looks at the trailing 12-months numbers on the NSE website.
The problem is that the correction has not helped lower valuations in any way. On the contrary, the price-earnings (PE) multiple has remained elevated. In fact, since January 2019 the Nifty 50’s PE increased from 26 times earnings to about 27.6 times currently.
That means that stock prices still remain elevated, and the Nifty’s current valuations is not much comforting.
After all, a correction in the market essentially should reflect in lower valuations. If the earnings are falling, the market’s valuations could continue to look stiff and overvalued despite a correction.
To top it, the bigger risk for investors is the lack of earnings triggers in the coming quarters. The slowdown in vital sectors of the economy is likely to drag down the Nifty’s earnings even further. Analysts have already begun downgrading the Nifty’s earnings in the current year.
“Consensus Nifty FY20/21 EPS is currently forecasting a growth of 23%/18% with nominal GDP growth assumption of 10% - which indicates high risk of meaningful earnings downgrade (correlation between Nominal GDP and Nifty EPS is at 0.65; significant divergence exists for FY20-22),"" said analysts at PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.
As such, scores of companies reported poor first quarter results which include the likes of Tata Motors Ltd, Yes Bank Ltd, Maruti Suzuki Ltd among others.
Many critical sectors face a sluggish demand condition. “We are expecting growth to taper in favoured sectors like consumer discretionary, infrastructure (roads), and chemicals (reflecting broader economic weakness) along with negativity persisting in automobiles, pharmaceuticals, FMCG, and metal,"" said PhillipCapital in the note.
As things stand, if the demand conditions don’t begin to improve starting next quarter, earnings downgrades could even escalate from the present levels.
In fact, analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd which downgraded Nifty earnings by 2.6% for FY 20 said in a client note that “Further earnings downgrade of 2-3% can’t be ruled out owing to overall economic slowdown.""
That does not bode well for the markets. After all, both a price and an earnings correction can be a lethal combination, one that can crush investor sentiment."

Mumbai: Automobile manufacturers in the country slashed production by 11% in April-June period this fiscal over the year-ago period amid the industry facing the worst slowdown with sales declining month after month, said a rating agency's report on Wednesday.
Vehicle sales across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in the April-June period against 69,42,742 units in the same period of last year.
Domestic automobile industry's sales volume fell 12% in June 2019 over the same month last year on weak consumer sentiments owing to the slowing economy amid delays in the onset of monsoons.
""The auto industry undertook a production cut of 11% in the June quarter over the year-ago period on account of production cut in passenger and commercial vehicles as well as two-wheeler segment, which stood at around 12%, 14% and 10% year-on-year, respectively,"" rating agency India Ratings and Research said in its report.
The production cut in the PV segment was as higher as 15% y-o-y while in the utility vehicles (UVs) segment it stood at 2% y-o-y, it said.
According to the rating agency, the market leader Maruti Suzuki slashed production by 15% following the slowdown in the industry to reduce inventory at the dealer level.
The average inventory for PVs declined to 30-35 days in June from 35-40 days in May, the report said, adding contrary to industry-wide production cuts, Hyundai Motor increased production by 3% over April-June 2019.
In the commercial vehicle segment, the top two players Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra curtailed production by 12% and 25% respectively, due to high existing inventory levels with the average inventory for CVs increased to 55-60 days in June from 45-50 days in May, it said.
In the two-wheeler segment, Hero MotoCorp cut production by 11% during the period while rival Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India took a substantial cut of 23% year-on-year over April-June.
The 2W inventory at dealer level increased to 60-65 days in June , up from 55-60 days in May, the report said adding the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations has requested the auto industry to bring down dealer inventory of 21 days by September.
Therefore further production cuts are likely to continue in July as well, given the existing high inventory levels, it added.
PV sales volume declined 18% YoY in June driven by weak buying sentiment leading to the postponement of purchases.
CV sales volume declined 12% YoY in the previous month, owing to decreased industry demand on account of tight liquidity conditions, especially amongst non-banking finance companies, revised axle load norms, and delayed purchases owing to weak customer sentiments, as per the rating agency.
The two-wheelers sale also fell 12% YoY in June on increased insurance costs, higher interest rates and weak rural demand amid delayed monsoon, the report said."
153,2019-08-01,Maruti,"India's largest passenger vehicle manufacturer sold 98210 units in JulyMaruti Suzuki’s net profit for the quarter ended June 30 witnessed the steepest decline in the last five years

Following the continued slowdown in the economy and tightening of credit norms by financial institutions, domestic wholesales of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd-- the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer—slumped 36.3% year-on-year in July to 98,210 units. This is the sharpest decline in wholesales that the company has witnessed in the last two decades.
In the corresponding month last year, the company sold 154,150 units.
Domestic vehicle manufacturers are expected to report sharp decline in sales in July due to the overall slowdown and because of the high base effect of the first half of last fiscal.
For Maruti, sales in the compact segment, which includes best sellers like the Swift, Baleno, Dzire, and Wagon R, declined nearly 23%, while utility vehicle sales fell a shade above 38%. The decline in utility vehicle sales can also be attributed to the company’s announcement to withdraw its diesel offerings from April, 2020.
The company’s domestic vehicle sales fell more than 19% to 374,481 units in the June quarter, the sharpest drop since the third quarter of 2000-01. This has taken a toll on its financials as well as stock performance.
Maruti Suzuki’s net profit for the quarter ended June 30 witnessed the steepest decline in the last five years, while the operating margin contracted 455 basis points due to increased expenses and sharp fall in volumes. Net profit fell 27.3% year-on-year to  ₹1,435.5 crore, while the company’s net sales during the period fell 14.1% to Rs18,735.2 crore."
152,2019-08-02,Maruti,"Maruti has already started testing its first electric vehicle based on its hatchback Wagon RMaruti Suzuki though is reeling under the pressure of continuous decline in vehicle sales in India

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India ltd - country’s largest vehicle manufacturer- will focus on developing vehicles with compressed natural gas and hybrid powertrains till electric vehicles become affordable. The union government is urging vehicle manufacture to shift towards development and manufacturing of electric vehicles in the next decade to reduce air pollution and oil imports.
Maruti has already started testing its first electric vehicle based on its hatchback Wagon R but the company thinks in the interim period CNG and hybrid engine based vehicles will offer a solution.
""The company is working on Electric Vehicle (EV) development. In addition, till the time EVs gain prominence overcoming the lack of infrastructure and high costs, a more workable solution is to promote other powertrain options of clean energy like CNG and hybrid EVs. We are thankful to the Government of India and appreciate their efforts in increasing the CNG distribution network in the country,"" said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director, Maruti Suzuki in its annual report.
Maruti’s parent Suzuki Motor Co has already collaborated with Toyota Motor Co, for developing affordable hybrid and electric vehicles for the Indian market. Suzuki along with Denso Corp and Toshiba Corp invested in setting up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing capacity in Gujarat.
Maruti Suzuki though is reeling under the pressure of continuous decline in vehicle sales in India due to the overall decline in economic activity and lack of availability of credit from financial institutions. In June, the company’s vehicle sales declined sharply by 36%.
“BS6 norms and the impact on smaller diesel vehicles is one factor that is resulting in the lower sale of cars this year. However, the market response to the BSVI vehicles that have been introduced has been excellent and customers appreciate new technology and the ‘greenness’ of the vehicles. The increased sale of petrol and CNG vehicles in the future should more than compensate for the discontinuance of diesel vehicles,"" said R C Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki, in its latest annual report."
151,2019-08-02,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, said it had not reduced its permanent workforceIt is the first time the reduction has been reported

NEW DELHI :
Manesar/New Delhi: India's biggest automaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said it had cut the number of its temporary workers to cope with a slowdown in auto sales, adding to the jobless problem in Asia's third largest economy.
The vehicle industry, accounting for nearly half of India's manufacturing output, is facing one of its worst slowdowns in nearly a decade, with vehicle sales falling rapidly. There is little sign of a swift revival.
Maruti Suzuki said in an email sent to Reuters it employed 18,845 temporary workers on average in the six months ended June 30, down 6% or 1,181 from the same period last year. The company also said job cuts had accelerated since April.
Two sources familiar with the matter said the company would freeze hiring new employees until the downturn reversed.
It is the first time the reduction has been reported. The listed firm is not required to disclose any reduction in its temporary workforce.
India's jobless rate rose to 7.51% in July 2019 from 5.66% a year earlier, according to private data group CMIE. Those figures do not include many people on the margins of society who are day labourers and are often unemployed or underemployed.
Economists say government jobless figures are out of date and lack credibility.
Maruti Suzuki, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp, said it had not reduced its 15,892-strong more permanent workforce. It declined to say whether further reductions were planned or comment on the hiring freeze.
The automaker previously said it had cut production by 10.3% in the first six months of the year.
Maruti Suzuki, which produces every second passenger vehicle sold in India, reported a 33.5% decline in sales in July to 109,265 vehicles compared with July 2018.
Chairman R. C. Bhargava told Reuters the workforce was being reduced to reflect the slowdown in business, adding that this was one reason carmakers liked to have some temporary workers, although he did not give details about the job losses.
""One of the consequences of a slowdown is that the marginal players and weaker players find it difficult to survive. When do consolidations happen in business? Only when times are difficult,"" he added.
Two temporary workers outside the Manesar plant in the northern Indian state of Haryana, who did not want to be named, said the number of days with three shifts had been reduce. They said some assembly lines at the plant were not operating.
Kuldeep Janghu, general secretary of the Maruti Udyog workers union, said the average wage of temporary workers were about $250 a month at the company's Manesar and Gurugram plants.
The two plants have combined capacity to produce more than 1.5 million vehicles a year.
The company rolled out its popular Maruti 800 model from the Gurugram plant in 1983.
The auto sales downturn has put jobs across the industry at risk. The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) said parts makers could slash a fifth of their 5 million workforce if the slump continued."
150,2019-08-03,Maruti,"With the increasing bookings for Venue, Hyundai’s share in the utility vehicle space has been further bolsteredIn July, Hyundai’s total utility vehicle despatches stood at 16,234 units compared to 15,178 units sold by Maruti to its dealers

New Delhi: Hyundai Motor India Ltd - country’s second largest vehicle manufacturer- has taken over Maruti Suzuki India Ltd as the leading manufacturer of utility vehicles in the July, as a result of the overwhelming response received for Venue, the South Korean company’s first compact sport utility vehicle.
Hyundai first tasted success in the utility vehicle market with Creta, which was launched in 2015 and the company continues to sell around 8000 units on an average every month.
Now with the increasing bookings for Venue, after the launch in the domestic market, Hyundai’s share in the utility vehicle space has been further bolstered.
In July, Hyundai’s total utility vehicle despatches stood at 16,234 units compared to 15,178 units sold by Maruti to its dealers. Mahindra and Mahindra’s wholesales in their space stood at 16,003 on the back of recently launched XUV 300.
Back in 2017, Maruti Suzuki took over the mantle of leading manufacturer of utility vehicles from Mahindra and Mahindra, after the company launched the Vitara Brezza, its first in the compact UV segment. Along with that it’s multi-purpose vehicle Brezza was also a favourite of customers.
Mahindra on the other hand couldn’t fight back with its products TUV 300 and KUV100 but with the recently introduced XUV 300, the company has managed to compete with the existing players in the system.
For Maruti, Vitara Brezza has been the best seller over the last two fiscal years. In the current fiscal, apart from the downturn in the economy, the announcement of the company phasing out diesel vehicles from April, 2020, has also impacted sales. In July the company significantly reduced wholesale dispatches of the vehicle as total sales crashed by 36%. Also, Maruti is expected to introduce a petrol engine powered Vitara Brezza in the next few months and the company might be trying to ease the pressure of its dealerships and create some room for the upcoming variant.
In July, Hyundai dispatched 9585 units of Venue compared to 5,032 units of Vitara Brezza and 4,464 units of XUV 300. At a time, when the demand in the domestic market has nosedived to a multi decade low, Hyundai has received more than 50,000 bookings for Venue.
New entrant MG Motor India Ltd has also stopped receiving bookings for its first product Hector after it touched the 28,000 mark, as the company doesn’t have the capacity to quickly ramp up its manufacturing capacity in its Gujarat plant."
148,2019-08-04,Maruti,"The company will, however, continue to work on the necessary enablers to tap opportunities in the medium and long termMSI Chairman R C Bhargava said the company needs to recognise that such downturns do happen from time to time all over the world

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) has said headwinds like softening of demand in the domestic market and protectionist measures abroad may impact its ability to create value in the short term.
The company, which has over 50% market share in the domestic passenger vehicle industry, has been impacted by sluggish offtake and has seen total sales drop 33.5% in July at 1,09,264 units.
""India has already become the fifth largest car market in the world, though car penetration rate remains reasonably low at 3%, with the country's population exceeding 1.3 billion people. With economic growth, the low penetration offers a good growth opportunity to the automobile market and the company,"" MSI said in its Annual Report for 2018-19.
However, in the short term there are certain headwinds that might affect the company's ability to create value, it informed shareholders of the company.
""These include slowdown in consumption leading to softened demand in domestic market, weakening of Indian economy due to protectionist trade measures adopted recently by various countries, uncertainty in commodity prices and foreign exchange fluctuations,"" it added.
The company will, however, continue to work on the necessary enablers to tap opportunities in the medium and long term, MSI said.
""These include strengthening its customer-centric culture, expanding sales and service network, increasing manufacturing capacity, investing in new products and technology, augmenting capability and skills of employees and inculcating green manufacturing methods,"" it added.
Terming the weak demand situation as unfortunate, MSI Chairman R C Bhargava said the company needs to recognise that such downturns do happen from time to time all over the world.
""Such occasions, while posing challenges also provide an opportunity to review what we are doing and to find ways of becoming more efficient and cost-effective,"" he said in the Annual Report.
Bhargava further said: ""My belief is that we are near the bottom of the downward cycle and the economy, and car sales should start to accelerate in the near future. The fiscal year 2021 should again see your company coming back to its usual rate of growth.""
With prolonged slowdown, MSI has been forced to take various steps, including production cuts at its manufacturing plants, in order to adjust its inventory to market demand. It had cut vehicle production for the fifth consecutive month in June by 15.6 per cent to 1,11,917 units as compared to 1,32,616 units in the year-ago month.
As per industry sources, the company has also reduced temporary manpower at its facilities and freezed new hiring till the slowdown continues.
A senior leader of the company's workers union, while confirming the developments, said that only temporary workers were impacted and there was no impact on the permanent employees so far.
However, a mail sent to the company regarding the jobs cuts and new hiring freeze remained unanswered.
In its Annual Report, MSI said it is increasing its engagement with customers to address the short-term challenge of weak market demand by pursuing targeted marketing events to generate enquiries and encourage customers to expedite vehicle purchase.
""Hyper-local marketing techniques are being used extensively for customer engagement,"" it said."
149,2019-08-04,Maruti,"With no immediate signs of recovery, FADA feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government interventionAbout two lakh jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India: FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale

New Delhi: Around two lakh jobs have been cut across automobile dealerships in India in the last three months as vehicle retailers take the last resort of cutting manpower to tide over the impact of the unprecedented sales slump, according to industry body FADA.
With no immediate signs of recovery, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government intervention such as reduction of GST to provide relief to the auto industry.
""The majority of job cuts have happened in the last three months...It started around May and continued through June and July,"" FADA President Ashish Harsharaj Kale told PTI.
He further said, ""Right now most of the cuts which have happened are in front-end sales jobs but if this (slowdown) continues, then even the technical jobs will be affected because if we are selling less then we will also service less, so it is a cycle.""
When asked how many jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India, he said, ""Close to about two lakh.""
""It is a guesstimate that our members have already cut 7-8% of the jobs in most of the dealerships as the degrowth has been very high,"" he added.

Around 2.5 million people were employed directly through around 26,000 automobile showrooms operated by 15,000 dealers. Another 2.5 million are indirectly employed in the dealership ecosystem, he added.
The two lakh jobs cuts in the last three months are over and above the 32,000 people who lost employment when 286 showrooms were closed across 271 cities in the 18-month period ended April this year, he added.
Stating that more dealerships have closed in the past three months, Kale said, ""We are collating the figures again...In a few cases some (dealers) have gone for closure of outlets, not the main outlets but those which were put up anticipating some geographic reach.""
Elaborating reasons for taking the drastic step of cutting jobs, he said the 'margin of error' in the business in the past few years has really gone down with cost almost doubling in the last three to four years.
""The margin that we earn overall as a business has not gone up. Therefore, if we go into a degrowth situation we get into cash loss. So to avoid that, dealers have been cutting down on costs other than manpower...Till March this year none of the dealers went for any manpower correction because we thought this was a temporary slowdown and it will soon recover,"" he said.
However, he said, ""The way the first quarter has panned out despite good election results and the Budget, the degrowth continued. It is clear now that a proper slowdown has hit us. Now dealers have resorted to cutting manpower.""
Terming manpower as 'the most precious resource of dealers', Kale said,""That is the last thing we try to cut down. When the slowdown started we first decided that we should go for stock reduction. Most of OEMs have supported us. While cutting other variable expenses that we can, we did not touch manpower till March and almost mid-April.""
Ruing the loss of jobs, he said, ""It is the last resort because it is difficult to get those manpower. We invest a lot on training them because it is a peculiar industry, whether it is a technical or a field job.""
As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) figures, vehicle wholesale across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in April-June against 69,42,742 units in same period of last year.
On the other hand, as per data based on registrations collated by FADA, automobile retail sales in the April-June period declined by 6% to 51,16,718 units in the first quarter of this fiscal as against 54,42,317 units in the year-ago period.
Passenger vehicles (PV) segment has been the worst hit with sales continuing to decline for almost a year now. In July, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 36.3% drop in its domestic PV wholesales, while Hyundai saw a dip of 10%.
M&M sales were down 16%, Tata Motors' PV sales fell 31% while that of Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) also came down 48.67% during the month.
Seeking immediate government intervention, Kale said, ""We are hoping, from whatever we are hear that the government has taken note of the serious situation that is going on in the overall economy, specifically with the auto sector. We are hoping for some support for the auto sector in the next few days or week or two."" He said the auto industry has already put out a request for GST cut.
""It is not a permanent demand. We know GST is such a huge developmental agenda for the government, but at the same time (it is needed for) reviving the auto industry. We (auto industry) are almost 8% of the GDP and 49% of manufacturing GDP,"" Kale said.
He said while the revival of monsoon holds out hope, resolution of liquidity crisis, specially with the NBFCs, will go along way in helping the auto industry recover from one of the worst sales slumps in its history.

147,2019-08-04,Maruti,"Shadow banks, or NBFCs have long funded vast chunk of auto salesDealer inventories hit 55-60 day levels, up from 45 days - FADA

MUMBAI:
Sudhir Gharpure and his sales team sat chatting at a big Maruti Suzuki dealership on the outskirts of Mumbai some two hours after its doors were opened on a recent Saturday morning - not a single customer was in sight.
""There used to be close to 15-20 bookings each day, but now we're down to 3-5 on good days,"" said Gharpure, the general manager at the dealership.
Gharpure's experience is not an isolated one. Across India dealerships are being pushed out of business and the Indian auto sector is going through its biggest slump in nearly two decades. Passenger vehicle sales fell for eight straight months until June, and in May sales dropped 20.55% - the sharpest recorded fall in 18 years.
Preliminary data indicates passenger vehicle sales may have plunged as much as 30 percent in July. The slump in India, along with a simultaneous slide in Chinese auto sales, is a blow for automakers wrestling with higher costs driven by more stringent emission norms and a push to develop electric cars.
Unlike in China, where the plunge in cars sales has been caused largely by new emissions rules, India has seen a mix of factors that have combined to erode demand for automobiles.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 2016 ban on high-value bank notes, higher tax rates under a new goods and services tax regime, a boom of ride-sharing firms such as Uber and Ola, and a weak rural economy have all played a role.
But many dealers and automakers agree it is a deepening liquidity crunch among India's shadow banks that has been the biggest single factor in an auto sales collapse, which some fear may lead to more than a million job losses.
Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), or shadow banks, have dramatically slashed lending following the collapse of one of the biggest, IL&FS, in late 2018.
IL&FS, or Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd, was a behemoth in shadow banking and its defaults and unravelling, amid fraud allegations, have dried up funding for rivals and led to a surge in their borrowing costs.
Non-bank or shadow banking firms generate credit outside traditional lenders, by means such as collective investment vehicles, broker-dealers or funds that invest in bonds and money markets.
In India, NBFCs have in recent years helped fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles both new and used, 30% of passenger cars and nearly 65% of the two-wheelers in the country, according to rating agency ICRA.
To aggravate matters, the stress in the autos market has also prompted banks to begin trimming their exposure to the sector.
""The car doesn't sell, it's the finance that sells,"" said R. Vijayaraghavan, a senior marketing consultant at the same Mumbai dealership. ""Today the finance is not selling, so the cars are not selling.""
Problems amplified
Some 286 dealerships have shut down in the last 18 months across India as rising costs for inventory management have made businesses unviable, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA), a lobby group of auto dealers.
""The slowdown in the (NBFC) sector has dragged down vehicle sales growth,"" said A.M. Karthik, financial sector head at ICRA. ""Now the auto slowdown is becoming more visible as the liquidity squeeze continues.""
Automakers including Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors , and Mahindra & Mahindra are feeling the heat and have either cut production or temporarily closed plants to correct mounting stocks.
According to FADA data, passenger vehicle inventories now stand at 50-60 days up from around 45 days earlier, while those of two-wheelers are even higher at 80-90 days. For commercial vehicles, inventory levels range between 45 and 50 days.
""We are asking dealers to maintain an inventory of 21 days, which is almost half of the current levels,"" said Ashish Kale, president of FADA.
At least four dealers from different brands said, however, there was little scope to reduce inventories as automakers were pushing them to buy stock despite there being no demand even with heavy discounting and other sops on offer.
While 70-75% of car sales were previously financed in-house by NBFC or bank agents sitting at a dealership, that has fallen to about 50%, say dealers, as buyers struggle to qualify under more stringent lending norms put in place by lenders that are under pressure to shore up their books.
Moreover, as many NBFCs typically lent to less creditworthy clients, banks are reticent to rush in to fill the void, as they themselves struggle to cope with an existing pile of about $150 billion in bad loans.
""The banking sector is certainly one of the factors that has affected the growth of the industry,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chair of Maruti Suzuki, noting interest rates for car buyers have gone up in the last 12 months despite the central bank cutting rates.
Early recovery unlikely
With the autos sector employing more than 35 million people directly and indirectly, and contributing more than 7% to India's GDP and accounting for 49% of its manufacturing GDP, the fallout from the autos slump is huge and presents a big challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
The entire supply chain, from vehicle manufacturers to component makers, are bleeding amid the slump.
""I've been making my payments for the last 30 years and the lenders know me,"" said Adarsh Gupta, the director of finance at Autolite (India), a component manufacturing firm. ""But even a two-day delay has people crying that I will default.
""I too want to pay, but because of the fall in cashflows I'm facing short-term issues and because of that it's difficult to get more financing. This is the vicious cycle we are in.""
Still, automakers are hopeful of a recovery in the months ahead, helped by the September-December festive season that traditionally sees a surge in consumer spending.
""One can only wish that things improve sooner rather than later. With festive demand starting to seep through, we should start seeing a gradual improvement in sales,"" said P.B. Balaji, group CFO at Tata Motors.
Analysts are more sceptical though, and say without vehicle financing becoming cheaper and easier the chances for that are low. With no silver lining in sight, analysts fear bad debts could mount in the auto sector, forcing banks to further reduce their exposure.
""We see market prices and sales coming down so there may be issues,"" said a top official at the Indian Banks' Association. ""We could see a spillover in terms of bad loans for the overall sector, but we are going to wait and watch.""
Dealers said they were hopeful of tiding over the current downturn as the broader growth story for India remains intact, but there could be a lot more pain before a recovery kicks in.
""The future is going to be multi-brand car showrooms,"" said marketing consultant Vijayaraghavan. ""That is the only way for dealerships to survive going forward as overhead costs need to be shared.""

TOKYO/NEW DELHI :
Suzuki Motor Corp on Monday said its consolidated net sales declined by 80 billion yen (8.1 %) to 907.5 billion yen in the April-June quarter as compared to the year-ago period, mainly hit by slip in Indian sales as well as cut in production in Japan.
The company said the operating income decreased by 53.8 billion yen to 62.7 billion yen, down 46.2 % and net income attributable to owners of the parent declined by 45.4 billion yen (52.8 %) to 40.5 billion yen on a year-on-year basis.
""Net sales and income of this first quarter (April to June 2019) decreased owing to decrease in Japan production due to restructuring of final inspection structure, as well as decrease in Indian automobile sales due to slowdown in overall market,"" Suzuki Motor Corp said in a statement.
The company's net sales during the quarter were also impacted by decline in sales in other markets like Pakistan and Indonesia, and due to impact of Yen appreciation, it added.
Maruti Suzuki India (MSI), which is majority-owned by Suzuki, has seen sales slump in India due to a prolonged slowdown.
The company's domestic sales were down 36.3 % at 98,210 units last month compared to 1,54,150 units in July last year. It was in June 2017 that the company's sales had last fallen below 1 lakh units in a month.
With prolonged slowdown, MSI has been forced to take various steps, including production cuts at its manufacturing plants, in order to adjust its inventory to market demand. It had cut vehicle production for the fifth consecutive month in June by 15.6 % to 1,11,917 units as compared to 1,32,616 units in the year-ago month.
As per industry sources, the company has also reduced temporary manpower at its facilities and freezed new hiring till the slowdown continues.

146,2019-08-05,Maruti,"Vendors are either temporarily shutting plants or adjusting output by reducing daily shifts in factoriesThe current 15-20% cut in production has led to a crisis-like situation in the auto ancillary industry

MUMBAI :
Auto parts makers in India have been hit hard by automobile companies cutting production to trim inventory amid weak demand.
The vendors are being forced to follow the path of the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) by either temporarily shutting plants or adjusting output by reducing the number of daily shifts in their factories.
Automakers such as Maruti Suzuki Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M), Ashok Leyland Ltd and Honda Motorcycle & Scooter India Ltd have temporarily closed plants in the past few months. Initial reports for July suggest that the passenger car sales have slipped by over 29% making it the worst month in the past 2 decades.
Mint reached out to more than a dozen auto parts makers and learnt that while production cuts are resulting in mounting fixed costs and loss of jobs for contractual shop floor workers, smaller businesses are beginning to default on loans.
On 20 July, Bosch Ltd, one of the largest auto parts makers in India, said it has suspended operations at its Gangaikondan plant in Tamil Nadu for five days starting 23 July to ‘avoid unnecessary buildup of inventory’. Later, it suspended operations at its Naganathapura unit in Karnataka for two days (27 and 29 July) followed by single-day shutdowns at Jaipur (27 July) and Bidadi (29 July).
Bosch is not alone. Other key tier one vendors such as Exide Industries, Continental Automotive Components (India), ZF, Brose India Automotive Systems, Schaeffler India, Brembo Brakes India, Kalyani Maxion Wheels, Varroc Group, Eaton, IAC India have adjusted their respective production schedules to align their inventory as per the revised forecasts by the car companies.
A spokesperson at Exide said capacity is usually diverted to the aftermarket segment during low demand from automakers. “So, in the short run, this works to our advantage because aftermarket offers us better margin. However, if the demand slump continues for a very long time, then there is cause for concern,"" he stated.
Kalyani Maxion Wheels shut its truck wheel manufacturing plant for five days while the car wheel facility was closed for three days, one person at the company said. Meanwhile, Brose, a German supplier of window regulators and door modules for cars, trimmed its daily production schedule from three shifts to a single shift.
“Facilities are being shut on weekends; few shifts are being suspended impacting a large proportion of contractual workers, which comprise about 50% of all manpower employed by the auto industry. Few smaller enterprises are even beginning to default on loans raised from the financial institutions due to this economic slowdown,"" said a senior industry official, who declined to be named.
Jignesh Raval, MD, Sintercom India Ltd, maker of sintered parts for engines and transmissions, said, “The offtake continues to be low from our customers. This has forced us to cut our production to two shifts to control our inventory. If we don’t see further improvements, we will have to consider a block closure for a week in August.""
The current 15-20% cut in vehicle production has led to a crisis-like situation in the auto ancillary industry and if the trend continues, an estimated one million people could be laid off, Ram Venkataramani, president, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) said recently.
Prashanth Doreswamy, market head, Continental India, a powertrain and chassis parts supplier, said various factors have contributed to the downturn. “We are closely monitoring our production and process costs. We are continuing to optimize them. Hiring is being looked at carefully,"" he said.
However, he said the company, which invested in two greenfield plants recently, is keeping its expansion plans on track.
Suresh K.V., head of ZF Region India, said his company is also impacted by the overall weak automobile demand. “We are carefully monitoring the situation such as inventory levels on a daily basis and balance our labour capacities between the different production lines,"" he said.
Vinodkumar Ramachandran, partner and head, Automotive and Industrial Manufacturing, KPMG in India sees vendors increasing their focus on agility and optimization of resources on weekly basis to manage costs. “They are focused on lowering their breakeven levels by converting fixed cost to variable cost and deploying technologies and automation to lower their enabling function costs,"" he added."

The unprecedented slowdown in India’s automobile industry has severely hit automakers with Nissan Motor Co. and Hyundai Motor Co. bearing the maximum brunt of shuttered retail outlets.
Car market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) and Renault also witnessed several dealership outlets close amid a sharp fall in demand.
Japan’s Nissan had the most shutdowns with 44 dealer outlets closing in the 18-months through April 2019, according to the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada). Nissan has been witnessing lower sales of its namesake as well as Datsun brand of vehicles in India.
Hyundai closed 39 dealerships during the period as overall customer orders fell despite robust demand for its recently introduced Venue compact sport-utility vehicle model.
Growing economic uncertainties, rise in insurance costs and an ongoing credit crunch has crimped automobile demand. Rural sentiments have been hit by irregular rainfall this year. Passenger vehicle sales have fallen for the ninth month in a row in July. With banks tightening credit norms for dealers, many have been starved of funds, forcing them to pull down the shutters.
Fada, which represents about 15,000 dealerships and 26,000 outlets across India, said a total of 286 dealership outlets downed their shutters in the 18 month-period.
The closure of retail outlets along with manpower downsizing across the 26,000 outlets has resulted in losses of about 200,000 direct and indirect jobs during the May to July period, adding to the 32,000 people who lost their jobs in the prior 18-months ended April, said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president, Fada. He said the 26,000 dealer outlets employ about 2.5 million people.
“The dealerships are beginning to reduce manpower costs, which is the last resort among other cost cutting measures for us. While the vehicle manufacturers are now helping us control inventory, June and July were the worst months for trade. Our initial estimates suggest that about 7-8% of manpower reduction has taken place in the last three months,"" he said. Nissan contested that only 25 outlets have seen closures in the past 18 months.
“While we have had 25 outlets closures in the last one and a half year, at present, we have over 270 touchpoints across 220 cities and will continue to strengthen our presence across the country,"" said a spokesperson for Nissan India.
Hyundai did not respond to queries until press time.
Meanwhile, Tata Motors and M&M saw closures of 27 and 24 dealership outlets respectively, including both passenger and commercial vehicle retail outlets. Renault, Honda and Ford had 21, 19 and 17 dealership outlets close down, respectively, in the same period, according to Fada. Only 13 dealerships outlets of Maruti Suzuki closed down, which has the biggest retail network among domestic automakers.
S.N. Barman, vice president, sales and marketing, Tata Motors (TML) said, “During these 19 months, we have severed our relationship with 22 dealer principals. This was primarily done due to non-compliance with TML business objectives, customer interests and market coverage.""
Barman said TML has appointed more than 59 new dealer principals who opened 93 outlets. In an e-mailed response, an M&M spokesperson said, “In the past 18 months we have had a few dealer closures across the country and this is nothing unusual.""
Maruti Suzuki, Renault and Honda did not respond to emailed queries."
142,2019-08-08,Maruti,"Around 40,000-50,000 workers in the Gurugram-Manesar auto belt have been retrenchedThe downtrend has trickled down to the logistics sector as lower vehicle production has drastically hit the utilization of trucks

New Delhi/Mumbai: A prolonged sales slowdown has plunged India, the world’s fourth-largest automobile market, into a labour crisis with tens of thousands of workers losing their jobs in the past few months across automakers and their parts suppliers.
Almost 40,000-50,000 workers have been retrenched at Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana, the country’s biggest automotive hub, as original equipment manufacturers and vendors have reduced their contract labour force, said several people aware of the developments. The situation is also severe in the automotive hubs of Chakan in Pune and Chennai, the people said.
With the slowdown showing little or no signs of bottoming out, hiring from local engineering colleges in the region has also taken a beating.
The Gurugram-Manesar hub houses two factories of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, and one each of Honda Motorcycle and Scooters India Pvt. Ltd (HMSI) and Hero MotoCorp. Ltd (HMC).
The downtrend has also trickled down to the logistics sector as lower vehicle production has drastically hit the utilization of trucks, leading to an increase in non-performing loans in the sector.
The domestic passenger vehicle industry has recorded its worst performance in the past two decades in July, continuing the downward trend for nearly a year. Sales of commercial vehicles and two-wheelers have also been hit. A series of factors including higher insurance costs, volatile stock markets and a liquidity squeeze in a slowing economy have slammed demand for new vehicles.
Maruti’s base of more than 300 tier I vendors have laid off 100-150 people on an average. Prominent vendors, who have multiple facilities such as Lumax Technologies and JBM group, have laid off around 500 or more employees. HMSI, India’s largest scooter maker, has asked 1,200-1,400 of its level I or technical contract workers to proceed on leave, while a third of the total contractual workforce with the vendors has been made redundant, said the people cited earlier.
None of the automakers disclosed the number of level II or non-technical workers who have been asked to go on leave.
“HMSI has removed 1,200-1,400 jobs since November last year as daily production has been reduced to 3,500 vehicles from 5,500 vehicles. Also, a third of our tier I suppliers have removed a third of their contractual workers in the last six months,"" said a worker at the Manesar plant of HMSI. “Post October, job losses are expected to rise even more as introduction of Bharat Stage VI norms would lead to a slowdown for a couple of quarters.""
Pawan Goenka, managing director of Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), said job losses are taking place at the level of automakers, dealers, suppliers and other unorganized levels. “Given the current challenging global and domestic growth environment, a concerted policy effort will be required to prop up sentiment, put a floor under consumption and revive growth,"" he said.
Level I contract workers in the companies work on the shop floor, while level II work in places such as employee canteens and stockyards. Maruti has asked 300-400 of its contractual workers at its Gurugram facility to proceed on “rest"". The figure is almost double at its factory in Manesar.
Kuldeep Janghu, general secretary of Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union, said 10-15% of the total workforce in the Gurugram and Manesar region have been shown the door as sales have fallen drastically in the past year.
“Maruti has stopped hiring in the Manesar plant and recruitment of students from colleges has also been significantly low. Hiring is not expected to improve next year. Maruti is still better than other automobile manufacturers when it comes to balancing its workforces in such trying times,"" said Janghu.
Dilip Pawar, a union leader who represents Vishwa Kalyan Kamgar Sanghatana in Pune, said the ongoing slowdown has “directly resulted in massive production cuts at the manufacturing units in and around Pune"".
“While we don’t have accurate number of job losses at the moment, I estimate that more than 10,000 daily wage workers have become unemployed over the past months as plants that were running three shifts a day are now operating only a single shift,"" he said.
Pawar said most of the job cuts were made by vehicle manufacturers such as Tata Motors Ltd, M&M and Volkswagen India.
He said all the retrenched workers were temporary and full-time employees have not been fired so far.
A person from SIPCOT Irungattukottai Manufacturers Association near Chennai, who did not want to be named, echoed a similar sentiment. He, however, did not disclose the number of job losses in that region.
Although most automakers have decided to reduce workers, Bajaj Auto Ltd and HMC have been the outliers.
“Though production of vehicles has declined a bit, we haven’t seen many job losses as yet. Hero has not reduced production to the extent of Maruti and HMSI. We use to manufacture around 6,000 units daily, but now it has been reduced to 5,500 units,"" said a worker at the Manesar factory of HMC.
Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra said, “The most obvious and welcome first aid would be some temporary relief on the GST front, either by modifying the slabs, or, if that is not possible, by removing the cess""."
141,2019-08-08,Maruti,"Indian Hotels plans to dispose of certain budget inns in the nation’s non-metro areas and lease them back for a feeThe grounding of Jet Airways has also hit Indian Hotels, forcing it to write-off some dues

The luxury hotel chain controlled by the Tata Group is looking to sell some assets and avoid owning new properties in an effort to further pare debt, as it braces for a slump in consumer spending.
Indian Hotels Co, Tata’s listed firm that operates the Taj brand, plans to dispose of certain budget inns in the nation’s non-metro areas and lease them back for a fee, Puneet Chhatwal, managing director and chief executive officer said in an interview.
“We are moving our focus to more management contracts rather than constructing hotels of our own,"" Chhatwal said. “We have no plans to put our legacy and flagship properties under sale and lease back.""
The Mumbai-based company’s measures to cut costs and liabilities come at a time growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy has cooled to a five-year low, while a lingering shadow-bank crisis damps discretionary spending. The nation’s biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, reported the worst sales drop since 2012 in July. Besides the slowdown, the grounding of Jet Airways India Ltd has also hit Indian Hotels, forcing it to write-off some dues.
The chain, which operates New York’s The Pierre and St. James Court in the UK, has been reducing debt in the past few years by selling assets including apartments purchased for Tata Group’s executives. Consolidated net debt stood at  ₹2,000 crore ($282 million) at the end of March, down from as high as  ₹3,100 crore two years earlier, according to the hospitality firm.
Indian Hotels is focusing on an “asset light model"" besides keeping costs under check and shedding non-core assets, Amit Agarwal, analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. said over phone. All 12 brokerages, whose data Bloomberg compiles for this firm, have a buy rating on the stock.
The efforts to pare borrowings at the hotel chain are also part of a wider drive at India’s biggest conglomerate. Tata Motors Ltd, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has said it is looking at options for the struggling British luxury brands. Tata Steel Ltd is in the midst of a revamp of its European operations.
The hotel operator aims to reduce ownership of properties to 50% by 2022, from 70% at present, Chhatwal said. The sale and lease-back plans include as many as six hotels at the group’s Ginger budget brand and a similar number held by joint ventures and associate companies, he said.
Indian Hotels, currently operates 151 hotels, including the Taj Mahal Palace that became the target of terrorists during the Mumbai siege in 2008.

138,2019-08-13,Maruti,"The decision of automobile companies to transport vehicles via railways has also hurt the logistics businessThe auto industry in India has been experiencing a slowdown for the past 10 months

New Delhi/Mumbai: Faced with an uncertain future, Dharmendra Yadav, 32, has returned to his native village in Mainpuri district of western Uttar Pradesh.
Production cuts by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India’s largest passenger vehicle maker, have left truck drivers such as Yadav without any work as there has been a decline in demand for trailer trucks, used to transport finished vehicles across the country.
The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit has in recent months announced production cuts at its factories in Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana. Others such as Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Renault have taken similar measures at their factories across India.
The fortunes of India’s logistics industry are closely tied with those of the automobile sector. With the auto sector in the midst of a slowdown for the past 10 months, the logistics sector is facing the heat. There has been an increase in loan defaults by fleet operators, who have bought new trucks.
The automobile sector is not the only one to fault. With the Indian economy in the midst of a downturn, overall demand for other types of freight has also fallen, severely impacting the financial health of transporters and truck drivers.
Those who had planned orders for new heavy-duty trailer trucks have deferred them. This has impacted sales at commercial vehicle makers such as Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland Ltd and Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd, as well as their parts suppliers.
Like several others, the transport company where Yadav works as a driver has defaulted on its truck loans.
“I have been staying in my village for more than 15 days now and I don’t know when they will call me back. My company used to operate 30-50 trucks in Maruti’s plant in a month, depending on the demand but now hardly 20 trucks are plying. Salary was reduced to  ₹8,000 from  ₹12,000 and the long-distance driving allowance that I used to get has been stopped since there are no trips,"" said Yadav.
Fleet owners usually have contracts with vehicle manufacturers on purchasing new trucks. With new truck orders falling to a trickle, the dire situation has become a double whammy for commercial vehicle manufacturers, already reeling under the impact of the new axle load norms, which have also affected demand.
The new norms have increased the capacity of commercial vehicles by 15% on an average. The decision of automobile companies to transport vehicles via railways has also impacted business.
Kuldeep Yadav, another truck driver, is thinking of leaving for his native village near Manesar in the next few days, as the trucks owned by the company he works for are lying in the yard for almost a month now. Falling demand for small cars from the northern and eastern parts of India is another reason behind his plans.
“I used to earn around  ₹30,000-35,000 in a month since I used to go on long trips to places such as Siliguri and Guwahati. With the production cuts and the auto company deciding to transport vehicles by train, we have nothing to do right now as demand in other parts of the country is also not great,"" said Yadav.
A passenger vehicle maker can send up to 200 cars on a train, while by roadways it would have to deploy 50 trailer trucks.
Financing options have dried up for fleet owners amid the shadow banking crisis in India that emerged in late 2018, leading the shadow banks, or non-banking financial companies, to drastically cut their loan disbursals and tighten lending norms.
A senior official of VRL Logistics Ltd, who did not wish to be named, said automobile freight has declined more than 20%, resulting in fewer number of trips by car carriers. “Most automotive logistics service providers have sized their fleet according to the market load and the number of trips they make in their respective regions or pan-India. Since a car carrier is a tailor-made solution to transport vehicles, it cannot be used to transport any other cargo if vehicle transportation is cut down. This leads to idling of these vehicles,"" he said. The official did not disclose the number of car carriers currently idle at VRL Logistics.
As the automobile sector shows little signs of a revival, some fleet owners, who are buying automobile carriers, are choosing used vehicles to rein in cost.
Umesh Revankar, managing director of Shriram Transport Finance Co., said new commercial vehicles are not selling due to excess capacity created by the new axle load norms, but he expects demand to rebound by September due to higher freight from agricultural produce and the festival period.
“The number of trips by a particular truck has come down but the good thing is freight carrying capacity has increased revenue per trip. Our loan portfolio has grown by 6% year-on-year in the April-June quarter,"" said Revankar.
Umesh Bhanot, managing director of APL Logistics Vascor Automotive Pvt. Ltd, a third-party logistics specialist, said that although more than 90% of all vehicles produced are transported to regional markets through roadways, the slowdown is felt also by the railway carriers.
“When the cargo volumes drop, it is natural that you have to park some of your assets,"" Bhanot said, adding that his five-year old company, which is a joint venture between APL Logistics and Vascor, deploys 16 double-decker rail wagons to transport vehicles. Each of these wagons can carry up to 300 cars at a time."

India’s passenger vehicle industry suffered its worst sales performance in nearly 19 years in July as a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states deterred buyers.
Sales fell 31% to 200,790 vehicles last month from 290,931 units a year earlier, showed data released on Tuesday by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
This was also the ninth straight drop in monthly passenger vehicle sales. Sales have fallen in 12 of the 13 months since July 2018, underscoring the sharp slowdown in demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
In July, passenger car sales plunged 36% to 122,956 units, while utility vehicles recorded a 15% drop to 67,070 units. Vans suffered a 46% decline to 10,804 units. Industry body Siam releases wholesales, or factory dispatches, of automobiles, and not retail sales.
The drop in sales of utility vehicles came despite the recent introduction of models such as Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s XUV300, Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s Venue and MG Motor India Ltd’s Hector models. The new models have seen robust demand despite a weakness in the overall market.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd reduced wholesales of its Vitara Brezza compact sport utility vehicle because of weak demand, emerging competition and its recently announced plans to phase out diesel vehicles from next April.
Hyundai and Mahindra and Mahindra reported 10% and 15% decline in sales, respectively in July.
Weak domestic economic activity and escalating global trade tensions led the Reserve Bank of India to cut India’s growth projection for 2019-20 to 6.9% last week from its June forecast of 7%. A liquidity crunch caused by a shadow banking crisis since late 2018 has exacerbated the woes of the auto industry. Severe floods in key states such as Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka before the onset of Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi are also impacting the fortunes of the automobile industry.
In commercial vehicles, the economic slowdown has coincided with an increase in freight carrying capacity of trucks, which led to a sharp fall in sales as fleet owners could carry more freight on their existing trucks. Lower demand from agriculture and other sectors also contributed to the weak market as fleet owners witnessed a drop in rentals.
Sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles fell 37% in July to 17,722 units, while light commercial vehicles posted a 19% decline to 39,144 units. Total sales of commercial vehicles fell 26% to 56,866 units.
A sharp contraction in consumption in both urban and rural markets and an increase in third-party insurance premium continued to adversely impact sales of motorcycles and scooters. In the two-wheeler segment, total dispatches fell by 17% in July to 1.51 million units. Sales of motorcycles dropped 19% to 933,996 units, while scooter sales fell 12% to 526,504 units.
As the slowdown intensified, automakers announced shutdowns of their factories to adjust inventory. Tata Motors Ltd, India’s largest commercial vehicle maker, closed its Jamshedpur and Pune plants for up to 12 days. Ashok Leyland Ltd, the third-largest commercial vehicle maker by volume, closed its Pantnagar facility for nine days last month due to weak demand.
Among carmakers, Maruti cut production for the sixth straight month in July to control dealership stocks.
“There is no point pushing stocks in the dealerships when there is no demand in the market. We will take a call regarding production after taking a look at the market situation. We have an inventory of a little over a month with our dealers since retail sales are under pressure,"" R.S. Kalsi, senior executive director (sales and marketing) at Maruti Suzuki, said in a recent conference call with analysts.
Car and two-wheeler makers tend to start adding to dealer inventory from August in anticipation of higher sales during the festival season, which starts with Onam in August and ends with Diwali in November.
Vishnu Mathur, director general of Siam, said the decline can be arrested only if the automobile industry receives a financial package from the government. The flood situation in states such as Maharashtra will further impact consumer sentiment, he said.
“Thankfully, this time the festive season will arrive a bit late. So, if some help comes from the government, then we can expect demand to pick up during the festive season,"" Mathur said. “The automobile industry supports the steel, chemicals, textiles and other sectors as well, and any slowdown will impact the broader economy. Demand in the rural market has also declined significantly and the double-digit drop in motorcycle sales is an indication of the demand situation in rural areas."""

In contrast, Bajaj Auto increased its production by 4.47% during the period at 13,89,396 units. Suzuki Motorcycle India also hiked its production by 24.51% to 2,83,291 units during the period.
The current slowdown in the auto industry has forced manufacturers to reduce production which has resulted in retrenchment of 15,000 casual and temporary workers so far.
Dealers body FADA has also stated that nearly 2 lakh jobs were cut in the last three months while components industry body ACMA has cautioned that nearly 10 lakh jobs were on the line due to the market slump."

NEW DELHI :
Over 3,000 temporary employees have lost jobs with the country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) due to the ongoing slump in the automobile industry, a top company executive has said.
MSI Chairman R C Bhargava said contracts of the temporary workers were not renewed due to the slowdown while asserting that permanent workers have not been impacted.
""This is a part of the business, when demand soars, more contract workers are hired and reduced in case of low demand,"" he said while speaking to some leading private TV channels.
Bhargava was responding to a query on whether the current slump and production cuts have led to job cuts in Maruti.
""Around 3,000 temporary workers have lost jobs with Maruti Suzuki,"" he added.
Reiterating that automobile sector creates job in the economy – from sales, service, insurance, licensing, financing, accessories, drivers, petrol pumps, transportation - he cautioned, ""fewer automobiles (sales) will impact jobs on a larger scale.""
These are not even visualised. The impact is much higher, he added.
When asked if the industry has hit the rock bottom in terms of sales in July, he said revival in the sense of positive growth will start from third or fourth quarter of this fiscal, partly because of the lower base effect.
""Hopeful to see strong revival in FY 2021. By then transition to BS VI will be over,"" he added.
Commenting on expectations from the upcoming festival season, he said due to the good monsoon, rural sales may pick up.
""If government makes an announcement and takes positive actions it should help improve the situation,"" he said, however, it was up to the government to decide on GST rate cut and take the corrective action.
""Personally we would like to see GST benefits linked to greener/cleaner cars...The government gave tax cut on EVs but hybrid should be given duty cut. There should be tax cut on CNG vehicles,"" he added."

NEW DELHI :
Automobile manufacturing companies are betting big on upcoming new launches to entice customers to showrooms during the festive season at a time when vehicle sales are languishing. Four mass market vehicle manufacturers,Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Renault India Pvt ltd and Kia Motors India Ltd, will introduce at least five new offerings just before the start of the festive season.
Maruti Suzuki will launch its new multi-utility vehicle XL 6, to be sold from the Nexa chain of dealerships. The company will also introduce a hatchback named S-Presso just before Diwali.
Hyundai will launch its hatchback Grand I 10 Nios next week and this will be the third launch of the company in the current calendar year. Hyundai Motor Group’s another subsidiary Kia Motors India Ltd will introduce its first vehicle Seltos during the next week as well. The South Korean manufacturer has also received significant number of bookings for its first product.
French vehicle manufacturer Renault will be eyeing to make a comeback in the Indian market with the Triber, a seven-seater sport utility vehicle within the sub-4 metre range. This product will be crucial for the company after its previous product Captur (an SUV) didn’t draw enough volumes.
Due to a credit crunch, lack of consumption demand and change in regulations such as a hike in insurance premiums of new safety features like anti-lock braking systems, sales of automobiles across segments have declined drastically, which led to massive job losses as automobile makers reduce production.
India’s passenger vehicle industry suffered its worst sales performance in nearly 19 years in July as a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states deterred buyers.
Sales fell 31% to 200,790 vehicles last month from 290,931 units a year earlier, showed data released on Tuesday by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
This was also the ninth straight drop in monthly passenger vehicle sales. Sales have fallen in 12 of the 13 months since July 2018, underscoring the sharp slowdown in demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
Two companies that managed to limit their loss volumes are Mahindra and Mahindra and Hyundai, as both launched their respective compact utility vehicles, XUV 300 and Venue, recently.
Severe floods in states such as Maharashtra, Kerala and Karnataka before the onset of Onam and Ganesh Chaturthi are also affecting the fortunes of the automobile industry.
Last year vehicle manufacturers experienced their worst vehicles sales during the festival period -- Onam to Diwali -- due to a liquidity crisis triggered by the bankruptcy of IL&FS and worsening economic factors like increase in crude oil prices and a a depreciating rupee.
Hence, to create some buzz amongst buyers most of the leading manufacturers have lined up a host of launches. Vehicle sales during the festive season comprise almost a third of the total vehicles sold in a year.
Despite the new launches, car makers are very cautious about moving inventory in the market before the festive season."
133,2019-08-18,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki said there is a need to promote hybrid, CNG cars as it will take some time for mass acceptance of EVs considering the high cost of technologyThe GST Council last month reduced the tax rate on EVs to 5% from the existing 12%, but there was no tax relief for hybrid, CNG cars

New Delhi: The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) is pitching for tax relief for hybrid and CNG cars in addition to electric vehicles in order to promote green mobility in the country.
MSI chairman R.C. Bhargava said there is a need to promote hybrid and CNG cars as it will take some time for mass acceptance of electric vehicles (EVs) considering the high cost of technology right now.
""Personally we would like to see GST benefits linked to greener/cleaner cars. The Government gave tax cut on EVs but hybrid should be given duty cut. There should be tax cut on CNG vehicles as well,"" he told a news channel.
The hybrid cars are 25 to 30% more efficient and will help reduce oil imports, he added.
""For industrial development, reducing oil import costs is important. Hybrids and CNG will help. Government should look at both hybrids and CNG options before we transition to EVs,"" Bhargava noted.
The GST Council last month reduced the tax rate on EVs to 5% from the existing 12%, effective from 1 August. It also slashed the GST on EV chargers from 18% to 5%.
However, there is no tax relief for hybrid and CNG cars. GST rate for petrol and diesel cars and hybrid vehicles is already at the highest bracket of 28% plus cess.
Bhargava said so far the government has not announced any target for EV four-wheelers in the country.
He added that customers’ acceptance depends on availability of charging infrastructure, range and cost. Even the FAME scheme did not have any subsidy for private cars, he added.
""The cost of the EVs with the current technology will be very high. It could be more than double the price of internal combustion vehicles. This may not attract private car buyers...not the right time for mass acceptance for EVs,"" Bhargava said.
The company, however, is working on bringing a small EV which would primarily target cab aggregators like Ola and Uber, he added.
Similarly, the company will also continue to bring in more CNG vehicles, Bhargava said.
""Last year, CNG saw an increase of 40% in volumes. All small cars in our portfolio will get converted to CNG,"" he added.
To promote 'Make in India', the government must encourage factory-fitted CNG vehicles, Bhargava said.
He added that the company will discontinue 1.3-litre engine diesel vehicles. ""But that doesn't mean we will discontinue Vitara Brezza. It will continue. We will introduce a petrol variant of Vitara Brezza before the end of 2019-20 fiscal. We are not phasing out the model,"" Bhargava clarified."
132,2019-08-19,Maruti,"The Suzuki Jimny might replace the 35-year-old Gypsy in IndiaThe launch of the Jimny was initially slated to take place in March this year, but was delayed due to safety updates

The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) may soon be launching the successor to the beloved Maruti Gypsy. This will be the first time in 35 years the company will manufacture an SUV in India. A report by Nikkei Asian Review says Maruti's new mini SUV, which will replace Gypsy, is aimed at India's rural markets to bolster dwindling automobile sales as the nation sees a slowdown in the auto sector.
""We are only operating in a third of India's communities,"" Suzuki Chairman Osamu Suzuki told the Japanese financial publication.
The launch of the new Gypsy was initially slated to take place in March this year, but was delayed due to safety updates.
The new Gypsy could be a three-door mini SUV which might be powered by a 1.5-litre petrol engine that generates 102PS of peak power and 130Nm of torque. It could be based on Suzuki's new Jimny platform, the report said. The Gypsy was also based on original Jimny platform. 
In terms of features, the Japan-spec Jimny comes with LED headlamps with washers, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, hill hold control and hill descent control.
India’s passenger vehicle industry suffered its worst sales performance in nearly 19 years in July. This has been attributed to a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states. Over 3,000 temporary employees lost their jobs with MSI due to the slump and the company cut production for the sixth straight month in July to control dealership stocks.
The carmaker is now looking at the upcoming festive season with new launches, including a new hatchback S-Presso and an MPV called XL6. Vehicle sales during the festive season comprise almost a third of the total vehicles sold in a year."
131,2019-08-20,Maruti,"The demand slowdown in the market is ‘very much cyclical and not structural’, says Seon Seob KimKim said such a positive step was necessary under the current circumstances in order to make 'people come forward'

NEW DELHI :
The ongoing slowdown in India’s automobile market is transient and government intervention can drive a turnaround in the coming quarters, especially during the festival season, said a top executive of Hyundai Motor India Ltd.
With automobile sales on the decline for about a year, companies have been urging the government to either reduce the goods and services tax (GST) on automobiles, or offer some other financial relief to revive demand.
“The festival season might be a great opportunity for Hyundai and all other OEM’s (original equipment manufacturers) in terms of recovery of demand and revival. In many areas, the customer sentiment is subdued and we are preparing interesting customer communication programmes,"" said Seon Seob Kim, managing director and chief executive, Hyundai Motor India.
Wholesale dispatches of passenger vehicles fell 31% from the year earlier in July to 200,790 vehicles, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers. It was the sharpest drop since the 35% fall in December 2000. July also witnessed the ninth straight drop in monthly wholesale passenger vehicle sales.
Sales have fallen in 12 of the 13 months since July 2018, underscoring the sharp slowdown in demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
Kim said the slowdown in the local market was “very much cyclical and not structural"". From an OEM perspective, India still has huge growth potential and the number of cars sold per 1,000 people is very low compared to the US, China and South Korea. This means that even if the domestic market is passing through a difficult time, it is going to be a very short-term trend, he added.
A range of factors, such as higher ownership costs and economic uncertainties, have led to a decline in auto sales in India. Companies are hoping that sales will recover during the festive season, which starts with Onam in September and ends with Diwali in late October.
“If the government helps at this stage, I believe the recovery can happen this year itself. The burden on customers has increased when it comes to purchasing cars due to increase in insurance premiums, registration charges and then BS VI transition. This has not been done intentionally, but yes, it has an impact,"" Kim said.
At a time when other manufacturers have cut production, Hyundai has grown its overall market share to a record 19.4%, he added. The company is leading the sports utility vehicle segment for the first time in two decades of its existence in India thanks to demand for its compact SUV, Venue.
Hyundai Tuesday introduced its latest offering in the small car segment, the Grand i10 Nios, costing  ₹4.99-7.99 lakh. It was the firm’s third launch since January after Venue, and electric SUV Kona.
The Grand i10 Nios is based on a new platform compared to the existing Grand i10 car and will have BS VI complaint petrol and BS IV diesel engine versions. Since 2013, the South Korean manufacturer has sold more than 751,000 Grand i10s in India.
“Our rate of (sales) decline is much smaller than that of those of other OEMs and that has led to the increase in our market share to 19.4%, which is the highest-ever. Automotive industry is a key contributor in some of the major economies and huge contribution comes from the value chain companies as well,"" Kim said.

Expected engine and gearbox specifications
According to an Autocar India report, the car might be powered by a 1.5-litre BS6 petrol engine with Maruti’s Smart Hybrid system that will be mated to either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic gearbox. It is expected to come in two trims, namely Zeta and Alpha.
Expected features
The teasers of the crossover have confirmed a few details. For starters, the XL6 will come with signature square LED headlamps with DRLs. It is expected to have the same footprint of the Ertiga, but in a boxier, more aggressive form. The crossover will be a seven-seater, with three rows. There will be reclinable captain seats in the second row with slide function. The third row will get 50:50 split/folding functionality.

The car will have keyless entry, push-button start and auto climate control. It will also come with steering mounted controls and power windows. 
Sales slump
India’s passenger vehicle industry is seeing the worst sales performance in nearly 19 years. This has been attributed to a slowing economy, higher ownership costs and floods in some states. MSI too has been affected by this, as it laid off over 3,000 temporary employees. The company also cut production for the sixth straight month in July to control dealership stocks.

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd expects vehicle sales to recover in the forthcoming festival season buoyed by new product introductions and expectations of some favourable government decisions.
“At this stage, everybody is hoping that this festive season will be better than last year and at this stage, one can only hope. The new launches will not be able to turn the market around but will be able to make some changes,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki. “How the festive season turns out will also depend on some measures taken by the centre and state governments.""
A roll back of the proposal of the Union government to raise registration charges of new vehicles within a few days will be a boost to the industry, Bhargava said.“The bigger challenge is the road taxes being imposed by state governments and that needs to be reviewed,"" he added.
India’s largest passenger vehicle maker on Wednesday launched new multipurpose vehicle XL6—a six-seater premium version of its existing Ertiga model. XL6 will be sold through Maruti’s Nexa chain of premium dealerships. Maruti is also expected to unveil a new model in the hatchback segment before Diwali. XL6 will be offered with Bharat Stage-VI compliant petrol engines in the price range of  ₹9.79 lakh to  ₹11.45 lakh.
India’s passenger vehicle industry reported its worst performance in five years in the fiscal year that ended on 31 March as higher fuel prices, increase in insurance costs, farm distress and lack of financing options following the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) crisis kept buyers away. Vehicle sales during the festive months generally comprise a third of total vehicles sold in a particular year.
“We hope that the festive season will start the upward trend in the market. We are expecting a growth in demand in the domestic market. At present, we have an inventory of 30-35 days at our dealerships, which has come down in the past few months,"" said Shashank Srivastava, executive director, Maruti Suzuki.
Companies have lined up new product launches in an effort to woo customers during the coming festive season. BMW India launched the latest version of its 3 Series sedan on Wednesday, while Hyundai Motor India Ltd introduced Grand i10 Nios, a small car, on Tuesday. Kia Motors will launch its first product Seltos, a sport-utility vehicle, on Thursday, while Renault India will launch its seven-seater multipurpose vehicle Triber next week.
Automobile sales in India have been on the decline over the past nine months because of a sharp fall in consumption demand and an increase in ownership cost after the introduction of new safety features, higher insurance costs and the shift to BS-VI emission norms. In July, Maruti’s wholesale vehicle dispatches plunged 36% when the total number of vehicles sold fell below the 100,000 mark for the first time since June 2017.
Maruti’s vehicle dispatches during April-July 2019 fell 23.2% year-on-year to 617,992 units.
“The pre-festive period sales have remained weak and largely below industry expectations. This has led to a reduction in production days across original equipment manufacturers to rationalize inventories,"" said Nishant Vass, research analyst, ICICI Securities. “Discounting trends could intensify in second and third quarter as consumers may delay purchase decisions with imminent BS-VI transition.""
Vass said, however, an “improvement in monsoon (turned to 2% surplus till Jun-Sept 2019) is likely to support rural sentiment amidst possible policy support from the government""."

MUMBAI :
Kia Motors will continue with its ambitious product introduction plans for India, undeterred by the worst slump in sales in nearly two decades in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
The South Korean automaker and the latest entrant to the Indian market plans to introduce half a dozen new vehicles over the next three years, said Kook Hyun Shim, chief executive officer and managing director of Kia Motors India.
A key focus will be on the utility vehicle segment, which is largely dominated by Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
Besides the Seltos mid-sized sport-utility vehicle (SUV) which went on sale on Thursday, the company has lined up a premium multipurpose vehicle (MPV) and a compact SUV, Shim said.
“We will introduce new car every 6-8 months and this is our internal target also,"" Shim said. “We remain focused on the UV market in India because this segment is also strong point for Kia globally.""
Kia, a sister company of Hyundai Motor Group, is also studying the most-competitive and price-sensitive compact car segment in India and has plans to develop products for this market over the mid to long-term, Shim said. He said however that the evaluation is currently in early stages.
“In the long run, we will also get into the compact car market. We are studying this space in India. We are just beginning to understand this market here and there is nothing fixed on the ground on this at the moment,"" Shim added.
The company has launched Seltos, its first product for the domestic market, with an aggressive starting price tag of  ₹9.69 lakh (ex-showroom). Offered in 16 variants across three BS-VI-compliant engine options—1.5 petrol, 1.5 diesel and 1.4 turbocharged petrol—the Seltos range will take on the likes of Hyundai Creta, and other models such as Mahindra XUV500, Renault Captur and Nissan Kicks. The Seltos will also target buyers of the recently-launched Tata Harrier and MG Hector SUVs.
Kia claims to have already received more than 32,000 bookings for the feature-loaded Seltos. “We have already produced more than 5,000 units from our Anantapur (Andhra Pradesh) plant and we do not plan to close bookings (to catch up with the demand),"" said Manohar Bhat, head, sales and marketing, Kia Motors India. MG Motors temporarily suspended bookings of the Hector SUV in July saying it could not cope with overwhelming customer response because of limited production capacity.
Analysts say that the Seltos will cannibalize sales of Hyundai Creta with its feature-loaded packaging and aggressive pricing.
“Kia Seltos will clearly impact Hyundai Creta volumes. However, it is yet to be seen how Kia fares on the long term factors including ownership costs, service and repair costs and resale value,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, LVP forecasting, IHS Markit.
Despite its robust launch plans, Kia is worried about the economic downturn as a protracted slowdown in the auto market could affect its original plan to achieve break-even on its investments in India, Shim said. “Yes, we are worried about the current economic situation in the domestic market. However, we do think that this is going to be a short-term cycle,"" he said, assuring that the economy will bounce back in the mid- to long-term.
“Anticipating consistency in the initial market response for Seltos, we will still take more than three years to break even in India,"" he said."

Jaipur: The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India is pinning hopes on the festive season for a turn around in the auto industry irrespective of government help forthcoming or not, according to a senior company official.
With some of the factors responsible for the slowdown in auto sales such as concern over monsoon and elections behind, the company is hopeful that revival in demand specially from rural markets and peak discounts along with new model launches will play a crucial role converting inquiries into real purchases.
""We are not going to speculate on whether or not the government will provide some extra relief to the industry... how much or how little it would be or when, now or later, will it be...What we are trying to do is to be more constructive in our approach,"" Maruti Suzuki India Executive Director, Marketing and Sales Shashank Srivastava said in an interview.
The auto industry has been asking the government for reduction of GST on automobiles to 18% from 28% as part of a stimulus package.
Srivastava said instead of waiting for government steps, the company is focusing on what it can do to revive demand by bringing new models and also providing attractive offers to consumers. ""We have launched the XL6 and we will continue to introduce new models. We will have another model coming up later,"" he said.
Stating that the company is focusing on retail sales, Srivastava said, ""We have focused on consumer offers which are at a peak. This is the best time to buy.""
Discounts in August will be slightly higher than what MSI had in the first quarter of the fiscal, he added without elaborating.
Moreover, he said,""We are advertising with the same vigour as before."" With all those actions, he said, ""We are hopeful that this festival season it will turn around.""
Elaborating on why MSI is hopeful of a turn around this festive season, Srivastava said some uncertainty like monsoon and election that were also responsible for sales drop earlier in the year have gone.
Also, the government has sought to address to an extent the liquidity issues associated with NBFCs by allowing banks to lend more to these financial institutions in the budget, he added.
Moreover, Srivastava said, ""We are also confident because of the number of inquiries at showrooms.""
The key is to convert those inquiries into purchases, he added. When asked if there's light at the end of the tunnel for the auto industry, Srivastava said, ""MSI as a company, we are very optimistic that there is this light. How far is it is the question. It is better to answer that, a better estimate after we see this festive season , end of October.""
This festive season is very critical and the industry is looking forward to it, he said.
Automobile sales in India witnessed its sharpest decline in nearly 19 years in July, dropping 18.71%, rendering almost 15,000 workers jobless over the past two-three months as the sector reels under a prolonged slump.
Passenger vehicle sales slumped by 30.98% to 2,00,790 units as compared with 2,90,931 units in the same month last year. It was the ninth month of consecutive decline.

123,2019-08-24,Maruti,"To boost demand for automobiles, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday announced a slew of measuresThe announcements will boost the morale of companies and customers alike, just before the festival season, say industry executives 

Senior executives of automobile manufacturing companies and various lobby groups have welcomed the steps announced by the union government on Friday to arrest the downturn in the sector.
Most believe the liquidity situation at both the dealer and customer end will ease after the recent announcements.
To boost demand for automobiles and arrest the precipitous decline in sales the Centre on Friday announced a slew of measures like mandating government agencies and departments to replace old vehicles, increasing depreciation on new vehicles for commercial fleet service providers, urging banks to make automobile loans cheaper and increase credit availability to non-banking finance companies.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman also assured buyers and manufacturers that vehicles compliant with Bharat Stage IV emission norms registered before March 31, 2020, will be able to run for the entire registration period or the life of the vehicle.
The announcements, industry executives believe, will boost the morale of companies and customers alike, just before the festival season.
According to Venu Srinivasan, chairman, TVS Motor Company, the measures will provide the immediate relief that the industry was seeking. The government’s prompt response has not only been reassuring for just industry, but for the common man as well because the steps will boost liquidity in the market.
“While there are indications of a global slowdown, this government has demonstrated its resolve to mitigate the impact of that in India through these measures. This is the stability and proactiveness that industry wants,"" added Srinivasan.
Lobby groups in the sector like Society of India Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), Automotive Component Manufacturer Association of India (ACMA) ans Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (Fada) had also been urging the government to ease financing options for dealers and customers and reduce Goods and Services Tax on two and three-wheelers.
“Affordability and availability of retail finance as well as finance for dealers, was a major concern for the industry and the announcement today have adequately addressed concerns on both the fronts. The release of  ₹70,000 crore for PSU banks recapitalisation and  ₹20,000 crore for National Housing Bank will give banks and NBFCs enhanced liquidity in the system,"" said Rajan Wadhera, President, SIAM.
According to Ram Venkatramani, president ACMA, measures to improve liquidity and the deferring of enhanced vehicle registration cost will revive ailing sales in the auto sector. That apart, enhanced depreciation of 30% until March 2020 will motivate institutional sales of vehicles. Further, removal of ban on purchase of new vehicles by government will also help reduce the current pileup of inventory.
“The easing of liquidity in banking sector was followed up with a slew of announcements like increase depreciation rate till March 2020, deferment of one time registration fees which would have further burdened the affordability of customers. Coupled with the soon to be announced scrappage policy, will definitely boost demand,"" said Ashish Kale, president, Fada."

New Delhi:  Maruti Suzuki India, country's largest carmaker, is looking at CNG option to fill in the space vacated by small diesel engine cars in future, according to a senior company official.
The company had in April this year announced that it would stop selling diesel cars from April 2020, when BS-VI is implemented in the domestic market, citing feasibility issues after cost escalation due to the new emission norms.
At the time of announcement around 23% of all the units sold by the company in the domestic market were diesel cars.
Presently, MSI offers its popular models Alto, AltoK10, Celerio, WagonR, Dzire, Ertiga in CNG option along with light commercial vehicle, Super Carry.
""For Maruti Suzuki in the future, CNG vehicles are likely to make up for the space vacated by small diesel engine cars,"" MIS Senior Executive Director (Engineering) C.V. Raman told PTI.
""We believe that for a small car, CNG is a very good option. It is an alternative to oil consumption. We have the widest range of CNG cars for our customers. We are keen to promote green fuels,"" he further said.
Besides, the government's focus is also to expand the gas-based economy, Raman added.
""There is a lot of emphasis on expanding CNG availability in the country,"" he added.
In the April-July period this fiscal, MSI's domestic sales were at 4,74,487 units as against 6,17,990 units in the year-ago period, down 23.2%.
An estimated 30 lakh CNG vehicles are currently plying on the Indian roads at present with sales majorly in Delhi-NCR, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana.
Cumulatively, MSI has sold over 5 lakh CNG cars so far.
MSI has, however, kept its options open saying if there is demand for bigger diesel engine after BS-VI implementation, it will consider offering its consumers the same.
Although, it is currently focussing only on making petrol and CNG engines BS-VI compliant. It is already offering seven of its models in petrol BS-VI engines."

Safety norms and higher taxes have ""added substantially"" to the cost of cars, affecting their affordability, Bhargava told shareholders at the company's annual general meeting.
With India's auto sales declining for the ninth straight month in July, more automotive manufacturers are laying off workers and temporarily halting production to keep costs in check, Reuters reported on Saturday.

New Delhi: In the midst of a deepening slowdown in India’s automotive industry, Maruti Suzuki India will not retrench any from his 16,050-strong permanent workforce in the near future, chairman R C Bhargava said on Tuesday at the annual general meeting of the company in the national capital.
According to the octogenarian, Maruti has not renewed contracts of around 3,000 of his contractual workers but has not downsized its workforce. Contractual workers give flexibility to the operations of the company, Bhargava added.
India’s auto sales declined for the ninth straight month in July, with automotive manufacturers are laying off workers and suspending production to keep costs in check. Wholesale dispatches of passenger vehicles during the month fell 31% year on year to 200,790 units, according to data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
Bhargava was hopeful that the steps announced by the government last week to boost the Indian economy will go a long way in reviving demand in the domestic market.
“Some of the measures announced by the government are very good and faster availability of GST refunds will fuel the further growth.

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said on Tuesday that it has not renewed the job contracts of around 3,000 temporary workers in recent months amid a sharp slowdown in sales, though permanent workers have remained untouched by the manpower restructuring exercise.
R.C. Bhargava, chairman of India’s largest carmaker, is hopeful automobile demand will rebound following a series of steps announced by the government.
Contractual workers give flexibility to the operations of the company, Bhargava said at Maruti’s annual general meeting.
India’s automotive sector is in the midst of an unprecedented slowdown, with passenger vehicle sales falling the most in nearly 19 years in July. This underscores weak consumer sentiment, uncertain economic conditions, higher ownership costs, farm distress and a credit squeeze. This was the ninth straight drop in passenger vehicle sales.
Sales of commercial vehicles as well as two-wheelers have also remained weak, forcing automakers across segments to lay off workers and temporarily suspend production to keep costs in check.
Bhargava said Maruti has no plan to fire any of its 16,050 strong permanent workforce in the near future. He said steps announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Friday to boost the economy will go a long way in reviving demand in the domestic market.
“Some of the measures announced by the government are very good and faster availability of GST (goods and services tax) refunds will fuel further growth. Also, the assurance from government that bankers will not attract punitive measures for bona fide commercial decisions will help,"" Bhargava said in response to a shareholder’s query.
Last week, Sitharaman announced a slew of steps such as mandating government agencies and departments to replace older vehicles, increasing depreciation on new vehicles for commercial fleet service providers, urging banks to make automobile loans cheaper and increase credit availability for non-banking financial companies.
The finance minister also assured buyers and manufacturers that vehicles compliant with Bharat Stage (BS) IV emission norms registered before 31 March 2020 will be able to run for the entire registration period or the life of the vehicle. India will shift to BS VI norms from 1 April. Automakers have also been urging the government to reduce the GST rate on vehicles to 18% from 28%.
“Unfortunately, what has happened in the last few months is that suddenly a number of factors have combined to increase the final cost the customer has to bear to buy a car,"" Bhargava said. “The new safety regulations, which include airbags, ABS (anti-lock braking system) and more stringent crash test norms have been implemented in the current financial year.""
Meanwhile, in line with the Centre’s approach to promote electric mobility, the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit has begun testing its first electric vehicle based on the Wagon R hatchback model. Maruti will, however, continue to invest in developing vehicles equipped with compressed natural gas (CNG) and hybrid powertrains until electric vehicles become affordable.
The recent start of supply of the Baleno hatchback to Toyota’s Indian unit as part of a cross-badging agreement has also helped maintain decent utilization levels in the manufacturing capacities of Maruti Suzuki, at a time of weak demand.
“The advancement of electric technology is not as rapid as we hoped and what this seems to indicate is that for an individual customer or a low-cost car user, availability of an affordable electric vehicle is not likely in the next few years. That is unfortunately the reality of this situation,"" Bhargava said. “Meanwhile CNG and hybrid cars are the way forward."""
118,2019-08-28,Maruti,"For Toyota, the alliance provides access to Suzuki’s expertise in IndiaToyota will acquire about 5% of Suzuki shares while Suzuki will get a smaller holding

Toyota Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp. are strengthening their alliance by taking stakes in one another, seeking to bolster their position as the auto industry shifts further toward electrified and self-driving cars. Japan’s biggest automaker will acquire about 5% of Suzuki shares for about 96 billion yen ($907 million), while Suzuki will get a smaller holding valued at about 48 billion yen in Toyota, the automakers said in statements today. 
The move builds on ties established in 2017 between the two carmakers and is aimed at expanding their collaboration to keep up with technological advances sweeping through the transportation industry, from on-demand rides to cars that are no longer powered by fossil fuels. For Toyota, the alliance provides access to Suzuki’s expertise in India, which is on track to overtake Japan and become the third-largest vehicle market in the world.
“Toyota is getting Suzuki at an attractive valuation,"" said Janet Lewis, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Securities (Japan) Ltd. “It appears to be very similar to the mutual investments made between Toyota and Mazda.""
Toyota will pay 4,004 yen a share, lower than Suzuki’s closing price of 4,085 yen on Wednesday. Suzuki shares are down 27% this year, following a 15% decline in 2018 as the Indian economy cooled.
Autonomous Driving
Suzuki said it will use 20 billion yen of the proceeds on development of new technologies including autonomous driving, and the remainder to replenish its capital.
Suzuki is seeking to team up with a larger carmaker after an acrimonious split with Volkswagen AG. Toyota has budgeted about seven times more on research and development than Suzuki for this fiscal year, and the smaller automaker has pointed to the soaring cost of making competitive cars as a reason to join forces with a partner.
In February 2017, Toyota and Suzuki agreed to begin “concrete examination"" of a partnership in technology and procurement. A year later, they agreed to sell each other’s hybrid cars and other vehicles in India. This March, Toyota further expanded the alliance to supply its hybrid system to Suzuki globally, while Suzuki will sell compact vehicles through Toyota in India and Africa. The carmakers also said they plan to produce joint battery electric cars in India around 2020.
As the industry face challenges from ride-sharing services to stricter emission targets, smaller Japanese carmakers are increasingly relying on tie-ups with Toyota to help tackle the issues. Toyota also has stakes in Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp. and works with them on electric cars.

Indian carmaker Maruti Suzuki has launched a new initiative called ‘Service on Wheels’ to provide its customers doorstep service and repairs. All Maruti passenger vehicles are covered (CNG, petrol or diesel) under the new service and customers can avail both, paid and free, services.
Maruti says this will not only benefit Maruti Suzuki customers located in far flung areas but also the customers in urban areas who are unable to visit the workshop due to paucity of time.
As the name suggests, ‘Service on Wheels’ is essentially a minivan that comes equipped to handle repairs, oil changes, under-body inspections and filter cleaning.
The service will compliment Maruti’s network that consists of 3,600 workshops across 1,800 towns and cities in India.
Tata, Hyundai, Mercedes and Toyota all offer doorstep service of some sort.
Hyundai offers a similar doorstep service that also includes car wash and detailing while Mercedes even offers a comfortable mobile lounge for customers. Even new entrants like MG Motor are offering road side assistance in case your car breaks down on the road. Maruti’s initiative seems to be aimed at these."

As vehicle manufacturers gear up for a possible revival in sales in the upcoming festival season, most of them are betting on sport utility vehicles or hatchbacks as opposed to sedans to engineer a recovery in the domestic market.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd - country’s largest vehicle manufacturer has already launched its multi-purpose vehicle, XL6, and is expected to launch another hatchback before the festival season ends.
Hyundai Motor India ltd - country’s second largest passenger vehicle manufacturer - has also launched the third generation of Its popular hatchback i10, known as Grand i10 Nios.
The South Korean manufacturer launched its first compact SUV, Venue in the first quarter of the fiscal and bookings and wait list for the vehicle have been surging since then.
In mid-August, Kia Motors India, a new entrant, launched its first product in the Indian market which is also another mid-size SUV, known as Seltos.
French car maker, Renault, also jumped in the race with its new product Triber, a multi-purpose vehicle but under four metres in length. The company is also expected to launch the second generation of its popular hatchback Kwid, sometime during the festival months.
As consumption demand in the market has nosedived, leading to multi decade decline in auto sales, especially since the start of the current financial year, auto makers are betting big on two of the most volume-generating segment -- sport utility vehicle and hatchback.
Hatchbacks still enjoy almost 70% of the market share and ever since the launch of compact SUVs, with the introduction of the Renault Duster and Ford Ecosport, the sport utility vehicle segment has substantially increased its contribution in the overall sales of passenger vehicles in the country.
According to data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, in FY 19 sales of sport utility vehicles increased by just 2% to 941,461 units despite low demand. In the April to June period, sales of SUVs declined 4.5% year-on-year to 224,224 units while passenger car sales declined significantly by 23.32% year-on-year to 447453 units.
The increase in demand for sport utility vehicles have taken a toll on the sedan segment as launches in the segment has also dried up. Maruti’s new generation Dzire and Honda’s new generation Amaze have been the only two successful product introductions in the segment, in the last two financial years."

He, however, said the recent measures announced by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to boost the auto sector with cheaper car loans, improving liquidity through credit expansion to public sector banks, deferring of one-time registration fees, higher depreciation for all vehicles and lifting ban on purchase of new vehicles in government departments are likely to spur some demand which is a much needed relief.

111,2019-09-01,Maruti,"Automobiles currently attract the highest tax rate of 28%, apart from a cessDispatches to dealerships during the month plunged 34% from a year ago, the sharpest decline since September 2001

New Delhi: The Union government has finally decided to bite the bullet on a tax cut for the automobile sector, on a day the industry reported the worst August for passenger vehicles in 18 years. Dispatches to dealerships during the month plunged 34% from a year ago, sales data showed, in the sharpest decline since September 2001.
The government will take a proposal to reduce the goods and services tax (GST) rate on automobiles to the GST Council, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters in Chennai, while briefing them on efforts to arrest the economic downturn. Automobiles currently attract the highest tax rate of 28%, apart from a cess.
Six top automakers together dispatched 171,193 vehicles to dealerships in August, 34% below 259,925 vehicles recorded in August 2018. Indian manufacturers count factory dispatches to dealerships as sales. These numbers follow a 31% sales drop in July.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, which makes one in every two cars sold in the country, posted domestic sales of 93,173 units, down 36% year-on-year (y-o-y) as demand for its small cars cooled.
Sales of Maruti’s small cars fell 40% y-o-y to 64,397 units in August. Analysts have pinned hopes on Maruti’s Bharat Stage VI compliant S-Presso hatchback to be launched this month to revive sales in the festive season. Sales of midsize sedan Ciaz fell 77% to 1,596 units. Although at 8,658 units, van sales fell 37%, utility vehicle sales rose 3%.
“It (the tax cut proposal) has got to go to the GST Council, where all state finance ministers assemble,"" Sitharaman said. “It is for them to take a call. I have suggested to them (automobile makers) that I will take it to the Council but the final decision will be theirs... I will wait for the GST Council to take a call."" The federal indirect tax body meets next on 20 September.
Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) reported total passenger vehicle sales of 13,507 units, down 32% y-o-y, and a 28% y-o-y drop in commercial vehicle (CV) sales to 14,684 units. Among CVs, medium and heavy commercial vehicles were hit the most, falling 69% to 354 units.
Tata Motors Ltd posted domestic passenger vehicle sales of 7,316 units, a 58% decline y-o-y. “Our retail sales were 42% more than offtake and as a result, the network stock came down by over 3,000 vehicles. This prepares dealers well for the festival season,"" said Mayank Pareek, president (passenger vehicles business unit) at Tata Motors. Sales of CVs fell 45% y-o-y to 21,824 units on poor freight availability and lower truck rentals. Girish Wagh, president of the CV unit, however, said retail sales could have exceeded wholesales by over 25% in August.
Mint reported on 11 August that the GST Council is preparing for a meeting to be convened after the finance ministry decides on the extent of benefits to be given to the auto industry.
A reduction in GST, or cess, or both, could give some relief for the automobile sector facing a crippling demand slowdown, while taking a toll on flagging tax revenues. Central and state governments may have different views on this, and reversing a rate reduction later may be more politically difficult in the case of GST than in the case of cess.
A decision on the rate cut will be taken by the council in light of the tax revenue collection trends.
The finance ministry said on Sunday that central and state governments collected  ₹98,202 crore in August for transactions in the previous month, a 4.5% increase from a year ago, but below the  ₹1.02 trillion collected in July 2019. Although subdued revenue collections reduce the fiscal space for tax cuts, the government at times takes the view that a revival in industrial growth could help make good any revenue loss from a tax cut.
“While the GST rate is one of the key factors impacting automobile prices and thereby demand, any reduction in rates would need to consider the revenue impact in the context of the current year collections being lower than that budgeted,"" said M.S. Mani, partner at Deloitte India.
ICICI Securities said in a recent report that prospective buyers are deferring purchases as automobiles are not currently a consumer priority.
“The auto industry continues to be subdued in the month of August due to several external factors. We are optimistic and hopeful of a good festive season going ahead,"" said Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing (automotive division) at M&M.
Meanwhile, Sitharaman also said the government’s efforts to promote electric mobility should not be misconstrued as promoting electric vehicles at the expense of internal combustion engine vehicles.
“All vehicles will have their due market share. It is not that we are promoting one segment of the industry at the expense of another,"" said the minister.
She also said the feedback received from the industry about the measures announced so far to support growth was positive.
A report by credit rating agency Icra Ltd, which estimates a 4-7% decline for the overall passenger vehicle segment in FY20, pointed out that entry-level and midsize hatchbacks have witnessed a price increase of over 10% and 6-8%, respectively due to new regulations and commodity prices.
Calls for strong measures to support the industry have been growing in recent weeks, as economic indicators give worrying signs of a sharp deceleration in growth.
India’s economy grew 5% in the June quarter, its slowest pace in six years, official data showed last week.
This has also prompted criticism from the opposition Congress party on the government’s stewardship of Asia’s third largest economy, which has already lost the tag of the ‘fastest growing major economies’ in the world to China.
“With GDP at 5% growth for the last quarter, it shows the impact of growth momentum and slowdown in consumer spending. It is a free fall for the auto wholesales in August as well, and this trend is likely to continue till the BS IV inventory is cleared as consumers are waiting for heavier discounts on BS IV compliant vehicles,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, LVP forecasting, IHS Markit.
Automobile companies and lobby groups have been urging a tax reduction for vehicles across the board. As a consequence of the decline in consumption demand, lack of liquidity with banks and NBFCs and regulatory changes, sales of automobiles have been on a downward trend since July 2018.
According to a senior industry executive, some customers have been postponing their purchases expecting better discounts from auto makers, at the fag end of this fiscal year. Now, if there is again another round of speculation on reduction in GST rates levied on automobiles, then demand during festive season will be impacted, he said."

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India, which plans to launch is first electric vehicle (EV) in the country next year, is finding cost of EVs to be prohibitive for mass adoption besides charging infrastructure proving to be a big issue, according to a senior company official.
Having commenced a nation-wide fleet testing in September last year, the company is also facing a challenge over customer acceptance of EVs and adopt a business model.
""It is going to be difficult to make a good value proposition immediately unless the cost comes down substantially,"" Maruti Suzuki India Senior Executive Director (Engineering) C V Raman told PTI.
He was responding to a query on how the preparation for launching EV next year was progressing.
""There is still testing going on. We are trying to understand the range, temperature, charging time,"" he said, however, adding there were three major issues of cost, charging infrastructure, and customer acceptance.
MSI is currently testing a fleet of 50 prototype EVs based on WagonR model platform developed by Suzuki Motor Corporation in Japan.
Under the current circumstances, a mass segment EV is likely to cost around two-and-half times more than the same vehicle type powered by a conventional engine, he added.
On charging infrastructure issues, Raman said, ""As per our study, 60 per cent of people don't have their own parking. There is no way they can do charging. They won't adopt.""
Even for fleet operators, Raman said at the current costs the EVs don't offer a viable alternative to a CNG or a diesel vehicle.
When asked if that meant the company would go slow on plans to launch the EV next year, he replied in the negative.
""We are still working towards (launching it),"" he said, adding EV is a technology which needs to be looked at.
""Battery chemistry is changing, technology is changing. We have to work and make ourselves capable to do it. So, from an engineering point of view we will continue to work on it and we won't stop but whether that translates into a product or not is a different thing,"" he said.
The company has also reconciled to the fact that government support will not be forthcoming for promoting private usage of EVs.
Addressing shareholders last week at the company's AGM, MSI Chairman R C Bhargava said, ""The fact that FAME (II) scheme does not provide any incentive for private buying of EVs is a very clear signal that the government doesn't think that this segment is going to be at all important in the coming time.""
Last year, Suzuki Motor Corporation Chairman Osamu Suzuki had said that the company has decided to launch EV in India around 2020 in cooperation with Toyota Motor Corporation.

New Delhi: India’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India Limited, reported domestic wholesales of 97,061 units in August, down 34.3% year-on-year due to persistent fall in retail demand.
Total domestic passenger vehicle wholesales stood at 93,173 units last month, a year-on-year decline of 36.1% - one of its sharpest dips in the last two decades.
The carmaker’s mini sub-segment, which includes Alto and Old WagonR models, was the most hit with 72% YoY fall at 10,123 units last month. The company had reported wholesales of 35,895 units of this category in August last year.

110,2019-09-02,Maruti,"A hefty injection of  ₹55,250 crore of taxpayers’ money into the merged banks will only help them provide for the bad loans that will get lumped togetherThe  ₹98,200 crore collected in August via GST, was the smallest in six months

With every passing day, India’s economic indicators are turning a little bleaker. The situation is bad enough to warrant using the word “crisis,"" arriving just as the government’s fiscal ammunition is spent.
The announcement Friday of 5% GDP growth in the June quarter showed the economy growing at its weakest pace in six years. On Sunday, the top six carmakers reported a 29% drop in August sales, stoking fears that the slowdown could get still worse.  The  ₹98,200 crore ($13.7 billion) collected in August via the goods and services tax, the main tax on consumption, was the smallest in six months. 
This adds pressure on the central bank — both to cut its policy rate and to ensure that commercial lenders pass them on to borrowers. To the extent that the more inefficient state-run banks are a drag on credit, central government said on Friday that as many as 10 of them will be merged into four.
Whether folding one weak bank into another will make the combined entity any stronger remains to be seen. What’s clearer is that these lenders will spend the next six months on integration. Putting their balance sheets to work may take a backseat. Pending consolidation, the lenders might also be hesitant to issue new bank guarantees, especially to private-sector bidders for road projects. Thus, one of the few areas where there’s new investment may be affected, especially with a sharp rise in debt levels of the government agency that gives out the contracts. 
A hefty injection of  ₹55,250 crore of taxpayers’ money into the merged banks will only help them provide for the bad loans that will get lumped together. Capital for growth remains elusive. State Bank of India, the largest lender, will require  ₹15,000 crore in the current fiscal year, according to ICRA Ltd., an affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service. 
The benefits will only be evident in a few years. The new round of consolidation will bring down the number of state-run banks to 12 from 27 just a few years ago. These lenders will have no choice but to become more competitive because they’ll have to price consumer loans by linking them to the central bank’s policy rate. Since they aren’t very good at lending against cash flows, the government wants them to originate loans together with non-bank financiers. Currently, even the shadow banks are stressed. Over time, though, this should help boost the underwriting standards of state-controlled lenders. Credit flows to smaller firms, which supply goods and services to larger companies, will improve. 
Making the most of vendor finance will require plugging India into global supply chains first. By offering the likes of Apple Inc. and Ikea less restrictive access to its billion-plus population, the central government is hoping for long-term sourcing wins from the rapidly deteriorating trade relations between Washington and Beijing.
But while taking much-neglected steps to position India as an alternative to China is a welcome move, the gains won’t be immediate. Before committing to a new factory in India to both sell locally and to export, investors will want to see steadier final demand in the domestic economy. Maruti Suzuki Ltd., the nation’s biggest carmaker, is struggling to push out 100,000 cars in a month to dealers ahead of the festival season. That isn’t exactly a great advertisement to dangle before new entrants.  
Good things will come from all the tinkering – just not now. Weakening global growth means India can’t even use a weak currency to export its way out of trouble. This isn’t the time to talk loudly about wanting to become the next China. A hawkish Washington won’t want to see mercantile strategies being deployed by yet another large labor-surplus nation. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s best hope will be to use the crisis to mend his government’s frayed relationship with the private sector. Giving startups a reprieve from a seven-year-old law, one that was used by tax authorities to harass them with impunity, is a good move.
Admitting that there are design flaws in the consumption tax and fixing them — perhaps by bringing separately taxed petroleum products into its ambit — should be the next step. Like with the bank mergers, the gains will take time time to become evident, even as the pain gets visibly worse.

New Delhi: Auto industry body SIAM on Monday sought immediate steps from the government, including reduction in GST rates and initiation of scrappage policy, as sales continued to plummet with passenger vehicle makers witnessing a decline of 30% offtake in August.
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said even the commercial vehicle and two-wheeler sales are significantly negative indicating that the market has still not responded to the various measures initiated by the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month.
""All this while, the industry has pulled out all the stops in offering attractive deals and discounts to the consumers. However, the ability of the industry to provide large discounts is limited and this only highlights the need for government to consider reducing the GST rates from 28% to 18% which would significantly reduce the cost of vehicles and, in turn, create demand,"" SIAM President Rajan Wadhera said in a statement.
There is also an urgent need to come out with an integrated incentive-based scrappage policy covering all segments of the automobile industry as promised by the FM, he added.
""The festival season is around the corner, it is imperative that these decisions are taken quickly and announced without delay so that the industry could hope for a better festival season that could harbinger a recovery in the industry,"" Wadhera said.
The series of announcements on credit availability and reducing the cost of credit that were made do not seem to have percolated down to the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) which support the bulk of finance for the automotive industry, he added.
The consumer sentiment also continues to be low and there is clearly a trust deficit in lending money to the dealers, he added.
On Sunday, major companies such as Maruti Suzuki India, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors and Honda reported a high double-digit de-growth in their sales in August.
While Maruti reported a 33% drop in August sales at 1,06,413 units, sale of passenger vehicles by Tata Motors fell 58% during the month under review.
Similarly, Honda Cars India and Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) sales dropped 51% and 21%, respectively.
Similarly, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) saw its domestic sales dip by 26% to 33,564 units last month, compared to 45,373 units in August 2018.

The festive months contribute around a third of total vehicles sold by automobile manufacturers throughout the year.
Vehicles manufacturers usually increase production and dispatch of vehicles or dealerships in July and August, expecting high demand for their respective products during the festive months.

The launch of multi-purpose vehicle XL6 has further bolstered Maruti’s position in the face of stiff competition from Hyundai Motor India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd.
“Maruti Suzuki has topped the chart of utility vehicle sales, by registering a market share of 25.46% during first four months of FY 2019-20.

105,2019-09-04,Maruti,"Dealers wary of stocking up for festival months, see flat sales growth when compared with previous yearSales during the festive season are expected to remain flat or grow marginally, says Fada

NEW DELHI :
With consumption demand not showing any signs of recovery in the domestic market, automobile dealers do not expect sales to grow significantly during the current festival months (September and October), against last year. Most of them are gearing up for a flat or marginal growth for the second successive year.
Last year, automobile manufacturing companies experienced one of the worst festival season sales in the last five years, in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of IL&FS and the lack of liquidity in the banking system.
According to Ashish Kale, president, Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), sales during the upcoming festival season are expected to remain flat or grow marginally, compared to last year, since dealers are not confident and have taken a cautious approach before taking stocks from the manufacturers.
Sales of automobiles during the festival months comprise almost a third of the total vehicles sold during a particular year. Last year in July and August, automakers substantially increased dispatches of vehicles to dealerships, compared to the retail demand, expecting robust sales, but ended up with huge inventory as retail sales tanked.
Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) started to witness decline in sales of vehicles since July 2018, as regulatory changes such as enhanced safety regulations, lack of credit availability from the banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) had an adverse impact on the overall consumer demand. The slowdown intensified since the beginning of the current financial year as wholesales declined by double digits.
“Last year, retail sales in September were still fine and passenger vehicle sales began to decline at the end of the month. This time we won’t see huge growth and wait for the measures announced by the government to make an impact. It is tough to say whether the measures will have the desired impact or not just after 10 days,"" added Kale.
The muted expectation of dealers come at a time when vehicle manufacturers such as Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others reported a double-digit fall in wholesale dispatches to dealerships in July and August before the festival season kicks off with Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states and Onam on 12 September in southern states, especially Kerala.
Maruti’s domestic wholesales in August declined significantly by 35.9% year-on-year to 94,728 units. This is the third time the company pushed less than one lakh vehicles to its dealerships in a particular month since July 2017. Vehicles dispatched by the top six passenger vehicle manufacturers during the same period declined by 34% year-on-year to 171,193 vehicles.
According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), passenger vehicle sales in July fell significantly by 31% to 200,790 vehicles. It was the worst sales performance since a 35% decline in December 2000.
One of the most important reasons behind the slowdown had been the lack of credit options available to both customers and dealers alike from banks and NBFCS as financial institutions tightened their respective credit norms.
“The pressure on dealers for capital is still on, but it has improved from the past. NBFCs used to fund 15-20% of our customers who came to buy vehicles for the first time and their credit worthiness aren’t quite high. These were the customers who use to give us the additional numbers,"" according to Kale.
FADA is hoping that the GST Council will decide to reduce the rate of taxes levied on vehicles and that will be able to generate some demand in the coming months.
Expecting that customers will shy away from buying vehicles during the festival season, Maruti Suzuki has decided against dispatching stocks to dealerships during the festive season as inventory with dealerships has already exceeded by more than a month."

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd said on Wednesday that it will suspend vehicle production at its plants in Gurugram and Manesar as the automaker battles an unprecedented slowdown in sales.
India’s largest passenger vehicle maker by sales will shut the two plants on Saturday and Monday, according to a company statement. This will be the first time the company will close both plants simultaneously for two days in its more than three decades long presence in India.
The step is an indication that the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit expects sales to remain weak even during the crucial festive season. The production shutdown is exceptional as Maruti tends to keep its factories at optimum levels in the run up to the festivals.
India’s auto industry has been in the grip of a prolonged slowdown.
Most passenger vehicle manufacturers have been cutting production as sales fell for the 10th consecutive month in August. Maruti cut production by a third in August, for the seventh straight month. Vehicle production at Maruti’s three plants, including the one in Gujarat, plunged 34% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 111,370 units in August.
Automakers traditionally boost vehicle production ahead of the festive months of September through October-November, as sales during the festival season constitute almost a third of the vehicles sold during the year.
This year, expecting a muted response from customers, other manufacturers such as Hyundai Motor India Ltd and Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd reported a double-digit decline in wholesale dispatches to dealerships in July and August before the festive season kicked off with Ganesh Chaturthi in the western states, which will be followed by Onam on 12 September in southern states, especially Kerala.
Maruti’s domestic wholesales in August fell 36% y-o-y to 94,728 units. This is the third time the firm has dispatched fewer than 100,000 vehicles to its dealerships in a particular month since July 2017. Vehicles dispatched by the top six passenger manufacturers fell 34% y-o-y in August to 171,193 vehicles.

The union government should make a common platform for formation of future regulations related to the automobile industry with representations from all the ministries responsible for making policies related to the sector, said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director, Maruti Suzuki India ltd.
As of now more than 5 ministries – Ministry of Heavy Industries, Road Transport and Highways, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Environment, Science and Urban Development – are responsible for policy making related to different aspects of the automobile sector.
According to Ayukawa, the carbon monoxide emission in a car is regulated by one ministry but the carbon dioxide emission is regulated by another ministry. While, the fuel that goes into the car is regulated by a third ministry. In addition, there are many courts and judicial bodies.
“In the future, with more technologies and regulation, the complexity will grow manifold. How to navigate through these multiple bodies and ensure that there is alignment?,"" added Ayukawa.
Taking a cue, Siam president, Rajan Wadhera, also urged the government to have only one nodal ministry for the auto industry.
Executives in the auto industry are of the opinion that the upcoming regulations and technologies will make policy formulation very intricate. Hence a single ministry or a platform should help policy formulation in the days to come.
“A few years ago, for addressing this issue, an institutional framework was planned by Ministry of Heavy Industries. There was the concept of a National Automotive Board or NAB with specialized automotive experts to provide knowledge and stakeholder consultation for all auto related policy making. Is it possible to have a central common platform for all ministries?,"" added Ayukawa during his speech.
At a time when the union government want to promote alternative powertrains to curb pollution and reduce import of crude, the automobile industry has been divided into two parts with one supporting for a transition to fully electric vehicles and while the other half lobbying hard for hybrid vehicles as an interim step before moving to electric.
Ayukawa also urged the centre to let the customers decide which technology they would choose in order to reduce vehicular emission.
“Is it possible that the government sets a target on its objective of emission or energy efficiency and allows the industry the freedom to choose the technology to achieve that goal. Once the “regulatory end-objective"" is taken care of, which design or technology is used should be left open to the customer to choose,"" added Ayukawa.
“By leaving the choice to the customer, it will help engineers to design the most optimal solution without any compromise on reaching the end goal. It will help us, as manufacturers, to be clear which investment we can undertake,"" he explained.
The auto mobile industry has been facing a severe slowdown over the last one year as sales of passenger vehicles declined for ten straight months to August, 2019. Maruti Suzuki curbed production in its three plants for seven consecutive months as vehicle dispatches also declined by double digits.

New Delhi: As the automobile industry undergoes structural changes with emergence of hybrid and electric vehicles, Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, on Friday urged the company’s 400 plus tier-1 component manufacturers to focus on building their capacities and making ‘zero-defect’ components with emphasis on quality.
“The next big challenge is developing capabilities of your suppliers. I think, it is important that you take ownership to develop the capability and quality of your suppliers. You will remember the hand holding that you got from vehicle manufacturers. Please carry the same process in the same spirit to your suppliers,"" Ayukawa said, while speaking at the 59th Annual General session of Automotive Component Manufactures Association of India (ACMA).
On Thursday, during the annual session of Society of Indian Automobile Manufactures (Siam), Ayukawa urged the government to form a common platform for making policies related to the auto industry.
As of now more than five ministries – Ministry of Heavy Industries, Road Transport and Highways, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Environment, Science and Urban Development – are responsible for policy making related to different aspects of the automobile sector.
According to Ayukawa, carbon monoxide emission in a car is regulated by one ministry but carbon dioxide emission is regulated by another ministry. While, the fuel that goes into the car is regulated by a third ministry. In addition, there are many courts and judicial bodies.
He said, “In the future, with more technologies and regulation, the complexity will grow manifold. How to navigate through these multiple bodies and ensure that there is alignment?""
Taking a cue, Siam president, Rajan Wadhera, also urged the government to form only one nodal ministry for the auto industry."
99,2019-09-06,Maruti,"Pay attention to quality as industry prepares for a transition to BS-VI emission norms, say automakersMaruti CEO urges tier-I suppliers to help small scale firms in manufacturing value chain

Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki and Tata Motors have urged auto component suppliers to build capabilities by investing in research and development (R&D) and ensure zero defect products. Addressing suppliers at the 59th annual session organized by the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) in Delhi on Friday, vehicle manufacturers asked suppliers to pay greater attention to quality, as the auto industry prepares for a transition to new safety measures and BS-VI emission norms.
“Please develop your capabilities. It is time now for India to manufacture zero defect products. Quality deserves a much greater attention from the top managements at the suppliers,"" Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director and CEO, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, said. He emphasized the need for “maintaining consistent quality benchmarks"" while addressing a gathering of about 900 delegates from the auto industry, largely component suppliers.
Ayukawa said developing supplier capabilities was the next big challenge. “You will remember the hand holding that you got from the vehicle manufacturers. Please carry the same process in the same spirit with your suppliers."" He urged tier-I suppliers to guide the medium and small scale companies in the automotive manufacturing value chain.
Maruti Suzuki had issued a recall of its WagonR hatchbacks last month to correct a defect in the fuel hose unit that had impacted over 40,000 units manufactured between 15 November 2018 and 12 August 2019.
A voluntary recall is an added cost for the company as well as for the parts makers involved.
Guenter Butschek, managing director, Tata Motors, said: “The millennial customers have faster turnaround expectations and zero tolerance for (poor) quality. The bar has been raised."" He stressed that suppliers must identify gaps and pain points and address them. “Take this ongoing crisis as a fitness project. We need to work on bringing innovations to the market by being inclusive. We must also quickly align to the changing market dynamics and technology at play,"" he said. “Preparation for ACES (autonomous, connectivity, electric and shared mobility) will lead the industry forward."" Butschek said the auto ancillary units have to drive supply chain efficiencies via Industry 4.0. “The buck doesn’t stop at the tier-I suppliers,"" he said, highlighting the need for medium- and small-scale suppliers to chip in and enhance efficiency and quality.
Rohit Saboo, president and CEO, National Engineering Industries Ltd, a leading supplier of bearings to automakers, said Industry 4.0 helps suppliers in predicting failures and reducing downtime of machines, besides driving efficiency, and reducing losses and turnaround time.
Ayukawa also stressed the need to skill people as automakers were looking at rolling out world class vehicles in India. “A root cause analysis of the defects shows that more than half of the defects are due to human error. This means we are underestimating the importance of training and skilling our people.""
Ayukawa urged suppliers to develop in-house research and development capabilities. He said Maruti Suzuki cars have about 90% localized content, given that some key electronics components are still imported.
“But we want to make in India. If anybody can make key electronic components in India with quality and reliability, it will help not only your company but the entire Indian automobile industry,"" he added."
97,2019-09-10,Maruti,"A mix of robotics, AI and IoT is making the Indian factory smarter. How  will  the  shop floor look 10 years from now?While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 1990s, the bus has now become more advanced. And the edge lies in industrial IoT,  robotics,  AI  and 3D  printing

Bengaluru: Three years ago, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, a unit of Tata Motors Ltd, showcased a robot called BRABO at the “Make in India"" week in Mumbai. Short for “Bravo Robot"", BRABO was touted by the company as the first “Made in India"" industrial robot, and is designed to lift loads of up to 10 kilograms.
Mahindra and Mahindra LTd already has a “robotic weld line"" at its factory in Nashik, which now caters to many of its products including the Marazzo and the XUV300. Tata Motors, too, uses robots in its Pune factory, while Godrej and Welspun run their shop floors with the help of an Intelligent Plant Framework, which enables tracking of machinery and productivity on the floor in real time.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has numerous robots employed at its Manesar and Gurugram car factories, with more than 2,000 robots working at the weld shop in its Manesar facility alone. Manjushree Technopack Ltd’s Bidadi (in Bengaluru) manufacturing plant also has more than a dozen of its packaging machines connected to a network, providing monthly updates on maintenance issues.
Automation, of course, is no stranger to shop floors. Many factories all over the world and India have been using computer numerical control (CNC) machines for years. These machines allow operators to feed a program of instructions directly into a mini-computer via a small board, similar to a traditional keyboard. After loading the required tools in the machine, the rest is done automatically by the CNC machines, which use these instructions to control machinery such as the grinder, milling machine, and lathe. But next-gen automation is likely to be vastly different on one score: it will either make humans redundant or vastly alter the necessary skill set that is required to hold on to one’s spot on the shop floor. A human-machine interface, or HMI, may eventually make the good old CNC machine voice-activated, for example, allowing an operator to just speak instructions.
These oncoming changes will leave long-lasting impacts on India’s labour force, particularly in some sectors—automotive, textile, and banking and financial services, apart from information technology—which have become far more attuned to global shifts due to the nature of modern supply chains. The “smart factory"" will, in all likelihood, change the popular conception of what a shop floor looks like.
An army of robots
The number of robots in use worldwide multiplied threefold over the past two decades to 2.25 million, according to a June 2019 report by Oxford Economics. Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030—with 14 million in China alone, the report adds.
India is way behind at the moment. But things can change very quickly. The automotive industry, which is currently racked by a slowdown, is a great example. In the face of stagnation, firms that had begun to ramp up their robot density (robots per 10,000 workers) in the mid-2000s have now merely chosen not to rehire a bulk of the short-term, rotational, low-skilled contract workforce. According to a 22 January 2019 report by the International Federation of Robotics, India’s automotive sector was the main customer for industrial robots, accounting for as much as 62% of the total supply.
“On average, each newly installed robot displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers,"" the report says. Despite these rapid changes, industry players like Harshvendra Soin, chief people officer at Tech Mahindra, say: “We believe the future will be more human than we think."" However, some factories are now beginning to acquire the capability for “lights out"" production—meaning, they can operate without the presence of human workers. In fact, Japanese robotics firm FANUC, which is considered to be the poster boy for such factories, has been operating a “lights out"" factory with robots since 2001.
Unique quandary
India is in a unique quandary. While the country needs to find jobs for its booming population, the globally competitive opportunities are almost entirely in smart manufacturing, most of which require less human hands per unit of output. “The conventional ways of doing incremental business will no longer suffice. India needs to push its people to adopt disruptive ways of doing business,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, Department of Science and Technology at the 4th Confederation of Indian Industries Smart Manufacturing Summit, held on 26 October 2018 in Delhi.
While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 90s, which powered China’s growth, the bus has now become more advanced. And the competitive edge lies in artificial intelligence (AI), industrial Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, robotics and additive manufacturing (better known as 3D printing), which are all set to fundamentally transform global production.
In any case, automation on the shop floor is now being taken to new levels. Machines develop faults like parts getting worn out or equipment not getting calibrated properly. An operator could, thus, waste a lot of time trying to locate the origin of the problem. It’s here that automation is being combined with AI and IoT on the shop floor to resolve such issues.
AI, for instance, can be integrated with CNC machines to enable self-diagnosis. Thus, when a fault develops, it will be detected and the software will try and solve the problem. Apart from using the data that is collected thus for diagnostics, a more advanced AI system could analyze that data and alter the settings of the machine to optimize a prototype being manufactured.
According to a 10 May blog by Craig Lyjak, EY Global Smart Factory leader, the smart factory is no longer a futuristic vision. It is the heart of the broader Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which refers to the gradual combination of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices with digital technologies. The most prominent of these technologies, according to Lyjak, include computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software, cloud computing, IoT, advanced sensor technologies, 3D printing, industrial robotics, data analytics, AI and machine learning (ML), and enhanced machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.
These technologies are already showing impressive results both globally and in India. In 2016, The Times of India reported that the country’s first “self-aware"" factory was being set up in Bengaluru at the Indian Institute of Science’s Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing with seed funding from the Boeing Co. The factory is enabling data to be continuously collected and monitored, from both sensor-fitted machines and digitally connected wearables in order to provide real-time insights about every movement and process taking place on the factory floor. The factory remains a “work in progress"".
On its part, German auto-component maker Bosch’s Bidadi plant has cobots, or collaborative robots, working alongside humans. GE’s Chakan (in Pune) factory’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is linked to the manufacturing execution system (MES). Equipment efficiency is monitored in real time to decide production schedules like availability of forks or lifts, raw material trucks, workers and machines while sensors (read IoT) send warnings on possible breakdowns.
Digital factories
While the Indian automobile industry is unquestionably at the vanguard of the oncoming change, other companies are not entirely untouched. Mondelez India describes its Sri City (in Andhra Pradesh) unit as an “integrated digital factory"", one which can pack 6,300 chocolate bars a minute, while Jaipur Watch Co. has added a new collection of stainless steel watches that were 3D printed.
Lyjak cites the example of Microsoft Dynamics’ integration with smart factory processes and technologies as a case in point. Microsoft Dynamics’ Remote Assist application, for instance, combines Microsoft HoloLens (a self-contained, holographic computer) with mixed reality, video calling, annotations, and file sharing to enable experts to remotely troubleshoot complex problems and help technicians. This saves time, reduces travel costs and improves operational efficiency on the shop floor.
Further, AI is used to optimize the multi-robot fulfilment system in Amazon warehouses. The average cost for a spot welding robot, according to the report, is projected to decrease by 22% by 2025, and robots-as-a-service models are beginning to appear.
Although bringing AI onto the shop floor would require a massive capital investment, the return on investment (ROI) is higher, according to SaaSnic Technologies. AI and ML, for instance, can test numerous demand forecasting models with precision, while automatically adjusting to different variables such as new product introductions, supply chain disruptions or sudden changes in demand. Using AI systems, every single part of a product can be tracked from when it’s first manufactured to when it is assembled and shipped to the customer.
Walmart, for instance, cut its physical inventory from one month to 24 hours by using drones that fly through the warehouse, scan products, and check for misplaced items. Using algorithms that learn from experience to optimize logistics, BMW tracks a part from the point it was manufactured to when the vehicle is sold—from all of its assembly facilities across the world. In finance operations, AI can close operations and automate monthly, quarterly and year-end processes. Using ML, bots can learn from human inputs to make better judgments and adapt to the behaviour patterns of accounting professionals.
The future office
Smart robots also assist shop floor operations indirectly by increasing employee satisfaction and appealing to a millennial mindset. A couple of months ago, for instance, Indian IT services provider Tech Mahindra introduced a Human Resource (HR) humanoid at its Noida Special Economic Zone Campus in Uttar Pradesh. Christened K2, this was the second HR humanoid (a robot that resembles a human) from the Mahindra Group company—the first was launched at its Hyderabad campus in May.
K2 can address HR-related employee queries and even handle personal requests for actions like providing payslips, tax forms, etc. With the help of AI, K2 can start a conversation without any need for wake-up commands. It can even converse with differently-abled employees by responding to queries with a text display along with speech. Tech Mahindra now plans to deploy the next humanoid at its Pune campus.
Despite the immense potential benefits of enhancing ERP systems with AI, there are risks with regard to sharing of sensitive data and regulations that need to be considered, such as the European Union general data protection regulation (GDPR), besides the loss of jobs to automation and robots. That said, the benefits may outweigh the risks if governments devise sensible privacy regulations, and revamp labour policies to factor in the impact of these new technologies on the workforce.
As an example, Tech Mahindra, which has already implemented an AI-based facial recognition (which typically raises privacy invasion concerns) system to register the attendance of employees, claims it has “drastically reduced the time spent by an associate in updating the timesheet"". The company also has Talex—an AI-driven marketplace of talent that maps skills of the existing talent pool.
But the increasingly common use of AI and robotics in the Indian context may lie inside the e-commerce package. Gurugram-based AI-powered robotics firm GreyOrange’s Butler, for example, is an autonomous robot that uses goods-to-person technology for inventory storage and order picking. It populates the many warehouses that have come up across the country in order to fuel the e-commerce boom. Butler runs on a software platform that uses AI algorithms and ML, which optimize path planning, maximize storage, and accelerate order fulfilment.
The final piece of the puzzle is the ability to hire these intelligent machines on contract, like workers. As a precursor for what may become commonplace soon, US-based Hirebotics allows firms to hire cloud-connected robots. The hourly wage starts at $15 per hour and they can work a minimum of 80 hours a week—and, they neither tire nor need bathroom breaks. Of course, companies have to give Hirebotics a 30-day written notice if they fire any robot. What these robot work contracts show is this: the future is already here."
98,2019-09-10,Maruti,"In August, sales of passenger cars slumped 41% year-on-year, with market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd registering a 36% decline

India’s auto sector continues to remind us of the painful economic slowdown that India is undergoing. In August, sales of passenger cars slumped 41% year-on-year, with market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd registering a 36% decline. Sales of Alto, the company’s entry-level hatchback, have halved. According to news reports, Maruti Chairman R.C. Bhargava has apportioned some of the blame on a crisis of car affordability, or lack thereof. Extra costs borne on account of stricter safety and emission norms, in his view, have pushed cars out of the reach of people who may otherwise have been able to buy them. While he has also mentioned other factors that have held sales back, including higher road tax in some states and enhanced insurance charges, his point on safety invites a debate.
Apart from greener technology, India has mandated the installation of anti-lock braking systems and air-bags in all cars. It takes money to adhere to these norms, but there is a strong case for making these compulsory rather than treating them as optional. Consumers often ignore not only the invisible damage they do the environment, they also tend to overlook the worst-case risks they bear. Left to themselves, they may not want to pay for add-ons that don’t deliver immediately palpable benefits. In such cases, state intervention is justified.
If cars are too expensive, then other costs deserve scrutiny. Could better economies of scale be squeezed out by making fewer models, for example? Also, does the tax burden on vehicles in India really need to be higher than in other markets? There are no easy answers. But lives are as precious. We need cheaper cars, but not at the cost of safety."
96,2019-09-12,Maruti,"The carmaker has hired KPMG, PwC to advise its parts suppliers on how to manage their business during the downturnHiring the consulting firms shows Maruti Suzuki’s intent to keep its ecosystem sustainable

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has collaborated with consulting firms KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to suggest to its suppliers on how to efficiently run their operations and survive the current turbulence in India’s passenger vehicle market, said two people aware of the development.
The step indicates that the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit is preparing for a prolonged slump in domestic demand, despite a raft of measures implemented by the Union government to boost car sales.
In a meeting organized by Maruti Suzuki Suppliers Welfare Association on Wednesday, both KPMG and PwC told vendors how to manage their businesses during a downturn and also emphasized the reasons for the slowdown, the two people said, requesting anonymity.
PwC was also tapped by some European automakers to advise their parts makers during the financial downturn in 2008-2010, one of the two people cited earlier said. Maruti has therefore decided to use PwC’s experience to help its own suppliers strengthen operations, the person said.
“This move by the company also indicates that it is not expecting the slowdown to go away in the near future. The suppliers have been the biggest casualty of the slowdown as most of them had to retrench a lot of their employees to reduce operational cost. This also shows the maturity of Maruti as a company as well,"" the person said.
Maruti Suzuki, KPMG and PwC did not immediately respond to emailed queries.
An unprecedented slowdown in India’s auto industry since July last year has forced automakers and their vendors including those of Maruti to shed temporary workers.
Passenger vehicle sales in India plunged 32% year-on-year in August to 196,524 units, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam). It was the 10th straight decline in passenger vehicle sales and the worst since Siam began compiling monthly sales data in 1997-98.
Maruti, which sells one in two cars in India, saw sales drop 25% in the April-August period to 562,923 units from a year earlier.
Vehicle production at Maruti’s three plants, including the one in Gujarat, plunged 34% to 111,370 units in August. Domestic wholesales fell 36% to 94,728 units last month, the third time the company has dispatched fewer than 100,000 vehicles to its dealerships in a particular month since July 2017.
“Maruti is by far one of the most organized automakers and planned for the long-term scenario,"" said Avik Chattopadhayay, founder of Expereal, a brand consulting firm. “They realize that the current situation will take time to repair... probably a few quarters, if not a full year to be back to August 2018 levels. Therefore, the preparation to dig their heels deep and arm themselves for a protracted battle. To ride out the storm earlier, you have to be better prepared.""
KPMG and PwC have informed the suppliers that they should undertake aggressive financial monitoring of their operations, focus on cash conversion cycles, convert fixed cost to variable ones, that is, monetize fixed assets such as warehouses, cut costs in the right place and review planned manufacturing to survive during a slowdown, said the second person.
Both urged the suppliers to have a “clean sheet"" or a back-to-the-drawing-board approach for every cost item and think of collaborating with rivals to improve capacity utilization. They also advised parts makers to reskill their workforce and embark on a top-down business transformation to survive, the person said.
Mint reported on 8 August that 40,000-50,000 workers had been retrenched at Gurugram and Manesar in Haryana, the country’s biggest automotive hub, as original equipment manufacturers and vendors have reduced their contract labour force. Some of the vendors have temporarily shut factories as Maruti adjusted production at its twin plants in Gurugram and Manesar in line with waning demand.
The second person said hiring the consulting firms shows Maruti’s intent to keep its ecosystem sustainable both financially and operationally during this slowdown as a turnaround is not expected anytime soon.
“The current slowdown is not like the one we experienced earlier in 2008 and 2013. A year after declining sales, still we don’t have any recovery in sight. With BS-VI coming in from next fiscal, this is expected to exacerbate,"" the person said. “Leading suppliers of Maruti have invested quite a lot in Gujarat as well thinking of robust growth orders. These companies need to be protected now, as they are very important to the overall sustainability of Maruti in the long term."""

New Delhi: Auto-makers Maruti Suzuki India and Tata Motors' domestic passenger vehicle market share declined in April-August this year, while Hyundai and M&M witnessed gain in the same period, as per data compiled by industry body SIAM.
The country's largest car-maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) saw its market share dip by over 2 percentage points during the period under review and slip below 50% in the domestic passenger vehicle segment in April-August.
The company sold 5,55,064 units this fiscal as compared with 7,57,289 units during April-August previous year. Its market share has come down from 52.16% last year to 49.83% in the April-August this fiscal.
Overall PV sales during the April-August of the current fiscal stands at 11,09,930 units as compared to 14,51,647 units.
When contacted MSI executive director (marketing and sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI that while cars and vans (A and C segment) have performed well, there has been a drop in sales of utility vehicles (B segment).
""This is because of constraint in supply of Ertiga having a large waiting period,"" he added.
Besides, there is a shift in consumer preference in SUV segment towards petrol where currently the company does not have a variant, Srivastava said adding that MSI plans to introduce petrol variants of Vitara Brezza and S-Cross BS-VI later this fiscal.
Similarly, Tata Motors has reported sales of 60,093 units this fiscal so far as against 98,702 units last year. Its market share has fallen by 1.39 percentage points to 5.41% in the current fiscal as against 6.79% last year.
On the other hand, Hyundai Motor India saw its market share go up by 2.77 percentage points in the April-August this year. The company sold a total of 2,03,729 units this fiscal as compared to 2,26,396 units.
Despite selling less this fiscal, the company's market share has risen from 15.59% last fiscal to 18.36%.
""2019 is a milestone year for Hyundai Motor India as we launched three products in three different segments...the new launches have led to increase in customer traction, footfalls in showrooms and market share,"" Hyundai Motor India Ltd National Sales Head Vikas Jain said.
Similarly, Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) sold 89,733 units this fiscal so far as compared with 1,00,015 units in April-August last financial year, still its market share has risen by 1.19 percentage points this fiscal to 8.08% from 6.89%.
Likewise, Toyota Kirloskar Motor sold 53,977 units this fiscal so far as against 67,051 unitsin the same period previous year. Its market share rose to 4.86% from 4.62% earlier.
Other players like Renault India, Skoda Auto, Volkswagen India saw their market shares increase marginally during April-August this year.
Honda Cars sold 51,569 units as compared to 79,599 units last year, shrinking its market share marginally to 4.64% this fiscal as against 5.48% in the same period last fiscal.
Similarly, Ford India saw its market share go down marginally to 2.7% from 2.81% in April-August last year. It sold 30,010 units this year as against 40,799 units.
Nissan Motor India saw its market share dip to 0.73% this fiscal as against 1.14% in the year-ago period. The company sold a total of 8,070 units so far this fiscal as compared to 16,515 units.
Newcomers Kia Motors and MG Motor India saw their market share in the PV segment at 0.56% and 0.32%, respectively, this fiscal so far. Kia Motors overall wholesales stood at 6,236 units during the April-August period as compared with MG Motor's 3,526 units.

94,2019-09-16,Maruti,"India’s largest passenger vehicle maker is also urging commercial banks to lower rates on vehicle loansMaruti is currently offering discounts ranging from  ₹40,000 to  ₹100,000 on its vehicles

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is offering hefty discounts on its vehicles as India’s largest passenger vehicle maker seeks to stimulate retail demand during the crucial festival season.
The local unit of Suzuki Motor Corp. is also urging commercial banks to lower their rates on vehicle loans, in line with recent reductions in the repo rate by the central bank, to make it easier for consumers to purchase new vehicles.
Maruti hopes the steps would help to reduce the overall ownership cost of a new vehicle and avert a slump in retail sales for two consecutive festival seasons. In 2018, vehicle manufacturers endured the worst festive season sales in five years, as customers stayed away from showrooms in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).
Vehicle ownership costs have risen since last year along with higher insurance charges while automakers have increased vehicle prices to meet stricter safety and emission norms. An economic downturn, liquidity squeeze and farm distress is also forcing many to shun new vehicle purchases.
The festival season is critical for automakers as it comprises about a third of total annual vehicle sales. With the automotive industry bearing its worst sales slump, Maruti and other automakers in India are unveiling discounts and other incentives to attract consumers.
Maruti is currently offering discounts ranging from  ₹40,000 to  ₹100,000 on its vehicles, said Shashank Srivastava, executive director, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki. He said the company is focusing on bringing down the cost of ownership irrespective of the steps to be taken by the government to revive consumption demand, as an internal study conducted by the company has shown increase in vehicle prices, due to introduction of new regulations, as one of the biggest reasons behind the current decline in sales.
“The number one reason for this slowdown seems to be the cost of acquisition of vehicles which has gone up substantially for multiple reasons. For example, in the entry segment, price of an Alto (small car) would have increased in the range of around 15-20%. We are trying to reduce the cost of acquisition by our strong promo offers at present,"" said Srivastava.
Sales of automobiles, especially passenger vehicles, have been declining since July 2018 as banks became cautious in extending credit to customers and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), in the aftermath of bankruptcy of IL&FS.
“In case of retail financing, we are trying to get banks to finance increased portion of the on-road price of the vehicle so as to reduce the down payment cost that a customer has to bear. We are also talking to banks to reduce the retail finance rate. In July last year, the repo rate was 6.5% and now it’s 5.3%, but this reduction has not reflected in the retail financing rate,"" Srivastava said.
Most automakers are offering enhanced discounts for the upcoming Navratri and Diwali period to lure customers. With dealerships saddled with inventory of more than a month, companies have also cut factory dispatches by more than 10% in August and September.
Maruti’s wholesales, or factory dispatches, in August fell 36% year-on-year to 94,728 units. This is the third time the company sold less than 100,000 vehicles in a month since July 2017. The number of vehicles produced at its three plants declined 34% year-on-year to 111,370 units in August. It was the seventh straight monthly production cut for Maruti.
“The initial sign (for this festive season) seems to be a bit positive since our enquiry levels are higher and there seems to be some traction in the market. We have to wait for a little bit more time since it’s the end of the month when the festive season will start across the country, after the Shradh period which will get over by 28 September"", Srivastava said."

New Delhi: The latest campaign for Maruti Suzuki India’s popular hatchback Swift opens with an unlikely protagonist Bhupender Sharma, a senior marketing executive, who lost a leg in an accident. The camera follows his journey as he talks about the definition of kamyaabi (success), showing him embracing sports as a way to regain physical and mental stability.
Made by advertising agency, Dentsu Impact, the film salutes the undying spirit of Sharma introducing viewer with auto maker’s new brand thought ‘Be Limitless’. Created as a series, the new campaign also highlights the stories of real life heroes such as six-time world champion and Olympics bronze winner Mary Kom and Vikas Dimri, a corporate banker, ironman runner who scaled the Mt Everest.
“We want to engage with our target group (TG) in a more meaningful way. Be Limitless is a way to build a higher level of brand salience to associate with performance but in an emotional way which is going to be our long term strategy. The limitless spirit celebrates individuals where keep challenging themselves to become their better version. We wish to associate Maruti Suzuki with visual dynamism and pursuit for excellence. We have a separate campaign for sales promotion for Swift. This campaign does not push for immediate sales it is meant to build brand salience,"" said Shashank Srivastava, executive director (marketing and sales), Maruti Suzuki India.
The campaign will be promoted across digital and social media platforms.
“Swift has always celebrated performance and the ‘Limitless Stories’ campaign has been created to do exactly that, with one difference – it takes the ‘Be Limitless’ philosophy beyond just the car. It salutes the undying spirit of certain special achievers who never accept things as they are, and keep pushing past all limits to realise their dreams. These stories have been carefully selected; because we felt they strongly connect with a consumer’s ‘nothing-is-impossible’ attitude. Thus, inspiring people to share their own limitless stories, while creating higher brand resonance at the same time,"" Anupama Ramaswamy, national creative director, Dentsu Impact, Gurgaon.
Swift was introduced in 2005, and now has a third generation model which was launched last year.

92,2019-09-18,Maruti,"Indian automakers are now on par with Europe and America in terms of quality but the purchasing power of domestic buyers has not grown enough to afford the increased product prices, says R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India

NEW DELHI :
Automobile sales have continued to decline in India amid newer safety and emission norms, higher vehicle prices and an overall consumption slowdown. In an interview, R.C. Bhargava, chairman, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, agreed that many youngsters prefer gadgets over cars, and the lack of affordability is keeping many potential customers away. Indian automakers are now on par with Europe and America in terms of quality but the purchasing power of domestic buyers has not grown enough to afford the increased product prices, he added. Edited excepts:
Is there is a structural problem behind the current downturn in automobile sales?
The per capita income in India is almost around $2,200 (per annum) and in Europe, it is approximately around $40,000. In terms of all the standards which add to the cost of the product, there is no difference between Europe and India. In addition to which the taxation levels in India, whether it’s in terms of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), road tax and others, are much higher than in Europe or even China for that matter. How do you expect a country with such a low per capita income to have enough customers to have the capacity to pay this kind of money for a car and grow at 10-15% every year (in terms of vehicle sales). Why do we want at this stage of our development to adopt all the western standards and norms without considering its impact on the affordability of products?
How will the auto sector perform in the next five years?
We want contribution from manufacturing (sector) to reach 25% of GDP by 2025 and today, it is may be around 15% of the GDP. That means manufacturing sector needs to grow faster than the overall GDP to reach the desired target. If GDP growth itself has to grow by 12% a year to reach the $5 trillion target, then manufacturing will have to grow by something around 17-18%. To grow manufacturing at that rate, then demand for manufactured products also must increase at that rate because unless the customers can buy the product, then the production cannot happen. As automobiles are 50% of the manufacturing GDP, then the sector has to grow by 15-16% per year to propel manufacturing sector to reach 25% of GDP. If customers cannot buy products at this rate, then how will it happen? We have economists everywhere, but where have they worked out this affordability and growth related to affordability?
Do you think emergence of shared mobility has impacted sales?
The reality is that everybody will like to have a car. If you have just started a job or just completed a year in a profession, that salary does not allow you to have everything you want. If you buy a car in the beginning of your career then you have to pay the monthly instalments. So, I have to choose what I want to do with the limited amount of money that I get because for buying a car, I may get a loan but have to provide 10% to 20% initial deposit and also pay the EMI. That cuts into my ability to do some of the other things I want. Today, a youngster wants to buy a nice smartphone and wants to meet his friends at a restaurant and have a good time. If he buys a car, then he probably can’t do these things. So, he is now looking at an option which he didn’t two, three or four years ago—that let me not buy a car to start with and get the other gadgets that I want. So, he postpones his car-buying by four or five years or whatever time it takes him to reach a stage where he is comfortable owning a car. Today, a youngster has so many options of what he can do with his money, that a lot of them prefer other options than buying a car because he can still get his mobility through a car from Ola and Uber which is much more economical. So, what the finance minister said is 100% correct. That is what the millennial generation is thinking.
Has the Gujarat plant been commissioned at a wrong time given the protracted slowdown?
We needed the capacity and earlier, we were short of capacity and there were cars on waiting list all the time. Problem starts from people not buying and doesn’t start from production. The over or excess production has happened because there is a slowdown. Manufacturers take time to bring down production and now everyone is facing non-production days because we have all ordered inventory and parts. There is a whole chain that is in motion which just does not stop.
Having seen Maruti evolve as one of the most valuable corporate entities in this country, how do you think the company will evolve in this coming decade given the disruption in the industry?
My worry is how we will create the capacity amongst Indian consumers to buy manufactured products in large numbers. I don’t think 10 years ahead that way. There is need for our economists to do a study on what policy of pricing and taxation are required, taxation particularly, both by the states and in fact, more by the states, and for input cost of the industry to bring down the cost of production of manufactured products. For example, electricity has been priced at the highest to the industry. How does industry make products which are affordable? If you don’t have affordable products, then how will we have 15% growth?
What do you think of impact of new ways of owning car which is through leasing and subscription?
None of this is of any great significance. They all have some impact. First thing is the consumer must have the ability to buy a product. Nothing is more important that.
Some of your competitors have picked up stakes in various startups in the recent past. When can we expect something on the same lines from Maruti?
How does that make any difference to the growth of the industry? By investing in Ola and Uber, you are not growing the demand for the product. These are all ways to look at how to improve your business but will not help increase the overall demand for cars in the country. That’s a question of a strategy from each manufacturer as to whether they think that it will help the business becoming more competitive. Each company has its own strategy. At the moment, we haven’t invested in any of these sharing platforms and one can argue that these companies will buy products not because somebody is an equity investor but because the particular product is most economical for them to operate in that business. We sell a lot of cars to Uber and Ola. I have no stake in them but they do buy my cars.
Why is the automobile industry divided when it comes to demanding a GST cut on vehicles?
There is no division and Siam has said that a cut is needed. My point is different in a sense that I don’t want a temporary cut. Many people have talked of a temporary cut and that does not help. My bigger question is which I would like the economists in the finance and other ministries to work out that if the auto industry has to grow, what will be the growth rate that they would like the industry to achieve. For that, what will be the pricing structure? It not only includes just taxes bit, also cost of production due to the cost of inputs, infrastructure or compliances."
91,2019-09-18,Maruti,"There’s no point in a temporary cut in GST rates, says R.C. BhargavaBhargava says the buying power of Indian consumers has not risen in line with the increase in car prices

New Delhi: Ride-hailing companies such as Ola and Uber have hit demand for new cars in India as young buyers don’t need to buy cars for commuting and can spend most of their income on electronic gadgets, said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker.
Bhargava’s latest statement supports the contention of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman who cited millenials’ unwillingness to buy cars as one of the reasons for a slump in sales.
Bhargava, a former bureaucrat, said there is “no point"" in a temporary cut in the goods and services tax (GST) on vehicles as it would not help the industry in the long run. He said the introduction of stricter safety and emission regulations would improve the quality of vehicles produced in India and put them on a par with those in Europe.
Bhargava said the buying power of Indians has not risen in line with the increase in car prices, leading many to postpone purchases as car prices have been increased to adhere to new norms.
“The per capita income in India is almost around $2,200 (per annum) and in Europe, it is approximately around $40,000. In terms of all standards, which add to the cost of the product, there is no difference between Europe and India,"" Bhargava said. “In addition, the taxation levels in India, whether it’s in terms of GST, road tax and others, are much higher than in Europe or even China for that matter. How do you expect a country with such a low per capita income to have enough customers to have the capacity to pay for a car and grow at 10-15% every year?""
Passenger vehicle sales in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market have slumped in the past year as lack of financing options, increase in ownership costs and an economic downturn have discouraged people from buying cars.
Bhargava said Sitharaman “is correct"" in saying that the youth are opting for Ola and Uber rather than buying new vehicles during the initial years of their careers.

Mumbai: Indian stock markets may see an uptrend on Thursday tracking global cues after the US central bank decided slash interest rates. The US Federal Reserve cut interest rates again on Wednesday to help sustain a record-long economic expansion but signalled a higher bar to further reductions in borrowing costs, eliciting a fast and sharp rebuke from President Donald Trump.
Asian shares edged higher on Thursday, tracking some modest Wall Street gains after the US Federal Reserve cut interest rates as expected but offered mixed signals on the next easing, keeping investors cautious.
The Treasury yield curve flattened as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell dashed hopes he would signal further easing while division among central bankers has increased uncertainty over how much further rates might fall.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.03%. Japan's Nikkei rose 0.46%, while Australian shares rose 0.23%.
The Fed cut interest rates for a second time this year to 1.75%-2.00% in a 7-3 vote but signalled further rate cuts are unlikely as the labour market remains strong. The rate cut was widely expected, but the split vote has raised some concern about predicting the future path of monetary policy. So-called dot-plot forecasts from all 17 policymakers showed even broader disagreement, with seven expecting a third rate cut this year, five seeing the current rate cut as the last for 2019, and five who appeared to have been against even Wednesday’s move.
Central banks around the world have been loosening policy to counter the risks of low inflation and recession. Easier monetary policy has generally supported equities. However, some analysts argue that a bond market rally has gone too far, saying yields have fallen too fast and curves flattened too much. Others are worried about the growing amount of sovereign debt with negative yields.
US stock futures were down 0.06% in Asia on Thursday. The S&P 500 reversed losses to end 0.03% higher after Powell said he did not see an imminent recession or think the Fed will adopt negative rates.
Back home, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is studying how non-bank lenders and home financiers price their loans, close on the heels of directing commercial banks to link their loan rates to external benchmarks. The matter came up at an internal RBI discussion on external benchmarks, which are binding on all banks beginning 1 October, according to a Mint report.
The government has banned electronic cigarettes amid growing fears over the health risks posed by vaping, sending shares of conventional cigarette makers soaring. The Union cabinet has made the manufacture, import, sale, distribution and advertisements of e-cigarettes a cognizable offence, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said after a Cabinet meeting in New Delhi on Wednesday.
Ride-hailing companies such as Ola and Uber have hit demand for new cars in India as young buyers don’t need to buy cars for commuting and can spend most of their income on electronic gadgets, said RC Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker.
Meanwhile, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes rose to 1.7944%, while the two-year yield rose to 1.7621%.
The spread between two- and 10-year Treasury yields, the most commonly used measure of the yield curve, narrowed to the lowest since 9 September. The curve inverted on 14 August for the first time since 2007 when long-term yields traded below short-term yields, a widely accepted indicator of coming recession.
The yen traded near a seven-week low versus the dollar before a Bank of Japan meeting later on Thursday where policymakers are expected to keep their ultra-easy policy unchanged. The yen stood at 108.42 per dollar, only a few pips from the highest since 1 August.
The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is widely expected to maintain its pledge to guide short-term interest rates at -0.1% and the 10-year government bond yield around 0%. Investors will closely watch BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda’s post decision press conference to see how he assesses risks to Japan’s economic outlook.
US crude futures ticked up 0.03% to $58.13 per barrel. Oil markets have stabilised after attacks in Saudi Arabia over the weekend triggered a supply shock and sent prices soaring, but the volatility is still a risk as Middle East tensions remain high.

NEW DELHI :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Wednesday reduced the prices of entry-level cars and diesel variants of all products by  ₹5,000 to boost demand during the festival season.
The move by India’s largest vehicle manufacturer in the run-up to the Navratri and Diwali festivals, and Durga Puja comes in the wake the Union government drastically reducing corporate taxes.
Maruti has brought down the prices of Alto K10 and 800, and Celerio, as well as the diesel variants of Swift, Dzire, Vitara Brezza, S-Cross and Baleno.
“The new prices will be applicable from 25 September across the country. This reduction of price will be over and above the current promotional offers for the company’s vehicle range. The company is optimistic that the price reduction will bring down the cost of acquisition, especially for entry-level customers. This announcement around the festival season will help boost customer sentiment and revive the market to create demand,"" Maruti said in a press release.
Maruti’s festive offers include discounts of  ₹40,000 to  ₹100,000 across different models, to lure potential customers back to the showrooms.
Ratings agencies and brokerages were expecting original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to cut product prices to boost demand, after the reduction in corporate taxes.
“Under the current weak demand conditions, OEMs are expected to pass on some of the benefits of tax revision to the end consumers. This implies that the price correction in coming months will, to an extent, address demand-side issues,"" said Pavethra Ponniah, vice-president and sector head of ratings agency Icra.
The government had on 20 September reduced corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% to boost consumer demand and increase spending by private companies. The effective tax to be paid by the companies, including surcharge and cess, will be 25.17%.
Automakers exploring opportunities to start manufacturing in India stand to benefit more, as the corporate tax rate for new manufacturing companies was cut from 25% to 15%, provided they start operations by 31 March 2023.
Domestic sales of passenger vehicles had plunged 31.6% in August to 196,524 units from a year earlier, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
This was the 10th straight drop in domestic passenger vehicle sales and the worst since Siam began compiling monthly sales data in 1997-98. Passenger vehicle sales have been declining since July 2018.
“We are currently offering discounts ranging from  ₹40,000 to  ₹100,000 on our vehicles. We are also focusing on bringing down the cost of ownership, irrespective of the steps to be taken by the government to revive consumption demand, as our internal study has shown an increase in vehicle prices, with the introduction of new regulations as one of the biggest reasons behind the current decline in sales,"" said Shashank Srivastava, executive director, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki, in an interview with Mint earlier this month.
Maruti had cut production by one-third in August as it expected muted demand during the festive season. Vehicle production at Maruti’s three plants, including the one in Gujarat owned by its parent Suzuki Motor Corp, plunged 34% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 111,370 units in August.
Maruti’s domestic wholesales in August fell 36% y-o-y to 94,728 units. This was the third time since July 2017 that the firm has dispatched fewer than 100,000 vehicles to its dealerships in a particular month."

NEW DELHI :
The steps taken to reverse the economic slowdown, along with the upcoming festive season offers, might have the potential to accelerate the automobile sector's sales growth, industry insiders opined.
The trend of reduced prices on the back of recent corporate tax sops is expected to catch-up after car market leader Maruti Suzuki cut prices on Wednesday.
There had been scepticism in the auto industry whether a cut in corporate taxes will lead benefit consumers. The government has yet not lowered GST rates for automobiles despite persistent demands by the industry.
Nonetheless, the auto giant announced an immediate  ₹5,000 cut in prices of its bestselling cars including all variants of Alto 800, Alto K10, Swift Diesel, Celerio, Baleno Diesel, Ignis, Dzire Diesel, Tour S Diesel, Vitara Brezza and S-Cross.
Besides, other companies such as Piaggio India and Isuzu Motors India announced festive season discounts.
On its part, Maruti Suzuki decided to reduce the price by  ₹5,000 on ex-showroom price, ""proactively and voluntarily"" sharing the benefits of corporate tax reduction with customers.
Maruti said it is optimistic that the price reduction will bring down the cost of acquisition, especially for the entry-level customers. This announcement around the festive season will help boost customer sentiment and revive the market to create demand.
Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced several measures to rescue the auto sector, including lifting a ban on purchase of vehicles by government departments, and allowing additional 15 per cent depreciation on vehicles bought till March 2020 among others.
However, the industry had demanded more measures, like reduction in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate on automobiles from 28 per cent to 18 per cent, along with a vehicle scrappage policy.
On September 20, Finance Minister Sitharaman reduced the effective corporate tax rates to 25.17 percent (inclusive of all cess and surcharges) from 30 percent for all domestic companies.
The development comes as the automobile industry suffers from a slowdown, caused by several factors like high GST rates, farm distress, stagnant wages and liquidity constraints.
The industry's sales and production levels have dramatically plunged, leading to job losses. In August, all major OEMs consisting of passenger, commercial, two- and three-wheeler manufacturers have reported a massive decline in domestic sales.
As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers' August sales figures, the overall sectoral offtake in the domestic market has plunged 23.55 per cent to 1,821,490 units, from 2,382,436 units sold during the corresponding month of the previous year.
Moreover, the industry has estimated that around 15,000 contractual manufacturing jobs have been lost and another million are at risk, if the slowdown is not reversed.

Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd., India’s largest hospital chain, is considering passing on the proceeds of corporate tax cuts announced last week to its shareholders, according to people familiar with the matter.
Apollo may also use some of its tax savings to pay down debt and invest in the business, which operates 71 hospitals throughout India, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing internal matters. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government pared the corporate tax rate to 22% from 30%, as it tries to ignite an economy growing at the slowest pace in six years.
The people familiar with these plans didn’t elaborate on how Apollo will deliver the proceeds to investors, whether by paying dividends or through a buyback.
Apollo’s moves to return tax savings to shareholders would be a further boost after a surge in the stock price this year as the company pivots away from multi-year investments to build new hospitals to focusing on increasing profitability. The biggest beneficiaries would be Apollo’s founders and largest shareholders, the Reddy family, who have been selling assets to pay down their own debt and trying to lower the amount of shares pledged as collateral with lenders.
An Apollo spokesman declined to comment on how the firm intends to use this unexpected windfall. Apollo’s effective tax rate last year was 46%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Other companies are employing this tax saving in different ways.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, India’s biggest carmaker, said Sept. 25 that it’ll cut prices of some car models by 5,000 rupees ($71) to pass on the tax cut benefit. Bajaj Auto Ltd. said the extra money will defray costs and boost its ability to invest in technology, as the sector fights a sales slump that’s near two-decade low.
Apollo Hospitals is led by its octogenarian founder Prathap C. Reddy, and his four daughters, who share the roles of chairman and managing director between them.
The company and the family sold off their stakes in a health insurance venture earlier this year. This month, the founding family sold Apollo shares amounting to 3.6% of the company, bringing their stake down to 30.8%.
With these transactions, the family’s pledged ratio of shares should decline to 20% by the end of October from 76% currently, Apollo told the exchanges in a Sept.12 filing.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had recently reduced the effective corporate tax rates to 22% from 30% for all domestic companies. Maruti is seen as passing on the benefits to consumers.
Besides the price cut, Maruti is also having various promotional offers varying from  ₹40,000 to  ₹1 lakh on different models. It had earlier said that it is optimistic that the price reduction will bring down the cost of acquisition, especially for entry-level customers. ""This announcement around the festival season will help boost customer sentiment and revive the market to create demand,"" Maruti had earlier said in a press release.
Last month, Sitharaman had announced several measures to rescue the auto sector, including lifting a ban on purchase of vehicles by government departments, and allowing additional 15% depreciation on vehicles bought till March 2020 among others.
The auto industry has been demanding GST rate cuts as domestic car sales were down 41% to 115,957 units last month."
80,2019-09-28,Maruti,"The govt had on 20 Sep reduced corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% to boost consumer demandThe festival season is critical for automakers as it comprises about a third of total annual vehicle sales

Hyundai Motor India Ltd—the country’s second largest vehicle manufacturer—is exploring ways to pass on the benefit of the corporate tax reduction to potential customers.
Although customers are expected to flock to the showrooms during the festive month of October, the company has decided to increase discounts on four models—the Santro, Creta, Elite i20 and Grand i10—that kicked in on 21 September.
According to automobile manufacturers and dealers, customers stayed away from showrooms in September, expecting a reduction on the goods and services tax rate levied on passenger vehicles.
The country’s largest vehicle manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd on Wednesday reduced the price of select entry level offerings and diesel variants of different products by  ₹5,000.
According to Vikas Jain, national sales head, Hyundai Motor India, after 20 September, enquiries from potential customers increased sharply and bookings of some of the vehicles rose by almost 50%. As Navratri and Diwali both fall in October this year, sales of vehicles could be better than the preceding months.
“The tax reduction will definitely help us in improving the cash flow. Now, we need to decide what to do with this additional money. We have to look at other factors too since last fiscal we made profit but this fiscal depending on how much utilization of capacity has happened, there has been a volume loss plus the offers have gone up (a decision will have to be taken). There is an investment required on BS-IV to BS-VI and with lower tax rate, we can use this money for capex and thereby reduce the price gap between a BS-VI and BS-IV products,"" added Jain.
Sales of automobiles, especially passenger vehicles, have been declining since July 2018, as banks became cautious about lending to customers and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), in the aftermath of the bankruptcy of IL&FS and an increase in overall costs of vehicles due to the introduction of new safety norms.
The festival season is critical for automakers as cars account for about a third of annual vehicle sales.
With the automotive industry bearing its worst sales slump, Hyundai, Maruti and other automakers have unveiled their highest ever discounts and other offers to attract consumers.
“(Festive season sales) should be better than the previous months but compared to last year we still need to wait and watch. Still, too early to comment on the overall festive period. October has both Dussehra and Diwali, so it should be a positive. From 21 September, we see definite improvement in consumer sentiment. It is a positive and significant change. At least, there is a recovery path which is visible now,"" added Jain.
To revive consumption demand in the domestic market, the government had on 20 September reduced corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% to boost consumer demand and increase spending by private companies. The effective tax to be paid by the companies, including surcharge and cess, will be 25.17%.
Earlier, the Union government also mandated its departments to buy new vehicles to increase demand and also assured potential customers that BS-IV vehicles will be allowed to run for its entire registration period.
Mint on 24 September reported that Hyundai is aiming to maintain 20% increase in passenger vehicle exports from India in this fiscal year to compensate for the loss in the domestic market."
79,2019-09-30,Maruti,"Analysts expect a dull or muted festive season in terms of auto and retail sector this yearWith early festive demand traction not very encouraging, dealers are hopeful for better traction over the next 2-3 months

Mumbai: Poor demand from Indian consumers could dampen the mood during festivals next month, especially for automobile makers and retailers that count on the season for a sales boost, analysts predict.
Indians typically buy everything from new cars to shoes for themselves and as gifts during celebrations steeped in religion and tradition. Yet the slowest economic growth in six years, unemployment at a 45-year high and tepid private consumption may see sales fall short of recent years, even after the government’s $20 billion tax break to companies earlier this month.
“You can make the product 50% cheaper, but there has to be income to spend,"" said Nitin Gupta, an analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “In the short-term, I don’t see any kind of an income boost. Rather than giving cash to individuals, they have given it to companies.""
Car sales in August fell the most on record and Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. Friday reduced the price on its Baleno RS model by  ₹100,000 ($1,420) to pass on the benefit from the tax cut. Market researcher Nielsen has lowered its 2019 growth estimate for fast-moving goods to 9%-10% from 11%-12%, while a stock gauge of consumer discretionary firms is set for its first annual back-to-back losses since at least 2005.
Even so, the industry’s fortunes beyond the approaching festival season are poised to improve, according to BNP Paribas SA. Plentiful rainfall seen this monsoon season and cash handouts to farmers will help lift rural incomes, helping sales of staples recover in the second half of the year that began April 1, the brokerage said in a recent report.

Maruti Suzuki India ltd, the country’s largest vehicle manufacturer, on Monday launched its new entry-level hatchback S-Presso, at a price range of  ₹3.69 lakh to  ₹4.91 lakh. With muted sales over the last one year, the company will bank on the new product to revive its fortunes during the festival period and beyond.
The S-Presso is the first entry-level hatchback from Maruti after the launch of Celerio in 2014. Maruti will also export this product to countries such as South Africa, Sri Lanka and the ones in the ASEAN and Latin American region. The company has invested  ₹640 crore for developing the product.
According to Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director, Maruti Suzuki, mini sport utility vehicle, S-Presso has been designed, developed and validated using Suzuki’s global development processes. While working with counterparts in SMC, Japan, engineers from Maruti Suzuki worked on this car.
The new offering from Maruti is powered by the BS6 compliant, one-litre petrol engine and will be sold from the company’s Arena set of dealership.
“We believe that the current turbulent times are a short-term challenge and continue to have confidence in India’s long-term growth story. We realized that the entry-level compact segment needs a fresh design language. One that is bold, confident and dynamic. Our engineers and designers have created this new Mini SUV that carries the attributes desired by today’s customer,"" according to Ayukawa.
Domestic sales of passenger vehicles had plunged 31.6% to 196,524 units in August from a year earlier, according to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
This was the tenth straight drop in domestic passenger vehicle sales and the worst since Siam began compiling monthly sales data in 1997-98. Passenger vehicle sales have been declining since July 2018.
Maruti’s domestic wholesales in August fell 36% year-on-year to 94,728 units. This was the third time since July 2017 that the firm dispatched fewer than 100,000 vehicles to its dealerships in a particular month."

Wholesale dispatches of vehicles across categories continued to plunge in September, as manufacturers feared subdued retail sales amid a slowing economy and an inventory pileup with dealers.
On a sequential basis, though, factory dispatches of passenger vehicles improved, as companies expected sales to increase during the festive month of October.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest passenger vehicle manufacturer, witnessed 26.7% year-on-year (y-o-y) drop in dispatches to 112,500 units, while Hyundai Motor India Ltd reported 14.8% fall to 40,705 units, despite a healthy response for its first compact sport utility vehicle, the Venue, launched in May.
Another leading manufacturer, Tata Motors Ltd, reported a massive 56% decline in dispatches to 8,097 units, while Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) saw volumes dip by 33% to 14,333 units from the year-ago period. Japanese manufacturer Honda Cars India Ltd reported 37.2% fall in dispatches to 9,301 units.
However, with significant discounts, carmakers expect better festive period sales than last year, considering that both Navaratri and Diwali fall in October. Festival sales make up one-third of total vehicles sales in a fiscal year.
Last year’s festive season sales were the worst in five years, in the aftermath of the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services bankruptcy, when banks tightened credit disbursal norms, and non-banking financial companies stopped lending due to lack of liquidity.
In July and August, Maruti Suzuki’s factory dispatches fell below the 100,000-unit mark as the company cut production and wholesales to dealers. In September, the company dispatched 112,500 units to dealers. Hyundai also touched the 40,000-unit mark in September after slipping to 38,205 units in August. This trend is visible in the wholesales of most of four- and two-wheeler manufacturers.
According to Rajesh Goel, senior vice president and director, sales and marketing, Honda Cars India, the market was tough in September, but auto sales saw an uptick from August, which was a positive sign. “We hope the consumer sentiment further improves during the ongoing festive season, and helps the sales momentum. There are attractive offers available in the market, which make this as the best time for customers to buy new cars,"" said Goel.
“We are positive that this festive season, with the onset of Navratri, will augur well for us and the automotive industry. This, in addition to a good monsoon and recently announced positive government initiatives should help revive the industry in the short term,"" said Vijay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, M&M.
Prolonged sluggishness in the economy and an increase in freight-carrying capacity of trucks following new axle-load norms continue to pull down commercial vehicle (CV) sales. Tata Motors, India’s largest CV manufacturer, reported 47% y-o-y drop in sales to 24,279 units, while sales of Ashok Leyland dropped by 57% to 7,581 units.
Two-wheeler makers increased dispatches in September, expecting a sales recovery, but witnessed double-digit fall. Hero MotoCorp, for instance, reported 20.4% y-o-y drop in sales to 612,204 units, while Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India Ltd saw 12.3% decline in sales to 455,892 units.

NEW DELHI :
Major automobile makers, including Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, Toyota and Honda, on Tuesday reported double digit declines in domestic passenger vehicle sales in September as onset of the festive season failed to lift the ongoing slump in the auto industry.
The country's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India said its domestic sales declined by 26.7% at 1,12,500 units last month as against 1,53,550 units in September 2018.
Sales of mini cars comprising Alto and WagonR stood at 20,085 units as compared to 34,971 units in the same month last year, down 42.6%.

Reflecting on the sales performance, M&M Chief of Sales and Marketing, Automotive Division, Veejay Ram Nakra said, ""We are positive that this festive season, with the onset of Navratra, will augur well for us and the automotive industry.""
This, in addition to factors such as the good monsoon and recently announced positive government initiatives should help revive the industry in the short term, he added.
Toyota Kirloskar Motor's (TKM) domestic sales were at 10,203 units last month as compared to 12,512 units in September 2018, a decline of 18 per cent.
Commenting on the sales performance, TKM Deputy Managing Director N Raja said, ""The consumer sentiment continued to be subdued in September which has reflected in the sales slowdown in the industry.""
However, the company expects consumer demand will see the much-needed revival resulting in better retails due to Navratri and Diwali, Raja added.

74,2019-10-01,Maruti,"Ford will transfer its entire business in India, barring an engine plant in Sanand, and its Chennai-based Global Business Services unit, to a new JV firm controlled by M&MThe Mahindra will own 51% in the new entity while the remainder will be held by Ford

Mumbai: Ford Motor Co. will cede control of most of its India operations to Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), underscoring the US company’s long-drawn struggles to make a bigger dent in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market.
Ford will transfer its entire business in India, barring an engine plant in Sanand, Gujarat, and its Chennai-based Global Business Services unit, to a new joint venture company controlled by M&M. The Indian automaker will own 51% in the new entity while the remainder will be held by Ford.
M&M will invest  ₹657 crore in the JV, which has a likely equity value of  ₹1,289 crore. M&M will induct all of Ford’s India based employees and vehicle plants located in Sanand and Chennai, subject to regulatory approvals.
The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-2020, after which the JV will become operational, according to a joint statement issued by the two companies.
The step highlights Ford’s prolonged battle to effectively compete with new and existing players in India. Despite entering the country more than two decades ago, Ford has struggled to challenge Japanese and South Korean automakers in India. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor India Ltd are the top two carmakers in the country. Ford’s native rival, General Motors, which too entered India about two decades ago, stopped selling vehicles here by 2017-end.
Ford’s move is aligned with its global strategy to mitigate risks by withdrawing from tough markets where it has failed to successfully grow profits over time. In June, Ford said it would restructure its European operations, shutting several production units and laying off about 12,000 people by 2020-end.
“We live in an increasingly complex world. The auto industry is disrupted by several incoming trends, new business models and customer buying patterns are ever changing. I don’t think any one company can address all those areas on its own. We aren’t rushing into partnerships. They have to be the right ones for us,"" said Bill Ford, executive chairman, Ford through video conferencing from Michigan.
The JV, Ardour Automotive Pvt. Ltd, was incorporated on 26 August as a wholly-owned unit of Ford. Prior to the investment in Ardour, M&M will buy the automotive business of Ford India Pvt. Ltd barring the engine plant in Sanand.
In a joint news conference in Mumbai, Ford and M&M said the JV will be operationally managed by M&M and that the board would comprise an equal number of nominees from both companies. The chairman would, however, be nominated by M&M.
While the JV will produce cars for Ford to be sold in the domestic as well as export markets under the Ford brand, existing dealers of Ford and M&M would continue to operate independently. Ford, however, said it would not look at a large expansion of its dealer network in India in the future.
Pawan Goenka, managing director, M&M said the sales and marketing teams of both the companies will remain independent.
Under the new JV, both companies would jointly work on common product platforms with a focus on utility vehicles (UVs), an area of strength for M&M, as well as cooperate on the development of electric vehicles, an area where Ford has access to advanced technologies. The JV expects to introduce three new UVs under the Ford brand starting with a new mid-sized sport-utility vehicle, which will share the vehicle platform and engine with M&M. Ford meanwhile would look to put a check on its costs by capitalizing on M&M’s wide network of local vendors, product development capabilities and economies of large-scale production.
Meanwhile, M&M said the JV with Ford will give it access to its global distribution network in emerging markets, thereby developing them to boost export business from India. “For M&M, export business accounts for about 7-8%,"" said Goenka.
“No matter how large a company is, everyone is looking at partnerships in the world for better future,"" said Anand Mahindra, chairman, Mahindra Group.
Jim Hackett, Ford president and CEO, said India will play a big role in providing computing, software and other key elements involved in technologies such as connectivity and urban mobility to Ford’s global product development.
“While Ford is looking to mitigate risks globally, the joint venture augurs well for M&M as the home-grown company gets access to Ford’s quality and design strengths to make headway into several global markets,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, LVP forecasting, IHS Markit. “However, in the future, once the Indian market will become stable on suitable powertrain technologies, we expect US-based carmakers such as GM and Ford will relook at India for growth. Expect this to happen in the long run."""

72,2019-10-06,Maruti,"Consumers care about EVs, the excitement is there but that stops the moment we tell them the price, FADA vice president Vinkesh Gulati saidThere is a lack of charging infrastructure, a reluctance by banks to finance purchases and an unwillingness among govt departments to use EVs as directed

NEW DELHI :
Hyundai Motor Co. launched India’s first electric SUV this summer with a quirky TV commercial urging millennials to “Drive Into the Future."" A few months later, the automaker finds itself on a lonesome road.
In a nation of about 150 million drivers, only 130 Kona SUVs were sold to dealers through August. That slow pace is emblematic of the difficulties carmakers face in establishing an electric foothold in the fourth-biggest auto market, even with committed government support.
The Kona sells for about $35,000 while the average Indian earns about $2,000 a year — and the best-selling gas guzzler costs $4,000. Yet Kona’s sticker price only kicks off the conversation about why EVs aren’t gaining traction in India —there’s also a lack of charging infrastructure, a reluctance by banks to finance purchases and an unwillingness among government departments to use EVs as directed.
Barely more than 8,000 EVs were sold locally during the past six years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. China sells more than that in two days, according to BloombergNEF projections.
“The affordability of electric cars in India is just not there,"" said R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., maker of the sales leader Alto. “I don’t think the government or the car companies expect that in the next two to three years there will be any real buying of electric vehicles.""
The segment still isn’t making meaningful strides more than four years after the government started promoting cleaner vehicles for one of the world’s most-polluted countries. In February, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration committed to spending $1.4 billion on subsidies, infrastructure and publicity.
The potential of India’s EV market can’t be ignored. There are only 27 cars for every 1,000 Indians, compared with 570 for the same number of Germans, giving global automakers an opportunity to challenge the dominance of Maruti –- the unit of Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp. that sells every other car on local roads.
Maruti’s not introducing its first EV until next year. Tata Motors Ltd. and Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. build some base-level electric cars, yet they have a limited range or are exclusively for government use. The Kona gives Hyundai a first-mover advantage in a market where EVs may comprise 28% of new vehicle sales by 2040, according to BNEF.
Not only Hyundai sees opportunity in Asia’s third-largest economy. MG Motor, the iconic British carmaker owned by China’s SAIC Motor Corp., and Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. see EVs as a way to expand in the country.
“Somebody has to take the leadership, and it will trickle down,"" said Rajeev Chaba, managing director of MG Motor India, which plans to launch an electric SUV by December.
The process of scaling up will be slow, and MG Motors would be satisfied selling 100 cars a month initially.
“We have to start somewhere,"" Chaba said.
Right now, though, consumers pass over electric cars for bigger, longer-range and cheaper gas guzzlers, said Vinkesh Gulati, vice president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, which represents more than 80% of automobile dealers in India.
More than half of the passenger vehicles sold in India last year cost $8,000 or less, according to BNEF. Electric cars won’t achieve price parity with gasoline-powered cars until the early 2030s, BNEF said.
“Consumers care about EVs, the excitement is there,"" Gulati said. “But that stops the moment we tell them the price.""
Yet even for those who can afford the Kona, plugging in is problematic. Nidhi Maheshwary, a 40-year-old finance professional working near New Delhi, wanted to buy an EV to show her children an example of environmental responsibility.
So when Hyundai launched the Kona, Maheshwary ordered one. Sounds easy, but it didn’t turn out that way.
Almost immediately, she got into a spat with neighbors about charging the SUV in her apartment building’s basement lot. The residents’ society said it posed a fire risk -– even though Hyundai engineers and the fire department said it was safe.
So Maheshwary charges the car at her office while weighing potential recourse against those neighbors. Hyundai offers two small chargers with the Kona, although it can take as many as 19 hours to fill up the vehicle.
India had an estimated 650 charging stations for cars and SUVs in 2018, according to BNEF. China, the largest market for EVs, has about 456,000 charging points, official data shows.
India’s sparse charging infrastructure stems from locals’ chicken-and-egg approach to the issue.
At a conference in New Delhi last month, government officials and EV-component makers debated whether to create adequate charging infrastructure to promote sales or whether to wait until there are enough EVs on the roads before building it out.
“We are pretty sure that people are going to like our EV, but we would have our challenges like infrastructure,"" Chaba said. “But we have our plans to handle that.""
Those include first requiring that the buyer can install a charger at home, he said.
But there’s another factor besides income that makes it difficult to pay for one of these cars. The unaffordability of EVs also stems from the unavailability of financing, said Pranavant P., a partner at Deloitte India focusing on the future of mobility.
Until there’s an established secondary market for EVs, banks and other institutions are hesitant to extend purchasing loans, he said. A majority of Indian vehicle sales are financed by lenders.
The government, both federal and local, will have to offer help for EVs to be adopted in the mass market, said Puneet Anand, group head of marketing at Hyundai Motor India. Modi’s budget in July included incentives such as reduced taxes, income tax benefits and import duty exemptions for certain EV parts.
The first beneficiaries will be the ubiquitous scooters and motorcycles -- with subsidies meaning to support sales of 1 million two-wheelers, compared with 55,000 electric cars.
Yet the government still needs to practice what it’s preaching. Energy Efficiency Services Ltd., a joint venture of state-run companies responsible for replacing state vehicles with EVs, awarded its first tender in September 2017 for 10,000 cars.
But as of July, agencies had accepted only 1,000 of them. Now EESL is offering the vehicles to taxi companies.
None of that helps Devdas Nair, a 34-year-old advertising professional in New Delhi looking for new wheels. He wants to try an EV and says he’d pay somewhat more to help the environment and for future savings. Yet for him right now, it’s too much of a gamble.
“I was excited about the Kona, but the price tag is just too much,"" he said. “We don’t even know how the charging infrastructure is going to be in India. That makes me rethink -- actually not think about it at all."

NEW DELHI :
Suzuki Motor Corp.—the parent of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd—has cut its earnings estimates for this fiscal year, hammered by a production loss in Japan and a sharp slowdown in sales in its single-biggest market of India.
The company, led by Osamu Suzuki, has revised downwards its net sales forecast by 10.3% to 3,500 billion yen. Operating income—a measure of a company’s operational profitability—has been lowered by 39.4% to 200 billion yen. Suzuki also revised downwards its net profit guidance by 30% to 140 billion yen.
Suzuki has been facing trouble in its home country, Japan, for flouting vehicle inspection norms, while its most profitable unit, Maruti Suzuki, is facing its worst sales performance in almost two decades in India. This has led Japan’s fourth-largest vehicle maker to cut revenue and profit forecasts.
“The company hereby revises the consolidated business forecast due to decrease in Japan production in the course of restructuring final inspection scheme, slowdown in Indian automobile market, and exchange rate fluctuations,"" Suzuki informed the Tokyo Stock Exchange on Thursday.
Suzuki said it will “explain the details of the announcement"" when it reveals the September quarter results on 5 November.
According to Nippon.com, on 18 April 2019, Suzuki informed Japan’s transport ministry on its decision to recall around 2.02 million vehicles, made in Japan between May 2015 and February 2019, for not complying with the safety standards in the country.
Toshihiro Suzuki, Suzuki’s president earlier said the company might have to take a hit of 80 billion yen due to the vehicle recall that includes 17 models.
“This announcement by Suzuki is in line with our expectations since contribution from India unit will come down due to decline in sales. Hence royalty payments will also decline. In Japan, the vehicle recall exercise is also expected to affect the company adversely,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage who declined to be named. “Maruti contributes almost 60% of Suzuki’s volumes and in terms of bottomline, contribution is even more.""
Maruti Suzuki’s sales in the fiscal first half fell 27% year-on-year to 908,801 units, prompting the company to lower production for eight consecutive months until September 2019. In the March quarter, Suzuki’s share from India operations fell to 298.8 billion yen from 348.4 billion yen a year earlier."
68,2019-10-12,Maruti,"MG Motor India has delivered little more than 6,000 units since the Hector’s launch in the last week of JuneIt currently has more than 30,000 pending bookings for the Hector SUV

Grappling with challenges around its supply chain and production ramp up of its first car in the domestic market, the Hector, a sports utility vehicle (SUV), MG Motor India Pvt Ltd said that it is still evaluating the start of production of its BS VI compliant SUV.
Speaking to Mint on the sidelines of the opening of its first flagship showroom in South Mumbai on October 10, Gaurav Gupta, chief commercial officer, MG Motor India said, “We do have customer bookings to cater to and we are continuously reviewing our manufacturing plans. We are still evaluating the production schedules for BSVI compliant Hector as we are yet to take a decision on that.""
The company said for now it is working to streamline its supply chain to be able to start off the second shift at its Halol-based manufacturing unit from November. “The priority is to keep the increasing wait list for customers in check,"" said Gupta.
The SAIC Motor Corp Ltd-owned carmaker claims that its current order book has more than 30,000 pending bookings for the Hector SUV. It has delivered little more than 6,000 units since the Hector’s launch in the last week of June.
Gupta said the second shift would grow the carmaker’s monthly manufacturing capacity from 2,500 units to up to 3,500 units. Although MG Motor says that the average waiting period is 3-4 months, the company-claimed numbers suggest otherwise.
The carmaker, which claims to be working to localize the Hector up to 75%, has been struggling to procure critical components that are imported from its global suppliers. Although MG Motor remains tightlipped on the matter, sources have suggested that the suppliers could not ramp up parts supplies in tandem with the initial booking numbers conveyed by the carmaker, thereby leading to serious supply chain issues.
“We have been talking to the suppliers in the backend because they have to increase their supplies. Some of our suppliers are global as some of them are based in Europe. Even as they expand their operations, this has to be supported with hiring of new workforce on ground for training. Once we got that clarity and assurance that we will be able to expand on time, we reopened bookings again,"" clarified Gupta.
Meanwhile, several carmakers have started preparing for the production of BS VI compliant models. Maruti Suzuki is leading the pack with eight BS VI compliant models already retailing at its showrooms. Other carmakers including Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors have already drawn their respective production schedules for BS VI compliant cars and SUVs.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit said, “MG Motor India should launch the BS VI compliant Hector by February next year as they are in the best position right now with ample bookings at hand and good demand for the Hector SUV. Most carmakers are moving to BS VI from Dec-Jan period and some of them have already moved lion’s share of their portfolio to BS VI. MG Motor will have to start rolling out BS VI models not later than February.""
MG Motor India also plans to unveil its first electric car eZS in India in December later this year and start retails from January 2020. The MG eZS, a compact SUV, will be imported via completely knocked down (CKD) route and will be assembled at its Halol plant."

New Delhi: Consumer offers on cars during the festive season have reached a peak and it will go down going forward as keeping discounts at such high levels is unsustainable, a senior Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) official has said.
The company, which is offering cash discounts and extended warranties on various models, witnessed its sales jump by 18-20% last month as compared with July and August.
""We clearly tried to revive the market but we cannot have high level of promotions at all the time, these are not sustainable. So, going forward there will be decline in terms of offers,"" MSI Executive Director, Marketing and Sales Shashank Srivastava told PTI.
The company also expects current month to be better in terms of sales as compared with the same period last year.
""These are probably the green shoots and if we look at first week of October, which was Navratara period, then bookings and retails have been better than last year as far as Navratra period goes,"" Srivastava said.
Offtake of vehicles, including diesel models and BS-VI compliant eight cars, has been good and driving the sales, he added.
Besides, the recently launched model S-Presso has garnered over 10,000 bookings, Srivastava noted.
The company has already stopped production of BS-IV cars for the models in which BS-VI has been introduced, he added.
For the rest of the models, the decision to cease BS-IV production will be taken keeping in mind the inventory levels, Srivastava said.
He, however, added that it would be too early to say that the auto sector is out of the woods and it would take at least two more months to get a clear picture.
""We have to see that in absence of this stimuli (promotions) whether there is an upturn or not. That I think will be evident in the next few months then we will be able to make more definitive statements about the change in fortunes of auto industry,"" Srivastava said.
Counting on the positives, he added that the demand from rural markets is set to improve with better monsoon and expectations of a good crop.
Besides, plans to launch petrol versions of Vitara Brezza and S-Cross should give boost to company's sales as there is already a shift from diesel to petrol in all segments of the market, Srivastava said.
He did not elaborate on the exact launch dates of two cars, but said that ""it will definitely happen during this fiscal."" Currently, the company offers both the models with 1.3 litre diesel powertrains.
MSI has already stated that it will stop selling models with diesel engines from April 1 next year."

64,2019-10-14,Maruti,"To cope with the industry slowdown, Maruti has cut production for eight consecutive months to SepThe Suzuki Motor Corp. unit is betting on the S-Presso to regain its 50% share of the local market

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd plans to sell 110,000 to 120,000 units of its latest offering S-Presso—an entry-level hatchback—in the domestic market over the next one year, according to an internal projection prepared by senior executives of the country’s largest carmaker.
The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit is betting on the S-Presso to regain its 50% share of the local market at a time when its sales are under strain because of an overall industry slowdown and new product introductions by rivals, said three people directly aware of the development.
Maruti Suzuki has witnessed a sharp reduction in wholesales, or industry dispatches, this fiscal through March. This led to a fall in its market share to 49.76% in the fiscal first half from 52.1% a year earlier.
The entry of Hyundai Motor India Ltd, the second-largest car maker, in the compact sport-utility vehicle segment with the Venue model and diminishing consumer preference for diesel engine products, has added to Maruti’s woes. Competition has also intensified for the company in the sedan as well as the multi-purpose vehicle segments.
The maker of the Alto and Wagon R models is now pinning hopes on the S-Presso to stage a recovery by drawing more customers in the entry-level small car segment, considered a bastion for Maruti in the past three decades.
The S-Presso would not only compete with small car models of Maruti but also of Hyundai Motor India, Renault SA and Tata Motors Ltd.
The first person cited above said the target set by the company is achievable despite the current industry downturn as Maruti is the preferred option for buyers in this segment, and the company can also tap its wide sales and service network.
“On the production side as well, the company is starting with a monthly production in the range of 10,000-11,000 units per month during the initial months which may be increased to 12,000-13,000 units in January depending on the demand and then will be reduced to 10,000 units in March,"" the person said. “The company also expects a significant part of its first-time customers to prefer the S-Presso over the Alto family.""
Maruti Suzuki did not respond to emailed queries sent on 10 October.
The company has so far announced that it has received orders for 10,000 S-Presso cars in the first eight days of launch.
Puneet Gupta, associate director, vehicle sales forecasting at IHS Markit, said the S-Presso has several features and can be the choice of young families from smaller cities.
“Maruti Suzuki’s entry into the mini car segment with S-Presso will help the company regain its market share which it has been losing in the last few months. We feel mini car segment will be game-changer in the coming days as liquidity crisis had impacted vehicle sales and customers are cautious while spending the money and sticking to lower variants or lower product range,"" Gupta said.
To cope with the industry slowdown, Maruti has cut production for eight consecutive months to September.
The company’s wholesale dispatches fell 27% year-on-year to 663,522 units in the fiscal first half. Maruti’s wholesales fell as much as 53% in the entry-level hatchback segment.
“The S-Presso is the best bet for the company at the moment since the next year is likely to be tough. Also, Maruti does not have any new products in the near future. So, they will try to push this product as much as possible,"" said the second person cited above."

Axis Mutual Fund is looking at one of India’s most beaten-down sectors -- the auto industry -- to help keep it in the top ranks of the nation’s asset managers. The investor is slowly increasing exposure to select companies as it sees “some signs"" of demand revival with a better-than-expected monsoon and lower corporate tax rates supporting sentiment.
“We are adding auto to our portfolio,"" Jinesh Gopani, head of equity for Axis Asset Management Co., overseeing about  ₹57,000 crore ($8 billion) of assets, said in an interview on Friday. “In another two years, the sector could come back.""
The S&P BSE Auto Index has declined 14% so far this year. That’s the second-worst performance among 19 sector sub-indexes compiled by BSE Ltd. Passenger car sales plunged 33% in September from a year earlier, down for an 11th consecutive month, industry data showed earlier this month.
Axis prides itself on investing for the longer term, and its biggest fund, Axis Long Term Equity Fund, offered a return of 20% over the past year, beating 92 percentile of its peers. Over five years, the returns are 14%, higher than 96 percentile.

60,2019-10-23,Maruti,"Competition, new norms to make things difficult ahead, says Suzuki presidentMaruti Suzuki has seen a sharp fall in factory dispatches this fiscal year through March

TOKYO :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, the country’s largest carmaker, will face challenges in defending its control of half of the domestic market over the next decade because of various industry disruptions and intensifying competition, said a top executive at its parent Suzuki Motor Corp.
In addition to subdued sales amid an economic slowdown, the entry of Hyundai Motor India Ltd, the second-largest carmaker, in the compact sport-utility vehicle segment with the Venue model and diminishing consumer preference for diesel engine products, has hit Maruti’s sales and financials in the past year.
Going forward, new emission, safety and fuel efficiency related regulations will make cars more expensive, which is likely to have an adverse impact on vehicle sales in India.
“It’s a challenge. Globally, one company has never been able to get 50% share in one country. The Indian market is very special to us and we will try to keep the 50% share, but there are varied challenges. General Motors in the US has around 16% market share and same is the case with Volkswagen in Europe. But I will try to keep the 50% market share (in India),"" Toshihiro Suzuki, president, Suzuki told reporters on the sidelines of the Tokyo Motor Show.
Osamu Suzuki, chairman of Suzuki, had in July last year announced the company’s aim to hold on to its 50% market share in India and sell five million cars by 2030, assuming the total size of the Indian passenger vehicle market at around 10 million vehicles annually.
Maruti Suzuki has witnessed a sharp fall in wholesales, or factory dispatches, this fiscal year through March. This led to a decline in its market share to 49.76% in the fiscal first half from 52.1% a year earlier.
Wholesale dispatches fell 27% year-on-year to 663,522 units in the April to September period. Consequently, the company reduced production for eight consecutive months until September.
Maruti’s financial well-being is essential for Suzuki, since the Indian unit contributes more than 50% of the parent’s revenue and net profit.
Recently, the Hamamatsu-based company cut its net sales forecast by 10.3% to 3,500 billion yen and net profit guidance by 30% to 140 billion yen, for the current fiscal year, on account of production loss in Japan and a sharp slowdown in sales in its single-biggest market of India.
Suzuki said the Indian market is posing tough conditions currently but is expected to recover shortly. He, however, sounded apprehensive on the possibility of adoption of electric vehicles in India in the near future.
“For electrification of vehicles, conditions in Indian market are tough because electric power supply is not in a good condition in India,"" he said, referring to insufficient and erratic power supply across the country. “Hybrid is a good solution for the Indian market.""
Wholesale dispatches of passenger vehicles slumped 24% year-on-year in September, the eleventh straight month of such decline, reflecting the slowdown in the wider economy.

58,2019-10-24,Maruti,"India’s largest carmaker has recorded maximum year-on-year (YoY) decline in the small car segment for the quarter ended September 2019Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is expected to report one of its toughest quarters later today

Hit by subdued demand in the Indian passenger car market and resultant production cuts to correct inventory levels across dealer network, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is expected to report earnings of one of its toughest quarters later on Thursday.
According to ICICI Securities, Maruti Suzuki’s July-September revenue is expected to decline about 27% year-on-year (YoY), while EBIDTA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) is likely to contract about 58% on negative operating leverage, lower gross margins, weaker mix and higher variable expenses. The brokerage also expects Maruti’s profit after tax (PAT) to decline about 53% YoY. Profit could have declined further but for higher other income--up 76% YoY at  ₹7.4 bln--and lower tax rates.
Motilal Oswal Securities also expects a 27% YoY decline in revenue, and 60% fall in adjusted PAT in Maruti’s Q2 results.
India’s largest carmaker recorded its worst YoY decline in sales in the small car segment in the quarter ended September. During the period, it reported a 62% YoY decline in wholesales in the mini car category, which comprises the most affordable Alto. Besides indicative of weak demand for its basic models, Maruti’s strongest portfolio, this also underlines fast changing consumer preferences in tier one and tier two cities.
Maruti Suzuki had also reported a substantial 23% YoY decline in its compact car wholesales in Q2, leading to 33% fall in its total domestic passenger car sales. The company sells models such as the new Wagon R, Ignis, Baleno, Swift, Dzire, and Celerio in the compact car segment. Its total domestic passenger car sales stood at 3,00,105 units in Q2FY20 compared with 4,49,834 units in the year-ago period.
In the past quarter, the company launched two new cars – small car S-Presso and the six-seater, multipurpose XL6 at a starting price of  ₹3.69 lakh and  ₹9.79 lakh respectively (both ex-showroom Delhi).
On 25 September, over and above the usual promotional offers to boost sales during the festival season, Maruti had also announced a price cut for select cars - Alto, diesel variants of Swift, Baleno, Dzire etc - by  ₹5,000 to pass on the benefit of corporate tax reduction to its customers.
Key issues to watch out would be the company’s outlook on demand during Dhanteras and Diwali, channel inventory management, and trend on discounts."
56,2019-10-24,Maruti,"Net profit of  ₹1,358.6 crore was about 40% lower year-on-yearMaruti’s weak sales volumes in Q2FY20 that plummeted 30.2% yoy dragged net revenue down by 25.2% to  ₹16,985 crore

A decent show notwithstanding, shares of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd slid lower following its September quarter (Q2FY20) earnings announced on Thursday. The stock closed 0.7% lower at  ₹7,390.40.
Investors were quick to glean that higher other income and lower effective tax rate during the quarter helped soften the fall in net profit.
India’s largest carmaker on Thursday reported a 39.3% year-on-year decline in its net profit to  ₹1,359 crore for the September quarter, lower than the 50-60% decline forecast by analysts. The softer-than-estimated decline in the carmaker’s profit could be attributed to a 78% fall in tax expenditure and a 75% jump in other income.
The carmaker’s operating performance brought little cheer for investors despite being in-line with analysts’ estimate. Investors perhaps expected better, given the higher-than-estimated numbers posted by some two-wheeler companies earlier this week.
Maruti’s sales volumes in Q2FY20 slumped 30.2% on year, dragging revenue lower by 25.2% to Rs16,985 crore. Thankfully, an increase in price and 6-7% higher realisation per vehicle supported revenue.
That said, negative operating leverage dented profits. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) tanked 53%. Ebitda margin drop of 580 basis points to 9.5% did not appease investors even though it was in-line with the average of estimates of 20 brokerages polled by Bloomberg. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
While an uptick in sales was missing in the reporting quarter, costs including advertising and marketing, rose as a percentage to sales during the period. At the end of the day, discounts and incentives are needed to trim inventory amid stiff competition.
To be sure, Maruti is the largest car manufacturer in the country with the widest product range across customer segments. “The company’s strong product pipeline, success of new launches, leadership and strong management capability would help going forward,"" says Mitul Shah, vice-president-research, Reliance Securities Ltd.
Shares of the company had rallied on hope of a revival in demand during the festival season. However, the high dealer inventory does not inspire confidence of a revival in wholesale volumes at the company level and improvement in production of passenger cars in the near term."
57,2019-10-25,Maruti,"Automaker’s net profit declined 39.3% y-o-y to  ₹1,359 crore in Sep quarterFirm records its worst y-o-y decline in sales in the small car segment in the quarter

MUMBAI :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd posted a 39% year-on-year (y-o-y) drop in net profit to  ₹1,359 crore for the September quarter, the lowest profit in 15 quarters.
The decline was, however, softer than the 50-60% drop forecast by analysts. India’s largest carmaker had a year-earlier net profit of  ₹2,240 crore.
This could be because of reduced tax expenditure and higher non-operating income. Maruti Suzuki’s total tax expenses in Q2FY20 fell 78% from the year-earlier to  ₹213.4 crore.
“This is the result of the corporate tax cuts announced by the finance minister last month wherein Maruti Suzuki has adopted the new tax regime in Q2,"" said Mitul Shah, auto analyst, Reliance Securities.
Maruti Suzuki’s Q2FY20 revenue fell 25% y-o-y to  ₹16,120.4 crore—the lowest in the past 13 quarters—amid subdued demand.
Maruti Suzuki sold a total of 338,317 vehicles in the quarter, a 30% decline from the year earlier. Sales in the domestic market fell 31% to 312,519 units.
The carmaker recorded its worst y-o-y decline in sales in the small car segment in the quarter. Its mini car sales plunged 62% y-o-y while compact sales fell 23%. It sells models such as the new Wagon R, Ignis, Baleno, Swift, Dzire, and Celerio in the compact car segment.
The company said that while mini and compact cars comprised about 67% of its total domestic sales, utility vehicles accounted for almost 18%.
Maruti Suzuki’s market share in the SUV segment was dented by new models from rivals such as Hyundai Motor India Ltd’s Venue and Kia Motors’ Seltos models. To give a renewed push to the sales of its Vitara Brezza, the company plans to soon start selling a BS VI-compliant petrol variant of the compact SUV.
Meanwhile, the company reported an operating EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) of  ₹680.2 crore, down about 40% quarter-on-quarter. The operating EBIT stood at 4.2% of net sales in Q2FY20 as against 6% in Q1FY20.
Net profit margin, however, rose to 8.4% in the September quarter from 7.7% in the previous quarter due to higher fair value gains on invested surplus, cost reduction efforts, and lower advertisement expenses.
“The average discount for Q2FY20 stood at  ₹25,761 per vehicle as against  ₹18,758 per vehicle in Q2FY19,"" said Ajay Seth, chief financial officer, Maruti Suzuki. The company plans to roll back the discounts post the festive season.
In the past quarter, the company launched two new cars – small car S-Presso and the six-seater, multi-purpose XL6 at a starting price of  ₹3.69 lakh and  ₹9.79 lakh, respectively (both ex-showroom Delhi).
Shashank Srivastava, head, sales and marketing, Maruti, said the S-Presso has received more than 16,500 bookings averaging 750-800 bookings per day while the XL6 has been receiving about 6,000 bookings per month so far.
Srivastava said retail sales in October has been at par with that of last year and saw single-digit y-o-y growth during the Navratri and Dussehra period."
55,2019-10-25,Maruti,"The net profit was 40% lower. It was better than estimated due to higher other income and lower effective tax rateWeak demand precipitated a 30% year-on-year slump in vehicle sales, which resulted in a 25% drop in net sales

Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp. had on 10 October trimmed its FY20 earnings estimate by 30%, citing slowdown in India’s automobile market, besides lower production in Japan and exchange rate fluctuations. After all, its unit, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, contributes a bulk of the parent’s consolidated revenue and profit.
Maruti Suzuki’s dismal Q2FY20 results, albeit in-line with the watered-down forecasts of analysts, only underscore the parent’s pessimism. Weak demand precipitated a 30% year-on-year slump in vehicle sales, which resulted in a 25% drop in net sales.
Worse, whatever sales came in was on the back of the highest-ever average quarterly discount of  ₹25,761 per vehicle. It was way above the  ₹18,758 and  ₹16,941 per vehicle in Q2FY19 and Q1FY20, respectively. Despite the incentives, the company’s overall market share fell from 52.1% a year earlier to 49.8% in the three months ended September 2019.
Net realization per vehicle increased about 6% in the just-ended quarter. However, this was on the back of price hikes to offset a cost increase due to stricter safety and regulatory norms.
Some analysts said the worst could be behind. However, Maruti Suzuki’s chairman R.C. Bhargava said the auto market is still not out of the woods, and a revival will depend on demand over the next two-three months.
A sudden increase in the cost of ownership at a time of liquidity crunch in the retail segment hit sales last quarter.
The company’s costs, including advertising and marketing expenses, as a percentage to sales also rose during the quarter. Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) fell 53% to  ₹1,606 crore.
The Ebitda margin drop of 580 basis points to 9.5% failed to appease investors, even though it was in line with the average estimate of 20 brokers collated by Bloomberg.
The moot question is: Will Maruti Suzuki be able to regain lost market share? Time will tell if the market leader will have to cede some market share, or profits, or both, considering the ongoing shift in India’s auto market and rising competition.
Further, from an investor standpoint, the earnings traction over the next 12-18 months is questionable. Q2 FY20’s net profit was 40% lower. It was better than estimated due to higher other income and lower effective tax rate.
That said, a robust recovery in FY20 earnings cannot be expected, given that the parent has sharply trimmed its guidance.
In this context, the recent rally in Maruti Suzuki’s stock pegs the valuation at 27 times its one-year forward estimated earnings, which is expensive given the turbulence in the domestic auto market."
54,2019-10-28,Maruti,"In the Passenger Vehicle segment, market leader Maruti Suzuki India took a production cut of about 21%Domestic automobile industry's sales continued their downward trend in September with a 22% year-on-year decline

Mumbai (Maharashtra): Automobile retail sales are likely to pick up with an improvement in consumer sentiment during the ongoing festive season due to recent liquidity easing measures announced by the government and on back of favourable monsoons, according to India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra).
Consequently, inventory build-up at the dealer level in anticipation of increased demand during this period is likely to lead to increased wholesale billing by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) during October, it said.
""However, with existing high dealer inventory levels, production cuts by OEMs are likely to continue in the near-term,"" said Ind-Ra in the credit news digest on India's auto sector.
The report highlights trends in sub-segments of auto sector including passenger vehicles (PVs), commercial vehicles (CVs) and two-wheelers (2Ws) with a focus on sales volumes growth, market share movement, change in commodity prices and recent rating actions.
Domestic automobile industry's sales continued their downward trend in September with a 22% year-on-year decline on weak consumer sentiments owing to the slowing economy. Inventory at dealer level remained high, leading to most OEMs continuing to implement production cuts.
Over April to September, overall auto industry undertook a production cut of 13% year-on-year with 16%, 27% and 13% production cuts in PV, CV and 2W segments respectively.
In the PV segment, market leader Maruti Suzuki India took a production cut of about 21%. The average inventory for PVs increased marginally in September to 30 to 35 days from 25 to 30 days in August.
The average inventory for CVs decreased marginally in September to 50 to 55 days from 55 to 60 days in August. But the average inventory for 2W remained high at 60 to 65 days.
PV sales volume declined 24% on account of a 33% drop in the sales volume of cars. Cars sales volume continue to decline on weak consumer sentiments amid a slowdown in urban and rural household consumption, a rise in the cost of ownership and the growing preference of shared mobility over buying a car.
CV sales volume declined 39% in September owing to decreased industry demand on account of tight liquidity conditions amid slowed economic activity. 2W sales fell 22 per cent on weak rural and semi-urban demand.
In the PV segment, Maruti's market share dropped by around 3% to 49% in September on lower sales volumes, while Hyundai Motor India gained 2% market share. Tata Motors Ltd's CV market share dropped by around 5 per cent to 41% while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd gained 8% market share.
2W market leader Hero MotoCorp Ltd's market share increased by around 1% to 36% in September, said Ind-Ra in the news digest.

53,2019-10-30,Maruti,"Honda to  make a decision on the deal WednesdayThe combination would create a parts maker with about $16.5 billion in sales

Tokyo: Japan’s Honda Motor Co. and Hitachi Ltd. are discussing a merger of four of their car parts businesses, a combination that would create a business with almost $17 billion in annual sales at a time when automakers are increasingly seeking tie-ups to grapple with the shift to electric and autonomous vehicles.
Honda, the country’s second-biggest carmaker, will make a decision on the deal Wednesday, while Hitachi, which makes industrial equipment to appliances, said it will discuss the matter at a board meeting. The units to be combined include Hitachi Automotive Systems and Honda affiliates Keihin Corp., Showa Corp. and Nissin Kogyo Co., the Yomiuri newspaper reported earlier.
Japan’s largest carmaker after Toyota Motor Corp. is consolidating suppliers with one of the country’s biggest industrial conglomerates as global car demand slumps and automakers are struggling to adjust to the once-in-a-generation shift toward new technologies. Last month, Toyota boosted its stake in Subaru Corp., the latest tie-up among automakers as they face an uncertain future. At the same time, Hitachi has been been reshaping its group by selling off some non-core assets and merging in others.
The combination would create a parts maker with about 1.8 trillion yen ($16.5 billion) in sales, compared with Japan-based parts making giant Denso Corp., a Toyota affiliate that had sales of 5.3 trillion yen in the year ended March.
Hitachi Automotive Systems had sales of 971 billion yen in the year ended March, while Keihin, Nissin Kogyo and Showa combined had about 825.6 billion yen.
Investors rushed to trade the news, with shares of Nissin Kogyo, Keihin and Showa untraded as buy orders outnumbers sellers as of 9:51 a.m. in Tokyo. Hitachi Automotive Systems is privately held.
Consolidating the parts makers would give the companies scale and help them reduce their dependence on Honda as production shifts toward electric vehicles that require fewer components.
Nissin Kogyo and Showa count on Honda for more than half of their revenue, while also supplying carmakers including Suzuki Motor Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Keihin is more dependent on its affiliate, relying on Honda for 85% of sales, while also supplying some to Volkswagen AG, Ford Motor Co. and Daimler AG, the data show.
Both Honda and Toyota have cut their profit and sales forecasts for the current fiscal year with demand in the US and China, the two biggest export markets, worse than projected.

50,2019-11-01,Maruti,"Top automaker becomes first to report growth amid economic downturnMaruti's October sales were driven by compact cars, UVs and LCVs, with entry-level variants continuing to witness a decline

Mumbai: Domestic wholesales at India’s largest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, rose 4.5% in October from the year earlier, the company said on Friday as it became the first automobile manufacturer in the country to report growth amid an economic downturn.
Maruti Suzuki’s despatches to dealers stood at 144,277 units in October compared to 138,100 units in the same month last year. Its despatches of passenger vehicles rose 2.3% to 139,121, growing for the first time since March. In September, the car maker had reported a 27% fall in despatches.
This is the first instance in FY20 where the carmaker has reported positive year-on-year (y-o-y) growth, partly triggered by a surge in festive demand and partly on account of a low base from last year.
It was the only carmaker to report wholesale growth on Friday, driven by increased despatches of its compact cars, utility vehicles and its light commercial vehicles, even as its entry-level, or the most affordable category, continued to report a y-o-y decline. Maruti Suzuki sells WagonR, Celerio, Swift, Swift Dzire, Baleno and Ignis models in its compact portfolio. Its UVs comprise Vitara Brezza, S-Cross, Ertiga and the recently launched XL6.
Maruti Suzuki has also supplied 2,727 units of its compact hatchback Baleno to Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt. Ltd, which sells a rebadged version as Glanza.
“The retail sales were far better than the wholesales and the company delivered close to 48,000 cars on Dhanteras alone. This was the highest single-day deliveries in the past 3-4 years,"" Shashank Srivastava, head, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki, said in an interview.
Srivastava added that festive retail sales this year saw double-digit growth over last year. “The newly launched S-Presso model has now accumulated more than 20,000 bookings, averaging about 750-800 units per day,"" he added.
While Maruti Suzuki plans to roll back its discounting initiatives November onwards, Srivastava said certain promotional schemes will continue in order to attract customers to retail showrooms.
Monthly wholesale figures reported by other carmakers on Friday were more muted than Maruti Suzuki’s.
The country’s second-largest carmaker, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, reported total domestic passenger vehicle wholesales of 50,010 units, down 4% y-o-y.
Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit, said: “Retail sales are directly linked with the festive demand even as wholesales continue to post y-o-y decline on inventory correction measures by the carmakers. The retail uptick is a clear result of pent up demand for cars as buyers were delaying their purchases on several factors.""
Vangaal suggested that Maruti Suzuki’s early move to cut production and correct its inventory across dealerships resulted in it registering positive wholesales for October.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) reported passenger vehicle wholesales of 18,460 units, down 23% y-o-y. However, Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M, said retail volumes exceeded wholesales by almost 40% last month. “Our billing numbers are in line with what we had planned for the month, since the objective was to significantly correct our channel inventory,"" he added.
Retail sales in October were highest ever for any month for M&M, said managing director Pawan Goenka. “I hope the retail momentum in October is an indicator of sentiment turning positive,"" he tweeted.
Stressing on the importance of reporting retail figures, Anand Mahindra, chairman, Mahindra Group, said: “The industry really needs to switch to reporting retail and not wholesale volumes. There are some strong signs of life in the market. And pipeline stocks have been slashed by controlling billings to dealers. Very appropriate stock levels now.""
At 13,169 units, Tata Motors’ passenger vehicle wholesales were down 28% y-o-y. In a statement, Mayank Pareek, president, passenger vehicles business unit, said that retail sales were 36% more than wholesales, and the company has reduced its network stock by 38%.
“In October 2019, retail registration of passenger vehicles is estimated to have increased by 11-16% over a low base, as 24 Sept-8 Oct 2018 was Shradh and had resulted in lower sales last year,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research."

Mumbai: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) on Friday reported a 4.5% year-on-year (YoY) growth in domestic wholesales for October at 144,277 units, indicating a spike in demand during the festival season.
India’s largest carmaker, however, continued to record a decline in its mini car category where it sells its most affordable small car Alto along with the newly launched S-Presso. The company reported wholesales of 28,537 units for last month as against 32,835 units dispatched in October last year.
In the compact car segment, where it sells Wagon R, Celerio, Swift, Dzire, Baleno and Ignis models, total wholesales were at 75,094 units, up 16% YoY. Meanwhile, volumes of its midsize sedan Ciaz fell to 2,371 units in October from 3,892 units in the year-ago period.
Sports utility vehicles (SUVs) wholesales were at 23,108 units for last month, rising 11% YoY on launch of a new model and steady demand. It sells Vitara Brezza, S-Cross, Ertiga and the newly launched XL6 models in this category. The company had reported wholesales of 20,764 utility vehicles in the year-ago period.
Maruti’s total domestic passenger vehicle wholesales stood at 139,121 units in October, up 2.3% YoY.
Light commercial vehicle dispatches rose too during the last month. Wholesales of Super Carry stood at 2,429 units as against 2,152 units in October last year.
MSIL supplied 2,727 units of its compact hatchback Baleno to Toyota Kirloskar Motor Pvt Ltd, which sells the rebadged version of the same as Glanza model.

49,2019-11-03,Maruti,"The company said it would take at least few more months to get clarity if the industry is finally on a revival pathThe company's inventory level is now down to 30 days

NEW DELHI :
The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) remains 'cautiously optimistic' over sales prospect going ahead as many of the challenges that led to slowdown in the auto industry still exist, a senior company official has said.
The company, which posted a growth in domestic passenger vehicle sales after seven months in October, said it would take at least few more months to get clarity if the industry is finally on a revival path.
""We are cautiously optimistic. The reason why we are cautious is that we do not have a crystal ball. Many of the factors like high cost of acquisition, confusion related to BS-IV and BS-VI, issues related to finance norms and liquidity etc, continue to be there,"" MSI Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava told PTI.
He was replying to a query whether October sales were an indication of revival of the industry which has been grappling with demand slowdown for almost a year now.
""We are optimistic a little bit because the stock levels are manageable as the dealers money is freed up due to good retail. We need to look at the situation for couple of months before we conclude the real direction of the industry,"" Srivastava said.
The company's inventory level is now down to 30 days which is a positive factor, he added.
MSI made most of the festive season and posted a growth of 4.5 per cent in its domestic wholesales at 1,44,277 units in October as against 1,38,100 units in the same period last year.
Other carmakers like Hyundai, Mahindra & Mahindra and Toyota also managed to perform better over last month.
Tata Motors and Honda Cars India also improved sales in October from preceding months. Passenger vehicle wholesales in India declined for the eleventh consecutive month in September.
The slump in sales has forced various companies to cut production and manpower. Elaborating on the factors impacting sales, Srivastava said high acquisition cost remained a challenge.
""Cost of cars going up due to mandatory emission and safety norms, increase in road tax of up to 7 per cent across nine states and upfront payment of three years third party insurance have all increased the on-road price of a car,"" he noted.
Besides, liquidity crunch has made it difficult for the dealers and customers to get financing for inventory as well as purchase, he added.
Further, confusion in the mind of the customers regarding the transition of vehicles from BS-IV to BS-VI technology, availability of BS-VI fuel and lack of clarity whether a BS-VI compliant vehicle can run on BS-IV fuel have also impacted sales, Srivastava said."

Yes Bank: The private lender announced its September quarter earnings on Friday after market hours. The bank reported a net loss of  ₹600 crore for July-September due to adjustment of  ₹709 crore in one-time deferred tax asset. It had posted a net profit of  ₹965 crore in the same period last year. The bank also aims to raise $1.2 billion equity capital by the end of December.

NEW DELHI :
Suzuki Motor Corp.’s net profit plunged 42% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the fiscal first half, hammered by lower vehicle sales in key markets of Japan and India and sharp fluctuations of the Japanese yen against major currencies.
The parent of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd posted a net profit of 79.3 billion yen in the six months ended 30 September.
During the period, Japan’s fourth-largest automaker posted a 17% y-o-y drop in volumes to about 1.4 million vehicles. This was mainly because of 4.6% and 26.5% decline in sales in Japan and India, respectively. Sales in other core markets such as Indonesia, Thailand and Pakistan also declined in double digits.
During the fiscal first half, Suzuki’s net sales fell 9% y-o-y to 1,755.4 billion yen. Operating income—a measure of a company’s operational profitability—declined 40% to 118.6 billion yen.
Suzuki did not disclose financial results for the July to September quarter in its earnings presentation uploaded on the company’s website on Tuesday.
In Japan, the company has started recalling almost 2 million vehicles after its final inspection infrastructure was found inadequate and had to be restructured, which led to loss of production.
Meanwhile, a year-long slowdown in the Indian market has led to a substantial reduction in contribution from Maruti Suzuki, which controls about half of the Indian market and contributes more than half of Suzuki’s profit and revenue. The Hamamatsu, Japan-based manufacturer in October already guided for a significant decline in revenue, operating profit and net profit in the current fiscal due to expected loss of production in both Japan and India.
The company, led by Osamu Suzuki, cut net sales forecast by 10.3% to 3,500 billion yen.
Operating income has been lowered by 39.4% to 200 billion yen. Suzuki also revised downwards its net profit guidance by 30% to 140 billion yen.
“The company hereby revises the consolidated business forecast due to decrease in Japan production in the course of restructuring final inspection scheme, slowdown in Indian automobile market, and exchange rate fluctuations,"" Suzuki informed the Tokyo Stock Exchange on 10 October.
In its results presentation on Tuesday, Suzuki said “The Group will work as one to reform in every field and pursue the business activity to accomplish more than the below forecasts for the consolidated operating results.""
Maruti Suzuki—Suzuki’s most valuable unit—posted a 39% y-o-y drop in net profit to  ₹1,359 crore in the September quarter, the lowest profit in 15 quarters, due to lower volumes. Revenue declined by 25% y-o-y to  ₹16,120.4 crore.
At the recent motor show in Tokyo, Suzuki’s president Toshihiro Suzuki said the company will find it extremely challenging to hold on to its 50% market share in India.
“It’s a challenge. Globally, one firm has never been able to get 50% share in one country. The Indian market is very special to us and we will try to keep the a 50% share but there are varied challenges. General Motors in the US has around 16% market share and same is the case with Volkswagen in Europe. But I will try to keep the 50% market share (in India),"" Suzuki said."
46,2019-11-05,Maruti,"CDSL has a well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed, cushioning it from volatilityShares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor NSE

The market value of Asia’s oldest stock exchange BSE Ltd slipped below that of its depository subsidiary Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) for the first time on Tuesday, as its stock fell nearly 8% so far this year.
On Tuesday, the market capitalization of CDSL stood at  ₹2,431 crore, against BSE’s  ₹2,430.31 crore. At the end of September, BSE held 24% stake in CDSL.
Typically, the parent company’s market value should be more than that of its subsidiary, considering the parent may have its own core business in addition to the subsidiary units. However, there are some exceptions where the units are valued higher. For instance, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Bajaj Finance Ltd have higher market value than their parent Suzuki Motor Corp., Housing Development Corp Ltd, and Bajaj Finserv Ltd, respectively.
Shares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor National Stock Exchange. BSE went public in February 2017 and its shares have since fallen 31.7% from its issue price of  ₹806 a share.
BSE’s financial performance has been muted over the past several quarters, and this has reflected in its stock price, according to Ajit Mishra, vice president of Religare Broking.
“Despite BSE’s duopoly position, the stock has been on a continuous downtrend ever since its IPO in early 2017. It has been losing market share and the network effect is playing against it, which is why it is a dying business model with no visibility for growth and weak durability and sustainability of earnings,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research, Samco Securities.
Shares of CDSL, which was listed in June 2017, have surged more than 59% from the issue price of  ₹149 a share. So far this year, they have gained 6%.
CDSL has an asset-light and well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed (annuity-based), which cushions it from market volatility. “CDSL has a more secular business working in a duopoly position where there is high visibility of earnings sustainability and durability. The triggers of the government’s new rule that even unlisted companies will have to dematerialise their shares and the huge untapped potential of investors in India around 10%, which is currently just 2%, have laid the foundation for a rally,"" Mehta said."
45,2019-11-06,Maruti,"The joint venture will set up the first vehicle dismantling unit in Noida with a capacity to handle 2000 vehicles per monthIt will subsequently have similar scrapyards in different parts of the country

Suzuki Motor Corp. and Toyota Motor Corp. will start a vehicle dismantling and recycling joint venture in India as the Japanese automakers expand their alliance in the country.
The joint venture, Maruti Suzuki Toyotsu India Pvt. Ltd (MSTI), will be owned equally by Suzuki’s unit Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Toyota Tsusho India Ltd, a subsidiary of Toyota. It will build its first vehicle dismantling unit in Noida with a capacity to handle 2,000 vehicles per month. Similar facilities will also be opened in other parts of India.
The partnership will allow Suzuki and Toyota to promote recycling and support resource optimisation and conservation, while using environment-friendly systems and processes, said Kenichi Ayukawa, managing director of Maruti Suzuki, India’s largest carmaker by sales. “Scrapping of older vehicles in a scientific and environment-friendly manner will help reduce pollution and also make roads safer. A team of experts at MSTI will dismantle the vehicles using international technology and global standards,"" he said.
The announcement comes at a time when the roads ministry is working on a policy for vehicle scrapping to reduce the number of old vehicles on roads to curb vehicular pollution in major cities. Mumbai-based Mahindra and Mahindra was the first to set up a vehicle recycling unit in India.
MSTI will be responsible for procuring and dismantling end-of-life vehicles (ELV). The process will include complete solid and liquid waste management in accordance with Indian laws and globally approved quality and environment standards, the companies said. They did not disclose the investments that would be made in the venture.
With the Union government working on the vehicle scrappage policy, most of the automakers are expected to set up their respective scrapyards hoping to tap an additional source of revenue in the future. The auto industry has been lobbying with the government for a scrappage policy for the past few years as it is expected to generate more demand for vehicles at a time when growth in vehicle sales are expected to stay modest because of the emergence of shared mobility and new regulations that make vehicles more expensive.
“Toyota Tsusho has started ELV recycling in the 1970s in Japan. We believe that we will be able to contribute to the Indian society through our knowledge and experience of the ELV business. The first vehicle dismantling and recycling unit of MSTI is just the initial step and we are eager to expand to a pan-India base with Maruti Suzuki,"" said Naoji Saito, chief executive, metal division, Toyota Tsusho.
Toyota and Suzuki first announced their partnership in 2017 with the aim of developing affordable electric and hybrid vehicles for the Indian market. They decided to set up a lithium-ion battery manufacturing plant in Gujarat in collaboration with Toshiba Corp., for hybrid and electric vehicles. The companies subsequently expanded their collaboration to vehicle cross-badging, supply of powertrains, joint development of vehicles, and exports.
In August this year, the companies deepened their ties by buying small stakes in each other. Apart from manufacturing electric and hybrid models, Suzuki and Toyota now plan to jointly develop autonomous driving technology.
The two are also expected to venture into the affordable electric vehicle space in India in the next few years.
“We will introduce a compact battery electric vehicle but I can’t divulge anything more right now,"" Shigeki Terashi, executive vice-president and member of the board at Toyota, said ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show."

NEW DELHI: Suzuki Motor Corp said it was no longer gung-ho about India's auto market, the world's fourth-largest, where it has seen relentless growth in the past seven years. And the parent of the country's biggest car maker is not alone.
The Japanese automaker issued the warning after it reported a slump in quarterly profit this week on tumbling sales at its Indian unit, Maruti Suzuki , which accounts for half the number of cars sold in India.
""We no longer think that growth in India will be an uninterrupted move upwards,"" Suzuki President Toshihiro Suzuki cautioned. Maruti's sales, which were growing till January, has slipped every month over February-September 2019.
India's auto sector has gone into a tailspin this year as tight liquidity at shadow banks, high taxes and a weak rural economy have sapped consumers' buying power.
Global players like Ford , Volkswagen  and Fiat  are already re-evaluating their strategy as they struggle to make inroads in a market dominated by small cars.
""Car makers are getting very cautious regarding their future investments in India. Most of them are either deferring or just scrapping their India new model plans,"" said Puneet Gupta, an autos sector expert at IHS Markit.
Auto executives and analysts point out that some car makers are focussing on their strengths in terms of products instead of chasing volumes with small cars. Some others are taking drastic steps to reduce their exposure.
Ford  has agreed to sell a majority stake in its India arm to Mahindra & Mahindra , ending its independent operations in the country after two decades and highlighting the challenges automakers face in growing profitably in Asia's third-largest economy.
Dialling back
A cocktail of higher taxes under a new goods and services tax regime, flip-flop over electric-vehicle policy, and a boom of ride-sharing firms such as Uber and Ola have all plagued global automakers in India. Not having the right cars and smaller sales network have also hurt, some executives say.
""When you have policy instability it becomes very hard to convince headquarters to invest more in the country,"" an executive at a western automaker said.
India is largely a small-car market and that is not a strength for most global automakers, who sell more SUVs and luxury cars elsewhere such as in China and the United States - the world's top two car markets, the executive added.
Western automakers had to design products specifically for India which is an expensive exercise, said V.G. Ramakrishnan, managing partner at consultancy Avanteum Advisors.
""Many chose a mass-market strategy instead of a niche one,"" and are dialling back to focus on specific segments, he said.
Volkswagen has put its sister company Skoda in charge of India strategy and will focus on SUVs. Fiat  too has put SUV-maker Jeep in charge of driving sales in the country.
Demand for SUVs in India is growing faster than some small car segments, prompting even the likes of Maruti that dominates the small-car space to look at launching SUVs and crossovers.
Honda is re-evaluating its India plans and may convert one of its two plants into a research centre, local media reported.
Toyota and Suzuki have formed an alliance to share supply chain costs and develop new vehicle technologies together.
""Automakers want to exploit their existing resources, minimize their costs and maximize their returns,"" Gupta said.

Mumbai: Lack of demand for passenger vehicles in the country has forced India's largest manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki to cut its production for the 8th consecutive month. The company's total vehicle production last month stood at 119,337 units against 150,497 in October last year.
The production of passenger vehicles was down 117,383 units from 148,318 in October last year, while Van produced slipped nearly by half from 13,817 in October 2018 to 7,661 last month.
The manufacturing of vehicles in the mini-segment came down to 20,985 units last month from 34,295 units in the corresponding month last year. The segment has models such as Alto, S-Presso, Old WagonR, the company said in regulatory filing on Friday.
In the compact segment, which consists of models like New WagonR, Celerio, Ignis, Swift, Baleno, OEM Model, Dzire, the number of units produced last month was 64,079 from 74,167 in the corresponding month last year.
Only utility vehicles like Gypsy, Vitara Brezza, Ertiga, XL-6, S-Cross saw a slight growth at 22,736 units in October from 22,526 units in October 2018.
However, in terms of sale, the company did show signs of recovery owing to the festival season demand. Maruti sold a total of 1,44,277 units (inclusive of OEM sales) during October 2019 in the domestic market recording a 4.5 per cent growth over the same month a year ago.
While it witnessed decline in sales of mini cars such as Alto and S-Presso, the compact segment including New WagonR, Celerio, Ignis, Swift, Baleno and Dzire posted a growth of 16 per cent year-on-year.

41,2019-11-17,Maruti,"A proposal in this regard will soon be circulated by the DPIIT for inter-ministerial consultationRoyalty is paid to a foreign collaborator for the transfer of technology, usage of brand or trademarks

NEW DELHI :
The government is considering to re-introduce restrictions on royalty payments for technology transfer in view of excessive outflow of such funds to overseas companies, sources said.
A proposal in this regard will soon be circulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) for inter-ministerial consultation, sources said.
According to the proposal, limits could be imposed on royalty payments in case of technology transfer or collaboration involving foreign entities either directly or indirectly through any firm in India.
A similar proposal was mooted by the department last year. That time it had proposed that royalty payments should be capped at 4 per cent of domestic sales and 7 per cent of exports for the first four years; and for the next three years the limit should be 3 per cent of local sales and 6 per cent of exports.
But the finance ministry had raised objections over the proposal saying it could send a negative signal to foreign investors.
The increase in outflow of these payments started after the government liberalised the FDI policy in 2009. It had removed the cap and permitted Indian companies to pay a royalty to their technical collaborators without seeking prior government approval.
Royalty is paid to a foreign collaborator for the transfer of technology, usage of brand or trademarks.
In April 2017, a surge in royalty outflow prompted the government to set up an inter-ministerial group to analyse payment norms and see whether there is excessive payout by Indian companies to foreign collaborators.
Proposing these restrictions, the department had argued that the curbs would help increase the profits of domestic companies, mainly in the automobile sector, prevent depletion of foreign exchange reserves, protect the interest of minority shareholders and increase revenue for the government.
Before 2009, royalty payments were regulated by the government and capped at 8 per cent of exports and 5 per cent of domestic sales in the case of technology transfer collaborations. They were fixed at 2 per cent of exports and 1 per cent of domestic sales for use of trademark or brand name.
Auto major Maruti Suzuki pays an average royalty of around 5.5 per cent of its net sales to its parent Suzuki.

On the decision to stop production of diesel vehicles, he said the company had said that it will not make small diesel vehicles of BS-VI standard but will reconsider if the market remains trendy.

A quick resolution to the US-China trade war is far from certain, because relations between the world's two-largest economies have often been acrimonious and negotiations have stalled many a times before.
Traders pointed to China's decision to increase punishments for intellectual property rights violations as a fresh concession to the United States in the drawn-out and volatile negotiations.
Investors were also encouraged by positive comments from the US President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Chinese state-owned media about the chance for an imminent trade deal.
The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in a 16-month long dispute over trade practices that the Washington says are unfair. China has responded in kind with its own tariffs on US goods.

37,2019-11-26,Maruti,"Move aimed at maintaining strong pipeline of models developed at low costs with faster turnaround timeMaruti has seen a 23.2% fall in domestic PV sales in the April to October period, triggering a dip in its market share

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India Ltd is set to rework its blueprint for introducing new products over the next decade as the country’s largest carmaker strives to maintain its dominant position in the market, said two people with direct knowledge of the development.
The revised strategy would see the Suzuki Motor Corp. unit introduce models that could be sold in both the premium Nexa dealerships as well as the mass market Arena showrooms, the people said, requesting anonymity.
The revamp is aimed at maintaining a strong pipeline of models developed at lower cost with a faster turnaround time, the two people said. The plan is expected to help the automaker as launching new products at regular intervals will allow it to effectively address demand and combat rivals.
“Maruti is expected to launch one such product with two versions every year. Most of the competition is also coming in those segments, which is addressed through Nexa,"" said the first person cited above. Cost savings will be a huge benefit under the new approach, the person said.
The automaker is likely to adopt the new strategy with the Vitara Brezza compact sport-utility vehicle when the product undergoes a full model change around 2021, the first person said, adding the new model will be sold through both Nexa and Arena showrooms.
The second person said it typically costs between  ₹900 crore and  ₹1,100 crore to develop a new car model in India, whereas a variant, even with drastic changes to the interior and exterior, requires an additional  ₹200 to  ₹250 crore.
A spokesperson for Maruti declined to comment.
Selling different versions of the same model would therefore require only an incremental cost of about 20%, which would be significantly lower than developing a new model for sale either through Nexa or Arena dealership, the person said. The costs on research and development would also halve if the models are built by re-engineering existing vehicle platforms, the person added.
Maruti would be following its rivals such as Renault SA, Nissan Motor Co. and Volkswagen Group which have taken similar approaches with their products previously. Automakers are increasingly feeling the need to develop new products faster as their life cycle shortens due to changes in customer needs.
In the current slowdown, Maruti’s main rival, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, increased its market share to 18.19% in the April-October period from 16.96% thanks to new products like the Venue compact SUV. New entrants such as Kia Motors India Ltd and MG Motor India Pvt. Ltd generated strong customer interest for their debut products despite the slowdown.
Maruti has, meanwhile, witnessed a 23.2% fall in domestic passenger vehicle sales in the April-to-October period, leading its market share to dip to 49.59% in the period from 51.5% a year earlier.
“Cross badging of products between their distribution network Arena and Nexa looks to be an clever strategy. This way Maruti will be able to capitalize and build more volumes on the same platform and thus improvise on profitability,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director, IHS Markit. “Consumers will get access to better value and multiple proposition. In a way, Nexa and Arena may also address different needs and consumer expectation with minimal investment. Ertiga and XL6 is an excellent example of the same.""
Maruti in August launched the XL6 multi-purpose vehicle, a reworked version of its Ertiga. While the XL6 is sold through Nexa showrooms, the Ertiga is retailed through Arena showrooms. These helped Maruti occupy the top slot in the segment, overtaking Toyota Kirloskar Motors Pvt. Ltd.
The second person cited above said that vehicles smaller than the Ignis hatchback may not be covered under the new approach. This strategy will help protect Maruti’s “50% market share till 2030 and beyond. The firm will need more products and this is an easy way out"", said the second person."
34,2019-11-27,Maruti,"Online used car retailer is in talks with Norwest, General Catalyst and Fundamentum for the fundraiseNorwest is expected to invest about $10 million, while General Catalyst will write a smaller cheque

Online used car retailer Spinny is closing a $50 million funding round with three new investors coming into an oversubscribed round, despite a wide-ranging automobile sales slump in India.
The new investors include growth equity firm Norwest Venture Partners, US venture fund General Catalyst, and Fundamentum, a fund set up by Nandan Nilekani and former Helion Ventures partner Sanjeev Aggarwal, said three people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity. Mint first reported on 2 October that Fundamentum is in talks to back Spinny.
Its existing investors—Blume Ventures and SAIF Partners—will also participate in the round, while Accel Partners will invest more from its global growth fund, valuing Spinny at about $150 million, said the people cited above.
While General Catalyst will write a smaller cheque, Norwest is expected to invest about $10 million, with the round being split into two tranches because of investor interest.
General Catalyst is one of US’s largest VC funds, currently deploying from a $1.4 billion fund—its ninth and largest so far. It is becoming more active in India, after investing in Cred, the credit card payment startup launched by Kunal Shah, co-founder of FreeCharge, in August this year. General Catalysts’ investments in the US include accommodation startup Airbnb, picture app Snap Inc., and payments firm Stripe, among others.
While Norwest declined to comment, General Catalyst, Accel and Spinny did not respond to emails seeking comment.
Spinny, run by Value Drive Technologies Pvt. Ltd, was founded by Niraj Singh, Mohit Gupta and Ramanshu Mahaur in 2015. It is currently present in Delhi, Noida, Gurugram and Bengaluru, and plans to use the funds to expand to more areas. It is a buyer-focused platform catering to used cars exclusively. In comparison, Sequoia Capital-backed Cars24 is a seller focused platform, while CarDekho is buyer focused for used and new cars.
“Spinny has grown well in the past year, despite being in a somewhat crowded market. It also wants to raise a large round while investor sentiment is still positive, and will have enough runway without worrying about capital for at least a year,"" said a person tracking the company, among those cited above.
Mint reported on 2 October that online car retailing startups, particularly in the used car segment, are continuing to attract investors despite the domestic automobile industry experiencing its worst sales slump in nearly two decades. This is because the used car segment is still growing well, albeit with a smaller base, and often seen as a substitute for newer cars, and thus unaffected by the slowdown.
Automakers, however, saw a glimmer of hope in October’s sales, with passenger vehicle sales rising 0.3% after nearly a year of weak sales. The turnaround in the passenger vehicle segment was, however, the only exception in the domestic automobile industry where all other segments recorded weaker sales last month.
A total of 285,027 passenger vehicles were sold in the festival month of October, thanks to higher sales by market leader Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and new entrants Kia Motors India and MG Motor India."

32,2019-11-27,Maruti,"RC Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, shares five ideas for the futureCorporate entities and governments, both at the central and the state levels, need to work together to grow the economy in the next decade

With 2020—a year that had people setting targets for transformation throughout the 2000s—just weeks away, Mint invites thought leaders, entrepreneurs and heads of corporates to share their vision for the next decade. R.C. Bhargava, chairman of Maruti Suzuki, shares five ideas for the future with Malyaban Ghosh, detailing how manufacturing will impact the economy in the coming decade.
AUTO SECTOR WILL DRIVE ECONOMY
In the next decade, the manufacturing sector will play a significant role in growing the economy of the country. Since the automobile industry is an integral part of the manufacturing sector, it needs to grow substantially and increase its contribution to the economy. Affordability of vehicles should also be looked into—if people cannot afford to buy vehicles, the sector can’t grow.
BUILD TRUST BETWEEN GOVT, INDUSTRY
Corporate entities and governments, both at the central and the state levels, need to work together to grow the economy in the next decade. We cannot afford to have a lack of trust between governments and the private sector. We have to work to ease trust deficits. And it’s going to be up to the industrialists to take the leap and work towards trust building in the future.
USE COMPETITION TO BRING DOWN COSTS
Understanding competitiveness will be very important, and the cost of manufacturing has to come down. Managers of industry have to focus on cost reduction, and this will be a major task for industrialists in the coming decade. The contribution of manufacturing to the gross domestic product has to increase and that can be done by growing industry faster.
SLOW OFFTAKE FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES
The potential for growth for the automobile industry will be enormous in the next decade since the penetration of cars in India is still quite low. Electric vehicles will take a fair amount of time to catch on with people, and they will not gain prominence for another two to four years. So, we will need to create wealth in order to become a socially just country.
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH
Infrastructure in India has to change and improve significantly in the next decade. This will include roads, infrastructure for electric vehicles and more. Transmission of power needs to improve, and infrastructure in the railways sector should also be upgraded. Improving infrastructure will be important to increase the overall size of the economy, which in turn will increase wealth in society."

New Delhi: The country's largest car maker Maruti Suzuki India on Saturday said it has crossed milestone of 20 million passenger vehicle cumulative sales in the Indian market.

NEW DELHI :
Car sales in India are expected to have fallen 8% year-on-year (y-o-y) in November, contracting from an uptick seen during the festival month of October.
Sales data issued by Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Hyundai Motor India Ltd, Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M), Tata Motors Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd and Volkswagen India showed combined sales of 218,166 cars last month, falling from 236,276 units sold by the same companies a year earlier.
Sales are measured as wholesales or factory dispatches to dealerships. The sales performance was, however, better than analysts’ expectations of a 10-12% decline.
Sales at market leader Maruti fell 3% y-o-y to 139,133 units last month from 143,890 units a year earlier.
Maruti, which sold 144,277 vehicles in the local market in October, fared better-than-expected in November, said analysts. Sales of Maruti’s mini and compact small cars grew 2% y-o-y to 104,319 units last month. The growth has been largely driven by demand for models such as Swift, New WagonR and the Baleno premium hatchback.
“November wholesales are better than expected. There is a slight revival for the BS IV diesel cars as the demand continues to be driven by discounts and promotional offers, which were given during the festive season,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, country lead, light vehicle production forecasting, IHS Markit. “This has worked well to reduce inventory for Maruti Suzuki. Meanwhile, incremental growth is coming on the back of new launches such as the XL6, S-Presso, New WagonR"".
New models helped Hyundai, the second-largest carmaker, post a 2% y-o-y growth in domestic sales last month at 44,600 vehicles. “Hyundai’s performance is primarily driven by the demand for its new products such as the Venue compact sport-utility vehicle and i10 Nios hatchback,"" said Vangaal.
M&M reported total domestic passenger vehicle sales of 14,637 units, a 10% decline y-o-y. Veejay Ram Nakra, chief of sales and marketing, automotive division, M&M, expects December to pan out better. “The month post festive season is historically a lean month for the automotive industry. Consumer demand, especially for passenger vehicles, typically picks up in the year-end that is in December,"" he said.
Vangaal, however, cautioned that annual plant shutdowns for maintenance at all major car manufacturers would impact December sales."

India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) recorded a 2% year-on-year (YoY) drop in its total wholesales in November, the company said in a statement on Sunday.

The carmaker, which had sold 144,277 units in India in October, continues to battle a demand slowdown post festival season and is tightly checking its inventory build up, especially of newly launched models, including S-Presso, XL6 and new WagonR.
Maruti’s mini and compact car segment have posted a 2% YoY growth of 104,319 units last month. The compact car category has driven growth in this category with the sub-segment posting wholesales of 78,013 units for November, up 7.6% YoY. Analysts said it could mean the carmaker continues to see strong bookings of models such as Swift, new WagonR and the Baleno premium hatchback.
Meanwhile, the mini sub-segment, where Maruti sells its entry-level Alto models and the newly launched S-Presso, clocked sales at 26,306 units, down 12.2% YoY. Even as the company said the S-Presso is seeing average bookings in the range of 700-800 units per day, Maruti dealers suggest that the carmaker has grown cautious over last months on monthly billings and stock building.
After reporting a growth of 11% in October, Maruti’s portfolio of utility vehicles posted wholesales of 23,204 units, down 1.3% YoY on tight inventory control. The company sells models such as Ertiga, XL6, Brezza and S-Cross as UVs.

Auto sales remain in the slow lane in November, denting investor sentiment. Going by the sales figures, it seems even a gradual uptick in the sector remained elusive as the mild uptick in the festival season failed to roll over to November. The Nifty Auto index was down 0.5% on Monday.
The decline in sales at India's largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki Ltd capped a pickup in the stock price seen in the past few months. Domestic sales in November declined 1.9% year-on-year and 1.6% month-on-month, indicating that the auto market is far from revival. This will continue to put pressure on the stock.
Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd’s total sales slumped about 9% last month. In the domestic market, its sales dropped about 7%. A weaker global economy hit exports, which slumped 26% year-on-year. Tractor sales were also muted and showed that the stress in the rural economy is far from over.
Tata Motors once again failed to make much headway in the domestic market as sales slumped 25% in November. Financing issues hit sales in the passenger vehicles segment while sales of medium and heavy commercial vehicles were the worst hit, falling tanked 38% year-on-year. As commercial vehicles sales depend on economic growth, most forecasts pointing towards a further slowdown does not bode well for the sector.
Auto stocks have remained largely flat because they have shed substantial value this year. That does not mean the stocks are inexpensive. In fact, the current slump shows that the recovery will be more prolonged than what was estimated earlier."

Worldover, the automobile industry, particularly car manufacturing, is undergoing a major shift due to both regulatory and technology changes, in the process holding back consumers from making purchases.
With rising concerns over climate change, many counties including have set ambitious plans to move to electric vehicles altogether. While India hasn’t yet set a deadline for this, it will move to cleaner petrol and diesel vehicles and fuel from April 2020, conforming to Bharat Stage-VI (BS-VI) standards on emission. Many manufacturers, Indian and foreign, plan to stop making diesel vehicles in the near future, a move away from a fuel considered dirty.
Buyers, in anticipation of the new BS-VI norms, are reluctant to buy cars immediately, on fear of regulatory changes and the cars thus having a shorter run on the road. Many of them are also discouraged by the ever reducing prospects of a second hand vehicle in a changed environment that favours cars compliant with new norms."

22,2019-12-05,Maruti,"The actual price increase in the price of the vehicles on the ground is usually quite negligible, said a Maruti Suzuki dealerCompetitors like Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others are also likely to follow suit

India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki announced this week that it would increase prices of its vehicles in January, a practice that has almost become ritualistic for other car manufacturers as well. But analysts and industry watchers say that the annual exercise is a tactic aimed at enticing customers to buy before the year-end and clear piled up inventories before the start of the next year, when the value would typically suffer from a sharp depreciation.
The actual price increase in the price of the vehicles on the ground is usually quite negligible, a leading Maruti Suzuki dealer said.
“Next year prices will increase anyway if companies will launch vehicles complying with the BS 6 norm then there will be some increase. Otherwise, for Maruti the increase will not be substantial considering the market situation,"" added the dealer mentioned above.
Maruti has not disclosed from which date prices will increase for its offerings next year.
“Over the past year, the cost of company's vehicles has been impacted adversely due to increase in various input costs. Hence, it has become imperative for the company to pass on some impact of the above additional cost to customers through a price increase across various models in January 2020. This price increase shall vary for different models,"" Maruti said in a press statement.
Competitors like Hyundai Motor India, Tata Motors Ltd, Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and others are also likely to follow suit.
Over the years, this practice has led consumers to believe that December is the best month for buying vehicles because of wide-ranging discounts offered to customers, not to mention price increases touted for January.
According to Mitul Shah, analyst, Reliance Securities, December is usually a good month for retail sales and this year manufacturers will increase their offers to reduce inventory..
Amid slowing sales, this year automobile manufacturers almost went overboard in offering discounts to attract customers during the festive season that started from September-october. Maruti Suzuki offered almost  ₹1 lakh discount on their diesel vehicles like Vitara Brezza to get rid of the BS 4 vehicle inventory.
“In the early 2000s, companies used to take the same strategy before the budget and now it is in December.

New Delhi: After nine straight months of falling production, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd built more vehicles in November than a year earlier, following the mild sales recovery seen in the festive month of October.
Production in November rose 4.33% year-on-year to 141,834 vehicles, India’s largest carmaker said in a statement on BSE.
Production of utility vehicles such as the Vitara Brezza, XL6 and Ertiga increased 18% year-on-year to 27,187 units in November, while that of compact hatchback cars such as the Wagon R, Celerio and Baleno increased 18.82% year-on-year to 78,133 units.
Increased demand for diesel vehicles such as the Vitara Brezza compact sport utility vehicle and new products such as the XL6 multipurpose vehicle have propelled the company to increase production.
Maruti has also announced that it will stop producing diesel vehicles from 1 April, 2020 and increased discounts of such products are drawing a significant number of customers.
The New Delhi-based automaker has exhausted a significant portion of its Bharat Stage (BS)-IV vehicle inventory at its dealerships and has therefore moved to ramp up production as 80% of its product portfolio is compliant with the BS-VI emission norms.
India will shift to the more stringent BS-VI emission norms from April, leading several automakers to offer hefty discounts to clear existing stocks of BS-IV vehicles.
Despite the launch of its new small car S-Presso, Maruti’s production of vehicles in the mini car segment fell 20% year-on-year to 24,052 units in November.

In November, however, Maruti’s wholesales declined by 3.2% year-on-year to 141,400 units.
Sales of automobiles in the domestic market have been on a precipitous decline since the September quarter of 2018-19 due to an overall slowdown in consumption and liquidity crisis at financial institutions after the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI :
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, country’s largest vehicle manufacturer, on Wednesday signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Federal Bank to improve finance options for its customers and dealers. Earlier this year, the New Delhi-based vehicle manufacturer had signed a similar agreement with Bank of Baroda.
While the carmaker looks to expand its customer base and open up new funding options for its dealer principals, Federal Bank looks to expand its presence across India along with growing its book value on auto loans.
According to Maruti Suzuki, almost 80% of all vehicles are financed in the auto industry, thereby making vehicle finance a key element in the capital-intensive business. Shashank Srivastava, Executive Director, Marketing and Sales, MSIL said that the market size of Maruti Suzuki’s retail finance is in excess of  ₹75,000 crore alone.
Most private and public banks have tightened their credit disbursal norms after bankruptcy of IL&FS last year, which impacted the business of dealers and led to closure of showrooms and affected sales of vehicles. Automobile dealers depend on credit from banks and Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to meet their working capital needs.
“In August 2019, MSIL had inducted Federal Bank as an approved partner for dealer inventory funding. The latest tie-up for retail financing to customers will further offer comprehensive loan access facilities to Maruti Suzuki dealers as well as customers,"" a Maruti spokesperson said in a press release issued.
According to Shashank Srivastava, executive director, sales and marketing, Maruti Suzuki, Federal Bank’s extensive presence across India and strong presence in Kerala will help the company expand its customer base.
“This arrangement will help us offer end to end solution for dealers and retail banking customers via best in class technology enabled platform,"" Shyam Srinivasan, managing director and chief executive, Federal Bank.
With Kerala as its home state, for Federal Bank, which is stronger in the southern region, loans given out to the auto industry is less than 5% of its overall book value.
“However, as a percentage of incremental flow for the last 2 years, auto loans comprise 12% (of all loan disbursals). I think it is significant in times when there is so much noise around the slowdown. This could be the beginning of a very strategic partnership,"" he said.
“I believe that customers should have a choice of banks and they would prefer the one which makes it easy for them to get the loan. I am sure Federal Bank has bigger ambitions of growing beyond a few states and even Maruti Suzuki is looking to expand the business across the country,"" Srivastava told Mint.
According to Federal Bank officials, average ticket size of a loan to car dealer is in the range of  ₹2.5 crore – 3 crore. “This, however, varies depending upon the scale of business,"" added Srinivasan.
Commenting on the rise of loan defaults lately seen across dealers, Srinivasan said that banks are now keenly looking for fraud-specific risks in dealer financing as credit-specific risks can be evaluated based on the track record of a party.
“The real nuance is to keep a watch on inventory management. So banks which are investing in fraud analytics and early warning systems deal with it better. As we are going into it, we are putting mechanisms in place,"" he added.
Shalini Warrier, COO and business head – retail at Federal Bank suggested that with deployment of end-to-end digital processing solutions, the bank is able to actively monitor the vehicle inventory and sale transactions at dealer level.
“Technology can enable early detection of fund diversion by a dealer. The banks have realized that they need to monitor the dealer inventory very closely. They have been very strict in terms of allotting more credit days beyond what is already prescribed to the dealers,"" Srivastava told this publication explaining the fast evolving lending norms.

8,2019-12-13,Maruti,"Maruti Suzuki has increased the production target for FY20 by 6% to 1.65 million vehiclesMaruti Suzuki raised production by 4.3% in November following nine consecutive months of decline

Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has raised its vehicle production target for this fiscal in the first sign that India’s largest carmaker is seeing green shoots of a recovery in the troubled auto sector.
The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit has increased the target for the year ending 31 March by 6%, or 60,000 units, to 1.65 million vehicles, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The target has been increased because of expectations of stronger demand in the fiscal fourth quarter with the rollout of more cars compliant with Bharat Stage- VI (BS-VI) emission norms, cheaper financing options and brisk demand for its new products, XL6 and S-Presso, said the two people cited above.
Currently, of the 15 models of Maruti Suzuki, eight are compliant with BS-VI emission norms, which come into effect from 1 April.
Maruti’s decision is significant that the automaker cut production substantially in the first seven months of this fiscal as a slowing economy crimped consumption demand in the world’s fourth-largest automobile market. Maruti raised production by 4.3% in November, after nine consecutive months of decline.
Passenger vehicle sales have been sliding since August last year in the wake of the bankruptcy of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, which triggered a liquidity crunch that worsened as problems surfaced among non-banking financial companies. Sales measured as factory dispatches fell for 11 consecutive months before posting a marginal increase in October this year.
Weaker sales have forced automobile factories to temporarily shut production, while several dealerships went bust.
“Maruti has moved most of its petrol products to BS-VI and can now afford to increase production. It has managed the transition quite well, despite the hit in the first seven months of the fiscal,"" said one of the people cited earlier.
Uncertainty over transition to BS-VI from the current BS-IV norms was one of the factors that kept buyers away as some wanted to opt for products that are compliant with the new emission norms.
A Maruti Suzuki spokesperson confirmed the development without giving details.
“One of the main reasons that manufacturers were circumspect about the production this year was that they did not want to make too many cars that were BS-VI compliant,"" said Shashank Srivastava, executive directorof sales and marketing at Maruti Suzuki. Production has to match retail sales and increasing production leads to higher inventories, weighing on costs, he said.
“Maruti has been working on gradually making its products BS-VI compliant, starting with the highest-selling Alto and Baleno. Now, it is easier for us to plan for an increase in production of BS-VI compliant vehicles. Even if there is some stock left, we can carry it forward to the next fiscal,"" said Srivastava.
New models such as the XL6 multipurpose vehicle have a waiting period, while the S-Presso small car is receiving 400-500 bookings every day, according to Srivastava.
Passenger vehicle sales in India between April and November fell 18% year-on-year to 1.88 million units. Maruti recorded the biggest decline among carmakers because of its position as the market leader. Its sales fell 20.4% during the period, while its market share dropped to 50% from 51.80% year-on-year.
Despite the renewed optimism on production, the recent recall of Ertiga and Ciaz could be a potential dampener, said the second person."

Indian stock markets may rise on Friday tracking rally in other Asian shares but weak domestic macroeconomic data may weigh on sentiment. Asian share markets jumped as a last-gasp Sino-US trade deal and a likely major election win by Britain's Conservative Party looked to have cleared a couple of dark clouds from the global horizon.
The double dose of relief slugged safe-haven sovereign bonds and the Japanese yen, even leading investors to scale back the chance of more interest rates cuts around the world.
The pound hit its highest since mid-2018 as UK exit polls seemed to rule out a shock win by the left-wing Labour opposition, and could help clarify the outlook for Brexit. Polls suggested Prime Minster Boris Johnson could gain a commanding 368 seats in Britain's Parliament, settling another long-standing uncertainty.
The pound was last up 2.3% at $1.3464 and reached levels on the euro not visited since mid-2016.
A wave of trade euphoria had already lifted Wall Street to record highs. Reuters reported the United States has agreed to reduce some tariffs on Chinese goods and delay a tranche of tariffs as part of a phase one deal. China also has agreed to make $50 billion in agricultural purchases in 2020 as part of the deal.
In Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 2.1% to a 14-month high, while South Korean stocks firmed 1.2%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan put on 0.5%.
Wall Street had celebrated the trade deal news with record highs. The Dow ended Thursday up 0.79%, while the S&P 500 gained 0.86% and the Nasdaq 0.73%.
That was bad news for bonds and yields on US 10-year Treasuries shot up to 1.95%, a rise of 16 basis points in just two sessions.
Back home, India’s industrial output shrank while inflation swelled, official data released on Thursday showed, highlighting challenges for policymakers battling an economic slowdown amid surging food prices. Factory output contracted 3.8% in October after shrinking 4.3% in September, in sharp contrast with an 8.4% expansion in October last year. Retail inflation continued to surge in November, fuelled by soaring food prices, as prolonged rains dampened vegetable supplies.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has raised its vehicle production target for this fiscal in the first sign that India’s largest carmaker is seeing green shoots of a recovery in the troubled auto sector. The Suzuki Motor Corp. unit has increased the target for the year ending 31 March by 6%, or 60,000 units, to 1.65 million vehicles.
The National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) has indicted Deloitte Haskins and Sells LLP for what it called significant failures in the statutory audit of IL&FS Financial Services Ltd (IFIN) for 2017-18 and is examining whether disciplinary proceedings against the auditor need to be initiated, the audit regulator said on Thursday.
Interest rate futures slipped as investors priced in less chance of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve next year -- a shift seen across a range of developed nations.
Other safe-haven assets also took a beating, with the yen sliding across the board. The dollar firmed further to 109.42 yen, having risen 0.7% overnight.
The dollar fared less well elsewhere as the pound and the euro both benefited from the UK exit polls. The euro added 0.5% to $1.1189, while the dollar dipped 0.35% against a basket of currencies to 96.742.
The dollar also lost out to the Chinese yuan to hit an 18-week low as any truce would be seen as a boon for the export-heavy economy. The dollar was last at 6.9487 yuan having shed a steep 1.2% overnight.
The shift from safe havens saw spot gold ease to $1,465.04 per ounce.
Oil prices rallied on hopes a trade deal would support global growth and thus demand. US crude added 36 cents to $59.54 a barrel.

6,2019-12-18,Maruti,"Automobile dealers are of the opinion that the prevailing slowdown has resulted in a pile up of BS IV stocksMaruti Suzuki India Ltd, has already rolled out BS VI variants of eight out of its 15 products, and has sold more than 300,000 upgraded units

NEW DELHI :
The Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) India on Wednesday approached the Supreme Court seeking directions to allow dealers to sell and register Bharat Stage IV, or BS IV-compliant vehicles, even after the more stringent BS-VI norms come into effect on 1 April.
The request for exemption has been made for stocks purchased from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) before 1 March 2020.
Last year, the apex court had ordered vehicle makers to stop selling and registering BS IV vehicles from 1 April.
Accordingly, vehicle manufacturers have calibrated their production plans to comply with the Supreme Court order and have been trying to reduce the inventory of BS IV products.
Market leader, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, has already rolled out BS VI variants of eight out of its 15 products, and has sold more than 300,000 upgraded units. Some of the manufacturers, especially commercial vehicle makers and the ones with significant diesel variants in their portfolio, are struggling to upgrade the products due to the unavailability of BS VI fuel.
According to Asish Harsharaj Kale, president, FADA, despite the best efforts, if dealers are left with any inventory of BS IV vehicles on 1 April, many will face financial hardships which could even threaten their business.
“Hence, we have appealed to the honourable apex court to protect the inventory and, in turn, the survival of our members, and allow dealers to sell and register of stocks purchased before 1 March, if they remain unsold by 31 March, beyond the current deadline of 1 April,"" said Kale.
Several automobile dealers are of the opinion that the prevailing slowdown has resulted in a pile up of BS VI stocks and several manufacturers are unable to reduce them due to tepid demand and lack of availability of BS VI fuel. Hence, the Supreme Court should give them some reprieve, since the vehicles that will be left in the stock after March would not be significant."
5,2019-12-19,Maruti,"Dealers in the South Asian nation may go out of business if they’re not allowed to sell older vehicles after April 1, 2020Many car dealers will face financial hardships which could even threaten the existence of their business, said FADA president

India’s automobile dealers face an existential crisis next year, an industry body said.
Dealers in the South Asian nation may go out of business if they’re not allowed to sell older vehicles after April 1, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association said in a statement on Wednesday. FADA said most manufacturers will start making vehicles with the latest emission norms only by end-February, which means they’ll be stuck with previous models unless the Supreme Court modifies its order mandating sales of only Bharat Stage VI-compliant vehicles.
A potential flip flop by the court risks further confusing consumers — who are already in two minds about which vehicles are eligible for purchase — a confusion that has contributed to the worst slowdown for carmakers in India. The world’s fourth-largest automobile market is home to some of the planet’s most polluted cities, and is skipping one level of emission standards to promote cleaner fuel and an eventual move to electric vehicles.
“There is a possibility that many of our members are not able to ensure 100% liquidation of BS-IV inventory purchased by them in the course of business before the deadline,"" said Ashish Harsharaj Kale, the president of FADA. Such a situation will mean “many of them will face financial hardships which could even threaten the existence of their business.""

3,2019-12-20,Maruti,"The Chinese firms also hope to capitalise on gaps left by global automakers such as Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor and GM which have scaled back plans in a market still dominated by  Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor

Chinese automakers Great Wall Motor and Changan Automobile are accelerating plans to build cars in India after the initial success of rival SAIC Motor in one of the world's biggest markets, three sources said. Great Wall, one of the biggest sellers of sports-utility vehicles (SUV) in China, expects to secure a production site in the first half of 2020, likely a General Motors plant in Maharashtra, a source familiar with Great Wall's plans said.
Buying a factory is seen as the best way to get up and running fast and Great Wall is finalising which SUVs it plans to make in India, including whether to kick off its launch with an electric SUV, the source told Reuters.
Great Wall said it would make an announcement next month about its plans for India but declined further comment.
A spokesman for GM in Detroit said it was continuing to make vehicles for export at its Talegaon plant in Maharashtra state.
""As we have said previously, we continue to explore options to improve utilisation of the plant. We do not comment on speculation,"" he said.
Changan, too, is scouting for a production base and has held initial talks with suppliers, sources aware of its plans said. Both automakers, which produce electric vehicles (EVs) in China, are also considering whether to set up EV battery assembly plants in India, the sources said.
Changan declined to comment.
The companies see India as a chance to combat slowing sales at home, which fell in November for a 17th month in a row. While car sales in India are stuttering, the market is expected to become the world's third biggest by 2026, behind China and the United States, according to consultancy LMC Automotive
The Chinese firms also hope to capitalise on gaps left by global automakers such as Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor and GM which have scaled back plans in a market still dominated by smaller, low-cost cars made by Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor.
""It is an opportune time for China's automakers to enter India. There is currently a gap in competition and it may take a couple of years for some of the established carmakers to bring new products to the market,"" said LMC Automotive's Ammar Master.
GM's retreat from India, for example, could help Great Wall get going quickly and it has been in talks to buy GM's plant in Maharashtra, two of the sources said.
GM stopped selling cars in India in 2017 and has already sold its other plant in Gujarat to SAIC, where the state-owned Chinese automaker now makes the Hector SUV it launched in June under its MG Motor brand.
India is part of Great Wall's planned global expansion into South America, South Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia, and it also plans to export from their to places such as Europe and the United States, said the source who is aware of its plans.
""The plant in India is expected to be the biggest for Great Wall outside of China,"" the source said.
Great Wall has hired a former executive from Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest carmaker, for its product and business planning, and appointed a former executive from SAIC's India division as a consultant to liaise with the government.
""For global automakers, India is one of the many markets they are in but for the Chinese it is the first major market outside of home and so the level of investment and commitment will be proportionately high,"" said the source.
One of the biggest hurdles in India will be fighting perceptions about the quality and reliability of Chinese products and winning over brand-conscious buyers for whom cars are a prestige statement, say analysts.
Chinese smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp faced similar perception issues when they launched in India but they now dominate the market. However, cars remain a significant outlay for most Indians and the Chinese brands will need to make their mark quickly.
""Once the likes of Volkswagen and Ford start launching new models in India, the entrants from China could face tougher competition because a lot of buyers in India are still very brand conscious,"" said LMC's Master.
Still, the initial success of SAIC's Hector SUV has helped. Launched at the end of June it said it had sold more than 13,000 cars by the end of November and plans to sell 24,000 next year.
""SAIC has changed the perception about whether a Chinese brand can be made and sold in India,"" said Santosh Pai, partner at law firm Link Legal which advises Chinese companies setting up in India. ""Fence sitters are getting in and have realised they can sell in India if the price and strategy is right.""
Lessons for Great Wall and Changan from SAIC's India launch include marketing the brand aggressively, packing the car with features to differentiate it from rivals and giving extended warranties to dispel doubts over reliability, analysts say.
Another advantage for Chinese carmakers in the coming years will be their EV expertise. With the sale of EVs slowing in China they can deploy some of their existing capacity to India where the government is encouraging clean fuel cars.
SAIC, which will soon launch an electric SUV in India, is also scouting for a second manufacturing site and is expected to make a decision in early 2020, said a source aware of its plans.
SAIC did not respond to a request for comment though the head of its Indian division said in November it was working on an expansion plan and expected its total sales in India to hit 70,000 in 2021."
2,2019-12-23,Maruti,"A section of traders is betting on SALMAN to lead the next rallyThe asset quality of SBI improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19%

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."

New Delhi: Maruti Suzuki India (MSI) on Tuesday said its compact sedan Dzire has become the best selling car in the country in the first eight months of the current fiscal with sales of over 1.2 lakh units.
The company said the model currently has around 60 per cent market share in the compact sedan segment.
""Over years, Dzire has created a niche for itself amongst compact sedans. Gaining widespread acceptance, the model was conceptualised keeping in mind the customer demands,"" MSI Executive Director (Marketing & Sales) Shashank Srivastava said in a statement.
The third generation version of the model was launched in May 2017. 
However, Dzire's numbers fall short when compared with year-ago period, illustrating the prolonged slump the entire auto industry has been grappling with this year. 
The Maruti Suzuki Dzire compact sedan was India’s best-selling car since the start of 2018-19 fiscal year, overtaking the carmaker’s small car Alto, data released by Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) showed. During April-November 2018, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd sold 182,139 Dzire cars as compared with 153,303 units in the year-ago period, according to Siam."
0,2019-12-24,Maruti,"Denying any wrongdoing, Khattar said that Carnation had to be shuttered due to malpractices by other firmsJagdish Khattar started Carnation Auto India following his superannuation from Maruti Suzuki India

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has booked former managing director of Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) Jagdish Khattar for alleged criminal conspiracy, criminal misconduct and cheating Punjab National Bank (PNB) to the tune of  ₹110 crore. Khattar denied the charges.
In a case registered by the probe agency on 20 December, based on a complaint by PNB, CBI has alleged that Khattar, along with “unknown public servants"", cheated the bank of the amount, after he failed to repay the same.
Khattar, a former IAS officer, worked in MSIL from 1993 until his retirement in 2007. He became the managing director in 1999.
Following his superannuation, Khattar started Carnation Auto India Pvt. Ltd for which he received a loan of  ₹170 crore in 2009. The loan was declared a non-performing asset in 2015 with effect from 2012, according to CBI’s first information report (FIR).
Carnation Auto was established as a car servicing and repair outlet of various brands. It also dealt in sale and purchase of used vehicles.
“The accused borrowers dishonestly and fraudulently in order to cheat the bank... sold the goods hypothecated to the bank without its permission and diverted the funds, thereby causing criminal breach of trust and cheating causing wrongful loss to the bank and corresponding gain to themselves,"" said the agency’s FIR.
CBI said it has started an investigation into the matter. A look-out circular against Khattar has not been issued yet.
The probe agency has also alleged that PNB’s forensic audit found that Khattar had fraudulently sold fixed assets worth  ₹66.92 crore for a mere  ₹4.55 crore without the bank’s prior approval—assets which had actually been furnished to the bank as collateral. Khattar, CBI alleged, did not deposit the sale proceeds with the bank.
Denying any wrongdoing by either him or his company, Khattar said in an interview that Carnation had to be shuttered due to malpractices by other companies.
He said Carnation Auto India was the first to start a multi-brand service network for automobiles with around 25 outlets across the country, but met with stiff resistance from original equipment manufacturers, which refused to supply spare parts to the company.
“This made my project unviable,"" he said.
Carnation, whose investors included Azim Premji, Gaja Capital, PNB and IFCI, had to be sent for resolution under the new Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and was subsequently liquidated, with the Mahindra group taking over the business, said Khattar.
“All this was finished around six-eight months back and now suddenly we find this new development,"" Khattar said. “The bankers have taken a lot of information from us. We will wait to see now what happens.""
He said a detailed audit of his company by K.G. Somani and Co. had concluded that theirs was a genuine business failure and there was nothing wrong with it.
“The bank has now referred it to CBI as part of the process followed by them,"" Khattar said. “Search was conducted by CBI but nothing incriminating was found. We will be vindicated once the investigation is completed.""
He also highlighted that a Competition Commission of India order dated August 2014 had found 14 automobile companies guilty of anti-competitive conduct and imposed a fine of  ₹2,500 crore for price manipulation and restricting free availability of spare parts.
“Unfortunately, by then it was too late to rescue our business,"" he added."
