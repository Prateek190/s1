649,2018-01-04,HDFC,"HDFC is making the additional provision to create a buffer for any 'unexpected' risks in the future

Mumbai: Housing Development and Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) on Wednesday announced that it will make a special provision of Rs1,575 crore, using a part of the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of HDFC Standard Life Insurance. 
Mumbai: Housing Development and Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) on Wednesday announced that it will make a special provision of Rs1,575 crore, using a part of the proceeds from the initial public offering (IPO) of HDFC Standard Life Insurance.
The additional provision is being made to create a buffer for any “unexpected"" risks in future, India’s oldest and largest housing finance company said.
The mortgage lender stated in a stock exchange notification that the firm had made Rs5,250 crore profit from the IPO of its life insurance subsidiary in November.
It said the one-time gain gives it an opportunity to strengthen the balance sheet. The additional provisions over and above the regulatory requirements are being made on a voluntary basis, it added.
The amount used for creating special provisions constitutes about 30% of its profit from the HDFC Life IPO.
“The Corporation believes it would be prudent to utilize on-off pre-tax gains from IPO of HDFC Life to shore up the provisions and contingencies account and thereby build an additional buffer against any unexpected risks in the future,"" the notification stated.
At the end of the second quarter of the current fiscal, the firm was carrying Rs3,235 crore in its provisions and contingencies account, over and above the Rs2,500 crore mandated by regulations, the notification stated.
According to analysts, while the additional provisioning could be a measure by the firm to strengthen its books ahead of its fund raising programme, a part of the proceeds from the IPO could also be used for creating provisions for the lender’s corporate book.
“While the overall asset quality indicators remain sound, despite the small rise in non-performing assets in the current fiscal, the strong profits realized provides an opportunity to increase provisions and further strengthen its balance sheet. This would be important as it explores raising capital in the near term,"" said Karthik Srinivasan, group head for financial sector ratings at Icra Ltd.
To be sure, as on 30 September 2017, HDFC’s gross non-performing ratio for non-individual loans stood at 2.18% as against 2.09% in the preceding quarter.
Whereas, the non-performing loan ratio for individual loans remained stable at 0.65%.
The mortgage lender is also looking to raise about Rs13,000 crore to grow its business and for infusion into HDFC Bank. It will be infusing up to Rs8,500 crore in HDFC Bank and the balance will be used for growing its affordable housing business.
 A part of the proceeds from the fund raise will be used to venture into the health insurance space and to launch a stressed assets fund focused on real estate.
Another analyst said on condition of anonymity that the lender could be making additional provisions as it plans to enter the stressed assets business and instead of showing windfall gain in one quarter, it is utilizing the proceeds to strengthen its buffer."

647,2018-01-10,HDFC,"HDFC Bank said a normal monsoon will support rural consumption and additionally, help will also come from farm loan waivers

Mumbai: Second largest private sector lender HDFC Bank expects an uptick in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in FY19 to 7.3% from the 6.5% estimated for FY18, expecting a rural push by government and rise in consumption.  
Mumbai: Second largest private sector lender HDFC Bank expects an uptick in gross domestic product (GDP) growth in FY19 to 7.3% from the 6.5% estimated for FY18, expecting a rural push by government and rise in consumption. 
“We expect GDP growth to pick up to 7.3 per cent in FY19 and the gross value added growth to stand at 7.1 per cent,"" its economists said in a note. The government’s official estimate for FY18 growth stands at 6.5%, much lower than what experts would call as the potential, and restricted by the goods and services tax (GST) implementation and effects of the note ban. 
HDFC Bank said a normal monsoon will support rural consumption and additionally, help will also come from farm loan waivers. A surge in salaries for government servants through the implementation of the seventh pay commission will also help. The government will focus on rural sector and infrastructure, including road, railways and affordable housing, it said. 
Efficiency gains from GST roll out and a disappearance of the demonetisation reverses will give a positive base effect for the growth, it said. On the negative side, it warned of a surge in oil prices causing the ‘twin deficit’ problem with a surge in fiscal and current account gaps, sluggish global growth and a rise in consumption restricting the consumption. 
Even as it put governments at the centre and states adopting fiscal consolidation path as one of the factors which can negatively impact growth, it estimated the central government to not narrow the FY19 fiscal deficit to the targeted level of 3% under an adopted path. 
It said the fiscal deficit for FY19 will come at 3.2%. The bank economists also expect the current account deficit to widen to 2.5% for FY19, from the 1.5% expected for FY18. On the inflation front, it said price-rise will peak to 6% by mid-2018 on a low base and cool-off in the second half of the fiscal. 
It expects a hike of 0.25% in the policy rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) during the fiscal year 2018-19. Even as the Central Statistics Office (CSO) data estimated an uptick in gross fixed capital formation, HDFC Bank said this is due to a very low base in FY17. The capacity utilisation rates in the economy continue to be low, impeding the private capex cycle, it said."

Mumbai: Shares of Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) on Monday crossed Rs3 trillion market capitalisation mark for the first time after its shares soared over 6.7% on news of raising up to Rs13,000 crore through qualified institutional placement (QIP) and preference issue.
Mortgage lender touched a fresh record high of Rs1,878 on the BSE, up 6.70% from its previous close with a market cap of Rs3.01 trillion. So far this year it rose 9.8%. At 2pm, HDFC was trading at Rs1,879 on the BSE, up 6.7% from its previous close. The Sensex index was trading higher by 0.81%. 
Earlier, six companies have crossed this achievement—Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), HDFC Bank Ltd, ITC Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Oil & Natural Gas Corp. Ltd.
Currently, RIL is India’s most valued company with a market capitalization of Rs6 trillion, followed by TCS and HDFC Bank at Rs5.28 trillion and Rs4.92 trillion, respectively.
On Saturday, a committee of directors of the mortgage lender approved selling 64.3 million shares at Rs1,726.05 apiece to the investors, according to a stock exchange filing. The housing finance company has roped in investors like KKR, GIC, Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), Premji Invest and Carmignac for raising funds.
Separately, HDFC will also sell shares to institutional investors through a so-called QIP to raise up to Rs1,896 crore, it said. HDFC’s fundraising is mainly aimed at investing in a preferential share issue by HDFC Bank, which will help the mortgage lender maintain its about 21% stake in the bank.
Global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley resumed coverage on the firm with a recommendation of overweight and kept a target price of Rs2,030, up 17%.

Mumbai: India’s most-valued lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday crossed Rs5 trillion market capitalisation for the first time, making it only the third Indian company to achieve this milestone.
In intraday trade, the stock touched a fresh record high of Rs1,53.75 on the BSE, up 3.31% from its previous close. The scrip closed at Rs1,931.80, up 2.15% with a market cap of Rs5 trillion. The Sensex index closed higher by 0.51% to 35,260.29 points.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) are the other two companies which crossed market capitalisation of Rs5 trillion. RIL remained the most-valued company with a market cap of Rs5.82 trillion, followed by TCS with a market cap of Rs5.57 trillion.
HDFC Bank’s steady 20% profit growth quarter-after-quarter as well as its immunity to the bad loans crises has helped the stock.
The bank also reports bad loan ratio below 1%, the lowest among Indian lenders. Thus, investors continued to buy the stocks despite high valuation of close to 4.8 times its expected book value for this fiscal.
The recent gains in the stock along with other banking shares was due to news report on government mulling 100% foreign direct investment in the banking sector.
Brokerage firm Jefferies India expects that the this is sentiment positive, but the magnitude of impact should be marginal as the gap between current foreign institutional investor (FII) shareholding and upper limit is wide for most banks barring HDFC Bank.
In the last 12 months, the stock has gained 42.34%, while the S&P Bankex, the broader gauge of banking stocks, advanced 36.62%.
The bank will report its December quarter earnings on 19 January. According to 16 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank may report a net profit of Rs4,652.90 crore.
“HDFC Bank’s earnings growth should get a boost from recovering loan demand as disruption from the 2017 implementation of India’s goods and services tax wanes,"" said a 16 January Bloomberg Intelligence report.
“Strong exposure to retail should promote loan growth. Margin may struggle to expand further, but should stay above 4%. Credit costs could rise from last year’s low base, but will still stay under control, as HDFC Bank has lower exposure to stressed borrowers than other corporate lenders. Investors may closely monitor digital banking initiatives,"" the report added.
Among the analysts covering the HDFC Bank stock, 50 have a “buy"" rating, three have a “hold"" rating, while two has a “sell"" rating, according to Bloomberg data."

Mumbai: HDFC Bank Ltd on Friday reported a 20.1% rise in Q3 profit on higher net interest income (NII) and other income.
HDFC Bank’s net profit rose to Rs4,642.60 crore for the quarter ended 31 December from Rs3,865.33 crore a year ago. 
According to 17 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs4,706.90 crore.
Net interest income, or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased 24.1% to Rs10,314.34 crore compared with Rs8,309.09 crore last year. Other income was at Rs3,869.17 crore, up 23.12% from Rs3,142.67 crore a year ago.
Provisions and contingencies jumped 88.81% to Rs715.78 crore from Rs115.38 crore a year ago. On quarter-on-quarter basis, it fell 8.45% from Rs1,476.19 crore.
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) advanced 57.4% to Rs8,234.88 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs5,232.27 crore in the same quarter last year.
The rise in bad loans was due to an annual exercise conducted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) that pointed out divergence in asset classification for fiscal 2017.
For HDFC Bank, the divergence in gross bad loans, the difference between RBI’s assessment and that reported by the lender, stood at around Rs2,051.76 crore at end March 2017, while divergence in provisions was at Rs793.39 crore.
As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 1.29% as compared to 1.26% in the previous quarter and 1.05% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 0.44% in the December quarter compared to 0.43% in the previous quarter and 0.32% in the same quarter last year.
Advances rose 27.51% from a year ago to Rs6.31 trillion. Deposits rose 10.1% to Rs6.99 trillion.

The hubris among investors of HDFC Bank Ltd is evident. After all, India’s most valued lender has delivered another stellar quarter in terms of profitability and growth. 
The hubris among investors of HDFC Bank Ltd is evident. After all, India’s most valued lender has delivered another stellar quarter in terms of profitability and growth.
The bank reported a 20% rise in net profit to Rs4,642.6 crore for the December quarter backed by an impressive 24.1% growth in net interest income and an eye-popping 27.5% expansion in advances.
If that doesn’t dazzle, the 4.3% net interest margin will surely do. Deposits grew at 10% despite it being over the bloated base of demonetisation a year ago.
Let’s rewind again to advances. The surge in loans is also because HDFC Bank didn’t lend much in the December quarter. To its credit, the management of the bank mentioned that, but said that quarterly momentum in loan growth is still intact.
Notwithstanding the base effect from demonetisation, a 27% loan growth should not be sneezed at.
It would be futile to question why HDFC Bank is the only lender and also only the third Indian company to cross a market capitalization of Rs5 trillion (read more here). The love from investors is indeed evident. Add a gross bad loan ratio of 1.29% and it looks like there’s reason enough for this love.
But perhaps investors are getting blindsided by these percentages. HDFC Bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) stock rose 57% from a year ago period. What used to be an accretion of just about 20% two years back is now almost 60%. For a lender of HDFC Bank’s size, this is disturbing.
Also, notwithstanding the base effect on loan growth, as a percentage of the loan book, bad loans have increased sharply. In the September 2017 quarter, the gross NPA ratio was 1.26% while in December the previous year, the bad loan ratio was 1.05%.
Another fact that cannot be ignored is that the bank under-reported its bad loans for fiscal year 2017 by about 25%. To its credit, the lender has made adequate provisioning towards all risky assets including those thrown up by the Reserve Bank of India’s inspection.
HDFC Bank investors are used to consistent double-digit profit growth, industry-beating credit growth and margins that put even some non-banking finance companies to shame. What they haven’t seen before is a faster increase in bad loans and that is yet to reflect into the bank’s valuations. After all future profits are projected based on benchmarking the past. The stock trades at a rich multiple of 4.1 times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2019.
HDFC Bank is no longer what it was in the past as far as bad loans are concerned. The hubris needs to be tempered.
The writer does not hold a position in the company discussed here."
639,2018-01-22,HDFC,"HDFC Standard Life managed to increase the share of its protection business in total new business premium to 27.3%

HDFC Standard Life’s financial results give all the right reasons why its stock has gained 24% since it listed on 17 November. 
HDFC Standard Life’s financial results give all the right reasons why its stock has gained 24% since it listed on 17 November.
The third largest private life insurer’s results for the December quarter showed that its products are flying off the shelf, and more so in the most coveted retail segment.
New business premium grew by 33% in the nine months ended December to Rs7,070 crore from Rs5,330 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. That trumps the 25% growth for rival ICICI Prudential Life Insurance which also detailed its quarterly numbers.
Although market linked products continued to form the lion’s share of the product mix, HDFC Standard Life managed to increase the share of its protection business in total new business premium to 27.3%. 
What sets the insurer apart from its rivals is this high share of protection business. Protection plans formed hardly 4% of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance’s product portfolio in terms of annualized premium equivalent. Morgan Stanley noted HDFC Standard Life’s superiority here and has rated the stock “outperform"". 
Given the healthy growth across products, the life insurer’s asset under management grew by 27%, faster than the average 20-24% in previous years.
What is to be noted is that such a healthy growth comes on top of the surge in premiums insurers saw during November and December of the previous year due to demonetization. 
This means that insurance penetration, especially those of private insurers, is gathering steam and HDFC Standard Life is reaping benefits due to its superior product mix. It should not surprise that many brokerages have rated the stock a buy ever since the listing. 
Of course, market-linked products contributed the most given that the surge in stock markets over the last two years has pushed many to invest in such insurance plans.
The stock trades at more than four times its estimated embedded value for fiscal 2019 and given the potential growth, analysts are unlikely to temper their expectations. If the life insurer sustains the current growth rate, the stock would be very attractive, especially when seen with the penetration potential of the industry as a whole."

Financial stocks, led by top private lender ICICI Bank Ltd, were the most bought by mutual funds (MFs) in 2017, as fund managers placed their bets on a recovery in Asia’s third-largest economy. 
Domestic MFs pumped in a record Rs1.2 trillion in Indian shares in 2017, when BSE’s 30-share Sensex delivered 27.91% returns.
Five of the top 10 holdings of MFs were financials, ruled by private lenders HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, according to data from Morningstar Inc. The five accounted for 58.9% of the top 10 MFs’ holdings at the end of 2017.
Banking and financial services stocks also made up more than 34% of the top 20 stocks bought by mutual funds in 2017, which included ICICI Bank, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank Ltd, and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.
“Cyclical story of recovery in economy made lenders attractive collectively,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, director of fund research at Morningstar Investment Adviser India Pvt. Ltd, the India unit of Morningstar Inc.
Ritesh Jain, chief investment officer at BNP Paribas Mutual Fund, pointed out that financials have huge weightage and constitute 40% of benchmark indices, and added that portfolios largely mirror that weightage of financials.
“The sector though is expanding—we now have insurance companies, mutual fund companies, brokerage firms that have become diversified financial services companies, and small finance banks,"" Jain said.
Since September, as many as five insurance firms have been listed, namely SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd, New India Assurance Company Ltd and General Insurance Corporation of India, along with Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, a mutual fund. 
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd was listed in 2016.
“So, options are more for asset managers in the financial space,"" Jain said.
Mutual funds stocked up on ICICI Bank shares to the tune of Rs9,928 crore. Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. was a new entrant to the top 10 holdings list of mutual funds as the second most-bought stock. Mutual funds collectively bought Rs8,889 crore worth of the company’s stock.
“ICICI Bank was available at good value early in 2017. HDFC was preferred heavily in 2017 due to the government’s low-cost housing push,"" Belapurkar said.
Surprisingly, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd was the most sold stock by asset managers as they dumped Rs2,410 crore of the stock that slipped two positions to become the eighth-most held stock by domestic MFs. 
“Fund managers locked in gains in Maruti after the sharp rally,"" Belapurkar added."

Mumbai: Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd on Monday reported a 233% jump in its net profit in the December quarter to Rs5,670.21 crore from Rs1,701.21 crore a year ago.
The surge in net profit was due to a one-time gain of Rs5,250.31 crore as HDFC sold 9.52% stake in its arm HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd via an initial public offer.
“In accordance with past practice and with the objective of further strengthening the corporation’s balance sheet the corporation has made an additional provision of Rs1,575 crore to share up the provision and contingencies account and thereby recognise provisions towards specific loans against future risks,"" said HDFC in a notice to BSE.

635,2018-01-30,HDFC,"HDFC saw loan disbursals in the December quarter come from economically weaker and low income group, the two categories which are the biggest beneficiaries of government-sponsored schemes under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana

Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) has perhaps reaped the best of the benefits from the government’s push to the housing market. The operating metrics of the home loan lender for the December quarter clearly show how small loans have driven the game.  
Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) has perhaps reaped the best of the benefits from the government’s push to the housing market. The operating metrics of the home loan lender for the December quarter clearly show how small loans have driven the game. 
On an asset under management basis, the company’s loan book grew 18%, after the 14-15% growth seen in the last four quarters. That translated to a healthy growth of 14% in net interest income and excluding the one-time gain of Rs3,675 crore it made by selling a stake in its life insurance business, HDFC’s profit grew 17%.
The bulk of the loan growth is driven by home loans to individuals belonging to the economically weaker and low-income groups. The mortgage lender saw 39% of its disbursals during the December quarter come from the economically weaker section and another 32% from the low-income group. 
These two categories of borrowers are the biggest beneficiaries of government-sponsored schemes under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. 
HDFC saw its individual loan book growth bounce back to 19% due to these two categories and the management understandably believes this would sustain. That is a rate not seen for more than three years now because of a steady slowdown in the lender’s individual loan book growth. 
Loan disbursals to individuals is the bedrock of HDFC’s business and the fact that growth here has quickened should please investors. Of course, it also means that spreads have come under pressure as the high margin corporate loan book has, in fact, shrunk slightly during the December quarter.
There are two pitfalls of this kind of growth. Given that individual loans garner a lower spread coupled with the fact that interest rates were being reduced for the last two years, there is a hit on spreads. The spread on individual loans narrowed to 1.91% from 2.02% a year ago, bringing down the overall spread by five basis points to 2.29%. A basis point is 0.01%.
Another warning sign should be asset quality. A recent report by the Reserve Bank of India pointed out the fact that non-performing assets are the highest as a percentage of loans given to borrowers in the economically weaker and low-income groups. 
So far, HDFC has managed to keep a check on its asset quality and it believes that small loans are not bad loans. Focusing on these segments for growth is perhaps a good strategy for the company. But the mortgage leader needs to keep its eye on asset quality. HDFC has the wherewithal and the experience to do so, and will be richly rewarded it if keeps a check on its bad loans.
The satisfaction of investors was evident from the 2.66% gain in the mortgage lender’s shares after the results. While the HDFC stock trades at a multiple of over four times estimated book value for the current fiscal year, consistent performance would ensure these valuations don’t change."

Bengaluru: Mahindra Happinest Developers Ltd (MHDL), a joint venture between Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd and HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, will launch its first affordable housing project at Palghar, near Mumbai in February, with homes priced at Rs8 lakh and above, a top company executive said.  
Bengaluru: Mahindra Happinest Developers Ltd (MHDL), a joint venture between Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd and HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, will launch its first affordable housing project at Palghar, near Mumbai in February, with homes priced at Rs8 lakh and above, a top company executive said. 
In the first phase of the project, there will be 850 units across nine acres. Entry price for a one-room kitchen home is around Rs8 lakh, which goes up to Rs20 lakh for a two-bedroom home. 
After half of the homes in the first phase are sold, the company will launch a second phase over another 10-11 acres.
Mahindra Lifespace, the real estate arm of Mahindra Group, partnered with HDFC Capital last year to jointly invest Rs500 crore over the next three years to develop affordable housing projects across cities.
The plan is to build a pipeline of projects of around 7-8 million sq. ft in the next couple of years under the HDFC platform.
“We want to focus on Mumbai and Pune for now, and then look at Bangalore and Haryana. We are scouting for land parcels and the biggest priority today is finding the right location, with good connectivity because we are looking at end users for our projects,"" Anita Arjundas, managing director and CEO, Mahindra Lifespace Developers said over the phone.
“We are building homes at sub-Rs3,000 per sq ft, but we may go up to Rs5,000 per sq ft if we find a location that is closer to town,"" she said. 
Mahindra Lifespace ventured into the affordable housing segment in 2014, through the brand, Happinest and has since launched two projects—in Boisar near Mumbai and Avadi, Chennai.
The new Mahindra Happinest entity has also identified a second land parcel and is in talks to buy 10 acres in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) for a second project, with around 7-8 lakh sq ft of saleable area.
Once the due diligence process is over, the transaction should close in the June quarter and the project will be launched in the second half of 2018, Arjundas said. 
In a further boost to affordable housing, in January, the goods and service tax (GST) council recommended rationalization of GST rates on such projects. GST would be charged at 8% on the total value of under-construction properties, which would be 4 percentage points less than the earlier effective rate of 12%."

Bengaluru: Prestige Estates Projects Ltd on Wednesday said it will create an affordable housing platform with HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, a subsidiary of HDFC Ltd, to jointly invest Rs2,500 crore in low- and mid-income housing projects.
Investments, to be made through a mix of equity and debt, will be used to primarily buy land across cities to develop residential projects, said Venkat K. Narayana, chief executive, Prestige Group.
HDFC Capital has been offering long-term equity capital to select real estate developers, mainly to develop affordable housing, preferred by builders and investors alike. 
Last October, Mahindra Lifespace Developers Ltd, the real estate arm of Mahindra Group, partnered with HDFC Capital to jointly invest Rs500 crore over the next three years to develop affordable housing projects across geographies.
HDFC Capital’s investments are done through its HDFC Capital Affordable Real Estate Fund-1.
HDFC Capital’s first fund is dedicated to addressing this funding gap by providing long-term equity-oriented capital for development in urban and semi-urban peripheral areas, Vipul Roongta, chief executive, HDFC Capital Advisors, said last year.
In line with the government’s aim to provide housing for all by 2022, the Union budget on 1 February proposed to set up an affordable housing fund under the National Housing Bank (NHB).
The 2017 budget had proposed assigning infrastructure status to affordable housing projects and facilitate higher investments. 
Renu Karnad, managing director, HDFC Ltd said, “Affordable Housing has become the new mantra in the country and also a growth driver for the real estate sector. Our association with Prestige Group is to develop affordable homes and cater the largely unmet demand in mid income segment.""
Irfan Razack, chairman and managing director of Prestige Group said, “With this partnership, we are poised to grow manifold, and it will help us continue to build on the legacy of trust and efficacy that we are known for. Our endeavour is to scale up our residential platform, especially in the affordable housing sector that’s picked up huge demand and is currently vacuumed of supply and we are positive that this platform will facilitate long-term, sustainable value creation."" 
Venkat K. Narayana, CEO, Prestige Group, “...This capital will enable us to not only strengthen our presence in the geographies we currently operate, but also to expand into different geographies and tap new growth markets enjoying high demand across the country."""
631,2018-02-08,HDFC,"HDFC Bank raises lending rates by 10 basis points even as RBI holds rates, other major banks are likely to follow suit

New Delhi/Mumbai: India’s struggling economy is facing a new challenge: banks are raising interest rates even though the central bank is leaving its rates unchanged, as risks such as surging bond yields and more provisioning requirements erode their profit. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: India’s struggling economy is facing a new challenge: banks are raising interest rates even though the central bank is leaving its rates unchanged, as risks such as surging bond yields and more provisioning requirements erode their profit.
HDFC Bank, India’s second-biggest bank by assets, on Wednesday became the latest to raise some rates by 10 basis points. The same day, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) kept its policy rate unchanged, to “carefully"" nurture economic growth .
Other major banks are likely to follow suit, raising concerns of de facto rate increases in an economy that is growing at its slowest pace in three years and needs private investment.
An RBI staff study showed every 100 bps increase in borrowing costs lowers the investment rate by as much as 91 bps.
“Lending rates will move up. We cannot avoid that from happening,"" the chief of a large state-run bank told Reuters.
Banks are facing a number of threats. Chief among them is that rising inflation has hurt bonds, driving benchmark 10-year yields up more than 100 bps since July, a big concern for banks, which are the biggest buyers of the debt.
Banks are also facing a higher cost of funds, a key expense for the lenders, and more stringent regulatory requirements for their liquidity coverage ratios, according to Ashish Parthasarthy, treasurer at HDFC Bank.
Banks are also being forced to raise deposit rates so they can attract more funds, and they continue to set aside more capital as they clear a near-record $147 billion in soured debt.
Economists see little relief in sight, but are calling on the RBI to step in to support debt markets, including through debt purchases, thus easing at least one of the major challenges banks face.
In a measure of how much margins are being hit, the spread between the 10-year bond yield and a key lending rate, the median one-year marginal cost-based lending rate, has narrowed to only 80 bps from 200 bps in July.
“Lending rates might go up with such a large increase in bond yields,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at State Bank of India.
“Under such circumstances, it is important to help cool off bond yields to protect the overall interest rates from going up and hurting incipient signs of growth."" Reuters"

Bengaluru: Online classifieds platform Quikr Wednesday introduced QuikrRealty, which will offer online and offline home brokerage services, mortgages and housing finance, through a tie-up with real estate brokerage firm HDFC Realty Ltd. 
Bengaluru: Online classifieds platform Quikr Wednesday introduced QuikrRealty, which will offer online and offline home brokerage services, mortgages and housing finance, through a tie-up with real estate brokerage firm HDFC Realty Ltd.
QuikrRealty will be operated as an independent brand under Quikr which includes the brokerage business of HDFC Realty Ltd, and the online real estate classifieds business of HDFC Red. HDFC Realty which was founded in 2000 currently has presence in 19 cities in India with over 300 expert real estate professionals. 
The new product launch comes just a month after the mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) Ltd sold both of its subsidiaries—HDFC Realty Ltd and HDFC Red—to Quikr for Rs350 Crore.
At a press conference in Bengaluru, HDFC managing director Renu Sud Karnad said the company picked a minority stake of 3% in Quikr as part of the transaction. The stake was valued at Rs357 crore. However, the entire shareholding of HDFC Realty and HDFC Red will be transferred to Quikr.
QuikrRealty will be able to tap into 30 million users currently registered with Quikr, and the company will assist the customer at every step of home buying from discovery of properties to completion of the final transaction.
Quikr already operates two real estate products including QuikrHomes, and CommonFloor which was acquired in early 2016. Users of both QuikrHomes and CommonFloor will soon be able to discover properties listed on HDFC Red and HDFC Realty Ltd.
For developers registered with QuikrRealty, Quikr will offer a facility to run customised promotions and campaigns using data analytics. Consumers on QuikrHomes will be able to seek site visits, make negotiations, and close the deal from the properties they shortlist. Quikr said that it will continue to work with external brokers in all cities across its platforms.
“After the recent regulatory changes, the stars are aligned for a strong market leader to step in and organize home buying in India. We are excited to be that market leader. HDFC’s continued strategic association with QuikrRealty, QuikrHomes and CommonFloor is a testimony to our leadership in real estate and in other large sectors that move the Indian economy,"" said Pranay Chulet, chief executive officer, Quikr in a statement.
Quikr has been on an acquisition spree since 2015 and has acquired 13 companies in total till date across various categories. It started acquiring companies after it shifted its business to a vertical approach from being a horizontal classifieds portal like Craigslist. For this, the company identified key business segments based on user interest and built products on top of each segment instead of expanding horizontally as a single classifieds portal.
Mint reported in January that Quikr is generating half of its revenue from companies it acquired. The home segment is its largest vertical, commanding a 30% share in terms overall revenue."

Bengaluru: HDFC Property Fund, the real estate investment arm of India’s largest mortgage lender, is planning to start raising $500 million from overseas investors, nearly two years after it was originally planned. 
The fund wanted to first exit its earlier investments and return money to investors before raising more funds.
Separately, parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) is firming up plans to invest in distressed real estate assets at a time when the sector is undergoing a prolonged slowdown.
HDFC Property Fund plans to invest in commercial office projects and residential developments in top property markets through equity and structured equity instruments from the new $500 million fund. 
“The life of the fund is around 10 years and so it’s long-term, patient capital that we will invest,"" said a company executive, who didn’t wish to be named. 
This will be HDFC Property’s third offshore fund after it raised a $750 million fund in 2007-08 and a $350 million fund in 2014-15. The second fund has been almost fully deployed. The fund has committed to its investors to complete the exits from the first fund and return capital by 2018. Out of 14 investments it did from the first fund, it has exited 10 so far and the remaining four are expected to be concluded this year, he said. 
HDFC Property recently exited a Rs420 crore investment in Kalpataru Group’s under-construction project in Thane with around Rs1,172 crore, the executive said. 
HDFC vice-chairman and chief executive Keki Mistry said the decision to invest in distressed property assets is because real estate is an area of core competence for the company.
“We are seeing opportunities in the real estate sector. The investments could be in the form of a fund or even a corporate structure,"" Mistry said. He declined to comment on the quantum of investments that will be made. 
HDFC may invest around $500 million in distressed real estate assets, said a person familiar with the development, requesting anonymity. 
On the real estate investment front, HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd also raised $550 million in December, in an initial closure of its second affordable housing fund.
The fund, which is currently in active deployment mode, had Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) as one of its key investors. 
In February, Prestige Estates Projects Ltd announced a partnership with HDFC Capital to create an affordable housing platform that will jointly invest Rs2,500 crore in low and mid-income residential projects. 
IIFL Asset Management Ltd is also planning to raise its first offshore affordable housing fund of up to $500 million in the next financial year, Mint reported on 23 January. 
While fund-raising for real estate projects hasn’t been easy, raising capital from offshore investors have always been tougher given that many vintage funds of 2005-06 didn’t generate adequate returns. 
“The new regulatory and taxation regime, with RERA and GST, there is an increased level of transparency and a level playing field expected in real estate. Despite the slowdown in the sector, investors believe in the high demand for residential projects and see an opportunity to invest,"" said Shobhit Agarwal, managing director and CEO of investment banking firm ANB Capital Advisors Pvt Ltd."

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday directed HDFC Bank Ltd to strengthen its existing systems and controls to prevent any leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information so that no entity is able to breach Sebi’s insider trading norms and make illegitimate gains. 
Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday directed HDFC Bank Ltd to strengthen its existing systems and controls to prevent any leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information so that no entity is able to breach Sebi’s insider trading norms and make illegitimate gains.
Sebi ordered the country’s largest private sector lender to submit a report on its present systems and controls and the details of the entities responsible for monitoring such systems.
The bank has been ordered by the market regulator to conduct an internal inquiry into the leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information relating to its financial figures, including non-performing assets (NPAs), and take appropriate action against those responsible for the same.
Sebi has also ordered HDFC Bank to find out the possible role of certain persons in relation to the recent leakage of unpublished price-sensitive information (UPSI) with regards to the bank’s 2017-2018 June quarter results.
When contacted, an HDFC bank spokesperson said: “We have so far not read the order but it goes without saying that we will comply with the order as we are a very compliance- and regulations-driven organization.""
This is the second order from Sebi with regard to cases relating to leakage of sensitive company-related information through private digital messaging applications such as WhatsApp, ahead of the official announcement on stock exchanges by the concerned company.
On 28 December, Sebi had passed a similar order against Axis Bank Ltd, another privately held lender. Axis Bank was asked by Sebi to conduct an internal inquiry into the suspected leak of its June quarter financial results.
Sebi, in its order against HDFC Bank, said that it had initiated a probe into the lender after certain newspaper articles referred to circulation of UPSI in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies ahead of their official announcements to stock exchanges.
During the course of preliminary examination, Sebi observed that the messages circulated on WhatsApp closely matched the HDFC Bank results for the April-June quarter, which were published subsequently.
The actual results of HDFC Bank were announced on 24 July 2017 at 12.12 pm.
However, as per the Sebi probe, some WhatsApp messages mentioning certain key numbers from HDFC Bank’s Q1FY18 results started circulating from 21 July 2017.
The probe found that a WhatsApp post stated HDFC Bank’s gross NPA figure at 1.25% on 21 July, while the actual results showed this figure as 1.24% on 24 July. Similarly, a WhatsApp post ahead of the official announcement of the results stated the bank’s net profit at Rs3,900 crore while the actual net profit as per the official announcement stood at Rs3,893.84 crore.
Sebi found that a similar incident took place during the time of announcement of the bank’s December 2015 quarterly results as well.
Sebi found that a WhatsApp post at 0951 hours on 25 January 2016 stated HDFC Bank’s net interest income (NII) for the quarter ended December 2015 at Rs.7,050 crore while the official announcement at 1407 hours on the same day showed this number at Rs7,068 crore.
Similarly, on the same day, the bank’s net profit for the quarter was stated at Rs3,350 crore by a WhatsApp post while the actual profit declared later stood at Rs3,350 crore.
Sebi found that the financial results of HDFC Bank for quarter-ended 30 June 2017 were finalized on or before 19 July 2017, which was right before the beginning of circulation of the WhatsApp message on 21 July 2017.
However, Sebi could not ascertain the source of the WhatsApp earnings leak.
“Such leakage is prima facie attributable to the inadequacy of the processes /controls/ systems that HDFC Bank as a listed company had put in place,"" read the Sebi order.
HDFC Bank, in its reply to Sebi said that the concerned officials had shared the information on unpublished Gross NPA, NPA and profit figures with the concerned employees of the bank and with the statutory auditors, for official purposes and on a need to know basis.
Sebi, in its order, has asked the bank to find out the role of the members of its various committees involved in generation of the original data for the purpose of determination of key figures pertaining to financial figures. The bank is also required to probe the persons involved in the preparation of HDFC Bank’s board notes and presentations.
“The inquiry directed above shall be completed within a period of three months from the date of this order, and within seven days from the completion thereof, HDFC Bank shall file a report to Sebi in that regard,"" said the Sebi order.

Mumbai: Economic growth is on an upward move as the twin impacts of demonetisation and GST implementation wane, and will accelerate to 7.3% next fiscal from 6.5% this year, says a report.
Improvement in private consumption, increase in capacity utilization and private capex cycle revival will be driving higher growth,a report by HDFC Bank’s economists said.
“We are optimistic about the growth outlook in FY19 as the recovery gains momentum and the effects of the note-ban shock and GST related disruptions fade... We expect GDP growth to pick up to 7.3% in FY19 from 6.5% in FY18,"" its chief economist Abheek Barua said today, estimating the December quarter growth print to come at 6.9%. Real GDP growth will move upward to 7.2% in the last fiscal of 2017-18, it said.
It can be noted that India GDP growth rate had slipped to a three-year low of 5.7% for the first quarter and climbed up to 6.3% in the succeeding three months.
The report said there will be a slowdown in the agricultural sector growth, but it will be compensated by a faster surge in industries and services sectors. As the impact of GST rollout fades, the industrial sector, especially manufacturing, will see a rebound in activity, he said.
An uptick is expected on the services front as well on factors like a favourable base effect, recovery in most of the lead indicators like deposit and credit for banks, cargo handled at major ports, passengers carried by domestic airlines and foreign tourist arrivals, he said.
Agri growth, however, will be tepid at 1.5% for the third quarter because of a 2.8% dip in Kharif crop output, a lag in area under Rabi cultivation and an unfavourable base effect, it said. However, agriculture growth will accelerate to up to 4% in 2018-19 on a favourable base and assuming a normal monsoon, Barua said.
 Rising farm output, coupled with higher minimum support prices announced by government are likely to improve farm incomes and rural consumption, it said."

Mumbai: Private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd is looking to launch its equity share sale of up to $2.5 billion (around Rs15,000 crore) in a fortnight, while HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd (HDFC AMC) will be filing its draft initial public offer (IPO) papers, said three people aware of the developments.  
Mumbai: Private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd is looking to launch its equity share sale of up to $2.5 billion (around Rs15,000 crore) in a fortnight, while HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd (HDFC AMC) will be filing its draft initial public offer (IPO) papers, said three people aware of the developments. 
In December, HDFC Bank said it is planning to raise up to Rs24,000 crore through a combination of preferential allotment and qualified institutional placement (QIP). The bank said it will be raising nearly one-third (Rs8,500 crore) of the sum from parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC). “The bank will be launching its fund-raising very soon, likely around mid-March. They are waiting for regulatory approval, which should come this week,"" said one of the people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media. 
According to the second person cited above, HDFC Bank’s equity fund-raising will be a mix of a domestic qualified institutional placement (QIP) and overseas fund-raising via American depositary receipts/shares (ADR/ADS). 
“Like the last time it raised funds from the markets, the share sale this time, too, would be a mix of a QIP and overseas fund-raising. Majority of the fund-raising will be through the overseas share sale,"" he said. He, too, spoke on condition of anonymity.
In February 2015, HDFC Bank raised Rs10,000 crore through a mix of QIP and ADRs, with around Rs2,000 crore raised through the domestic QIP and the rest through an overseas share sale. “We don’t comment on market speculation/rumours,"" said a spokesperson for HDFC Bank in an email response to Mint’s queries. 
Indian banks have been busy raising funds in the past 12 months, with several large QIP offerings from both private sector and state-owned banks. Last year, State Bank of India raised Rs15,000 crore through a QIP, while private sector lenders Kotak Mahindra Bank raised Rs5,803 crore. 
Another HDFC group firm—HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd (HDFC AMC)—will be filing its so-called draft red herring prospectus for an IPO soon. HDFC AMC is a joint venture between mortgage lender HDFC and Standard Life Investments Ltd.
“HDFC AMC will be filing its DRHP in the next few days. The IPO, a pure offer for sale, will see the two JV partners sell stake worth around $550-600 million,"" said the third person cited above, also requesting anonymity. 
In November, HDFC and Standard Life said they plan to dilute their shareholding to at least 50.01% and 24.99% respectively, through dilution in one or more tranches. As of 30 September, HDFC held a 57.36% stake in the company, while Standard Life held 38.24% stake. 
HDFC AMC manages total assets under management of Rs2,69,781 crore, of which Rs1,19,159 crore is in equity oriented funds, as of 30 September. HDFC AMC is also the second asset management company to go public, following the IPO of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd, which went public in October.
Transactions at the group follow the recent fund-raisings at the parent company HDFC. 
On Tuesday, HDFC launched its QIP offering to raise Rs1,896 crore. It is also raising another Rs11,104 crore from top institutional investors like KKR, GIC and Premji Invest, among others.
HDFC will be issuing shares to these investors on a preferential allotment basis at a price of Rs1,726.05 a share, raising Rs11,104 crore. The preferential allotment represents 3.87% of HDFC’s enhanced equity share capital post the issue."

The sale process will begin as soon as the lender gets the required regulatory approvals, they said.
HDFC Bank plans to raise the bulk of the funds from international investors through a sale of American depository receipts, with the rest to come from selling stock in India, the people said. The money will be used to boost the lender’s capital buffers and support its growth plans for several years, Paresh Sukthankar, deputy managing director of HDFC Bank said in January.

The lender’s board approved in December a fund raising of as much as Rs24,000 crore through a share sale. Parent company Housing Development Finance Corp. will invest about Rs8,500 crore, it said at the time.

Mumbai: After global banks like Citibank, Bank of America and JP Morgan Chase, HDFC Bank Ltd Tuesday barred the use of its credit, debit and prepaid cards to buy or trade in cryptocurrenices like bitcoins, 
In a late evening note to its customers on Tuesday, HDFC Bank said, “You may be aware of the increasing global apprehensions regarding Bitcoins, Cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also cautioned the public regarding the potential economic, operational, legal and security related risks associated in dealing with such currencies. 
“To ensure our customers’ security, we have decided to not permit usage of HDFC Bank Credit, Debit and Prepaid Cards towards purchase or trading of such Bitcoins, Cryptocurrencies and virtual currencies, on merchants suspected to be dealing in cryptocurrency or online foreign exchange trading or both...""
Ever since the price of bitcoins skyrocketed from a little under $1,000 in 2016 to touch nearly $20,000 in 2017, people have been faced with the dilemma of whether or not to buy cryptocurrencies.
On the one hand, there is the fear of losing out on an opportunity to make money, investing in a virtual currency whose price is extremely volatile and whose true value cannot be assessed. It comes with its own risks as well. For instance, the current value of a bitcoin is under $10,000.
Adding to the confusion, most governments remain non-committal on the legality of bitcoins since it is not regulated by central banks. Some governments like that of South Korea and China have explicitly warned investors to exercise caution while those like the Indian government have begun imposing a tax on the gains from the sale of bitcoins.
A bitcoin is an open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that runs on blockchain technology, which is a distributed ledger that contains details of every transaction, allowing a user’s computer to verify the validity of each transaction of this virtual currency. Hence, the transactions are transparent to every user. In India, you can buy bitcoins from dedicated exchanges like Unocoin or Zebpay by downloading apps or using websites.

 The plan allows you to lock in your annuity rate at the time of buying the deferred annuity option. In a typical deferred annuity plan, you invest first and then use this money to buy an annuity at the then prevailing interest rate. In that sense, the plan by HDFC Life takes care of the interest rate risk. But is that enough? 
The immediate annuity plan offers two options—annuity for life; and annuity for life with return of purchase price. The first option pays annuity for life. On death of the annuitant, the benefits stop. In the second option, the plan returns the purchase price to the nominee. You can take it on an individual basis or on a joint life basis (annuity will continue as long as one of the annuitants is alive, and return the purchase price on death of both annuitants under the second option). 
Annuity rates are guaranteed for life. Typically, the older you are the higher is the annuity rate.
Under this option, you buy the annuity upfront and lock in to the current annuity rate; pay-outs happen later. This option comes with a return of purchase price variant with single and joint life options. The maximum deferment period is 10 years. 
The annuity pay-out rate depends on factors such as age and deferment period: the older you are and higher the deferment period, the more is the annuity pay-out. On annuitant’s death, the return of purchase price option pays a minimum of 110% of the purchase price as death benefit. 
“This policy offers better liquidity options than other annuity instruments. It offers a loan facility during the deferment period and also surrender at any point for the return of purchase price options. The surrender amount will be the present value of all future benefits discounted at the prevailing interest rate plus 2%,"" said Srinivasan Parthasarathy, senior executive vice president, chief actuary and appointed actuary, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
Under the immediate annuity option for a sum of Rs50 lakh, a 60-year-old will get life annuity at a rate of 8.12% and the return of purchase price option will come at 6.57%. (You could instead consider the insurer’s new immediate annuity plan that offers a better rate.) For deferred annuity pay-out, advertised annuity rates are up to 13%. But this is not how you should look at this product. 
The higher interest rate is due to the fact that you commit a big corpus in advance. You forgo an opportunity to get returns on this. So, the time value of money actually erodes the value of money. It’s on this eroded value that the annuity rates apply. Say, a 50-year-old buys deferred annuity with a deferment period of 10 years, with a purchase price of Rs50 lakh. The product offers a guaranteed pay-out of Rs6.27 lakh per annum or an annuity rate of about 12.54%. But this can be misleading as this is the rate at which the payouts happen. What you need to know is the rate of return, for which you need to factor in the time value of money. If you consider that, the actual return will be about 6.3%, assuming the person lives till 90 years of age. 
Annuities make sense for those who want guaranteed pay-outs. But retirement is also about managing longevity risks and so one needs to ensure that investments beat inflation. We suggest you have only a portion on your money in annuities. 
The deferred annuity variant of this plan takes away the interest rate risk, but at a cost. One needs to be mindful of the economic scenario when taking a call on the deferred annuity option, said Shyam Sunder, managing director, Peak Alpha Investment Services Pvt. Ltd. “We are likely to move into an upward interest rate cycle, so locking into a rate at the lowest point in the cycle may not be advisable. Further, if a person has 10 years to retirement, then I recommend a more aggressive approach by investing in equities so that a person is able to achieve higher returns instead of keeping the money in an annuity that yields low returns of 2.3-7.1%,"" he added."

Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter. 
Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter.
Chief executive officers at HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. —the nation’s largest private lenders by assets — are among bankers yet to receive bonuses for the financial year ended 31 March 2017, as the Reserve Bank of India hasn’t signed off on the proposed payments, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. They declined to give further details. Business Standard newspaper had previously reported the delays.
ICICI’s board had approved a bonus of Rs2.2 crore ($340,000) for CEO Chanda Kochhar while Axis Bank’s Shikha Sharma was set to receive Rs1.35 crore and HDFC Bank’s Aditya Puri about Rs2.9 crore, exchange filings show. A spokesman for Axis Bank declined to comment. Spokesmen for HDFC Bank and ICICI didn’t reply to emails and phone calls. An email to the RBI wasn’t immediately answered.
Long considered healthier than their government-run peers, India’s private banks have had a tough time over the past year, plagued by revelations of hidden bad loans and alleged lapses in corporate governance. Rising defaults have enraged the public, piling pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act against the perpetrators and reinforce his anti-graft image before elections next year.
Going by historical evidence, the RBI should have approved the bonuses well before 31 March 2018, said Asutosh Kumar Mishra, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. “We have never noticed such delay in approving the payouts, but then we haven’t seen a year in which so many skeletons were brought out of the closet — from under-reporting of bad loans to serious governance issues.""
In the year ended March 2017 — for which the bonuses are under contention — an RBI audit showed Axis hadn’t disclosed bad loans worth about Rs5,600 crore. HDFC Bank also reported a divergence and ICICI said it isn’t required to make disclosures on the topic even as provisions for bad loans climbed.
Axis Bank shares rose about 10% and ICICI 17% in Mumbai trading during the year ended March 2017, while the 10-member Bankex Index added 33%. HDFC Bank shares jumped had 35% during the period.
“Private banks will likely report sharp rise in slippages, led by ICICI Bank and Axis Bank,"" said analysts led by M.B. Mahesh at Kotak Institutional Equities, referring to higher delinquent loans. They predict January-March 2018 results would confirm a quarter of “pain"" for Indian lenders. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: Housing Development and Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) has raised its lending rates by up to 0.20 percentage points, in line with similar moves by commercial banks.
The increase in the retail prime lending rate (RPLR), on which it benchmarks the adjustable rate home loans (ARHL), is effective from 1 April, an official statement said.
A company spokesperson said the rate hike is progressive, between 0.05 percentage points to 0.20 percentage points, with the lowest hike applicable to the low-ticket size loan. A loan for under Rs30 lakh by a female borrower, which is the lowest rate offered by the lender, will now be available at 8.40%, the spokesperson said, adding for others it will be 8.45%.
Home loans between Rs30 lakh and Rs75 lakh will be available at 8.55% for women borrowers and 8.60% for others, while those above Rs75 lakh will be for 8.65% for women and 8.70% for others.
Despite no rate hikes by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the liquidity squeeze has resulted in several banks hiking interest rate offerings since late 2017. It started with the private sector lenders like Axis Bank, Yes Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank hiking their marginal cost of funding-based lending rates (MCLR), and gradually percolated down to all the banks in the system including the largest lender State Bank of India."

605,2018-04-19,HDFC,"HDFC Standard Life's results for FY18 clearly show that it can on its own justify why the stock trades at over four times the embedded value

Having entered the Rs1 trillion market capitalization elite league, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s stock was looking expensive if not priced to perfection. In comparison to peers, the stock was an outlier with a strong run, partly due to the fortunes of the respective groups to which they belonged. 
Having entered the Rs1 trillion market capitalization elite league, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s stock was looking expensive if not priced to perfection. In comparison to peers, the stock was an outlier with a strong run, partly due to the fortunes of the respective groups to which they belonged.
But the private sector insurer’s results for fiscal year 2018 (FY18) clearly show that it can on its own justify why the stock trades at more than four times the embedded value even now without borrowing the goodwill of investors for the HDFC Group.
For FY18, the insurer’s new business premium grew 32%. That along with a strong growth of 13% in renewal premium and an improvement in persistency ratios across tenures shows that not only are its products flying off the shelf but customers are sticking to their choices. This is a sweet spot for a life insurer and if the company wants to continue basking in the love of its investors, it would do well to safeguard this spot.
Another cheerful metric is that HDFC Standard Life has succeeded in increasing the share of protection products in the overall portfolio to 26% from 22% a year ago on a new business premium basis as brokers and agents pushed this product. Protection products are good for margins and hence profitability of the insurer. The company’s value of new business thus rose by 39% to Rs1,280 crore and margins also improved to 23.2% from 22%.
Nevertheless, HDFC Standard Life did have some help from market circumstances in its business growth. The growth in new business premium got a push from market-linked products, predominantly in the fourth quarter. That is because the government levied a long-term capital gains tax on profit made through shares but with a caveat that gains up to March-end will be grandfathered. However, insurance products linked to shares were kept out of the purview of this tax.
What investors may find a concern is the rise in the ratio of expenses-to-premium income of the private sector insurer. The ratio rose to 13.5% for FY18 from 12.6% in the previous year. Commissions as a percentage of total premium also rose to 4.6% from 4.1%. Given that the insurer intends to invest in technology to push its products through online channels, the relief from expenses would be hard to come immediately.
HDFC Standard Life’s product mix is without doubt superior to its peers’ simply because of the large share of margin-friendly protection products. Nevertheless, compared to its peers, the stock trades at a value that has priced in superior performance."
603,2018-04-23,HDFC,"HDFC Bank's unsecured loans have grown at a rapid pace, and the home loan segment hasn't grown muchtrends that can cause much investor concern

As usual, private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd’s March quarter (Q4) results met analysts’ expectations.  
As usual, private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd’s March quarter (Q4) results met analysts’ expectations. 
Net profit in the March quarter stood at Rs4,799 crore, up 20% on a year-on-year basis (y-o-y) and a record high, thanks to robust growth in “other income"".
Net interest margin remained at 4.3% and asset quality too was largely stable. 
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances during Q4 marginally deteriorated on a sequential basis, but the net NPA ratio improved.
While HDFC Bank Ltd has remained fairly immune to the corporate bad loan issues faced by other lenders, investors in the stock would need to watch some key trends. 
For instance, its overall loan book, which grew 18.7% y-o-y in Q4, saw its retail loan book rising at a faster pace than the wholesale loan book. It should be noted that its loan book has clocked 20% plus growth in previous quarters (see chart).
“This time the corporate loan book grew at a slower pace and one should bear in mind that could have been a conscious decision by the management to go slow here after the events that unfolded with Punjab National Bank. And in the current environment, we do not expect the bank to aggressively push its corporate loan book,"" said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Institutional Equities.
This means for the overall loan book to sustain at healthy levels, retail loan book growth should maintain this momentum. HDFC Bank is better placed than its peers to increase market share, but increasing penetration of small finance banks and NBFCs in this segment would keep competitive intensity high.
The bank’s unsecured loans have grown at a rapid pace, which is a concern because any increase in retail delinquencies could erode the bank’s asset quality going ahead, analysts said. Its home loan segment has also not grown much.
Lastly, analysts should also track the bank’s fund raising plan.
The board approved issue of perpetual debt instruments (part of additional tier I capital), tier II capital bonds and long-term bonds (financing of infrastructure and affordable housing) up to Rs50,000 crore in the next 12 months through private placement, subject to approval of shareholders.
Nitin Aggarwal, vice-president and banking analyst at Motilal Oswal Institutional Equities Ltd, sees the shareholders’ nod as one of the key triggers for the HDFC Bank Ltd stock since it indicates that the bank is focusing on its growth in the next phase."

HDFC Bank Ltd has increased rates for fixed deposits (FDs) below Rs1 crore for most tenures above 1 year, in the range of 10-100 basis points (bps). One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. With this, the highest rate for non-bulk FDs (less than Rs1 crore) from HDFC Bank with a tenure of 1 year 17 days to 5 years has reached 7% (see graph). There has been no change for FDs of tenures longer than 5 years.

There has been no change for FDs of tenures longer than 5 years. 
Some customers of HDFC Bank received an email stating that the higher rates were available for just three days. However, the new rates will be applicable till the next revision, HDFC Bank clarified later. 
HDFC Bank is not the first lender to hike FD rates. In February, State Bank of India had increased rates on term deposits by 10-75 bps. 
Banks are increasing deposit rates to deal with the tightening liquidity condition. Banks use the money collected through deposits to lend to borrowers. If the demand for credit from borrowers goes up, more money should flow in, in the form of deposits. 
Data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) suggests that growth in demand for credit is higher than growth in deposits. For instance, for public sector banks, annual growth in aggregate deposits in the quarter ending December was 0.9%, while bank credit growth was 6%. Similarly, for private sector banks, deposits grew 13.5%, but credit growth was 23.6%, in the same period. This creates a mismatch. To rectify the situation, banks try to attract more depositors through higher FD rates. 
This also means that the cost of funds for banks is going up. This will impact the marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR), making MCLR-linked loans costlier in the next revision cycle. Which explains why interest rates on loans have also been increased by many large banks despite the RBI not having raised the repo rate.
With the interest cycle turning, other banks too could revise their FD rates upwards to boost demand. 
Prakash Praharaj, founder, MaxSecure Financial Planners, said that as people are learning about mutual funds, many of them prefer to invest in them instead of FDs. Mutual funds also have some tax advantages over FDs. For instance, for Section 80C investments, mutual funds have a lock-in of three years, whereas tax-saving FDs have a lock-in of five years. 
Senior citizens too are opting for senior citizen schemes that give a return of 8%, said Praharaj. 
Though banks are increasing their FD rates, returns on an investment should not be the only deciding factor when you invest. You should also keep in mind your risk profile, investment time-frame, related goals and asset allocation. Asset allocation helps in diversifying your risk as well as in achieving financial goals in the most efficient manner; so when one asset goes down, it does not have a drastic impact on the entire portfolio."

On standalone basis, HDFC posted 39.23% rise in net profit to Rs2,846.22 crore in the reported quarter compared to Rs2,044.2 crore earlier. Total income grew 13.14% to Rs9,633.89 crore as against Rs8,514.51 crore in the year-ago period."
598,2018-05-01,HDFC,"HDFC management explained that growth in affordable housing loans was robust, mainly coming from economically backward and low income groups

Can the largest mortgage lender be immune to the pain of the industry it lends to? 
Can the largest mortgage lender be immune to the pain of the industry it lends to?
A look at Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) shows that the answer is a yes and a no. 
HDFC trumped analysts’ expectations on profit by reporting a 39% growth in profit after tax. Its growth metrics were also impressive with its balance sheet growing 18%. Considering the size of its balance sheet, this is indeed cheering.
As always, the driver of growth has been individual loans that grew 18% on an assets under management basis. Disbursals jumped 29% for FY18. If we view this alongside the ongoing narrative of the real estate industry, HDFC comes across like a shining beacon.
So where is the pain?
HDFC’s corporate loan book shrank from a year ago and the overall non-individual book grew by 17% and that too largely because of growth in construction finance. This is lower than the average 20%- and-above growth in the last three quarters.
The non-individual book is the margin-friendly part of HDFC’s balance sheet as individual loans tend to be given at lower rates. A slowing corporate loan book doesn’t augur well for the future of spreads for the lender. 
So, how was HDFC able to maintain its spread at 2.29%, have a balance sheet growth of 18% and exceed profit expectations?
The mortgage king undoubtedly benefited from the government’s thrust on affordable housing. The HDFC management explained that growth in affordable housing loans was robust, mainly coming from the economically backward and low- income groups. The two categories showed a growth of 32% and 41%, respectively.
HDFC seems to have cracked the code on asset quality. Unlike the concerns expressed on loans to government subsidized low-income groups, the mortgage lender has managed to keep its bad loans below 1% of its individual book. 
Recall that the Reserve Bank of India had warned that delinquencies are higher in the small-sized loans given to low-income and economically backward segments. “Asset quality is not different in affordable housing. The way we approach a loan does not change,"" said Keki Mistry, vice chairman and chief executive of HDFC.
Perhaps this is why the stock gained 1.5% on Monday, even though it trades at nearly five times its estimated book value for FY19.
While HDFC was not immune to the pain in real estate, the lender simply used the government’s push to offset this. The management hasn’t given a guidance for future quarters. But HDFC’s track record gives enough comfort for investors."
597,2018-05-04,HDFC,"Without disclosing the nature of violations, Sebi said it has kept the HDFC AMC IPO papers in abeyance for examination of past violations

New Delhi: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has put on hold the initial public offering of HDFC’s mutual fund arm HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, due to past violations, according to a filing on the markets regulator’s website. 
New Delhi: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has put on hold the initial public offering of HDFC’s mutual fund arm HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, due to past violations, according to a filing on the markets regulator’s website.
“Sebi has sent a letter to lead manager Kotak Mahindra Bank that proceedings have been kept in abeyance for examination of past violations,"" the regulator said on its website.
The regulator did not disclose the nature of these violations but its move could be due to a past front running case. Front running is the practice of a broker or trader stepping in front of large orders to gain economic advantage.
In the Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) present on the regulator’s website HDFC AMC said, “we are involved in an investigation initiated by Sebi with regard to alleged front-running and violation of securities laws"".
Calls and text messages sent to Millind Barve, managing director of HDFC AMC, did not result in a response until press time. 
This will likely push HDFC’s Rs3500 crore public offering to at least the third quarter of the financial year when the fund house was earlier looking at June for the IPO. 
The fund house is offering 8,592,970 equity shares of HDFC AMC at Rs5 each.
“The investigation is still on-going and may take sometime to finish. Sebi’s investigation in the front running case case was three levels - one involved key officials of fund house, the second involved equities dealers who received privileged information, and the third involved intermediaries who made gains for themselves and in their client accounts,"" said a person familiar with the developments declining to be named. 
Once the investigation is complete, the regulator will pass final orders. Only after that the company will get a green light for its IPO, he added. 
On 24 July 2014, Sebi had barred Nilesh Kapadia, former dealer of equities at HDFC AMC, for 10 years for providing privileged information to three traders. 
Subsequently, Sebi on 18 January 2016 had asked Kapadia, his wife and five others to disgorge “ill-gotten"" gains to the tune of Rs3.35 crore.  
Another big public offer being kept in abeyance is that of National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), due to pending investigation in a matter of alleged unfair access to few brokers who traded on NSE’s algorithmic trading platform. According to a Mint report on 9 March the IPO is likely to happen only in 2019."

Mumbai: Facebook Inc. is set to launch its WhatsApp payment services to the whole of India as early as next week in an attempt to win market share from rivals Paytm and Google Tez, even though its partners aren’t all ready, said people familiar with the matter.
WhatsApp Pay will partner HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. to process the transfers, and State Bank of India (SBI) will join once it has the necessary systems in place, the people said. Facebook was aiming for a full rollout with four partners but decided to go ahead with just three as its rivals were racing ahead, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.
The entry of WhatsApp into India’s payments space has been likened to WeChat, which reshaped payments in China when it expanded beyond messaging. The pilot version of WhatsApp Pay—started with 1 million users in February—received rave reviews, threatening the market share of incumbents Google Tez and Alibaba-backed Paytm, which lack the benefits of a social network.
“WhatsApp has a great starting point: a monopoly in chat,"" said Vivek Belgavi, leader for financial technology at PwC India. “High engagement makes it a credible competition.""
More than 200 million Indians already use WhatsApp messaging, equivalent to 60% of the US population and a daily active usage that Forrester Inc. estimates to be about 20 times higher than Paytm’s.
Emails to representatives of WhatsApp, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank weren’t immediately answered."

On Thursday, HDFC Bank shares surged as much as 5.03% to a record high of Rs2,150 in intraday trade on the BSE. The stock closed at Rs2136.15, up .36% from its previous close, while the Sensex ended 1.19% up at 35,322.38 points.
Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked stock exchanges to close the trading window—popularly known as the “6 lakh series"" which allowed FIIs to trade among themselves in stocks where the foreigners’ quota has been exhausted—effective 1 July.
When stocks get into FII restriction, there is a separate window on which only FIIs trade so that they still have the option of buying the stock. Since the buyer will be purchasing from another FII, it ensures that there is no change in FII shareholding. For stocks in demand this usually leads to an FII premium, Macquarie analysts said in the note.
When the stock will be open for FII trading on 1 June—the headroom will be 143 basis points. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“Now that this will be the last opportunity for FIIs to buy HDFCB (HDFC Bank), we think that the scrapping of FII window will increase the quantum of buying that will come in on 1st June. The buying could be more than $1bn on June 1,"" HDFC Bank analysts Suresh Ganapathy, Nishant Shah and Akash Nainani said in a note on 29 May.
HDFC Bank ADRs (American Depository Receipts) spiked up 8.62% to $105.17 in Wednesday’s trade.
The analysts pointed that HDFC Bank usually has the highest FII premium—it used to be higher than 20% before it came crashing down in Feb 2017 when the stock opened up for FIIs for a day, and premium is now running at around 3.5%."

Mumbai: The cabinet on Wednesday cleared one of the largest foreign direct investment (FDI) proposals before it—a plan by HDFC Bank Ltd to raise  ₹ 24,000 crore. 
The capital infusion will not result in breaching the foreign equity holding cap of 74% in the private sector lender. “The current 72.62% foreign equity holding is being raised to 74% with this  ₹ 24,000 crore FDI,"" said interim finance minister Piyush Goyal.
The bank’s management had made clear its intention to boost corporate lending at a time when other lenders are slowing down. The bank had announced its plans to raise  ₹ 24,000 crore, the largest by any company, through a combination of preferential allotment and qualified institutional placement on 20 December. 
Of this, the bank will raise  ₹ 8,500 crore by selling shares to its parent Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, India’s largest mortgage lender. 
The home financier owns 21.01% in HDFC Bank and will infuse funds in the bank to maintain its current shareholding.
The remaining  ₹ 15,500 crore will be raised through the sale of shares, convertible securities or depository receipts. 
“Given the high appetite for the bank’s shares among domestic and foreign investors, we don’t see an issue in the subscription of these shares,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.

Mumbai: HDFC Bank Ltd, the world’s most expensive major lender, is considering relying entirely on the Indian market for a share sale that could raise as much as  ₹ 15,500 crore ($2.3 billion), people with knowledge of the matter said.
The Mumbai-based bank is weighing seeking all the capital through a qualified institutional placement in India, rather than its usual practice of splitting the fund-raising between an offering of local stock and a sale of American depositary receipts, according to the people. HDFC Bank aims to start taking investor orders within the next couple of weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
HDFC Bank is focusing on an offering in India because it hasn’t finished preparing its latest financial statements under U.S. accounting standards, which it would need for an American depositary receipt (ADR) sale, according to the people.
It wants to proceed with the fund-raising soon in order to take advantage of the current market sentiment, the people said. India’s benchmark stock index has posted four straight weeks of gains, the longest stretch since April, amid optimism that economic growth will be boosted by good monsoon rainfall.
The planned share sale would rank as one of the biggest-ever Indian equity offerings in local-currency terms, data compiled by Bloomberg show. HDFC Bank, helmed by chief executive officer Aditya Puri, has consistently maintained a low bad-loan ratio by limiting its exposure to heavily indebted Indian companies and lending to the country’s growing middle class.
HDFC Bank said in December its board had approved a potential equity offering of as much as  ₹ 24,000 crore, with its parent company Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd planning to invest  ₹ 8,500 crore. It will use the money to boost its capital buffers and support its growth plans for several years, deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar said last week.
The lender is still waiting on some regulatory approvals before launching the share sale, the people said. The timeline could slip, and details of the offering may still change, according to the people.
A representative for HDFC Bank said he couldn’t immediately comment.
HDFC Bank appointed arrangers including Bank of America Corp., Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG for the offering, Bloomberg News reported in March. It also appointed JPMorgan Chase & Co., Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd., IIFL Holdings Ltd. and JM Financial Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.
The lender has the biggest weighting in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex. HDFC Bank trades in Mumbai at about 4.8 times book value, making it the most expensive among lenders across the globe with at least $50 billion in market value, data compiled by Bloomberg show."

The S&P BSE Sensex’s 4.3% gain this year has masked a selloff in mid- and small-sized stocks, sparked largely by the stringent margin requirements imposed earlier this month that prompted traders to flee these counters. The losses have left smaller firms trading near the biggest price discount to the Sensex since December 2016, a gap that is likely to widen as the flight-to-quality trade plays out, Relli said.
While the economy has grown, expanding at the fastest pace in nearly two years in the January to March quarter, improvement in company profits has lagged. Average net income of the 50 Nifty companies is projected to have risen 17% in the April-June period from a year ago, slowing from more than 24% growth in each of the previous two quarters.
Earnings have in the recent years been “plagued by skepticism, false starts, consistent downgrades and a few structurally challenged segments,"" making investors doubtful about further sharp expansion, Relli said.
Below are some of Relli’s views on specific topics:
What factors will impact stocks in the next 12 months?
Positive factors could include: good rainfall, economic growth, inflation that is “under control,"" a likely pause in local interest rate hikes after September, improvement in global sentiment toward emerging markets and oil stabilizing at about $65. Negative factors could include: a further oil rally (impacting Indian interest rates, inflation and currency), expectations of a hung parliament and a rise in interest rates overseas resulting in continued emerging market underperformance.
How do elections impact investor sentiment?
Investors will increasingly focus on the possible outcomes of the next general elections due in April or May 2019 and prospects for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s BJP. The market could become jittery if national and regional opposition parties form “opportunistic alliances"" against the ruling coalition.
What are the themes for equity investors?
Consumer-oriented businesses such as consumer goods, auto and auto-parts makers, as well as banks and financial services will continue performing well and should be accumulated during “sharp temporary selloffs."" Investors should reweight their equity portfolios toward larger stocks, as 2017’s bull run drove up weightings of small and mid-caps.
Note: The Sensex rose 28% last year, while gauges of mid- and small-sized companies surged at least 48% each.
What is your outlook on fund flows?
Local money has piggybacked on the domestic rally. That’s helped insulate us from selling by foreign investors, which has been large intermittently from August. Only when there is a sharp selloff, resulting in the Nifty going below 9,600, will we see serious outflows by local investors. Foreign fund flows will be a function of their view on the rupee and the attractiveness of Indian equity/debt market returns versus those of developed markets. India’s high consolidated gross fiscal deficit to GDP and current-account deficit to GDP may make it vulnerable to negative sentiment for EMs, though low external debt to GDP and high foreign reserves may prevent meaningful negative impact."

Mumbai: Shares of PNB Housing Finance Ltd on Monday jumped as much as 14.1% to  ₹ 1,224, the biggest ever intraday percentage gain, on reports that Housing Development and Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and Kotak Mahindra Bank are eyeing a stake in the home loans firm.

HDFC CEO Keki M. Mistry, however, said his firm is not looking at acquiring controlling stake in PNB Housing Finance. Kotak Mahindra Group spokesman declined to comment, while PNB Housing Finance did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
HDFC was trading 0.8% lower and Kotak Mahindra Bank edged up 0.3% on Monday. PNB Housing Finance is down nearly 20% this year as of Friday, compared with a 11.5% gain for larger rival HDFC."
580,2018-06-26,HDFC,"While HDFC has denied any interest in PNB Housing Finance, the  latter's pristine loan book with very little delinquency makes it a good buy for any investor

Shares of housing finance companies haven’t been shining in the current year and PNB Housing Finance Ltd has been no different. 
Shares of housing finance companies haven’t been shining in the current year and PNB Housing Finance Ltd has been no different.
Concerns over compressing spreads have pulled down shares of most mortgage lenders from their highs in 2017. Investors have taken note that the stellar growth in loan books in the previous fiscal year is unlikely to get repeated. 
But PNB Housing Finance’s stock has got a booster shot on reports that mortgage king Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd are jostling to buy a controlling stake in it, although the company and HDFC have denied having any talks on stake sale.
That said, it is known that two of the biggest shareholders want an exit from the lender. Hamstrung on capital, parent Punjab National Bank (PNB) is holding a fire sale of non-core assets and stakes in subsidiaries, one of them being the housing finance arm. The other significant shareholder Carlyle Group too wants to exit.
On the block is a 66% stake in PNB Housing Finance and it is not a stretch to believe that investors are salivating at the prospect. After all, who would not want to buy a slice of the fastest-growing and also safest mortgage market? Especially when the government is going out on a limb to boost the real estate market by making it more affordable.
So what will an investor be getting into?
A pristine loan book that has grown by 48% in FY18 and a mere 0.6% of delinquency. While affordable housing may have cooled down a bit, it is still a promising growth corner of the real estate market. Affordable housing loans are 20% of PNB Housing Finance’s individual loans.
Analysts believe current valuations are attractive given a superior loan book. The PNB Housing Finance stock has dropped 29% from its all-time high.
In November 2016, the lender got listed at a cool valuation of over five times its book value for that year. But multiples have been tempered and the stock trades now around 2.7 times its estimated book value for FY19. The promoter’s desperation to sell could temper valuations some more."

Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon.
Of the top five most preferred stocks, three are financials, with ICICI Bank being the second-most preferred stock, and most preferred financial stock despite being in the news for all the wrong reasons, as brokerages welcomed cheaper valuations coupled with steps to investigate alleged wrongdoing.
The analysis includes stocks which have the highest percentage of buys/outperform/add ratings from the Sensex pack of the total ratings for the respective stocks.
According to data from Bloomberg, Mahindra is the most preferred stock with 42, or 97.67% of analysts tracking the stock rating it a buy or outperform, and only one analyst or 2.33% of the total analysts rating the stock a hold or a neutral. There were no sell ratings on the stock.
Mahindra shares that started rallying on 21 February have gained 26.8% since then. Year to date, they are up 19.6% at  ₹  898.30, outperforming BSE’s benchmark 30-share Sensex which rose 4.21% during the period.
“Rural demand outlook remains positive, on expectations of normal monsoons and government spending in rural segment,"" Nomura said in a note on 30 May, while maintaining its buy rating and raising its target price to  ₹  1,049 from  ₹  965 earlier.
Nomura analysts pointed that Mahindra maintained its 8-10% tractor growth forecast for fiscal year 2019, with scope for upside risk, and the brokerage estimates 10% growth in fiscal year 2019 and 8% in fiscal year 2020.
“Revival of rural growth and volume recovery in UVs (utility vehicles) should help the stock re-rate, in our view,"" Nomura analysts added.
In the case of ICICI Bank, 48 analysts or 92.3% analysts rated the stock a buy or outperform, while three or 5.77% analysts had a hold, or one or 1.92% of total analysts rated it a sell. 
“Beyond the remedial measures around the current negative news flow, we maintain our Buy on ICICI Bank given gradual improvement in the operating environment coupled with the arrest of fresh NPL (non-performing loans) formation, and cheaper valuations,"" Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note on 18 June. Year to date, ICICI Bank shares have shed 8.28%.
On 18 June, ICICI Bank’s board said that CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is facing conflict-of-interest allegations, will go on leave until a committee investigating allegations of impropriety completes its work. In the interim, Sandeep Bakhshi—who has been appointed as the chief operating officer (COO)—will steer its businesses.
The Videocon group had secured $500 million in loans from a consortium of lenders led by ICICI Bank and 19 other banks in April 2012.
The whistleblower, Arvind Gupta, has alleged that the loans to Videocon group companies were approved by ICICI Bank after the group owner Venugopal Dhoot had invested in NuPower, where Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar was a partner.

Sebi, has also asked the fund house to return the money it had collected from distributors and independent financial advisers, at the rate of 12%, they added.
HDFC Mutual Fund had made a private placement of shares to the tune of Rs150 crore to 140 distributors in April this year. The shares were offered at Rs1,050 per share. Though it had offered stocks to nearly 200 distributors, only 140 subscribed, industry insiders said.
HDFC Mutual Fund, in its draft red herring prospectus, had said it may reserve up to 7.2 lakh shares for distributors, subject to regulatory approvals. The move was criticised by industry participants as they felt this could undermine distributors’ ability to provide unbiased advice to their clients.
According to industry participants, the distributors, who subscribed the shares of the fund house, may give biased advice because of their equity stake in HDFC Mutual Fund. This has prompted Sebi to ask the fund house to scrap this pre-IPO placement.
A query sent to HDFC Mutual Fund in this regard has remained unanswered.

574,2018-07-04,HDFC,"HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh boards of respective companies will look at both internal and external candidates to fill positions

Mumbai: Ensuring frictionless transition within the group will be his top-most priority, Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) Ltd chairman Deepak Parekh said in his annual letter to shareholders. 
Mumbai: Ensuring frictionless transition within the group will be his top-most priority, Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) Ltd chairman Deepak Parekh said in his annual letter to shareholders.
Succession planning requires 18-24 months of preparation, Parekh said, hinting at the impending retirement of HDFC Bank’s chief executive officer (CEO) Aditya Puri. The boards of respective companies will look at both internal and external candidates to fill positions, he said.
“Personally, the task of ensuring frictionless transition is and will be on the top of my mind. That said, it is not as if there will be an announcement right away,"" said Parekh. “As passionate and energetic as some of our leaders within HDFC group are about their jobs, the reality is that individuals do get on in age,"" he said.
This is the first time that Parekh, who turns 74 this year, has publicly spelt out his views on succession planning at the housing finance major and its group companies. 
In an analyst meet in May, Puri had, however, given a roadmap for transition at the bank, ahead of his retirement in October 2020. Puri has been managing director of the country’s largest private lender over the last two decades since 1994, the longest serving chief of an Indian bank. 
In his letter, Parekh also said that Keki Mistry (63) will continue as the vice-chairman and CEO of HDFC for three years, subject to shareholders’ approval.
On the housing finance business, Parekh urged the regulators to remove the regulatory arbitrage around funding land acquisition. He said banks and housing finance companies should be allowed to fund developers to buy land for affordable housing projects. 
Currently, banks and housing finance companies are not allowed to fund land transitions. However, that’s not the case with non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and private equity players, who are permitted to do so. 
Parekh said that the regulatory arbitrage allows NBFCs and private equity (PE) players to levy prohibitively high interest rates on developers borrowing to acquire land.
“If housing finance companies of a certain threshold size are permitted to fund developers to acquire land for affordable housing, then the current high interest rates are likely to get rationalized. This in turn will help reduce the cost for a homebuyer,"" he said.
Parekh also called on the regulator to stop “lazy housing finance"", which encourages lenders from poaching customers of other lenders. He suggested that lenders be allowed to charge prepayment penalty on home loans of those customers who transfer their loans to other lenders in less than two years.
“The growing practice of housing finance players picking loans off each other’s balance sheet needs to be carefully monitored. With regulators prohibiting prepayment charges on most home loans, no one gains in this game except the agent who keeps collecting commissions,"" he said.
In April 2012, the Reserve Bank of India had asked banks to stop levying prepayment penalty on floating rate home loans to bring uniformity across the banking system. This had resulted in borrowers switching their loans to lenders offering lower rates, a practice that slowly eroded the marketshare of many lenders, including HDFC."

New Delhi: The union government’s common services centres (CSCs) across the country will operate as business correspondents (BCs) of HDFC Bank. An agreement between the two aims to create last-mile access points for financial services across the country.
There are approximately 300,000 CSCs in the country—access points with basic computing infrastructure run and operated by a local entrepreneur who lives in the same community.
It is an integral part of the ‘Digital India’ initiative of the government to foster financial inclusion in the country.
A business correspondent is an approved bank agent providing basic banking service using a micro-ATM.
“This agreement is expected to be a game changer as it would significantly contribute to government’s objectives of enabling Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) of various schemes,"" said a statement from the union IT ministry.
Women, senior citizens and persons with disability are expected to benefit significantly through this initiative. This will facilitate withdrawal and deposit of government entitlements such as payments under MGNREGA as well as various social welfare schemes like widow pension, handicapped and old age pension, etc, the statement added.
The HDFC BC (CSC) will also function as business facilitator-facility to enable merchants, youth, entrepreneurs, farmers and women to borrow from the bank to support their economic upliftment.
Mint had reported earlier that IT ministry was in consultations with the finance ministry to implement the plan.
Over the last few months, the IT ministry has been pushing to increase the scope of banking activity carried out by CSCs."

New Delhi: HDFC Asset Management Company, the country's second largest mutual fund firm, has fixed a price band of  ₹ 1,095-1,100 per share for its initial public offering, through which it is estimated to garner Rs2,800 crore. 
The initial share sale offer will be open for public subscription from 25 to 27 July , HDFC said in a regulatory filing to stock exchanges. 
HDFC AMC operates as a joint venture between Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and Standard Life Investments.

568,2018-07-17,HDFC,"HDFC Bank also figures among the top 5 holdings for 133 funds. What makes the stock so popular?

HDFC Bank seems to be the most preferred stock to own in equity diversified portfolios. HDFC Bank is the top holding for at least 43% of the funds across nine equity diversified categories or 107 schemes and is among the top 5 holdings of 53% or 133 funds, as on 31 May 2018.  
HDFC Bank seems to be the most preferred stock to own in equity diversified portfolios. HDFC Bank is the top holding for at least 43% of the funds across nine equity diversified categories or 107 schemes and is among the top 5 holdings of 53% or 133 funds, as on 31 May 2018. 
If you compare this to fund holdings, say, a year ago, in June 2017, HDFC Bank was the top holding in 73 funds and three years ago it featured as the top holding in 68 schemes among diversified equity categories. 
The data throws two questions: what makes HDFC Bank stock such a consensus pick across funds and if most of the funds behave so similarly, then where is the distinction that active management ought to bring to the table? 
Consistent performance 
Out of 55 equity analysts listed on Bloomberg who track this stock, 50 have given it a buy, three recommend hold and two sell. It’s no wonder that mutual fund houses, that along with their own research also rely on these reports, are lapping it up. But that’s not the only reason, it’s also a lack of options. 
According to the equity head of a mid-sized fund house, who did not want be identified, “The bank has delivered consistent earnings for two decades and probably has disappointed the least in earnings season. Its weight in the index has gone up over the years and being underweight means taking a performance risk."" HDFC Bank is 10.25% of Nifty 50 and roughly 12.25% in Sensex. 
There is a lot of market uncertainty owing to both global and local factors. While the headline index value is moving up, rise in earnings growth in individual stocks has been selective. As a result, while some stocks are trading at very high or premium valuations, others don’t find enough demand. In a narrow market like this, replacing an 8-10% invested in a high-quality, high-earnings stock like HDFC Bank would mean finding at least 2-3 other stocks with similar performance expectation. 
“There is a willingness to hold HDFC Bank even at a slightly higher PE multiple as funds are evaluated on relative performance. It’s not just this stock, but if you see the top 10 holdings of schemes with large size, the list will look a lot like Nifty top 10 stocks. The choice is limited, no one has the courage to be under-allocated to HDFC Bank,"" said Vikas Gupta, founder and chief investment strategist – OmniScience Capital, an investment management firm. 
Experts suggest that HDFC Bank is a safe stock and under-allocation to it can lead to risk of under-performance in the short term. “For many it is a cyclical choice now. One wants to be comfortable in this market, which means owning stocks which are favourable today. With PSU banks suffering and Axis and ICICI Bank being out of favour, the options are limited in the sector,"" said another senior fund manager who did not want to be named. 
Active management alpha 
If many funds, despite their separate investment objectives and strategies, rely so heavily on allocating to one or even just a handful of similar stocks for 30-40% of the portfolio, then what value does that add for investors? 
Munish Randev, chief investment officer, Waterfield Advisors, a multi-family office and advisory firm, said, “Our analysis shows that the more diversified your fund portfolio is the closer you get to index-like holdings. The top 10 stocks from Nifty are available across MF and PMS (portfolio management services) portfolios. When you add up the overlapping stocks, single company exposure gets much larger in individual portfolios."" 
Individual client portfolios are analysed for stocks that unintentionally get too high an allocation and schemes which contribute more of that stock are replaced with other good schemes, he added. 
While such an approach reduces the risk of over allocation, it is not something that many retail investors can do. Often, investors rely on the stated fund strategy to choose differentiated schemes to benefit from excess return, thanks to the fund manager’s stock selection. 
If so many of them choose the same stock as the top holding of their portfolio or similar stocks form their top 5-10 holdings, that too mirroring holdings of popular indices, where is the excess return from active stock selection? According to one of the fund managers quoted above, “Being close to the index on one security can’t be the sole contributor to alpha, there will always be other stocks which do that. However, deviation from the index can take away alpha. The industry’s problem is that consensus stocks find favour. It is the job of advisors, distributors and industry analysts to bring this out and hold fund managers responsible."" 
Randev agreed that differentiation among schemes is reducing and exchange-traded funds can be a better option in categories where correlation in portfolios of active managers is high. However, there is comfort in consensus. “If your fund underperforms with HDFC Bank as a top holding you are less likely to be questioned and held responsible, than if it was a lesser known mid-cap stock as a top holding,"" said Gupta. 
It is not the stock you hold that matters, but how precisely you follow the investment strategy. A focused buy-and-hold strategy may have more merit than jumping into short-term opportunities and following the herd. Ajay Tyagi, executive vice president and fund manager, UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd, said, “Consistency in stock selection and staying for the long term is important. This might mean you stand out in certain market periods, but that discipline is important. Index funds have the benefit of being disciplined in a sense as index composition changes only once or twice a year. If active fund managers had that same discipline with better stock selection ability, it can work very well."" 
What should you do? 
While many funds having overlapping top holdings may appear as lazy investing, it is hard for an average investor to judge a portfolio at an individual stock level. Ultimately investors want outperformance. 
The overall risk-adjusted returns of the scheme is important. Over time, however, if the fund manager doesn’t differentiate the portfolio reasonably compared to the benchmark and others, it will get reflected in returns converging or even underperforming. If that happens consistently, the fund can fall out of favour."

The HDFC AMC IPO is a pure offer for sale. HDFC is selling a 4% stake in the company, while Standard Life Investments is selling 8%. 
This is the fifth HDFC group company to go public, said Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC Ltd. “Creating long-term value requires patience. We have been building HDFC AMC for the last 18 years. Based on the way we envisage India’s growth in the coming years, we felt that this is the right time to take the company public,"" said Parekh. 
Last year, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd went public in an IPO that saw shareholders HDFC and Standard Life sell shares worth  ₹ 8,695 crore to the public. The insurance company was valued at  ₹ 58,277 crore at the time of the IPO. 
Since its IPO, the stock price of HDFC Standard Life has grown by 63.2% to  ₹ 473.45 per share. Parekh added that several factors have made mutual funds a vehicle of choice for Indians. “Demonetization was a shot in the arm for the mutual fund industry. If you see the interest rates on bank deposits have been going down. Rental yields on real estate have become low and are at around just 2-3%, while gold, in the last five years, has appreciated just 1% year over year. All these factors have contributed to making mutual funds a preferred choice for investments,"" said Parekh. 
The total assets under management (AUM) of the industry stands at  ₹ 23 trillion, he said, adding that the potential for growth going ahead is immense. 
“The total AUM of the mutual fund industry is just 11% of the Indian GDP (gross domestic product), while the global average is 62%. In US, the mutual fund industry size is 101% of the GDP. Equities under management of mutual fund industry account for just 4-5% of the total market capitalization of Indian stock markets, while in US this number stands at 42%,"" said Parekh.

The other listed AMC Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd is valued at  ₹ 13,739.4 crore, according to its closing stock price on Thursday. The company’s stock price has declined almost 11% from its IPO price of  ₹ 252 per share.
“They (HDFC Group) are definitely asking for a higher valuation than what Reliance AMC did. Reliance has seen its stock price reduce from the IPO price. So that is available at a even cheaper price today. So there is definitely a substantial premium that HDFC is asking,"" said Arun Kejriwal, founder of research firm KRIS. 
However, he added that the HDFC brand is a much more widely accepted brand in the financial services industry. 
 At the IPO valuation, HDFC and Standard Life will collectively raise  ₹ 2,800 crore from selling over 12% stake. HDFC is selling 4% stake, while Standard Life is selling 8% stake through the IPO. 
“HDFC as a group so far has always created value through its various listed entities for shareholders. We wanted to leave enough on the table for investors in this issue as well,"" said a spokesperson for the company.

Since its IPO, the stock price of HDFC Standard Life has gained by 62.5% to  ₹ 471.25 per share.

Mumbai: The Rs24,000-crore capital raising will increase HDFC Bank’s capital buffers by 3 percentage points and help support the lender’s over 20% loan growth for the next few years, says a report. 
Mumbai: The Rs24,000-crore capital raising will increase HDFC Bank’s capital buffers by 3 percentage points and help support the lender’s over 20% loan growth for the next few years, says a report.
The Rs8,500-crore infusion last week through a preferential allotment to parent HDFC will increase the common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio by about 1 percentage points to 13.3% from 12.3 reported in March 2018, global rating agency Moody’s Investor Service said in a report on Monday. 
This is the first tranche of the Rs24,000-crore capital raising plan announced last December. “If the bank manages to raise the remaining planned capital, its CET1 ratio will increase by a total of 3 percentage points to 15.2%,"" it added. 
The capital infusion is “credit positive"" as it will strengthen its loss-absorbing buffers, while supporting balance-sheet expansion, the agency said. 
Moody’s vice-president for financial institutions group, Alka Anbarasu, further said even though HDFC Bank is more profitable than its peers, the internal capital generation “has lagged its risk-weighted assets growth"" in the past five years. 
The preferential share sale to the parent is part of a Rs24,000-crore capital raising plan announced earlier. The remaining money will be raised from overseas investors, for which the bank has got necessary government approvals. 
The bank has not yet revealed the exact timeline for raising the second tranche and the agency says it will not be difficult for the bank to raise the money from equity markets. 
“We expect that the capital raise will support HDFC Banks credit growth of 20-25% over the next few years. 
HDFC Bank is growing at a faster pace than other banks: its average loan growth has been 22% over the past three years, versus the average of 6.5% for the system,"" Anbarasu said."

Industry insiders says a few other large asset managers may also get listed eventually. 
Should you follow the same principles in picking up shares of a fund house as you do when you invest in its schemes? The answer is no. Picking a mutual fund scheme is very different from picking equity shares of its asset manager. Here’s what will determine your AMC’s run on the stock markets.
When XXL is better than S
While picking up a scheme from a small-sized fund house is fine, the same may not be true if you want to buy a share of a small- or medium-sized fund house. For the scheme from a small fund house to do well, its fund manager has to be skilled in stock selection, the size of the fund house has little to do with the return you will see. But when you buy a stock of an MF company, size matters. The income and, therefore, profit of a fund house depends on how big it is because MFs charge investors a certain percentage of the assets under management. The larger the pie, the larger is the fund house income. 
“Fund performance depends on market; AMCs have no control over market. The mutual funds business is a pure assets gathering game. Unlike a manufacturing company that can reduce its price, offer discounts, new products and so on, a fund house does not do all of that. It has to gather assets if it wants to make money,"" said Deepak Chhabria, CEO and director, Axiom Financial Services Ltd, a Bengaluru-based distributor of financial products.
Can HDFC AMC grow? 
Although MFs have been in India since 1987 and private sector fund houses entered the space in 1993, they haven’t yet penetrated in the hinterlands of India . But there is room ahead for expansion. “The ‘financialisation’ of savings is going to be the biggest driving factor, fuelling the potential growth of the MF industry in India. With MF-to-GDP ratio in the country at just about 10% compared to about 50% in the UK and about 90% in the US, the opportunity for growth is large,"" said Nithin Sasikumar, co-founder and head-research, Investography Ltd, a wealth management firm.
Investors should look out for the ratio of equity assets to total assets. Higher expense ratios (the fees that fund houses collect) in equity funds of up to 2.5% translate into higher profits. Brands like HDFC AMC score; they were able to grow assets even during market slowdown during 2008-2012.
What if expense ratios fall?
Just because a fund house is growing its assets doesn’t guarantee more income. If expense ratios go down, it can hurt revenue. This is the biggest threat for an AMC. 
In February, Sebi tweaked the definition of a small town from ‘Beyond 15’ or B15 town to Beyond 30 or B30 town. In 2012, Sebi allowed fund houses to incentivise sales from B15 towns by offering distributors there extra commission of 0.30%, and also barred closed-end funds and those that do not charge exit loads from charging the extra 0.20% fees they used to collect."

Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors. 
Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors.
The Axis Bluechip Fund is up 25% over the past year, beating nine index funds and 35 other actively managed portfolios to the mantle of India’s top performing large-cap fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest holdings - HDFC Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Housing Development Finance Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services - have contributed more than three quarters of gains on the S&P BSE Sensex Index this year.
“Our portfolio tilt toward very high-quality stocks has helped us ride out the market volatility,"" Shreyash Devalkar, senior fund manager at Axis, which has $12 billion in assets, said in an interview. The fund exited some smaller companies in December after a gush of inflows lifted valuations, he said.
Gains in Indian equities this year have been lopsided as investors sought safety in the biggest stocks amid headwinds from a brewing trade conflict and elevated prices of oil, India’s top import. A selloff in stocks of medium and smaller-sized companies was made worse by stringent margins requirements imposed in June. That’s left those smaller firms trading near the biggest discount to the Sensex in two years, according to Bloomberg data.
Axis expects a boost in government spending in India’s countryside ahead of next year’s general elections to benefit companies able to capture improved consumer demand. The government this month raised minimum assured prices for crops like cotton and rice to boost rural incomes and spending. “We are tracking earnings closely to see how consumer demand is panning out,"" he said, without naming the stocks he’s watching.
New Record
The Sensex is up more than 8% this year, surpassing a previous all-time high reached in January, after turmoil in the first quarter dragged equities into a correction. Despite the rebound, volatility may remain elevated amid uncertainty over international politics and in the run up to next year’s national ballot, Devalkar said.
Rising crude prices and its impact on public finances remains a cause for concern, he said. Brent oil held above $72 per barrel, up about 45% from a year ago, fueling concern inflation will quicken. India is the world’s third-biggest oil user and relies on imports to meet about two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
Prior to his fund’s outperformance over the past 12 months, Devalkar’s fund lost about 3.6% in 2016 compared with a 3% gain in the NSE Nifty 50 Index that year."

Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd’s (HDFC) loan book continues to grow in the high double-digits, thanks to the government’s thrust on affordable housing. On assets under management (AUM) basis, the mortgage lender’s loan book grew 18% in the June quarter. Individual loans, which comprise 72% of its overall AUM, rose 25%, and the non-individual loan book gained 18%.

On assets under management (AUM) basis, the mortgage lender’s loan book grew 18% in the June quarter. Individual loans, which comprise 72% of its overall AUM, rose 25%, and the non-individual loan book gained 18%.
During the quarter, 37% of home loans approved in volume terms and 19% in value terms were towards the economically weaker sections and low-income group. This translated into healthy net interest income growth of 20% on a year-on-year basis.
Consequently, HDFC reported 54% year-on-year increase in profit at  ₹ 2,190 crore for the June quarter. It should be noted that non-banking financial companies are required to report earnings as per Indian Accounting Standard from FY19 onward.
As for asset quality, the gross non-performing loan ratio inched marginally higher on a sequential basis to 1.18% from 1.11% in the March quarter. Spreads were stable at 2.28%.
Meanwhile, the HDFC stock touched a 52-week high of  ₹ 2,052.95 in intraday trading on NSE on Monday ahead of the earnings, but ended the day’s session down 1.53%.
However, according to some analysts, HDFC’s earnings have largely been in-line with expectations and this correction comes after the sharp-run up recently witnessed in the stock. One should not read too much into it. In the past few days, the stock has been on an upward trajectory given the robust response to group firm HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd’s initial public offering, they said. 
On a year-to-date basis, the HDFC stock has posted 18.6% returns surpassing Nifty’s 7.5% returns during the same span. On the valuation front, the stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-book of 4.56 times, but the results suggest the premium is well-deserved"

The central bank has hiked the repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.5% due to inflationary pressures arising from a hike in minimum support prices of crops.

One basis point in one-hundredth of a percentage point.
According to Mint, the six-member monetary policy committee voted to keep its policy stance neutral, thus keeping the door open for future rate hikes. RBI also raised the average inflation projection for the second half of the year to 4.8% from 4.7% in June. The central bank expects inflation to edge higher to 5% in the first quarter of next fiscal year.
The monetary policy statement also cited the MSP hike for kharif crops as the primary factor stoking inflation this year. The government has fixed the MSP at 150% of the cost of production of all kharif crops.
According to a Mint poll of economists, a rate hike was expected in the monetary policy today.
Earlier Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist with Kotak Institutional Equities, said: “We pencil in a repo rate of 25 bps in the August policy. Even as we call for a rate hike, the RBI may pause mainly to wait-and-watch if MSP hikes start to percolate to food prices and how inflationary expectations have evolved over the last quarter.""
Crude oil prices have declined from $75.3 per barrel to $74.2 per barrel from the last monetary policy in June. An agreement between OPEC members to increase oil production, concerns over global demand amid worsening global trade relations and increased production in the US have led to a decline in oil prices. However, sustained supply disruptions in Libya, Venezuela and Iran have capped the declines."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of the current FD rates from some popular banks for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

HDFC’s decision to hike lending rates comes after RBI raised repo rate for the second straight time by 25 basis points to 6.5% on Wednesday.
Economists are not ruling out the possibility of more rate hikes this fiscal as RBI reiterated its intention to stick to the 4% inflation target and indicated upside risks to the target because of the larger-than-average increase in minimum support price for summer-sown crops and volatility in crude oil prices. 
“Cost of funds have been stable for the last month despite increase in RBI policy rate. With the increase in lending rate, HDFC will see a positive impact on margins in the coming quarters.

Now, the question facing some investors who are sitting on big gains is should they cash out. Some investors who missed out on the IPO allotment might be wondering if it is time to buy HDFC AMC shares. Livemint spoke to a few analysts who shared their views on the stock.
G Chokkalingam, MD of Equinomics Research & Advisory, said tactical or short-term investors can sell in phases as the valuation at current levels looks stretched. At current levels, fresh investors should stay away and only buy on declines, he said.
“In our view, in the short to medium terms, the valuation is highly stretched. At the current price, HDFC AMC shares trade at 53 times FY18 earnings and 41 times FY19E earnings, assuming 30% year-on-year growth in profits, in line with the trend. The market cap is 12.8% of its AUM, which is a highly stretched valuation,"" Chokkalingam said.
“Short-term investors and traders may consider booking profits in phases (some previous IPOs from the financial services industry moved up tactically beyond what the fundamentals would dictate before correcting quite significantly) at every significant rise from the current levels. Those long term investors who are willing to wait for more than two to three years, may hold,"" he added. 
Sanjiv Bhasin, EVP, Markets & Corp Affairs, at IIFL, said short-term investors can use the current euphoria around the stock to book partial profits. But new investors should look at declines to enter the stock, he added. The stellar listing of HDFC AMC shares did not surprise him, given the company’s pedigree and the strong outlook for the mutual fund sector. Both the insurance and mutual fund industries are sunshine sectors and will attract a lot of inflows in the future, Bhasin said.
“ ₹  1,800/share is a good level to book partial profits for existing investors and  ₹  1,400-1,500 is a good entry point for fresh investors,"" he added.
Rajesh Baheti, managing director of Crosseas Capital Services, says the market momentum could take HDFC AMC shares even higher in the short term. Long-term investors can look to stay invested in the stock, he added.

G Chokkalingam, MD of Equinomics Research & Advisory, said tactical or short-term investors can sell in phases as the valuation at current levels looks stretched. At current levels, fresh investors should stay away and only buy on declines, he said.
“In our view, in the short to medium terms, the valuation is highly stretched. At the current price, HDFC AMC shares trade at 53 times FY18 earnings and 41 times FY19E earnings, assuming 30% year-on-year growth in profits, in line with the trend. The market cap is 12.8% of its AUM, which is a highly stretched valuation,"" Equinomics Research & Advisory said in a note on Monday.
According to analysts, the blockbuster listing of HDFC AMC shares reflects bullish sentiment on Indian mutual fund managers who have seen record inflows in recent months.
HDFC AMC, the second-biggest mutual fund manager by assets under management, and its peers in the $344 billion sector have benefited from Indians moving away from traditional investment avenues such as real estate and gold to financial savings.
HDFC AMC, which is the most profitable in the 43-player sector, also stands out because of its higher proportion of equity assets.
HDFC AMC’s parent, HDFC, and group company HDFC Bank are among investor favourites. Another group company, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, listed last November and is up nearly 68% from its IPO price.
Including the HDFC AMC IPO, Indian companies have raised $4.8 billion from primary markets so far this year, following a record $11 billion initial share sales in 2017.
HDFC AMC’s two biggest shareholders - mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp Ltd and Standard Life Aberdeen Plc - sold a combined 12% stake in the IPO, which was open from July 25 to July 27 and was subscribed over 80 times.

532,2018-08-07,HDFC,"The surge in HDFC AMC  share price indicates a terrible shortage of quality stocks in the Indian markets

HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd’s (HDFC AMC’s) initial public offering set the Street on fire, with listing gains as high as 65%. The mutual fund company is now valued at 12.54% of its average assets under management (AUM) in the June quarter, which puts its valuation at almost double the levels of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd. Including Reliance’s pension AUM, its valuation falls to about 4%, which means HDFC AMC’s valuations are three times those levels. 
HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd’s (HDFC AMC’s) initial public offering set the Street on fire, with listing gains as high as 65%. The mutual fund company is now valued at 12.54% of its average assets under management (AUM) in the June quarter, which puts its valuation at almost double the levels of Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd. Including Reliance’s pension AUM, its valuation falls to about 4%, which means HDFC AMC’s valuations are three times those levels.
While it is understandable that investors would want to value a company from the HDFC (Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd) stable at higher multiples, they have clearly taken things too far with the mutual fund company. A look at the table alongside shows that while HDFC’s financial ratios are better compared to Reliance’s, the degree of outperformance isn’t that high to warrant such a large premium.
What then explains the mad rush for HDFC AMC’s shares?
It’s one simple reason: a terrible shortage of quality stocks in the Indian markets. Such is the dearth of listed companies that investors can trust that they pile on when a company with a pedigree lists on exchanges. The problem has been compounded lately, with a number of mid-cap stocks correcting sharply. Besides, with auditors resigning from a number of companies, investors are being doubly cautious.
But with companies that have a decent track record on governance, investors are throwing all caution to the wind when it comes to valuations. The rush for quality stocks is also evident in the high valuations of consumer goods companies and private sector banks, for instance.
CNBC-TV18 interviewed one of the bankers to the HDFC AMC IPO to understand the huge demand for the company’s shares. He said it doesn’t make much sense to look at price-to-AUM ratios, but rather at price-to-earnings (P-E) ratios, since a mutual fund can potentially make higher profits than a competitor with the same amount of assets.
But those looking for some semblance of sanity in the P-E ratio will be disappointed. HDFC AMC is now valued at 53 times earnings for the year till March 2018. Assuming earnings grow at the same pace as the previous year, the stock is valued at 41 times forward earnings. Note that fiscal year 2018 was a sort of a sweet spot for mutual fund companies, with equity AUM rising sharply. Even so, earnings growth stood at 31.1%. In the preceding year, earnings had grown just 15%.
ALSO READ | HDFC AMC shares gain 65%, what you should do
A valuation multiple of well over 40 times, therefore, means that investors are setting a high asking rate as far as future growth expectations go. If anything, things are expected to slow down after the high pace of growth in the past few years. Since large-cap equity funds have kept the faith, investors haven’t yet pulled out large amounts of funds. However, if the correction in the markets extends to the large-cap segment, the growth in AUM can soon come to a standstill.
Besides, the experience with developed markets shows that investors transition to index funds and exchange-traded funds, where fees are much lower. Already, some Indian fund houses have lowered fees for large-cap funds, because of the low alpha the segment generates.
To ignore all of this, and just focus on pedigree is clearly a myopic view."
531,2018-08-08,HDFC,"HDFC AMC has managed to keep HDFC Prudence and HDFC Balanced the way they were managed earlier, though they are now named HDFC Balanced Advantage and HDFC Hybrid Equity, respectively

If a mutual fund scheme changes its indicative asset allocation as stated in its scheme information document, but proposes to follow its erstwhile strategy, do we have a new scheme on our hands or is it the same old scheme? That’s the question we’re asking after seeing the way HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd has gone about merging its erstwhile balanced funds. The scheme consolidation and re-classification in the  ₹ 23 trillion Indian mutual funds industry, initiated by capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in October 2017, is complete. But two curious cases, ironically both from HDFC AMC, stand out.  
If a mutual fund scheme changes its indicative asset allocation as stated in its scheme information document, but proposes to follow its erstwhile strategy, do we have a new scheme on our hands or is it the same old scheme? That’s the question we’re asking after seeing the way HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd has gone about merging its erstwhile balanced funds. The scheme consolidation and re-classification in the  ₹ 23 trillion Indian mutual funds industry, initiated by capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in October 2017, is complete. But two curious cases, ironically both from HDFC AMC, stand out. 
Effective 1 June 2018, the erstwhile HDFC Prudence Fund was converted into HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund. The path was slightly complex. It first converted HDFC Growth Fund, a small equity-oriented fund of  ₹ 1,129 crore into HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund and then merged the flagship behemoth HDFC Prudence Fund ( ₹ 36,594 crore corpus) into it. 
But in a communication that the fund house sent out to all its distributors in the past two months, it said nothing has changed with the erstwhile HDFC Prudence. Mint has a copy of the communication sent to distributors. 
But isn’t HDFC Balanced Advantage supposed to be different from HDFC Prudence? HDFC Prudence, an erstwhile balanced fund, could invest 40-75% in equities and the rest in debt. In its new avatar, HDFC Balanced Advantage can invest its entire corpus—or practically nothing—in equities, and the rest in debt. In other words, it can swing completely between equities and debt. Then, why does HDFC AMC claim that the erstwhile HDFC Prudence and the new HDFC Balanced Advantage are the same?
There’s more. The erstwhile HDFC Balanced Fund became HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund. Here again, HDFC Premier Multi-Cap Fund (a tiny equity fund with a corpus of  ₹ 295 crore) was converted into HDFC Hybrid Equity and then HDFC Balanced ( ₹ 20,401 crore) was merged into this concoction. Here too, apart from a minor tweak (the fund calls it “no material change"") in its stated asset allocation (what every scheme states in its scheme information document), the rest remains the same (“no change"", as the fund house calls it). That HDFC AMC has chosen to put its Hybrid-Equity Fund in the “aggressive hybrid"" category is normal as most erstwhile balanced funds in the industry (those that invested at least 65% in equities and the rest in debt) have chosen to remain in this category.
If HDFC Hybrid Equity would continue to invest 65-80% in equities and HDFC Balanced Advantage too continues to invest as per its original avatar (around 65-75% in equities), then what’s the difference between then and now? Is the AMC using nudge-nudge, wink-wink to tell distributors that the scheme mandate is not to be taken seriously and that HDFC Prudence will remain what it was?
By doing these manoeuvres, HDFC AMC has managed to keep the two balanced funds the way they were managed earlier, despite Sebi’s attempt to consolidate the scheme and remove duplicity within each category of funds. HDFC AMC refused to comment for the story. 
What’s the fuss?
When Sebi had initiated the re-categorisation exercise, it said, “It is desirable that different schemes launched by a mutual fund are clearly distinct in terms of asset allocation, investment strategy etc."" This was its first justification about why it had embarked upon this big an exercise. But if HDFC AMC’s two erstwhile balanced funds continue life as usual, as their communication to investors indicate, then is HDFC AMC violating Sebi’s guidelines?
The MD of another fund house said: “HDFC Balanced Advantage continuing with the strategy of HDFC Prudence is dangerous for new investors. Usually, balanced advantage funds reduce their equity exposure when equity markets turn volatile. By nature, investors will expect lower volatility. But since HDFC Balanced Advantage will not swing between equity and debt and instead will continue the way HDFC Prudence was managed, investors will not get a ‘true-to-label’ fund. The fund perhaps thinks that since its brand is so strong, they will get away with it.""
The continuation of the old larger funds despite new names is not the only dichotomy. A former industry official, who spoke to Mint on the condition of anonymity, told us that if the asset allocation pattern, as stated in the offer document, changes, then it becomes a new fund. But the fund house has chosen to display past performance of HDFC Prudence and HDFC Balanced. This, despite the fact, that HDFC Prudence “has been merged into"" HDFC Balanced Advantage and HDFC Balanced “has been merged into"" HDFC Hybrid Equity. If HDFC Prudence and HDFC Balanced, therefore, cease to exist, why then is the fund house demonstrating their past performances?
In a Sebi circular dated 12 April 2018, titled “Performance disclosure post consolidation/merger of schemes"", the regulator laid down detailed guidelines as to how fund performances should be displayed (and when past performances should be buried) when two schemes merge. If two schemes merge and a third scheme emerges, then the past performances of both the merged schemes should not be shown.
Hence our second question. Are HDFC Balanced Advantage and HDFC Hybrid Equity new funds? Or are they just old schemes with new names? And if they are old schemes and nothing has changed, as per HDFC AMC’s communication, then why not just merge the small schemes into the larger ones? Better still, why not just merge the two balanced funds and create one giant fund? 
Best of both worlds
The answer lies in the two old and large schemes’ legacies that HDFC AMC has intended to protect and continue, while still complying with Sebi regulations, even if just on paper presumably.
 Industry officials said that HDFC AMC resorted to these unique mergers to ensure continuity in its dividend paying strategies. Read about how balanced funds lured investors on the pretext of paying regular dividends here.
At the forefront of the dividend saga has been HDFC Prudence that has built a formidable track record of paying regular dividends. But since Sebi rules mandate that dividends need to be paid out of only booked profits, any fund that aims to pay regular dividends needs a good amount of reserves in its balance sheet to pay dividends. A comparison of HDFC Prudence’s and HDFC Growth’s balance sheets tell us that the latter’s capacity to pay dividends is more than the former. “Higher reserves also ensure that in future when equity markets go down, the fund is still able to pay dividends (out of profits booked earlier but not yet distributed),"" said the head of operations of a fund house who did not wish to be named. Therefore, to be able to continue to pay dividends, it became imperative to merge HDFC Prudence (the larger fund) into HDFC Growth (the smaller fund). 
HDFC AMC’s communication to investors of HDFC Prudence’s investors that we spoke about earlier also mentioned that there would be “no change"" in the “monthly"" dividend frequency of the fund (HDFC Balanced Advantage).
In short, HDFC AMC has retained the strategy of HDFC Prudence (the merged fund) as it comes with a better past performance than HDFC Growth. But it has retained the balance sheet of HDFC Growth (the surviving fund) owing to its higher dividend paying flexibility. In doing so, it hid behind a clause in Sebi’s 12 April circular about retaining strategies, instead of another clause in the same circular that spoke about a new scheme born out of a merger. Read about the clauses here.
Alluding to HDFC Prudence, the CEO of a small-sized fund said, “HDFC AMC’s stance is understandable. How can it lose past performance of such large schemes with so many investors, especially if the fund has the same fund manager for the past 20 years."" But he added that despite being called a balanced advantage fund, it won’t be a true balanced advantage fund. The dividend saga clearly appears to have influenced in the way they have merged.
This way, HDFC AMC has had its cake and eaten it too."

The HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd stock closed 65% up on the first day of listing over its IPO price of  ₹ 1,100 per share.

Multiplier returns over the short term create a buzz and many of us get carried away by the noise forgetting the reason we invested in funds over direct equity. Dial back to mutual fund and retail investing basics to remember that we buy mutual funds because we do not have the ability to spend the time, money and effort required to choose individual stocks. We prefer to leave that job to experts who do this for a fee. The risk of putting all our money in a few stocks over holding a bunch of stocks through a mutual fund scheme is much higher. 
But you can argue back that the same logic that prevents us from buying stocks should also prevent us from buying managed funds. There are over 521 equity funds in the market with varying performance histories. The return difference of two equity schemes within a fund house we saw above is huge, so is the difference in the investor experience across fund houses. A one-year best return in a large-cap fund (Axis Bluechip) was as high as 23% and the worst was just 2% (IDBI Top 100). The best fund turned your  ₹ 1 lakh into  ₹ 1.23 lakh, the worst gave you a return worse than a one-year bank deposit. If you have to choose a good fund, how is this any different than buying individual stocks?
One way to reduce your fund manager risk is to buy an index fund or an exchange-traded fund (ETF). These funds we know replicate the index and remove what is called the fund manager risk from your portfolio. A fund manager risk is the risk of the money expert making wrong calls. For example, in the large-cap category of equity funds, the worst fund over 10 years has turned a  ₹ 1 lakh investment to just  ₹ 1.2 lakh, a return much poorer than a safer bank deposit. This is fund manager risk—the chance that your scheme will do badly because of poor decisions made by the fund manager. But with risk comes return. If you happened to choose the best fund in terms of returns, your  ₹ 1 lakh 10 years ago in a large-cap is now at  ₹ 4.21 lakh today. To iron out this difference, investors who do not have the ability to choose a managed fund, go the index fund way. An index fund gives the market return, so you may not do as well nor do as badly due to a good or a bad fund manager.
Your choice is not between HDFC stock and its mutual fund. Your choice is between stock picking yourself or going the mutual fund route. And within funds, your choice is between index returns and managed fund returns. The two are very different investment strategies and the current buzz around returns on a fresh listed IPO should not derail your financial plans. If you have chosen the mutual fund way, do not allow the noise over short term IPO returns to distract you.

“Mr Paresh Sukthankar has tendered his resignation as deputy managing director of the Bank, to be effective 90 days from the close of business hours of today (Friday),"" it said.
Sukthankar’s resignation comes as a surprise as he was considered one of the front-runners to succeed MD and chief executive officer (CEO) Aditya Puri, who is set to retire in October 2020. 
At an analyst meet in May this year, Puri had laid down a road map for leadership transition at the bank. The bank will look at both internal and external candidates and will announce the name 12 months before the retirement deadline, he had said."

In a call with analysts, Puri also said the position of deputy managing director will cease to exist after Sukthankar leaves. “That was recognition to the contribution Paresh made to the bank,"" said Puri.
Puri also denied rumours of any differences with Sukthankar and that the decision to leave was his personal choice. “It has been the most graceful exit. There is no acrimony, no differences of opinion,"" said Puri. 
Puri also assured analysts the functioning of the bank was not linked to any individual.
Sukthankar has been with the bank since its inception in 1994. 
He has been responsible for risk management, financial control and human resources. He was also one of the front-runners for the post of managing director after Puri’s retirement in October 2020.
“Paresh was a contender. But there would also be a search to find the next CEO,"" he added.
Puri also said the process of selecting his successor will start from March and that a new CEO will be in place 12 months before his retirement. 
“I don’t see any challenge to the bank’s fundamentals from a management transition or operations perspective. Considering Puri will be in charge at the bank for a couple of more years, he will ensure that it will be a smooth transition,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, director of financial services research at Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
Analysts say HDFC Bank may look at appointing an internal candidate as an executive director to replace Sukthankar. Currently, Kaizad Bharucha is the only executive director on the bank’s board. Sashidhar Jagdishan, the bank’s chief financial officer, is touted to be one of the candidates to replace Sukthankar as he handles similar portfolios, said analysts."

HDFC, which will be a sponsor to the fund, is in talks with investors to raise capital through the alternative investment fund (AIF) route. Kaizad Hazari has been appointed as chief executive officer-designate for the venture. 
“The objective is to find opportunities in real estate stressed assets, and then to take over these projects and turn them around,"" said Keki Mistry, vice chairman and chief executive, HDFC, told Mint. Mistry, however, did not disclose the likely size of the fund.
The real estate sector is an area of core competence for HDFC and its distressed-themed fund comes at a time when the residential sector, in particular, has undergone a nearly five-year long slowdown. 
Moreover, a stringent regulatory regime under the real estate regulatory authority (RERA) and the after-shocks of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetisation, have led to a prolonged slowdown, increasing debt for developers and unsold inventory with several projects across cities being either stuck or delayed.
HDFC is scanning the market to identify projects that are stuck, and where it can help in completing them and offer possession to retail investors and buyers. As an investor, the new fund can either continue with the existing project developer or bring in a new developer. 
“We will look at the top 6-8 cities and evaluate opportunities across segments, including residential, commercial office and hospitality,"" said Hazari.
HDFC currently handles real estate investments through HDFC Capital Advisors Ltd, which had raised $550 million in December, in an initial closure of its second affordable housing fund. It also has HDFC Property Fund, which is planning a $500-million overseas fund.
HDFC is not the only one. Other investors are also eyeing similar opportunities.
ASK Property Investment Advisors has its  ₹ 900 crore ASK Real Estate Special Situations Fund for incomplete housing projects either due to sluggish demand or the developer’s inability to complete the project due to lack of capital.
“There is a scope to invest in stressed projects as the sector further consolidates and smaller developers face cash flow pressure, forcing them to surrender to established developers,"" said Amit Bhagat, chief executive and managing director, ASK Property Investment Advisors. “With large developers, private equity investors and asset reconstruction companies eyeing this space, there is a fair bit of competition.""
“Funds looking at distress opportunities can get many projects, which can be bought at discounted NAV (net asset value),"" said Rajeev Bairathi, executive director and head of capital markets at property advisory firm Knight Frank India. 
“Today, when sales are not picking up, putting in equity and getting the project completed by bringing in another developer is a good solution to the ongoing crisis."""

The 10-year bond yield may drop to 7.50% by end-2018, a decline of 37 basis points from current levels, said Badrish Kulhalli, head of fixed income at the insurer, which has  ₹ 1.1 trillion ($15.7 billion) under management. Investors will return as confidence grows that the Reserve Bank of India is probably done with further rate increases, he said.
Kulhalli joins a small group of investors betting that a rout in Indian bonds that started last August is coming to an end. Consumer inflation eased in July, while the RBI has adopted a neutral monetary stance after raising rates twice since June. HDFC’s bet is also dependent on the central bank stepping up debt purchases to provide support.
“Our view is that RBI will maintain status quo on interest rates for an extended period, "" Kulhalli said in an interview. The 10-year bond is “the segment where you will see very strong demand coming in the moment there is any turn in sentiment.""
While the median analyst forecast is for the 10-year yield to rise to 7.90% by the end of the year, some investors see signs of improvement. Nomura Asset Management Co. said last month that Indian bonds stand out in emerging markets, while Standard Chartered Plc raised its three-month outlook to positive after the latest RBI meeting.
India isn’t in a situation where policy rates need to go much higher than the two-year high of 6.5%, given that they are “significantly higher than inflation,"" Kulhalli said. Consumer inflation came in at 4.17% in July.
Another turning point for the bond market will come if the RBI steps up open-market operations, said Kulhalli, who expects the central bank to buy as much as  ₹ 1.5 trillion of bonds for the fiscal year ending March. It has purchased  ₹ 30,000 crore as of July.
“A big factor which had led bond yields higher right from October last year was the mismatch between demand and supply,"" he said. RBI purchases “will shore up the demand side of the balance meaningfully and act as a cap on yields."""

New Delhi: Google India on Tuesday said it has rebranded its Indian payments app Tez as Google Pay and is partnering four banks to provide instant loans for the app’s users. In the coming weeks, Google Pay users will be able to access customised loans from HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Federal Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd with minimal paperwork, said Caesar Sengupta, vice-president of Google’s Next Billion Users Initiative and Payments, at the Google for India event in New Delhi. Once users holding accounts with these banks accept the bank’s terms, the money will be transferred to their accounts.

Once users holding accounts with these banks accept the bank’s terms, the money will be transferred to their accounts.
“We have learnt that when we build for India, we build for the world, and we believe that many of the innovations and features we have pioneered with Tez will work globally,"" Caesar Sengupta said.
Google Tez, which was launched in September, will also expand services for merchants and retailers. About 15,000 retail stores in India will have Google Pay enabled by Diwali 2018, Caesar Sengupta said.
Google claims that over 1.2 million small businesses in India are already using Google Pay. In a bid to help their business grow further, Google is building a dedicated merchant experience where they will be discovered through Google Search and Maps, and communicate with their customers through messages and offers.
“We are testing these features with merchants in Bangalore and Delhi, and on-boarding more neighbourhoods in the following months,"" said Sengupta.
Google Pay has rivals in Paytm and Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp targeting the Indian payments market. On Tuesday, Mint reported that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sealed a deal with Paytm, marking the legendary investor’s first investment in the country. A string of other big-name players are also expanding in India’s digital payments market including its banks, India Post Payments Bank, and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio.
“The real competition is actually user habits and cash,"" said Sengupta. “So, all of us (referring to the other players) are all in many ways brothers-in-arms who are trying to move people’s habits away from cash to digital so that we can move India to a digital economy. At Google, we focus on the users so we don’t think so much of the competition.""
Since its launch, over 55 million people have downloaded Google Tez and more than 22 million people and businesses actively use the app for digital transactions every month, according to company data and figures quoted by Sengupta. Collectively, they have made more than 750 million transactions, with an annual run rate of over $30 billion.
The search giant also announced other initiatives including expanding its Google Station internet access programme to 12,000 villages and cities across Andhra Pradesh, potentially reaching 10 million people; the launch of Project Navlekha, where Google will work with Indian publishers to bring more relevant content online; and a new feature in Google Go app that can pull up any webpage and let users listen to it with each word lighting up as it is read."

Realme 2’s first sale in India will go live today at 12 pm. The budget phone by Oppo’s ex sub-brand was launched in India last week at a starting price of  ₹ 8,990 and available for purchase exclusively through Flipkart.

The offers on the phone include  ₹ 750 off on HDFC Bank debit and credit card,  ₹ 4,200 instant benefits from Reliance Jio along with 120GB additional data and no cost EMI.
Realme 2: Quick review
When the Realme 1 was launched, it garnered praised from a lot of critics for offering a great design and even better specifications at a starting price of  ₹ 8,990. However, it did cut a few corners to get everything in a rather well rounded package. For instance, the only biometric option available on the Realme 1 is face-unlocking, as it skips the fingerprint scanner. Face-unlocking, as we are all warned, isn’t the most secure way of unlocking your device. The second area it left us hoping for more was the dual camera setup, which allows for better portrait imagery.
However, its successor — the Realme 2 — has got us thinking about the whole point of letting out an “upgrade"" and that too, in such a hurry. Most phone upgrades are offered in an attempt to end a product’s life cycle, which ranges between a year and two. For instance, the Xiaomi’s Note and Samsung’s Galaxy S series are given a refresh after nearly every 12 months. A new upgrade is also announced when a product is not selling well.
The Realme 1 was launched three months ago, it is still selling particularly well and it is still not obsolete in any sense. So what has the now-independent brand packed in the Realme 2, that justifies such a quick succession?
Design and display:
To begin with, the design has remained largely unchanged – it features the same diamond cut back with a plastic coating and glossy metal railings on the side. The tendency of the phone to catch scratches on the back will make you put on a case or skin, which ultimately renders that rather unique diamond cut back useless.
The front of the Realme 2 features a notched display unlike its predecessor, which still provided an 18:9 display. The display size also received a bump, from 6-inches diagonally on the Realme 1 to 6.2-inches on the Realme 2. However, the overall resolution and hence the pixel density takes a hit here – the Realme 2 featuring a 1520x720 screen with a pixel density of ~241 ppi as compared to the 2160x1080 screen with a pixel density of ~402 ppi on the Realme 1. This means the Realme 1 has a superior screen overall, keeping aside the size part of the equation.
Hardware and performance:
The same story follows in the chipset area, which also happens to be my biggest annoyance. The refreshed Realme 2 features a Snapdragon 450, which is a step back from the Mediatek Helio P60 on the Realme 1. The P60 on the Realme 1 offered a higher clock speed and a higher RAM speed than the Snapdragon 450. To offer a worthy “upgrade"", the Realme 2 should have at least featured a Snapdragon 625, which still wouldn’t be enough to beat the P60.
Realme 2's performance while running Asphalt 9 pic.twitter.com/vJWeAub4H3
You wouldn’t notice the difference while performing casual tasks like web browsing, but as soon as you hit a snag on Facebook or Instagram, you’ll notice some serious lag. This also holds true for the gaming experience. I tried Asphalt 9 on the handset and I could immediately notice frame drops, which made handling my car extremely difficult. And to add insult to injury, this wasn’t even the highest graphics setting. Couple that with the RAM woes, and you’ve a couple of seconds of suspended animation while switching apps from the multi tasking window. It is important to notice that a model with higher RAM and internal storage might be on its way — at the end of the launch event it was announced that Realme has a surprise for us. Realme 1’s top-of-the-line model featuring 6GB RAM and 128GB variant was also launched this way.
Camera:
The camera is package is an upgrade from the previous model though. It now features a secondary 2MP depth sensor alongside the 13MP primary sensor, something that the previous variant lacked. I could only try the camera indoors on inanimate objects, but you can see that the portrait mode did a pretty decent job of defocusing the background from my pair of headphones. The selfies are also good for a phone this price. They are adequately bright and don’t have a lot of noise, even when clicking photos indoors.
The camera app, however, has quite a bit of lag. It takes a hiccup or two to get me to the photo gallery after I am done clicking a picture.
Connectivity and other features:
The new fingerprint scanner is great. It never misses a fingerprint and unlocks the phone in a jiffy.
Realme has skipped the USB Type-C port on this phone and I think it is not a decision that people might mind, as Micro-USB ports are nearly ubiquitous. It also comes with the headphone jack.
Price:
The Realme 2 costs nearly the same as the Realme 1 — starting at  ₹ 8,990 for the 3GB RAM/32GB ROM version and going up to  ₹ 10,990 for the 4GB RAM/64GB ROM version.
Verdict:
We feel that Realme 2 should be considered as a variant of the Realme 1, featuring a better camera, a fingerprint reader and a Snapdragon chipset which suits people who want those features instead of a faster chipset and a single way to unlock the phone."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

The announcement comes after Sharma decided to leave on 31 December, cutting short her term of three years that began on 1 June. Sharma’s move comes at a time when Axis Bank had posted a sharp rise in bad loans.
According to analysts, the central bank’s asset quality review (AQR) in late 2015 led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders, including Axis Bank. In the quarters that followed, Axis Bank turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR."

India’s third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd will have a new chief four months from now.

India’s third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd will have a new chief four months from now. After a tumultuous three years, the private sector lender’s books are on the mend as its June quarter results showed. Its stressed assets have fallen, it has made large provisions towards all toxic loans and the bank has improved its loan mix by focusing on retail. 
With toxic assets reducing as a part of total loans, the overhang on interest income and margins will recede. Shikha Sharma, current managing director and chief executive officer at the bank, will have some more time to fix the balance sheet.
Amitabh Chaudhry, currently heading HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, is likely to have a far better book to inherit next year. 
Chaudhry will have a lender poised to grow, especially in the retail and small business space. Of course, a lot of this depends on how resolution of the assets under the insolvency code pan out towards which Axis Bank has an exposure of close to  ₹ 6,000 crore. 
What does Chaudhry bring to the table and what changes can one expect at the lender given that an outsider will be at the helm?
Chaudhry has deep exposure to technology through his BPO (business process outsourcing) days at Infosys Ltd. He also has knowledge on the retail segment for financial products through HDFC Standard Life. 
Analysts are already taking the leadership change positively as it puts an end to the uncertainty. “We would describe Mr Chaudhry as a turnaround expert,"" wrote analysts at IDFC Securities Ltd. They believe that his past success with HDFC Standard Life ensures that Axis Bank too will see its profitability grow. 
Many analysts have upgraded the Axis Bank stock, and it rose marginally amid broad weakness in the markets on Monday. 
However, Chaudhry has all but five years of experience in banking before he headed the Infosys BPO business. As far as risk management and assessment, and corporate banking goes, it could be a blind spot given that his banking experience was as early as 1990s. 
As analyst Hemindra Hazari notes in Smartkarma, a research website, Chaudhry may need to seek help from experts in the field of banking to bring Axis Bank to the next growth level. 
Growth through using technology in conjunction with banking solutions is something Chaudhry should be adept at. But for risk management and assessment, he perhaps may need to seek external advice.
For now, investors are relieved that the uncertainty over leadership is over and Axis Bank is being passed on to able hands."

Mumbai: Mumbai Police has arrested a parking attendant in Mumbai’s Kamala Mills compound for allegedly killing Siddharth Sanghvi, a vice-president of HDFC Bank, about a week ago. The accused Sarfaraz Shaikh, alias Rais, has confessed before the police that robbery was the motive of killing the 39-year-old senior bank executive.
According to the police, Sarfaraz, who also worked as a cab driver, was desperately seeking to arrange  ₹ 30,000 to pay EMI for his bike loan. He tracked Sanghvi’s movements for a few days and found him to be a good target. Both of them worked in the same building.
Last Wednesday after Sanghvi left office, Sarfaraz attacked him with a knife in the parking bay with the intention of robbing him. A scuffle broke out between the two and eventually the bank executive lost his life.
The accused then stuffed the victim’s body in his car and disposed it at Kalyan in the neighbouring Thane district and dumped the car in Navi Mumbai.
As Sanghvi, a resident of upscale Malabar Hills area in south Mumbai, went missing after leaving office, his family lodged a police complaint. His phone was switched off by the accused. Three days later, Sanghvi’s father received a call from an unknown person trying to convince him that his son was safe and he need not worry.
His car, which was found by the police on Friday, had blood stains. On Monday, his corpse was recovered in a decomposed condition.
The cabbie was caught after police traced the phone call made to Sanghvi’s father. Sarfaraz changed the SIM card while making the phone call but used the same mobile phone handset while making the call.
He was interrogated by the police and then taken into custody during which he is alleged to have confessed to the crime."

On the fateful night, Shaikh was prowling with a knife in the parking lot to attack any of his three targets, whoever turned up first. It was Sanghvi’s bad luck that he was the one. “He (Sanghvi) just happened to be at that place when Sheikh was on the prowl.... It was sheer bad luck for Sanghvi,"" the police told HT.
When Shaikh got hold of Sanghvi in the deserted parking lot, the banker tried to resist, but by then a knife was already at his throat. Refusing to surrender, Sanghvi moved his head and his neck was slit. Police said the assailant then panicked and went on to stab the banker 14 times.
After Shaikh’s version was found to be the same by three different teams of interrogators, the police was convinced that he was the solitary assassin."

Mumbai: State-run insurer Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC) is likely to subscribe to non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth up to  ₹ 4,000 crore that IL&FS Group is planning to issue in order to avail capital for servicing its debt. The NCD issuance is part of IL&FS’s  ₹ 9,000 crore capital raising programme for the current fiscal year. 
Mumbai: State-run insurer Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC) is likely to subscribe to non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth up to  ₹ 4,000 crore that IL&FS Group is planning to issue in order to avail capital for servicing its debt. The NCD issuance is part of IL&FS’s  ₹ 9,000 crore capital raising programme for the current fiscal year.
Two persons directly aware of LIC’s investment plans confirmed this on condition of anonymity.
Debt-laden IL&FS, which is promoted by LIC, State Bank of India and a few other private and state-run lenders, is holding a crucial board meeting on Saturday to decide on capital raising needs, especially to avoid more defaults on repayments and rating downgrades.
The first of the two people cited above said that LIC is also willing to subscribe to a large part of the  ₹ 4,500 crore rights issue to be launched by IL&FS a few weeks later.
“IL&FS is looking to raise a total of at least  ₹ 9,000 crore through rights issue and loans. SBI Capital Markets Ltd is working as the investment banker-cum-advisor for IL&FS’ capital raising programme,"" said this person.
Emails sent to LIC, SBI Capital Markets and IL&FS on Thursday remained unanswered.
LIC holds 25.34% in IL&FS, while HDFC Ltd has 9.02%, Central Bank of India holds 7.67% and State Bank of India owns 6.42%. ORIX Corp. of Japan and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority have 23.54% and 12.56% stake in IL&FS, respectively.
The liquidity infusion by LIC, through NCD purchases and rights issue subscription, will be crucial for the country’s largest infrastructure development and finance company, which is in the process of building the country’s longest tunnel—the Chenani-Nashri tunnel (9.2 km) in Jammu and Kashmir—but is struggling to repay its debt.
According to its annual report, around  ₹ 5,756 crore worth of debt is coming up for repayment in the next one year for IL&FS.
As of 31 March, IL&FS’ total outstanding loans stood at  ₹ 91,091.31 crore, according to the annual report. This is about 14% more than its fiscal 2017 end borrowings outstanding at  ₹ 80,017.72 crore. Most of the debts arise from loans given by the group’s subsidiaries IL&FS Financial Services Ltd, IL&FS Energy Development Co. Ltd, IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd and IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure Co. Ltd. IL&FS has 24 direct and 135 indirect subsidiaries.
Of the total outstanding debt,  ₹ 57,322.15 crore is in bank loans (term loans and cash credit from banks) alone, mostly from state-run banks.
IL&FS Transport Network, the holding firm of the group’s road assets, alone has consolidated debt of Rs35,000 crore. IL&FS Financial Services has Rs17,000 crore of debt, classified as standard asset for most banks, according to a Nomura India report.
On Friday, The Economic Times reported that IL&FS will sell its corporate headquarters in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex to raise funds. It is expected to fetch Rs1,300-1,500 crore, said the report.
IL&FS recently defaulted on inter-corporate deposits and commercial papers (CP), which prompted the Reserve Bank of India to initiate an audit into the group and resulted in a number of rating downgrades. On 6 September, IL&FS Financial Services, IL&FS group’s lending arm, was barred from accessing the CP market till the end of February 2019 as it failed to repay some of its maturing CPs on their due dates, according to company filings on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The company said in its filing CPs which was due on 28 and 30 August could not be paid on the due date. These were settled in full on 31 August.
“In compliance with the Reserve Bank Commercial Paper Directions, 2017, the company will not access CP market up to 28 February, 2019,"" read the exchange filing by the company.
On 4 September, Moneylife reported that IL&FS has defaulted in repaying a short-term loan of Rs1,000 crore to Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi).
“At the same time, a subsidiary of IL&FS too has defaulted in repaying loan worth about Rs500 crore to the development financial institution,"" said the Moneylife report.
Rating firm Icra Ltd. downgraded IL&FS by at least nine notches last Saturday due to the serious liquidity crunch the group is facing. The rating company has downgraded the company’s bonds and long-term loans to BB from AA+."

New Delhi: HDFC Bank Ltd has sent nearly 250 summons through e-mail and WhatsApp to customers who evade compliance and hopes to settle cases faster by adopting the newer methods of communication. “HDFC Bank is pursuing with various courts in the country to take up digital means of communication which include issuing notices, summons, through e-mails and WhatsApp which will help in faster disposal of the cases,"" a bank official said.
The official said over 60 lakh cheque bounce cases are pending in the country and HDFC Bank has taken a lead by requesting the courts to use digital means to issue summons.
“We have been sending summons through e-mail, on WhatsApp. In many cases, we have seen that customers deny having received any summon at all if sent through post. “It also happens that people change residence more often but their e-mail IDs and mobile phone number do not change in general, so we thought this is an effective means of communication,"" the official said.
The bank has been adopting this method after a Supreme Court appointed amicus curiae recommended closure of proceedings in all cheque bounce cases through digital means. The offence falls under section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act which defines and amend the law relating to promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques.
HDFC Bank has sent nearly 250 summons through digital means so far and hopes to settle the cases falling under the Act in a speedy manner, said the official. The summons sent digitally so far by the bank are mainly concentrated in Maharashtra, Gujarat, West Bengal, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh. A few cases are related to accounts in Delhi, Chandigarh, Rajasthan and Jammu & Kashmir.
Majority of these summons have been sent on e-mail, a significant on WhatsApp while others have been sent on both platforms. Sending digital summon assumes significance as the pending cheque bounce cases in various lower courts is clogging the criminal justice system, the bank official said.
There are over 1.93 crore criminal cases pending across the country, as per the latest data of National Judicial Data Grid."

Shares of asset management companies HDFC AMC and Reliance Nippon AMC fell over 7% and 8%, respectively, after Sebi on Tuesday capped the total expense ratio (TER) for mutual fund schemes. Here is what analysts say about the impact on AMCs:Morgan Stanley cut the target price for HDFC AMC by 14%, saying the stock has been weak in anticipation of adverse regulation. It expects some further near-term weakness.Nomura cut rating for Reliance Nippon to “neutral” from “buy”, and TP to Rs 210 from Rs 315. The brokerage says this TER cut clearly derails profitability for asset management companies. AMCs will have to also absorb a fair share of the impact and this will take away any operating leverage left in near term for the business, noted Nomura.Citi says, while lower TER would mean lower revenues, mutual funds could cushion the impact by some pass through to distributors and by lower promotional expenses. Over medium term, lower charges can make mutual funds more attractive for investors and aid penetration, added Citi.CLSA says AMCs’ ability to pass on impact to distributors will be key to their ability to defend the earnings impact. If they pass 50-70% of impact then the impact on earnings would moderate to 10%, it added.Emkay Research says “(This) will have direct negative impact on overall revenue yields for most AMCs in the industry. Though the large AMCs are enjoying economies of scale and operational efficiencies with recent rise in AUMs, however this will further pressure the yields on AUM for AMCs.”

“(This) will have a direct negative impact on overall revenue yields for most AMCs. What the recent rise in assets under management, this will lead to further pressure yields,"" said Emkay Research in a note to its investors.
Sebi said all mutual fund commissions and expenses must be paid from the scheme itself, adding that the industry must adopt a full trail model of commission in all schemes without paying any upfront commission. Trail commissions are payments earned by distributors as long as investors stay invested in the scheme.

Rising borrowing costs following the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) in July 2017, demonetisation in November 2016 and a slight slowdown in flows to local funds have led to underperformance by India’s smaller stocks this year. The S&P BSE Small Cap Index is down 15% in 2018 compared with a 9.5% gain for the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index.
“Large-cap stocks will give you steady returns—about 12 % per year—but a mix with small- and mid-cap shares can fetch investors at least 18 percent returns annually,"" Jasani said. HDFC Securities echoes London-based Ashburton Investments Ltd., which last month recommended buying Indian mid-caps for protection from trade wars and emerging market contagion from Turkey.
The next major opportunity for smaller shares may come around the general elections in May 2019, when large stocks may underperform, Jasani said. The analyst sees the NSE Nifty 50 Index dropping to 10,100 before or just after the elections amid investor concerns about global pressures as well as domestic issues such as ballooning deficits, the weakening rupee and bad loans.
Jasani said a retail investor should have an investment basket of 20 stocks, of which five should be businesses that one “firmly believes in long term,"" with the remaining 15 churned according to cycles.
“Smart investors demand quality management, visibility in earnings and revenue growth, and low variability in profit margins, and they are willing to pay a premium for that,"" he said."
501,2018-09-20,HDFC,"The worrying bit for investors in large mutual fund companies such as HDFC AMC is that the regulator isn't very pleased with the high market share of India's largest fund houses

Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. But investments in shares of mutual fund companies are subject to market risks as well as regulatory risks. This should have been obvious and priced into shares of asset management companies (AMCs). For some reason, it wasn’t. Shares of HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd and Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd fell 8.7% and 12.5%, respectively, on Wednesday after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) cut the maximum permissible limits for expense ratios charged to mutual fund investors. 
Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. But investments in shares of mutual fund companies are subject to market risks as well as regulatory risks.

Ltd and Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd fell 8.7% and 12.5%, respectively, on Wednesday after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) cut the maximum permissible limits for expense ratios charged to mutual fund investors.
In fact, HDFC AMC shares had strangely risen by over 12% soon after news reports emerged that Sebi had formed a sub-committee to review existing caps on expense ratios.
The correction in its shares was much-needed in any case, given that valuations had reached absurd levels. Note here that shares of AMCs haven’t been great investments globally, and some amount of caution with regards to Indian AMCs is warranted as well. 
Sebi chairman Ajay Tyagi’s comments at an industry conference last month suggest that the review of expense ratios has partly to do with a high concentration of industry revenues and profits among a few large AMCs. The new slab structure favours funds that are relatively small in size over large funds. While it remains to be seen how mutual fund distributors adapt to the new structure, one possibility is that they would push mutual fund schemes that aren’t very large-sized. Of course, large mutual fund companies may also launch new funds to benefit from the new slab structure, although it’s not clear if Sebi’s circular will close this loophole.
The worrying bit for investors in large mutual fund companies such as HDFC AMC is that the regulator isn’t very pleased with the high market share of India’s largest fund houses. As such, regulatory risk can be alive and kicking for some time to come.
“Returns of asset management companies have, in general, been trending down for many years now. The cap on expenses ratios is one part of the equation; costs have been rising too, with myriad compliance requirements,"" points out a fund manager at a domestic mutual fund."

499,2018-09-26,HDFC,"Significantly, both LIC and HDFC are still undecided whether they will invest additional money to bail out IL&FS

Mumbai/New Delhi: Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)’s nominee director abruptly stepped down from the board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) in September 2017. In July, Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), IL&FS’s biggest shareholder, withdrew from a panel mandated to take the company public, without giving any reason. The series of events over the past year, in which IL&FS’s most influential shareholders have washed their hands of the now crisis-hit company, may indicate that they were aware of its sharply deteriorating financials. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC)’s nominee director abruptly stepped down from the board of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) in September 2017. In July, Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), IL&FS’s biggest shareholder, withdrew from a panel mandated to take the company public, without giving any reason. The series of events over the past year, in which IL&FS’s most influential shareholders have washed their hands of the now crisis-hit company, may indicate that they were aware of its sharply deteriorating financials.
State-owned LIC owns 25.34% and HDFC owns 9.02% in IL&FS.
Surprisingly, HDFC has not nominated a director to the board of IL&FS since Harish Engineer, the mortgage lender’s nominee director, quit last year.
LIC decided not to be part of an initial public offering (IPO) committee, which was reconstituted on 21 July after IL&FS chairman Ravi Parthasarathy resigned. This, despite the fact that LIC, along with another institutional shareholder, Bay Capital, was part of the IPO panel when it was first formed in December 2014.
“I cannot answer why LIC was not part of the reconstituted panel, but then it should be no surprise that it was very clear by then (when the committee was reconstituted in July 2018) that IL&FS had clearly dumped all plans of going public,"" said an executive directly familiar with the developments.
An email sent to HDFC, LIC and Bay Capital seeking comment went unanswered.
The two events, according to corporate governance experts, indicate that shareholders of IL&FS were aware of the impending financial challenges.
“It is difficult to believe that many of the board members could not have seen that IL&FS is headed for trouble because of the issues related to the PPP (public-private partnership) model followed by the group,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder of proxy firm InGovern Research.
Significantly, both LIC and HDFC are still undecided whether they will invest additional money to bail out IL&FS. A decision on fresh infusion of equity would be taken at a board meeting on 29 September.
On Tuesday, LIC chairman V.K. Sharma, after a meeting at the finance ministry, told reporters that all efforts were being made to keep IL&FS afloat. “We will ensure IL&FS does not collapse. We will not allow contagion to spread from IL&FS... All options are open (including raising stake in the company),"" said Sharma.
“An IPO Committee was constituted on December 9, 2014 for working out a strategy for initial public offer of the company. The committee comprised of Mr Ravi Parthasarathy, chairman, Mr Hari Sankaran, Mr Arun K Saha, Mr Sanjeev Doshi, Mr Vibhav Kapoor, representatives of institutional shareholders viz: LIC and Bay Capital,"" said IL&FS’s 2018 annual report.
“Consequent to the resignation of Mr Ravi Parthasarathy with effect from July 21, 2018, the committee was reconstituted. The current composition of the committee includes Mr Hari Sankaran, chairman, Mr Sanjeev Doshi, Mr PK Molri, Mr Arun K Saha, and Mr Vibhav Kapoor.""
It is not clear if Bay Capital continues to remain invested in IL&FS, as the company’s shareholding pattern for the quarter ended March does not name Bay Capital as an institutional shareholder. As per IL&FS’s ownership details, Bay Capital Investment Managers Pvt. Ltd last held a 0.27% stake in the group until January 2015."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

In August, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had resorted to a back-to-back interest rate hike for the first time in almost five years to curb inflation. The RBI is set to again review interest rates on October 5.
The RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) may raise policy rates by 25 basis points on Friday for the third time this year amid surging crude oil prices and weakening rupee. Of the 15 economists surveyed by Mint, 14 expect RBI to raise repo rate, the rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to 6.75%. Only one economist expects a 50 basis points hike to 7%.
Shares of HDFC ended 3% higher on BSE at  ₹ 1,811, as compared to a 0.83% gain in Sensex.
HDFC had posted a 54% rise in net profit to  ₹ 2,190 crore for the quarter ended 30 June compared with  ₹ 1,424 crore a year earlier. Net interest income during the quarter rose 20% to  ₹ 2,890 crore from  ₹ 2,412 crore year earlier. HDFC’s home loan book stood at  ₹ 3.72 trillion at the end of June.
Last month, SBI, the country’s largest lender, increased its benchmark lending rates or MCLR by 20 basis points. SBI increased the lending rate by 20 basis points across all tenors up to three years. The MCLR for a one-year tenor rose to 8.45% from 8.25% earlier."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.

MCLR is the benchmark lending rate used to lend by banks and RPLR is used by non-banking finance companies. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point (bps).

MCLR is the benchmark lending rate used to lend by banks and RPLR is used by non-banking finance companies. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point (bps).
Rising interest rate regime
SBI, the country’s largest lender, increased its one-year MCLR from 8.45% to 8.50%. For an amount of  ₹ 30 lakh, the bank will now provide home loan at 8.70-8.85%, up from 8.65%-8.80%. 
ICICI Bank Ltd has increased its six-month MCLR from 8.50% to 8.60% and one-year MCLR to 8.65% from 8.55%. The bank offers home loan on both six-month and one-year MCLR. The spread on the home loan from the bank ranges between 30-90 bps depending on the type of loan, type of borrower and the loan amount. A spread is a margin that is above MCLR, which adds up to your overall home loan amount. 
HDFC is providing home loan at 8.80-8.85% for loan amount up to  ₹ 30 lakh, up from 8.70-8.75%.
In the last two policy reviews, the central bank increased repo rate by 25 bps each. According to banking analysts, RBI is likely to increase the rate during the Friday review as well. “We expect a 25 bps hike in repo rate in October policy and it may not be the last in the financial year. We rule out a hike of 50 bps, as it may spook the market. However, there is an outside probability of change in neutral stance too, as three successive rate hikes, with a neutral stance could contradict RBI’s message,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India, in a note.
What should you do?
If you are planning to take a home loan, you need to know that there are two types of loan options—fixed rate loan and floating rate loan. In a fixed rate loan, the bank gives you a fixed rate for a particular tenure. In case of floating rate loan, the interest rate will change depending on the interest rate cycle. Financial planners suggest that one should opt for floating rate loans. 
“No one can time the interest rates while taking a home loan. Moreover, housing loan lasts for a longer duration loan—over 20-year period. Hence, since there will be changing interest rate cycles, it is better to have a floating rate,"" said Suresh Sadagopan, a Mumbai-based financial planner. 
“Again, if you look at a typical home loan borrower, most of them end up prepaying the loan. Hence, there is no need to block it at a fixed rate loan,"" he added.
Remember that usually fixed rate loans are priced higher than home loan rates. Also, when it comes to prepayment, you may have to pay a prepayment penalty for a fixed rate loan. In case of floating rate loans, there is no prepayment penalty.
Besides the interest rate, you also need look at other charges when you opt for a home loan. 
Home loans usually have charges such as processing fee, administrative cost and franking charges. You need to factor in these costs and the interest rate before taking a loan.
As a borrower, you can also negotiate with a bank or housing finance company to waive off the charges if you have a good credit score. If you are an existing home loan borrower, you need to check your interest rate. If it is too high, try to convert into a lower rate through balance transfer. 
“It will make sense only if the new interest rate is lower by over 75 bps. However, if your home loan rate difference is say around 100 bps, in a competitive scenario, these do get corrected. If you are looking to do a balance transfer of your home loan, other than interest rate also check for the charges,"" said Sadagopan. 
Usually balance transfer works if your remaining home loan tenure is over 10 years."

493,2018-10-05,HDFC,"What's been different about the correction in the past few sessions is that market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries, TCS and the HDFC twins were also punished

Asian equities slipped on Thursday on worries that a stronger US economy will result in interest rate hikes, and make emerging market assets even less attractive for foreign investors. Investors in Indian equities have a lot more to worry about. Not that anything materially new has emerged in terms of information, but the liquidity squeeze has forced investors to finally acknowledge the cracks in the India story. For quite some time now, the markets have been afloat using either the “earnings aren’t growing, but the macro is great"" argument or its counterpart, “there are worries on the macro-economy, but earnings are growing"". 
Asian equities slipped on Thursday on worries that a stronger US economy will result in interest rate hikes, and make emerging market assets even less attractive for foreign investors. Investors in Indian equities have a lot more to worry about. Not that anything materially new has emerged in terms of information, but the liquidity squeeze has forced investors to finally acknowledge the cracks in the India story. For quite some time now, the markets have been afloat using either the “earnings aren’t growing, but the macro is great"" argument or its counterpart, “there are worries on the macro-economy, but earnings are growing"".
There is no place to hide now, with earnings being downgraded at the same time when macroeconomic worries, such as a widening current account deficit and the need to slow down the economy, are causing investors to flee. It’s the proverbial perfect storm.
The rupee hit a fresh low of 73.80 against the US dollar on Thursday, despite the government’s desperate measures to curb the currency’s free fall. In a double-whammy, the price of Brent crude rose to $86 per barrel. In short, the country’s current account deficit will worsen further.
Consequently, the yield on benchmark 10-year bonds hardened, adding to the panic in the equity market. Expectations that the Reserve Bank of India will adopt an aggressive monetary policy stance on Friday also eroded the risk appetite.
The fear gauge, National Stock Exchange’s India VIX (volatility index) rose 9.65% to an intraday high of 19.68. But it’s still far below its peak of 20.015 in February.
What’s been different about the correction in the past few sessions is that market heavyweights such as Reliance Industries Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and the HDFC twins were also punished. Earlier, a correction in other stocks would lead to a flight to safety in the above-mentioned counters. But this had resulted in bizarre valuations in sectors such as IT services and a few other stocks. As such, they were ripe for a correction. 
It’s interesting that the IT and pharmaceutical stocks were the biggest losers on Thursday, despite the continuing slide in the rupee. Finally, the markets seem to have given up silly props such as “buy shares of exporters whenever the rupee falls, regardless of where valuations are"".
Investors have also been forced to reckon with the fact that earnings are under pressure. Hopes of a revival in corporate earnings have dimmed, thanks to input cost pressures. Besides, worries of a liquidity crisis in the NBFC (non-banking financial company) sector still loom. Public sector banks are still struggling to get rid of their bad loan baggage. What’s more, subdued sales of automobiles in September could well mean that the consumption story is faltering.
While all of this has led to a much-needed reality check on Indian stocks, valuations of Indian equities remain expensive. As the chart shows, the one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of MSCI India Index is much higher than that of its Asian peers, excluding Japan. While the gap has narrowed a bit compared to early September, it remains wide. And the India VIX suggests there is a fair bit of complacency in the markets.
But given the rapidly deteriorating situation on the macroeconomic front, the downgrade in corporate earnings and the liquidity shock, it shouldn’t be surprising if the markets continue in correction mode."
492,2018-10-08,HDFC,"The IPOs of Aavas Financiers, Garden Reach and Dinesh Engineers saw lacklustre, barely weeks after the blockbuster share sales of Ircon International and HDFC AMC

The turmoil in the stock markets has made retail and high net-worth investors (HNI) wary of initial public offerings (IPOs), leaving institutional investors to do the heavy lifting to see share sales through. 
The turmoil in the stock markets has made retail and high net-worth investors (HNI) wary of initial public offerings (IPOs), leaving institutional investors to do the heavy lifting to see share sales through.
The benchmark Sensex shed almost 1,850 points, or 5.1%, in the last one week to close at 34,376.99 on Friday. A little over a month ago, the Sensex had closed at an all-time high of 38,896.6 points. 
Against the backdrop of investor confidence shaken due to a falling rupee and rising crude oil and liquidity fears thanks to a string of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services group, three recent IPOs saw little participation from retail and HNI investors and have had to depend heavily on institutional investors.
As per stock exchange data, the  ₹ 1,734 crore IPO of housing finance company Aavas Financiers saw HNI and retail investors subscribe to only 26% and 25% of the shares reserved for them, respectively. The IPO made it through on the back of institutional investors, with the category getting subscribed 2.77 times. The IPO closed on 27 September.
Others have fared worse. The share sale of state-run defence manufacturer Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Ltd had to be extended for three days, eventually sailing through on the back of a 1.81 times subscription in the institutional category. Retail and HNI portions of the share sale were subscribed just 31% and 24%, respectively. 
Dinesh Engineers Ltd, which launched its IPO on 28 September, had to abandon its sale after failing to attract enough interest across all three classes of investors.
The recent performance is in stark contrast with previous IPOs of Ircon International and HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, which were subscribed multiple times across all categories. (See chart).
“There is a lot of nervousness. Investors in the HNI category generally look to make a quick buck on listing; so they apply heavily. In the current scenario, one is not sure of gains on listing. So, they would typically keep away,"" said Prithvi Haldea, chairman of Prime Database group, a primary market tracker. He added that retail participation generally follows institutional participation in an IPO and the latter being weak has had an impact on retail participation.
“The QIB (qualified institutional buyers) subscription has also been poor. Retail takes cues from QIBs, if the QIB book is weak, then you would rarely see retail investors coming in large numbers,"" he said. “Market sentiment and other factors are important, but for the retail market the most important cue is QIB subscription. And that has been weak; so retail is bound to be weak."" 
Industry experts say market conditions and investor pessimism could mean weak post listing performance for these issuances. “In a falling market, such investors (retail, HNI) could get more cautious. This could translate into weak listing for the issues that are to be listed,"" said Arun Kejriwal, director of Kejriwal Research and Financial Services Ltd. However, he added that one could see selective interest from these investors, depending on each issue, particularly the pricing of the issue."

This marks the second investment for NIIF’s Fund of Funds and will see NIIF join a unit of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) as an investor in HCARE 2. 
“NIIF’s investment in HCARE 2 demonstrates the role that NIIF’s Fund of Funds can play in the infrastructure and associated sectors in India by anchoring and investing with fund managers with strong track records,"" NIIF said. 
HCARE 2 is structured as a Category II Alternative Investment Fund with a corpus of  ₹ 4,290 crore. The fund provides mezzanine finance to developers of mid-income and affordable urban housing projects.
“Housing remains a critical need in India and the demand for housing is expected to grow substantially with increased urbanization.

The September quarter (Q2) saw different shades of performance by life insurance companies and the pressure on their unit-linked products was patently visible. In terms of profitability, HDFC Standard Life overshadowed its peers ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life in performance. HDFC Life reported a robust 28% growth in value of new business and a huge 43% increase in new business premium. As a consequence, its value for new business margin was 24.3%, the highest among the three insurers who have reported results so far.
Not just individuals, but companies also grabbed the insurer’s products as it saw a 36% growth in its group new business premium. But the key gain was in the margin-friendly protection business (term plans), the share of which grew to 16.2% from 11.8% in the overall annualized premium equivalent. Protection business has been the focus of many insurers mainly due to its potential to increase profitability and the stability it lends to the product portfolio.
In this aspect, HDFC Life’s portfolio mix is superior to its peers. The share of protection in the annualized premium equivalent of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was 7.9% for the six months ended September.
The share of equity-linked products continues to dominate the portfolio of all three insurers. Considering the dismal performance of equity markets over the past month, Ulips have fallen out of favour, affecting the growth rate of premiums for the insurers. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw its new business premium drop by 5%. That said, ICICI Prudential Life could squeeze enough bang for a buck as its value of new business surged 41.5%, unlike the other two. The insurer even reported an impressive value for new business margin, at 17.5%.
SBI Life continued to report strong growth metrics despite being the largest insurer. Its new business premium grew 30% while the value of new business premium rose by 22%. Analysts believe that at roughly two times its estimated embedded value for FY20, SBI Life’s stock is reasonably valued. The valuation of HDFC Standard Life however is viewed as stretched, with some brokerages having a sell call on the stock."

Asset quality was stable and net interest margin (NIM) improved to 3.5% from 3.4% in the previous quarter. It should be noted that non-banking financial companies started reporting earnings as per the Ind-As format in the June quarter and NIMs have been calculated as per the new accounting standard.
HDFC’s total loan book grew 17% to  ₹ 3.79 trillion, with the individual loan book growing 18%. The mortgage lender’s thrust on affordable housing continues and loan growth is driven by home loans to individuals belonging to the economically weaker and low-income groups.
During the half-year ended 30 September, 37% of home loans approved in volume terms and 18% in value terms have been to customers from these two categories. On an average, HDFC has been approving 8,300 loans on a monthly basis to these segments, with monthly average of such approvals at approximately  ₹ 1,354 crore.
As for non-individual loans, as the alongside chart shows, the segment has grown at a comparatively slower pace and is at a multi-quarter low. 
Although the non-individual book is more margin-friendly, the capital required here is higher than individual loans and so is the risk factor. And considering the ongoing liquidity-related concerns in the industry and slowdown in the real estate sector, it looks like the mortgage lender may be adopting a cautious approach here. 
Meanwhile, ahead of its September quarter earnings, the HDFC stock surged nearly 6% on Wednesday on the National Stock Exchange. However, following the results, the stock ended Thursday’s session down 0.41% at  ₹ 1,762. 
As for valuations, the HDFC stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-book multiple of four times, which is all right, given its stable fundamentals."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.

Housing Development Finance Corp. raised  ₹ 500 crore ($70 million) via a sale of five-year 8.75% notes, it said in an exchange filing. That was higher than the coupon of 6.73% the nation’s largest mortgage lender offered when it previously sold masala debt a year ago.
The firm is returning to the market after the finance ministry withdrew tax payable on offshore rupee bonds in September, in an attempt to attract foreign investment to boost Asia’s worst-performing major currency. The rupee has recovered since October but has still weakened 10.5% this year, weighed down by the increase in crude oil prices and a wider emerging-market rout.
The market for masala notes, which are rupee securities sold abroad, may draw issuers at a time when liquidity is tight domestically. That’s a result of a surprise default by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).
“There’s reasonably good appetite for masala bonds now and we will raise more funds via this channel whenever the opportunity presents itself,"" said Keki Mistry, chief executive officer at the company, in a phone interview. “Liquidity in local markets is still tight even though it has eased a little since the IL&FS fiasco.""

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.

OPEC meets on Thursday in Vienna, followed by talks with allies such as Russia on Friday, amid a drop in crude prices caused by global economic weakness and concerns about an oil glut due largely to a rise in U.S. production.

Mumbai:  HDFC AMC and HDFC Trustee Company on Tuesday settled a case of alleged violation of mutual fund norms with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by paying  ₹ 3.78 crore as settlement fee.
The so-called consent mechanism allows the entities to settle violations by paying a penalty without admission or denial of guilt.
The regulator had initiated adjudication proceedings against HDFC Asset Management Company and HDFC Trustee Company in April for alleged violations of several provisions of mutual fund regulations.
Both firms submitted separate applications with Sebi to settle the case on payment of settlement charges.
The alleged violations pertained to “maturity of a security purchased by a scheme of HDFC Mutual Fund exceeding the maturity of the scheme"", said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The other violations by the fund house included difference in the total expense ratio (TER) for direct and regular plans being lower than the commission paid to the distributors in certain schemes. Excess charges being debited for certain years were credited after a period of more than one year, net asset value (NAV) of certain schemes not being published on HDFC Mutual Funds’ website for a certain period of time and error in valuation of unlisted equity shares of a company, said the same person. He did not wish to be identified.
Earlier in July, the regulator had also directed HDFC AMC, the country’s second largest mutual fund house, to cancel shares allotted to distributors and advisers ahead of its initial public offering.
Sebi had also asked the fund house to return the money it had collected from distributors and independent financial advisers, along with an interest rate of 12 per cent."

Here are 10 updates from the stock market
1) In his first public comment after assuming the charge of RBI, Shaktikanta Das struck a dovish tone on prospects for inflation and also hinted that the RBI might adopt a more growth-friendly monetary framework under his watch. He also said that banking sector would be his key focus and more measures were needed to revive lenders. 
2) Financial stocks have led this round of rally on Dalal Street. Today, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Yes Bank, and SBI were among the top Sensex gainers. 
3) Adding to stock market rally, bonds also rose today after inflation eased sharply in November, bolstering expectations of a RBI rate cut sooner than expected. The 10-year benchmark bond yield fell to 7.38% in early trade from 7.41% in the previous session. Markets also hope for liquidity easing measures from the new RBI chief, who said that there was a need to interact with stakeholders on liquidity issues.
4) The rupee also strengthened as US-China trade tensions eased. The rupee also strengthened to 71.70 a dollar, compared with previous close of 72.01.
5) Data released yesterday after market hours showed consumer inflation falling to a 17-month low of 2.33%, driven by falling food prices, and below the RBI’s medium term target of 4%.
6) Falling oil prices in recent months have eased inflationary pressure on India, a major fuel importer. Since early October, Brent crude prices have dropped by nearly 30% to about $60 per barrel. This has also helped the rupee rebound from October lows of 74.48 a dollar.
7) Separately, data released yesterday also showed India’s industrial output expanded at an annual 8.1% pace in November, the highest in 11 months, compared with a forecast of 5.7%.
8) Some economists expect the RBI will change their monetary policy stance to ‘neutral’ in February from ‘calibrated tightening’ currently, making a rate rise less likely. The RBI may even ease monetary policy to support growth, they say. 
9) Global markets have also rallied on signs of easing China-US trade tensions and expectations that China will step up efforts soon to support its cooling economy. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said trade talks were under way with China. A Reuters report said that China made the first major purchase of US soybeans since Washington and Beijing agreed to a temporary trade truce this month.
10) Trump also said he would intervene in a case against a top executive at Huawei Technologies if it would help secure a trade deal.

Based on share swap ratio, the total business of the merged entity will be  ₹ 15.4 trillion, only a notch below HDFC Bank but above ICICI Bank. “The merger of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank will create the third largest lender in the country, with advances and deposits market share of 6.9% and 7.4%, respectively,"" according to a research report by Motilal Oswal.

3. According to market analysts, the merged Bank of Baroda will have the second largest number of branches in India at 9,511. While BoB already has a widespread network, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank are more regional-focused banks. This will help BoB to strengthen its presence in the western, southern and north-eastern regions. Following the merger, the number of state-run banks will come down to 19 from 21.
4. The finance ministry says the amalgamation will help create a “strong globally competitive bank"" in the form of Bank of Baroda by utilising economies of scale and wide-ranging synergies of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. BoB will take over all businesses, assets, rights, titles, claims, licenses, approvals and other privileges and all property, borrowings, liabilities and obligations of the other two banks.
5. “The bailout of Dena Bank comes at a cost, and the swap ratio reflects adjustments for net NPA; and, hence, we conclude banks with stronger balance sheet are likely to fetch better value for their businesses (in this case Vijaya Bank) while weaker franchises, which are struggling with stressed loans and provisioning burden, are likely to be bailed out at a discount,"" Elara Capital said.
According to market analysts, while typical merger issues like cultural and social, network overlaps, relocations, and business team integration are likely to be an overhang on the near-term performance of Bank of Baroda, the back-end technology integration will be relatively smooth as all three banks operate on the Finacle CBS Platform."

From Bandhan Bank’s perspective, the merger share swap ratio of 2.84:5 is slightly better than what news reports had suggested. The dilution in its equity will be about 1.5% lower compared to a scenario where the share swap ratio was set at 3:5, which isn’t much to celebrate.
Investors are seeing this as a desperate attempt by Bandhan Bank to reduce its promoters’ stake and meet the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) shareholding norms. If the deal materializes, Bandhan Bank’s promoters will own 61% in the bank, down from 82.3% currently. It still needs to do more to reduce promoter holding to 40%, to meet RBI’s rules.
This is particularly worrisome because coming to the halfway mark of the target has itself been an extremely expensive affair. For the deal, Gruh Finance has been valued at an exorbitant valuation of 13.6 times its net worth as on September 2018, while Bandhan Bank’s price-book valuation was pegged at less than half those levels at 6.45 times. This isn’t very far from the average share price of the two companies in the past six months.
Ironically, one of the reasons Gruh Finance enjoys such a high valuation is on account of its parentage. Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) owns 57.8% in the company. With the deal, Gruh Finance will actually lose this exalted status; although Bandhan Bank has ended up buying the whole company at high valuations.
HDFC, on the other hand, gets to sell its stake at a premium valuation. The actual monetization may happen at a later stage, although the share swap ratio ensures it has got itself a sweet deal. In fact, this gives it the best of both worlds, since it can freely pursue the low-income segment without worrying about overlaps with subsidiary, Gruh Finance. HDFC said that 18% of its lending in the first half of this year has been towards the low-income group and economically-weak sections of society, where the loan value is between  ₹ 8 lakh and  ₹ 10 lakh.
But it is not all thorns for Bandhan Bank. The lender is keen to grow its non-microloan book and what better way to do than grow low-risk housing loans. The merged entity would have the twin coveted markets of microloans and affordable housing loans.
And Gruh Finance has been reporting a reasonably strong performance. In the September quarter, the lender reported a neat 20% increase in profits and 18% growth in disbursements. It has the lowest proportion of developer loans, currently the pain point for housing finance companies. The stock has steadily risen and even managed to largely escape the meltdown in financial stocks during September.
And if the move helps Bandhan Bank get some leeway from the regulator, it may get some freedom to open new branches.
That said, the Bandhan-Gruh Finance deal alone is not enough to meet norms. The fact that Bandhan Bank promoters need to lower their stake further, coupled with a possible stake sale by HDFC, may act as an overhang on the stock."

Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd on Monday evening announced the acquisition of HDFC Ltd-owned Gruh Finance Ltd through a share swap ratio, in a deal effective 1 January 2019. Earlier on Monday, Mint had reported that Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance were in advanced talks to merge the two firms, primarily with an objective to lower the bank’s promoter holding and expand its housing finance portfolio. 
Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd on Monday evening announced the acquisition of HDFC Ltd-owned Gruh Finance Ltd through a share swap ratio, in a deal effective 1 January 2019. Earlier on Monday, Mint had reported that Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance were in advanced talks to merge the two firms, primarily with an objective to lower the bank’s promoter holding and expand its housing finance portfolio.
Following board meetings of the two firms on Monday, Bandhan Bank in a stock exchange filing said the share swap ratio for the amalgamation will be 568 shares of Bandhan Bank for every 1,000 shares of Gruh Finance. This essentially means a share swap ratio of 0.6, or 3:5, between Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance.
The Mint report on Monday mentioned that the merger will be consummated through a share swap deal in the ratio of 3:5 between Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance, which means for every three shares of Bandhan Bank, shareholders of the bank will receive five shares of Gruh Finance.
Anup Kumar Sinha will be appointed as part-time chairman of Bandhan Bank post the merger with Gruh Finance, the company said.
The share swap ratio implies that the pricing for the Badhan-Gruh merger is in line with the six-month weighted average price of the two companies. HDFC and Bandhan Financial Holding Ltd’s (promoter of Bandhan Bank) stakes will come down after the merger.
On Monday, shares of Bandhan Bank tanked 5.21%, or  ₹ 27.55, to  ₹ 501.10 apiece on the BSE in a positive market. Gruh Finance shares lost 3.86% to close at  ₹ 306.20 apiece.
Bandhan Bank’s market cap stands at around  ₹ 60,000 crore while Gruh Finance has a market valuation of around  ₹ 22,436 crore. At these valuations, the combined entity will have a total market cap of around  ₹ 83,000 crore. The six-month weighted average prices of Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance are at  ₹ 552.64 and  ₹ 318.50 apiece, respectively, on the BSE.
HDFC holds 57.83%, or 423.8 million shares, in Gruh Finance as the promoter, while Bandhan Financial holds around 82.28%, or 981.4 million shares, in Bandhan Bank. 
Since the merger is being carried out on the basis of six-month weighted average price, the Bandhan-Gruh merger will result in HDFC’s holding falling to around 15.44% in the holding company and Bandhan Financial’s holding will come down to around 60.27%. This final shareholding structure was formally confirmed by the bank on Monday evening.
“The share swap ratio has been arrived at based on the joint valuation report…by SRB & Associates and Desai Haribhakti & Co…supported by fairness opinion submitted by Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Ltd,"" said the bank in the exchange filing. JM Financial Ltd gave the fairness opinion for Gruh Finance.
The loan book of the combined lending entity will have 58% micro loans, 28% retail home loans and 14% other loans, the company said in a release.
Sameer Kalra, equity research analyst and founder of Target Investing, feels that the merger with Bandhan Bank will negatively impact the business of Gruh Finance since synergies are low because of the firm’s average loan size of  ₹ 9.5 lakh and HDFC Ltd emerging as a strong competitor rather than support of the company, post the merger.
Since the proposed deal entails HDFC emerging as a co-promoter for Bandhan Bank, apart from being the promoter of India’s largest private lender HDFC Bank Ltd, HDFC will have to trim its stake further in the merged entity. RBI does not allow the promoter of one bank to hold more than 10% in another bank as a co-promoter.
To meet this requirement, HDFC is in talks with a clutch of institutional investors to offload at least 5.5% in the combined entity, according to the Mint report on Monday.
HDFC has a direct holding of 2.08% in RBL Bank Ltd, according to per BSE records, at the end of September quarter.
However, the Bandhan-Gruh merger won’t really solve the core problem for Bandhan Bank. To meet the bank ownership norms, Bandhan Financial will have lower its stake further from 60.27% to 40%.
In September, RBI restricted Bandhan Bank from opening new branches and ordered a freeze on the remuneration of its managing director and CEO Chandra Shekhar Ghosh for not meeting the bank promoter shareholding norms, which require Bandhan Financial to reduce its stake from 82.3% to 40%. The deadline to dilute the promoter holding was August-end.
Gruh Finance has total assets of  ₹ 15,970.97 crore, turnover of  ₹ 1,687.19 crore and a net worth of  ₹ 1,380.92 crore, as on 31 March, 2018. The home finance company, which is primarily focused on retail segment, recorded a net profit of  ₹ 220 crore in the first half of the ongoing fiscal.
Bandhan Bank has total assets of  ₹ 44,310.06 crore, turnover of  ₹ 5,508.48 crore and a net worth of  ₹ 9,382 crore as on 31 March 2018, the exchange filing mentioned.
The bank said the Bandhan-Gruh merger will result in enhancement of shareholders’ value, new product development, integration of technology platforms, enabling the two firms to further their socio-economic objectives.
The merger will also help the bank strengthen its housing loan portfolio and increase cash management efficiency, said the exchange filing."

Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd’s merger with Gruh Finance Ltd appears to be a deal that was born out of compulsion and is anything but sweet for minority shareholders of the bank and the mortgage lender, analysts said.
The crash in share prices of Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance following the merger announcement points to that effect. In the past two days, Bandhan Bank has dropped by around 10% to  ₹ 477.05 on BSE, while Gruh Finance, controlled by Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), has plunged by around 20% to  ₹ 256.
The deal favours HDFC more than the shareholders of Bandhan Bank and Gruh Finance, according to five people that Mint spoke to.
For the Gruh Finance management, the merger discussions came as a surprise, said two of the five people directly aware of the Bandhan-Gruh Finance deal.
“There was never a talk about monetizing Gruh Finance. The discussion with Gruh (management) happened just two weeks back. The firm would have preferred to continue as a stand-alone entity. There was no reason for merging with anyone,"" said the first person, who is close to HDFC Group. “HDFC was getting a good valuation for selling Gruh Finance stake and therefore wanted to monetize the business. They were also entering the same business portfolio and would have been finding it difficult to explain to their stakeholders.""
Yes Securities (India) Ltd called the merger “a complementary but expensive fit for Bandhan"", referring to the price paid by the bank to acquire Gruh Finance."

433,2019-01-21,HDFC,"The private sector lender reported a 20% year-on-year growth in net profit to  ₹5,585.85 crore for the quarter ended 31 December.Gross non-performing assets for the December quarter were 1.38% of its loan book, slightly higher than 1.29% a year earlier.

HDFC Bank Ltd has a reputation of being a consistent performer and its third quarter results were no different.
The private sector lender reported a 20% year-on-year growth in net profit to  ₹585.85 crore for the quarter ended 31 December, in line with analysts’ estimate of  ₹5,605.70 crore in a Bloomberg survey of 19 brokerage firms.
The fact that profits came on the back of a 22% core income growth and a 4.3% net interest margin should please investors. Non-interest income also grew at a fast clip of 28% from a year earlier, aided by higher fee income.
But strong growth and profitability have become a given in HDFC Bank’s performance. In that, these metrics are hardly surprising for investors. What analysts were looking for is whether the lender has continued to weather the bad loan crisis that hit its peers, and whether it has managed to escape the impact of the strain in small businesses.
It certainly dodged the crisis triggered by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, as it had negligible exposure to the beleaguered company. And the quality of its loans to non-banking financial companies remain pristine.
At the aggregate level, HDFC Bank continues to report enviable gross and net bad loan ratios. Gross non-performing assets for the December quarter were 1.38% of its loan book, slightly higher than 1.29% a year earlier. But ratios can reduce simply because of fast growth in total assets, which has been the case with the bank.
The lender’s loan book has been growing at a brisk pace of more than 20% and the third quarter was no different.
In the December quarter, the bank made 28% more provisions towards bad loans than it did a year earlier, which helped keep the net bad loan ratio at less than 1%.
That said, HDFC Bank has faced some heat on its agricultural lending and while loans to small businesses have also seen some strain, the management assured analysts in an earnings conference call that there is no material deterioration.
Either way, investors don’t seem to be too worried on asset quality as the HDFC Bank stock has gained more than 8% in the past one year and has outperformed the benchmark Nifty index, which has marginally declined. The stock trades at a multiple of a little over three times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2020, which doesn’t make it the most expensive among banks."

The boost during the third quarter drove up the APE growth for the nine months ended December to 13%.
What’s more comforting is that the growth is led by margin-friendly protection plans. The share of protection in new business more than doubled to 11% in the overall portfolio from 5% a year ago. Since protection plans are the most difficult to sell, the strong growth here indicates SBI Life has managed to crack the code.
The branches of its parent, State Bank of India (SBI), sold the maximum number of protection plans contributing to the growth. This shows SBI Life has managed to use its biggest strength in distribution to the best possible use.
Hence, the impressive 24% growth in value of new business and the improvement in value of new business margin to 17.5% should not come as a surprise.
The largest life insurer has not only managed to grow, but has increased its most profitable business.
SBI Life’s products are not just flying off the shelves, the insurer’s customers are sticking to it as well. Persistency ratios improved across tenures barring that of the 61st month with the 13th month increasing to 83.3% from 81.5% a year ago.
During the nine months ended December, the insurer also managed to improve its cost ratios as efficiencies increased. In short, it has finally used its parent optimally to grow its business.
“SBI Life’s retail business franchise is the geographically most well diversified among its private peers, adding greater immunity to capital market downturns. The contribution of the top three states in its total retail business stands at only 26%, versus 42% for ICICI Prudential Life and 54% for HDFC Life,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
That said, market-linked plans still form 53% of its total portfolio and unit-linked plans (Ulips) grew by 19% year-on-year. This means that despite the volatility in equity markets during the third quarter, customers have opted for Ulips.
The SBI Life stock has recovered most of the losses after the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd crisis, and the Q3 performance should come as an affirmation of investors’ faith. Even with the rise, analysts believe the stock is reasonably valued at the current levels. It trades at a multiple of twice the estimated embedded value for FY20."
430,2019-01-23,HDFC,"Protection plans reward insurer if its mortality assumptions are accurate and hence claims are lowerHDFC Life's early focus on protection business has reaped profits for the life insurer as its value for business continue to grow

HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s results checked all the right boxes that would underscore the rich premium the stock enjoys.
For the nine months ended December, the private sector insurer reported 41% growth in new business premium and a value of new business (VNB) margin of 24%. Its embedded value has grown 20% from a year ago.
What this means is that not only are the insurer’s policies being grabbed by customers, but it is also able to squeeze more profits out of them.
One of the reasons is the benefit from selling more term plans far ahead of the competition. Protection products form 7% of HDFC Life’s total portfolio, higher than that of rivals such as SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
Protection plans are margin-friendly, as the insurer need not pay regular bonuses. Such products also reward the insurer if its mortality assumptions are accurate and, hence, claims are lower.
The management has indicated that its focus on protection plans continues and that the share will rise, although slowly, as the ticket size is lower than other plans.
Is the insurer spending more to gain market share and profits?
Its expense ratios don’t send up any red flags. In fact, the expense of management ratio has dropped from 19% a year ago to 17%. Given that its tie-ups with banks and the network of HDFC Bank Ltd as well as parent HDFC (Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd) provide enough bandwidth to push products, the life insurer doesn’t need to put in too much money.
However, the commissions for renewal premiums have gone up sharply, the management said, indicating that agents are being compensated for making sure persistency ratios are high. HDFC Life may have an enviable product mix, but nearly 60% of its portfolio is still made up of market-linked products. This has ramifications as the insurer’s investment income was hit because of market risks. Also, persistency ratios drop in such products and the 61st month ratio was 44%.
Analysts had noted that given near-month persistency ratios seem to have peaked and the protection business share has steadied, HDFC Life has limited scope to improve VNB margins.
Indeed, the VNB margin for the quarter ended December was 23.5%, lower than 24.5% in the previous quarter.
So far, HDFC Life’s performance has justified the stock’s rich valuation. The scrip has gained 33% from its issue price in the initial public offering in November 2017. But the fact that peer stocks are more modestly valued explains why four brokerage firms already have a sell rating on the stock."
429,2019-01-24,HDFC,"Value of new business margin has moderated 50 basis points in Q3, despite a rise in protection policiesThe private sector insurer reported disappointing numbers for the December quarter

The worst fears of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s investors are coming true, with the company’s stock dropping over 11% on Wednesday.
The private sector insurer reported disappointing numbers for the December quarter. It was the only listed insurer to report a contraction in annualized premium equivalent (APE). Its APE declined 2.1% for the third quarter, while it showed a drop of 4.2% for the nine-month period ended 31 December.
“The 10% increase in the stock price in the past one month was not supported by fundamentals and, in that context, 3QFY19 performance could temper any build up in market expectations,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
However, the silver lining is that the company’s valuations are modest versus peers such as HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd. While this may limit downside, much depends on how ICICI PruLife performs in the coming quarters.

However, the silver lining is that the company’s valuations are modest versus peers such as HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd. While this may limit downside, much depends on how ICICI PruLife performs in the coming quarters.
The signs are not encouraging though. As analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd noted, the life insurer’s value of new business margin has moderated 50 basis points in the third quarter, despite an increase in protection policies. Protection policies are margin-friendly and, hence, every insurer is trying to sell these products more.
Indeed, ICICI PruLife’s protection APE doubled, which is the silver lining in its earnings. But Jefferies India warns here that the growth comes through group policies, which are relatively lower margin, rather than individual. This doesn’t bode well for future persistency as growth from group insurance tends to be one-time jumps. The insurer didn’t have much luck on persistency either as its 13th-month ratio dropped. The ratio shows whether customers continue to pay premiums after the first year. To be fair, all other durations have gained and analysts are not worried just yet.
In 2017, insurance firms had wooed investors for their initial public offerings (IPOs) on the promise of being a sunrise industry. Prospectuses of firms including ICICI PruLife elaborated on the immense opportunity of growth given the low penetration of insurance products in India.
That growth story seems to have derailed, at least for ICICI PruLife. As this column had noted earlier this month, the insurer’s focus on breaking down premiums into systematic investment plans seems to have backfired.
But an insurance company is not a mutual fund and volume doesn’t come easy as insurance is a push product.
Hence, ICICI PruLife’s growth numbers are not going down well with investors and even analysts. The company’s shares are now 8% lower to its IPO issue price of  ₹334."
428,2019-01-25,HDFC,"It is prudent to keep your investments and insurance plans separate If the SIP is discontinued before three years, the insurance cover stops immediately

Did you know that your systematic investment plan (SIP) could also provide you with an insurance cover? Currently provided by three companies in the market, it is a product that gives you the flavour of equity fund investment along with a free life cover.
“The idea of a SIP Insure insurance cover is that it acts as a bundled product allowing you to systematically save for your long-term financial goal and in the event of an unforeseen circumstance, where the nominee becomes the recipient of a free life insurance cover,"" says Sundeep Sikka, executive director and chief executive officer, Reliance Mutual Fund. “It is free for the investor and the asset management company bears the cost."" says Sikka. “The target consumer for such products is generally any retail investor who is looking to invest in SIPS for their long term goals,"" said Sikka. Reliance Mutual Fund and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd launched it in 2008 whereas ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund launched it in May 2012.
But are these products worth your money?
Here the AMCS bear the cost by taking a group cover which is cheaper and hence you get the insurance cover for free. “The mutual fund companies buy group insurance policies in wholesale for these bundled products. No health check-ups are required in such plans,"" said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive officer of Valueresearchonline.com, an online investment advisory platform. In a SIP plus insurance product, an SIP subscriber can begin at the age of 18 and pick select schemes of the chosen AMC to convert it into an SIP combined with an insurance cover. The validity of the bundled insurance cover depends on the age brackets and differs with the companies. The entry age limit is 51 years for all the three companies. The insurance part covers you till you turn 55 in case of ICICI Prudential and 60, in case of Aditya Birla MF. The insurance cover although is only applicable if you do SIP for a minimum of three years. However, in case of Reliance MF, SIP Insure benefit will be applicable from 45 days, that is if the demise of investor happens after 45 days of applying, sum assured will be provided to the registered nominee. There are a few situations where the insurance cover may be denied to you. Partial or full redemption of units before the tenure or till you turn 55 (in case of ICICI Prudential MF and Reliance MF) or 60 (in case of Aditya Birla MF) will lead to cessation of the insurance cover. In cases of a default in three consecutive instalments or five separate occasions, the insurance cover will cease although for Aditya Birla MF the insurance cover ceases if the subscriber has defaulted for two consecutive payments or four separate ones.
“It may seem like there are too many conditions binding the product but considering the life cover is coming for free, such conditions are required to safeguard the product as well otherwise it will bleed, However, the fact that there are too many conditions complicate the product for the investor and makes it less popular,"" said Deepali Sen, founder of Mumbai-based Srujan Financial Advisers LLP.
In Reliance MF and ICICI Prudential, the minimum instalment is  ₹500 and for Aditya Birla MF the minimum instalment varies from scheme to scheme beginning from  ₹500.
“For the AMCS it is a case of sticky SIPS because it is unlikely for the SIPS to be discontinued mid-way if it has a life cover attached to it. However, I would advise investors to go for a term plan and not depend just on this one,"" said Sen.
If the SIP is discontinued before three years, the insurance cover stops immediately. If the SIP is discontinued after three years, you will receive a cover equivalent to the fund value of the units as on the start of the renewal year. This amount is subject to a maximum of 100 times the monthly instalment in case of ICICI Prudential
AMC and Aditya Birla and 120 times in case of Reliance Nippon, capped at  ₹50 lakh. All three companies provide a sum insured of 10 times the monthly SIP instalment in the first year, 50 times the monthly SIP instalment and from the third year onwards. While Reliance Nippon offers a cover equivalent to 120 times the monthly SIP instalment, the other two provide it at 100 times the monthly SIP instalment, capped at a maximum of  ₹25 lakh for Aditya Birla MF and  ₹50 lakh for ICICI Prudential MF.
Should you depend on the life cover?
Taking the example of a 30 year old, living in Mumbai who has started an SIP of  ₹10,000 a month. According to the AMC rules, her insurance cover after the third year will become  ₹10 lakh. For a separate term cover of  ₹10 lakh, premiums can be as low as  ₹2,620 annually and range higher up, according to Policybazaar.com.
“Even though you are getting the life cover at such low prices, there may not be any harm in going for such products but you cannot depend just on the life cover provided by the SIP plan,"" said Kapil Mehta, co-founder of Securenow.in, an insurance web aggregator.
“Since your life cover is dependent on your SIP contributions, the term life cover may not be appropriate according to what you might need"", added Mehta."

431,2019-01-28,HDFC,"Debt repayments are becoming increasingly uncertain for the IL&FS GroupThe six funds include HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund and UTI Bond Fund among others

New Delhi: Credit rating agency ICRA has placed the ratings of six mutual fund schemes under watch with negative implications because of their exposure to special purpose vehicles of the IL&FS group where debt repayments are becoming increasingly uncertain, the agency said in a press release.
The funds are HDFC Short Term Debt Fund, HDFC Banking and PSU Debt Fund, UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund, UTI Bond Fund, UTI Dynamic Bond Fund, and Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Term Opportunities Fund.
""The rating action takes into account the deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying investments of these schemes driven by their exposure to special purpose vehicles (SPVs) of IL&FS Limited. ICRA notes that the above schemes have exposures to IL&FS SPV, namely, Hazaribagh Ranchi Expressway Limited (HREL) or Jharkhand Road Projects Implementation Company Limited (JRPICL) or Jorabat Shillong Expressway Limited (JSEL),"" the note said. ""The default risks by various SPVs of IL&FS have increased given the recent communication by their management to trustees expressing to stop future repayments citing their interpretation of an order given by National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on October 15, 2018. Further, in January 2019, two SPVs of IL&FS demanded a refund of the debt payment executed by them post October 15, 2018, from their trustees. Despite a ring-fenced structure and adequate cash flows to service the debt obligations, the SPVs have asked the trustees to stop debiting the SPVs’ escrow account towards future obligations.""
Mint reported last week on IL&FS informing certain creditors that it does not intend to continue debt repayment, armed with an interim order from the NCLT.
As on December 31, 2018, the exposure of HDFC-STDF and HDFC-BPSU to HREL stood at 0.55% and 0.29% of assets under management of the schemes (AUMs), respectively. The exposure of UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund, UTI BF and UTI DBF to JSEL stood at 6.87%, 5.98% and 6.25% of AUMs of the schemes, respectively.
The exposure of Aditya Birla Sun Life Short Term Opportunities Fund to JRPICL stood at 1.15% of AUM."
425,2019-01-28,HDFC,"The return from the affected funds may be hit for now, but the overall rating of these funds indicate high level of confidence in the quality of portfoliosNew investors should wait and watch how the situation plays out before considering fresh investments into the schemes

In a fresh round of bad news for debt fund investors, ICRA has put six debt funds under rating watch. What should you, the investor, make of this rating action and what should be your next course of action? Read on to know what the developments mean for you.
The story so far
ICRA put six debt fund schemes—two from HDFC Mutual Fund, one from Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund and three from UTI Mutual Fund—on a rating watch with negative implications.
These funds held bonds of certain special purpose vehicles (SPVs)—Hazaribagh Ranchi Expressway Ltd (HREL), Jorabat Shillong Expressway Ltd (JSEL) and Jharkhand Road Projects Implementation Co. (JRPICL) that have links with IL&FS Group. What triggered the rating action was a communication from the SPVs seeking to stop any future repayments to their bond holders, which included these mutual fund schemes, not because the projects were not able to generate the funds, but on a legal technicality relating to settling the obligations of insolvent IL&FS Group companies.
Subsequently, Crisil downgraded the bonds of JRPICL to BB(SO), indicating moderate risk of default, and India Ratings put the bonds of HREL and JSEL on a rating watch with negative implications, indicating a possibility of further deterioration in the credit quality.
The schemes that have been affected are HDFC Banking and PSU Debt Fund and HDFC Short-term Debt Fund with exposure of 0.29% and 0.55% of their assets under management (AUM), respectively, to HREL; UTI Bond Fund, UTI Dynamic Bond Fund and UTI Banking and PSU Debt Fund with exposure of 5.98%, 6.25% and 6.87% of AUM, respectively, to JSEL; and Aditya Birla Sun Life Short term Opportunities fund with exposure of 1.15% of AUM to JRPICL.
What mutual funds did
For mutual funds with exposure to these bonds, this meant that the obligations, when they arise, are unlikely to be met and they have to address the default. In such situations, mutual funds write down the value of the bonds to reflect the downgrade. Accordingly, all the affected mutual funds valued these bonds at a discount of 20-25% to daily prices taking a hit on their net asset value. For example, a bond that was valued at  ₹100 earlier will now be valued at  ₹70 because this is what the bonds are likely to realise in the current situation. To this devalued value of  ₹70, the mutual fund company may choose to give an additional discount, in this case in the range of 20-25%, to be conservative. So, in effect, the value of the bond drops from  ₹100 to  ₹52.5.
They do this so that the portfolio reflects the risks and is realistic about what the bonds can realise. The extent of impact on the NAV (net asset value) will depend upon how much of the fund’s assets were held in these bonds. The impact on UTI schemes, having greater exposure to downgraded assets, will be more significant compared to funds with a lower holding of these assets.
The option to segregate or side-pocket these assets so that the impact of the downgrade does not lead to panic redemptions is not yet available since the regulations require that the scheme information document be updated to allow such segregation, and there has been no move on this front by fund houses.
Should fund houses have seen the writings on the wall in September when the IL&FS issue broke and exited from all instruments of the parent company and its subsidiaries at that stage? No, say industry experts and point to the cast iron protection that the SPV structure provides to lenders where their claims to cash flows into the escrow account gets precedence over all other claims. According to Lakshmi Iyer, head-fixed income, Kotak Asset Management Co. Ltd, “At the moment, mutual funds are anyway wary of lending to the NBFC segment. However, in this case, the nature of default is very different, and everyone is aware that it is not an interpretation issue. Markets could be more tolerant as compared to what we saw in September last year. If it were a wilful default, the escrow account would not have the money, which it does.""
The SPVs have been servicing their debt obligations on time so far and the escrow accounts, into which the cash flows from the projects accumulates and is then paid out to the bond holders, continue to hold adequate funds to service the debt. “If a resolution does not happen, it may put into question other similar structures and have a negative impact on investor confidence in debt funds,"" said Arvind Chari, head-fixed income and alternatives, Quantum Advisors Pvt. Ltd.
What it means for you
“I don’t see this situation having a contagion impact leading to outflows in the asset management industry as a whole. Affected schemes have already marked down the exposure and that reflects in the NAVs,"" said Iyer.
To put it in perspective, the HDFC Short Term Debt fund has an AUM of around  ₹8,985 crore (as on 31 December 2018) of which the exposure to HREL was 0.55% or  ₹49 crore. Similarly, the exposure of Aditya Birla Short Term Opportunities Fund to JRPICL stood at 1.15% of the AUM of  ₹3,925 crore (as of 31 December 2018) or  ₹45 crore and that of UTI Bond fund to JSEL stood at 5.98% on an AUM of  ₹802 crore or  ₹47 crore. But however small the impact, the return from the funds will be lower to the extent of the hit the NAV takes due to the event, unless there is a ruling in favour of the lenders going forward and recoveries happen. All the funds have high ratings from agencies tracking and ranking MF schemes, indicating high level of confidence in the quality of the schemes’ portfolios.
The HDFC Short-Term Bond fund is part of the Mint 30 basket and we see no reason to question its eligibility as of now. Investors who are holding the schemes need not consider exiting for now. “Wherever there is an exposure to the IL&FS SPVs, mark down has happened. We are telling clients not to exit in panic. We continue to watch the developments closely. The question is whether the resolution will happen quickly or not,"" said Roopali Prabhu, director and head investment products, Sanctum Wealth Management.
New investors should wait and watch how the situation plays out before considering fresh investments into the schemes."
424,2019-01-29,HDFC,"Your credit card is your boarding pass to first classYour bank may perhaps not have the best fit for you to maximize your spending

I have been using credit cards since 2001. My first credit card, from Citibank, landed in my snail mail. Many years later, that credit card was converted to a Jet Airways Citibank co-branded credit card (now discontinued), and this was where my journey of using miles for (almost) free air travel began.
A business-class ticket between Mumbai and New York’s JFK airport on Jet Airways, roughly about 16,000 miles flown, cost all of  ₹23,000 and 188,000 JPMiles back in 2011 instead of  ₹3 lakh when paid in cash. The best part is, most of those JPMiles for my ticket came from my credit card, and not from actual flying.
Credit cards today make it very easy for everyone to collect frequent-flyer miles. And yet, a lot of people I know are usually looking out for the cheapest credit cards, rather than ones that will get them the most miles and benefits they or their families can use.
When looking for options, look at the offerings across the market rather than just looking at the bank you have an existing relationship with—your bank may perhaps not have the best fit for you to maximize your spending. Moreover, private and foreign banks are going to have much better options than the PSU banks.
Another decision would be about what kind of rewards you want to collect. For instance, you could collect credit card points which can be transferred to different airlines or hotels, or you could go with credit cards known as co-brand cards, which transfer to one airline only.
JetPrivilege, India’s largest frequent-flyer programme, has a co-brand tie-up with four banks to help you earn JPMiles. Between HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and American Express, they have 15 credit cards with fees to suit all budgets. ICICI Bank and American Express even have corporate credit cards for earning JPMiles. If you are a JetPrivilege Platinum tier, fees are waived on most JetPrivilege co-brand cards. JPMiles earned can then be used for redemption tickets on Jet Airways (even upgrades), Etihad, KLM, Air France and at least 20 other airlines that Jet Airways partners with.
At the top end, you can have the Jet Airways HDFC Bank Diners Club Black credit card, which would give you 24 JPMiles/ ₹150 spent booking Jet Airways tickets directly with the airline. HDFC Bank’s tie-up with JetPrivilege means you also get tier points in the JetPrivilege programme as you spend on their co-brand cards, making it easier to upgrade or retain your JetPrivilege status.
Vistara, on the other hand, has a co-brand tie-up with Axis Bank to issue credit cards. Each card comes with free tickets on payment of annual fees, and, if you opt for the highest variant, the Axis Bank Vistara Infinite Credit Card, you get Vistara Gold status and up to four free business-class tickets, one on payment of annual fees and one every time you cumulatively spend  ₹2.5 lakh on the card (up to  ₹7.5 lakh). On everyday spending, you earn Vistara points, which can then be redeemed for tickets on Vistara or Singapore Airlines.
In the case of Air India, SBI Card offers you a couple of options too. You can earn up to 100,000 bonus Flying Returns miles every year on spending on their co-brand card, which can then be used for redemptions or upgrades on Air India and Star Alliance member airlines.
However, if you are looking for an all-round product which helps you meet your travel and lifestyle needs and does not tie you down to one airline, there are some great options out there. Citibank issues the PremierMiles (entry level) and Prestige credit cards, both of which allow you to earn points which can be transferred to 14 airline partners and two hotel programmes. If you are a CitiGold member, you could get a 30% bonus on rewards earned through the year on your CitiPrestige Card.
American Express Platinum Charge Cards allow you to move Membership Rewards points to 10 airlines and a couple of marquee hotel chains such as Marriott and Hilton. HDFC Bank issues Diners Club cards in India, and it has been offering a lucrative promotion for many years now: You get up to 33% of your money spent as points at specific merchants, which can then be used to buy travel or transfer to partners such as British Airways, Jet Airways, Singapore Airlines, Trident Hotels and others.
To sum up, even if you don’t care about them, those reward points are piling up on your credit card. And you would perhaps be better off using them for a life experience (think flying your better half to Australia in first class!) rather than buying a toaster.

422,2019-01-30,HDFC,"Non-individual category largely responsible for the marginal rise in gross NPAs to 1.22%, from 1.13% in earlier quarterThe mortgage lender’s cautious approach comes in the backdrop of the ongoing liquidity-related concerns in the industry

Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd’s (HDFC’s) total loan book grew 15% to  ₹3.85 trillion in the December quarter (Q3), with the individual loan book growing at a steady 17%. While the overall loan book growth was largely in line with analysts’ expectations, growth in non-individual or corporate loans slipped to single digits.
Even though the individual loans segment is a key contributor to the company’s total loan book, slowing growth of its non-individual loans segment is a negative surprise and will dampen investor sentiment, said analysts.
Non-individual loans comprised about one-fourth of HDFC’s assets under management.
As the alongside chart shows, growth in the non-individual segment has fallen to a multi-quarter low of 9%, and is down from 21% in the year-ago period.
“Within the non-individual loan book, while construction finance and lease rental discounting have increased 9% and 11% respectively, corporate loans declined by 4% and the company has been lending cautiously here. Corporate lending really happens when a number of companies start taking up new projects and need housing for their employees,"" said HDFC chairman and chief executive officer Keki Mistry.
He added that the non-individual category was largely responsible for the marginal increase in gross non-performing assets to 1.22% from 1.13% in the September quarter.
The mortgage lender’s cautious approach comes in the backdrop of the ongoing liquidity-related concerns in the industry and the slowdown in the real estate sector.
Shares of HDFC fell more than 2% intraday on the National Stock Exchange, but later recouped about half the losses. They are now only about 6% lower than the highs before the liquidity crisis in September 2018, implying that investors have ruled out a major impact on the company. In that backdrop, the slowing of the non-individual segment is a worry.
While there were no major negative surprises in HDFC’s earnings, the stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-book of 4.29 times and looks priced to perfection."
421,2019-01-30,HDFC,"The project will have around 700 units of three to five bedroom luxury flats and is estimated to fetch  ₹5,800 crThe apartments ranging between 1,330-2,528 sq.ft will be sold at  ₹8-18 crore

Property developer Rustomjee group of Mumbai will borrow up to  ₹1,100 crore from HDFC Ltd in construction finance to complete a luxury housing project that it took over from DB Realty last year.
Rustomjee has entered into an agreement with HDFC Ltd as strategic financial partner to finance a five-year-old project in Prabhadevi, which DB Realty had exited early last year due to funding issues. 
“Our arrangement with HDFC is for about  ₹1,100 crore. HDFC will be providing all the capital required for this development. Of course, sales will continue to support as well,"" Boman R. Irani, chairman and managing director, Rustomjee group said in an interview, adding the funds will be disbursed “as and when it is required"". 
The project, now called Rustomjee Crown, will have around 700 units of three to five bedroom luxury flats and is estimated to fetch  ₹5,800 crore. 
The apartments ranging between 1,330-2,528 sq.ft will be sold at  ₹8-18 crore. 
In 2009, DB entered into a joint development agreement with Bhishma Realty, a unit of the Thackersey family which owns the 5.75 acre mill land where the project is coming up. 
“Going forward, we will be responsible for everything. All decisions will be made by us. We will take control over the project right from funding to execution of the project,"" Irani said. 
Rustomjee on Tuesday relaunched the project that had stalled over the last one year.
As part of its marketing efforts, DB Realty had offered helicopter rides to its clients over the project site in 2016. The project later stalled due to various reasons, mainly lack of funding. 
DB Realty had invested  ₹1,200-1,500 crore through debt into the project, said a person, who did not want to be identified. 
The project has been conceptualized by leading architect Hafeez Contractor. Rustomjee has hired Bangkok-based interior design firm PIA as well.
“It gives me immense pleasure to be part of the launch of South Mumbai’s gated estate. HDFC Ltd is the strategic finance partner for Ruistomjee Crown and we are confident this project will refine the way homes and living spaces are imagined in this part of the city,"" HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said in the statement. 
Of the total 700 flats, around 250 have been sold. Rustomjee expects to complete the whole project by December 2022. 
Mint reported in November that more than half of upcoming luxury skyscrapers in Mumbai’s Worli and Prabhadevi are struggling to find buyers. 
Lower Parel, also in the vicinity, is facing similar problems as several residential high-rises have mushroomed in the midst of office towers in the last few years."

418,2019-02-01,HDFC,"The proposal is part of the Finance Bill 2019-20 introduced by Piyush Goyal after presentation of the Interim BudgetAmendments have been proposed to the Indian Stamp Act

NEW DELHI :
The government Friday proposed to bring in a single stamp duty rate for all financial securities transactions, a move that would help in reducing procedural requirements for brokers.
The proposal is part of the Finance Bill 2019-20 introduced by Finance Minister Piyush Goyal after presentation of the Interim Budget.
In his speech, he said, the government last year promised that it would carry out reforms in stamp duty levied and collected on financial securities transactions.
Amendments have been proposed to the Indian Stamp Act.
""The amendments proposed would usher in a very streamlined system. Stamp duties would be levied on one instrument relating to one transaction and get collected at one place through the stock exchanges,"" Goyal said.
He also said the duty collected would be shared with the state governments seamlessly on the basis of domicile of buying client.
HDFC Securities MD and CEO Dhiraj Relli said the government has proposed to have a single stamp duty rate on securities transactions across the country and that it would help in avoiding litigations and procedural hassles.
The brokering industry has been demanding for a single rate for many years, he added.
The move to have a single stamp duty rate would not have an impact on Securities Transaction Tax (STT) since the latter is levied on transaction value, excluding stamp duty, according to experts.

416,2019-02-06,HDFC,"While putting together a portfolio, it is not enough to picks funds from different categoriesOne must ensure diversity of investment styles among the funds chosen

I am 40 years old and want to build a retirement corpus. I invest  ₹6,000 each in Franklin India Focused Equity Fund, ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund, ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund and Quantum Long Term Equity Value Fund. I intended to invest equally in large-cap, multi-cap, mid-cap and small-cap categories. However, over a period of time, the nature of these funds has changed. Please suggest one fund in each category (or new suggested categories) for 15-20 years, assuming a high risk-taking capacity. Also, I would be redeeming my 15-year PPF corpus next year. Please suggest ways to add the proceeds to funds.
—S.K. Abraham
While putting together a portfolio, it is not enough to picks funds from different categories—one must ensure diversity of investment styles among the funds chosen. In your current portfolio, three of funds follow a value investing strategy (of picking good companies at a fair or lower price). It would be better if you have one or maximum two out of the four funds following such a strategy, while the others can look for growth in the market. I would recommend you keep the ICICI Prudential Bluechip fund, and choose between Quantum Long Term Equity fund and Franklin India Focused Equity fund (both in the diversified category). For a mid-cap fund, you can go with L&T Mid-cap fund, and for a small-cap fund, you can choose Franklin India Smaller Companies fund.
Regarding deployment of PPF corpus that you will redeem next year, it would be easy to invest the proceeds in your four funds using systematic transfer plan (STP). Please divide the corpus into four parts and invest them in liquid funds in ICICI Prudential, Franklin Templeton (or Quantum), L&T, and (again) Franklin Templeton AMC. From there, you can set up STPs to your equity funds on a monthly basis. Please ensure that the quantum of money you transfer every month is such that the entire STP schedule gets completed in 12 months from the date of start.
I invest around  ₹33,000 in about nine funds, with 80% in equity and 20% in debt. During review, I noticed that a HDFC Midcap fund went down by 10% overall. Now that the markets are flat, should I remain invested in it or should I exit and book a loss because of poor performance?
—Abhishek Gupta
I assume you are referring to the HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities fund. This is a stellar fund in this category and you should continue investing in it. Although this fund has gone down in the past year, that negative performance happened during a very bad time in the markets for mid-cap stocks. To compare, the benchmark Nifty Midcap 100 TRI went down by close to 15% in the same period. Even the peer funds in this category went down by close to 13%. Such is the nature of the mid-cap segment. If such volatility makes you contemplate selling, then you should consider lowering the overall risk profile of your portfolio.
Also, I note that you have nine funds for a  ₹33,000 portfolio—that is a lot of funds and you will do well to consolidate your holdings to 5-6 funds. You can use this consolidation exercise to wean yourself off high-risk funds such as mid- or small-cap funds.

414,2019-02-07,HDFC,"Central bank to ease risk weight norms to aid credit flow to NBFC sector, NBFC regulationsAlthough bank lending to NBFCs during the first half of 2018 remained robust, the IL&FS crisis in September dried up bank lending

In a move to improve liquidity flow to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in the country, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday announced that banks assign differential risk-weights to their exposures to NBFCs, based on ratings assigned by credit rating agencies, as against the existing practice of a uniform risk weight of 100%.
Prevailing regulations require uniform 100% risk weights on bank exposure to rated, as well as unrated, systemically important NBFCs that don’t take deposits. The move will not only free up capital for banks for further lending—both directly and indirectly—but will also help reduce borrowing costs for well-rated NBFCs, which have been grappling with a systemic liquidity crisis triggered by a series of defaults by Infrastructure Lease and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), and its subsidiaries.
The alignment of risk weights with credit ratings will “facilitate credit flow to better-rated NBFCs, lower the cost of bank borrowings for NBFCs and for the end users, particularly the borrowers of micro finance institutions,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said, while addressing the press.
“PSU banks have been keen to lend to highly rated housing finance companies and asset finance companies due to the benefit of lower risk weights, but were not too keen to lend to even highly-rated loan companies due to 100% risk weight,"" said Renu Sud Karnad, managing director, HDFC Ltd. The relaxation will also make banks more amenable to lend to NBFCs.
While it is not clear yet if the new guidelines will be applicable retrospectively as well, or fresh loans alone, the move is likely to free up around  ₹15,000 crore worth of capital for banks, said Karthik Srinivasan, group head, financial sector ratings, ICRA Ltd. “In a way this (alignment of risk weights with credit ratings for NBFCs) is indirect capitalization of banks.""
Guidelines pertaining to risk weights for bank exposures to NBFCs will be released by the end of February. The regulator also clarified that the risk weight for core investment companies will continue to remain 100%.
“So far, banks were given flexibility to assign risk weights for only a few categories of NBFCs, such as asset finance companies and housing finance companies. In my view, this needed correction. A firm financing SMEs is as important as a firm financing cars, as both are critical to growth. The move to bring all NBFCs and corporates at par, in terms of how risk weights are assigned, is a huge positive,"" said Sumit Bali, chief executive, IIFL Finance.
Bali added that the flexibility provided will also allow banks to improve their return on capital and pass on the benefits to borrowers as lesser capital will have to be set aside against the loans to NBFCs.
Although bank lending to NBFCs during the first half of 2018 remained robust, the IL&FS crisis in September dried up bank lending, forcing NBFCs to scout for alternate sources of funding, like non-convertible debentures.
The central bank also said that it will be merging three categories of NBFCs—asset finance companies, loan companies and investment companies—into a single category, namely NBFC investment and credit company, in line with its efforts to harmonize various classes of NBFCs, and the regulations for the sector on the whole.
“There are too many categories of NBFCs currently and every time the regulator comes out with some policy changes, they get applied only to some categories of NBFCs and others are left out. So harmonization will help in getting the policies applied uniformly across various categories,"" said Karnad of HDFC.
The three categories cover nearly 99% of the NBFCs by number. “The Reserve Bank is committed to such harmonization and to move towards activity-based regulation replacing the current entity-based regulation for the NBFC sector…The proposed merger of existing categories would reduce to a large extent the complexities arising from multiple categories and also provide the NBFCs greater flexibility in their operations,"" the regulator stated in the press release."

Mumbai: Inflows into Indian equity mutual funds in January were the smallest in two years as heightened market volatility and political uncertainty cooled demand for riskier assets.
Stock funds took in a net 61.6 billion rupees ($866 million), the least since January 2017, and a seven percent decline over the previous month, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India show.
Here’s what the top three asset managers bought and sold last month:
HDFC Mutual Fund
India’s largest money manager held 1.2 trillion rupees in equities, with financials accounting for about 32 percent of stock assets followed by industrial companies at 14 percent.
ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund
The money manager held equity assets of 1.2 trillion rupees, with financials making up 26 percent of assets followed by technology at 10 percent.

412,2019-02-12,HDFC,"City Union Bank Ltd., a small lender based in Kumbakonam, has risen more than 27% over the last twelve monthsCity Union had gross bad loans of 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December

Mumbai: A policy of cautious lending to the silk weavers and shopkeepers of Tamil Nadu has allowed a small local bank to outpace the largest Indian banks in terms of share price performance.
City Union Bank Ltd., a small lender based in Kumbakonam, has risen more than 27 percent over the last twelve months, the best performance of any Indian lender in the Bankex index after Axis Bank Ltd. It has beaten out larger rivals such as HDFC Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India thanks to its successful record in lending to small and medium sized enterprises, or SME sector, while keeping a lid on bad loans.
“They are the gold standard in SME lending,"" said Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Anand Rathi Financial Services. “They have very good insight into how small industries work in their region.""
SME lending in India tends to be a higher margin business, because banks can charge hefty interest rates, but many avoid the segment because of the difficulty in assessing risks and the danger of piling on bad loans. Many of the country’s banks are struggling under the weight of a mountain of problem assets, denting their share prices and posing a threat to the wider Indian economy.
In addition, SMEs have been especially vulnerable to recent economic upheavals such as the temporary ban on high-valued currency notes in 2016, and the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax the following year.
City Union had gross bad loans of 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December, below its regional peers and its larger Mumbai-based rivals. Meanwhile, its net interest margin of 4.4 percent puts it in the top quartile of India’s banking system.
Many of City Union’s customers are small businesses in Tamil Nadu’s textile industry, working on different parts of the supply chain from spinning and weaving to garment manufacture. The bank also lends to the retail and wholesale dealers selling anything from toothpaste to spare parts for trucks, whose shops line the streets of towns across the state.
“Unlike larger lenders, City Union does more relationship-based lending, catering to the needs of the SME borrower, which can be quite volatile,"" said Pankaj Agarwal, an analyst at Ambit Capital. “That’s why they can charge a premium in this relatively untapped segment.""
Another positive is City Union’s relatively stable history at a time when faster growing lenders with similar profit numbers have sprung unpleasant surprises. Yes Bank Ltd., whose shares have dropped 47 percent over the past 12 months, has only recently resolved a leadership crisis. IndusInd Bank Ltd., down nearly 9 percent, last year disclosed significant exposure to the troubled infrastructure lender IL&FS.
Still, a smaller ratio of low-cost deposits in City Union’s liabilities compared with its peers could weigh on profits at a time when money market rates are tightening. The bank’s cost of funds rose by eight basis points in the last quarter.
But the bank has never reported a loss and has always announced a dividend in each of the previous 115 years, according to Chief Executive Officer N Kamakodi. He said the bank insists on collateral in the form of land or buildings when it lends to Tamil Nadu’s SMEs, ensuring it nearly always gets its money back.
“By nature we are a conservative bank,"" Kamakodi said in an interview. “We run marathons and not 100 meter sprints.""

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to Rs. 1 crore over various tenures."

407,2019-02-22,HDFC,"IDBI Bank sees wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,600 to  ₹7,381 crore—between Decembers of 2017 and 2018Govt has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect potential wilful defaults at an early stage

Mumbai: Despite lenders using the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and other means to recover loans and check defaults, most of them have seen a substantial jump in wilful defaults in 2018, shows data from Cibil.
Lenders were told by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2017 to refer more than three dozen defaulting companies to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). According to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), 1,484 cases have been admitted to the bankruptcy court between January 2017 and December 2018. These include referrals by financial creditors and operational creditors, besides the defaulting companies themselves.
The sharpest increase in wilful defaults among public sector banks was at loss-making IDBI Bank, which saw wilful defaults more than double—from  ₹3,660 crore to  ₹7,381 crore—between December 2017 and December 2018. This is more than 13% of the bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs).
Other public sector banks, such as Bank of India (BOI) and Bank of Maharashtra (BOM), are not too far behind. While BOI has seen 60% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in wilful defaults to  ₹9,785 crore, BOM witnessed a 41% increase to  ₹1,385 crore. While data for State Bank of India (SBI) and its associates was not available as on 31 December 2018, they had the largest chunk of wilful defaults till September at  ₹37,250 crore.
A senior banker at one of India’s largest public sector banks, requesting anonymity, said lenders have been recognizing several large defaults over the last year and the process could have led to figuring out which ones have wilfully defaulted. “Moreover, after the finance ministry asked us to probe all bad loans above  ₹50 crore for fraud, we did forensic audits for all. The ones showing traces of fraudulent activity have been classified as wilful defaulters.""
Among private sector banks whose December 2018 data is available, Kotak Mahindra Bank stands out with wilful defaults of  ₹8,757 crore, 22% higher on a y-o-y basis. HDFC Bank has seen little change in the past one year with wilful defaults at  ₹465 crore in December 2018.
Another banker who did not want to be named said the government has asked all banks to set up a separate fraud prevention wing to detect these cases at an early stage. “We are in discussions with the Indian Banks’ Association to form common guidelines with regard to fraud and wilful defaults so that banks do not follow different procedures.""
A borrower is tagged a wilful defaulter if he/she fails to meet repayment obligations despite having the capacity to repay. Other instances include not utilizing the loan for the specific purpose for which it was taken, and instead, diverting it for other purposes.
The RBI has also mandated banks to submit a list of suit-filed accounts and non-suit filed accounts of wilful defaulters of  ₹25 lakh or more at least every month to credit information firms like Cibil.
The evidence of wilful default is examined by a committee of high ranking bank executives. If the committee concludes that wilful default has happened, it issues a show cause notice to the borrower, and after considering their submissions, issues an order, which is reviewed by another committee comprising the managing director or the chief executive officer, and two independent directors. The order becomes final only after it is confirmed by this review committee."

405,2019-02-25,HDFC,"If the deal gets dashed or delayed, investors may well be exposed to the wrong side of volatilityInvestors seem to be sure that a change in management could spark an improvement in the asset manager’s operating parameters

Mutual fund investments are subject to market volatility. If the volatility is of the kind Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd’s (RNAM’s) shares experienced last week, no one will complain. Reliance Capital Ltd’s intention to sell its 42.8% stake in the asset manager has the latter’s stock all fired up. In just two days, the RNAM stock zoomed a steep 30%.
Investors seem to be sure that a change in management could spark an improvement in the asset manager’s operating parameters. The other expectation is the perception of the fund will change for the better.
RNAM has not been as successful in attracting money from high networth individuals (HNIs). The asset management company, however, struck a chord with retail investors, with the largest share of retail money. RNAM’s retail assets under management (AUM) share is 13.9%, but of HNIs, it is a mere 5.4%.
It is also worth bearing in mind that RNAM has lost market share over the years. In June 2011, it was the largest AMC and the first to reach AUM of  ₹1 trillion. Now it ranks as the fifth largest with  ₹2.36 trillion. Its market share in total industry AUM has shrunk from 14.4% to 10% during this period. Reliance Group’s financial woes seem to have affected the fund’s performance.
AUM market share is correlated with the fund’s performance. Here, RNAM does not have much to tom-tom about. Just 53.1% of its rated AUM is assigned four stars or more, noted HDFC Securities Ltd in a report citing a Value Research study. Rated AUM pertains to funds that are rated, and excludes some small-sized funds. Others such as SBI Mutual Fund, Kotak Asset Management, and ICICI Prudential AMC have 75.5%, 82.8% and 73.6% of rated AUM, respectively, in the top quartile.
Analysts also see the possibility of an improvement in operating metrics once Nippon Life takes management control. For example, RNAM’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin is 50.6% while HDFC AMC operates at 77.9%, according to the latest December quarter figures.
Analysts had expressed surprise on the asset manager’s deteriorating quarterly performance. “Core EBIT/AUM declined to 18bps vs. 21-22bps in H1 19, which was a negative surprise as HDFC AMC reported an improvement (adjusted for one-offs) in core profitability despite the equity-mix deteriorating,"" said Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.
Lately, though, the fund house has taken a slew of initiatives to get its mojo back. A few old fund management hands have moved out and given way to a new team. Manish Gunwani has been hired from ICICI Prudential MF as the chief investment officer (equity). Besides, Nippon Life may soon come in with its expertise and goodwill of managing $530 billion in global AUM.
Little surprise then, the RNAM stock has narrowed the valuation gap with its only listed peer, HDFC AMC. RNAM’s one-year forward price-earnings multiple has increased to 22.3 times based on consensus forecasts, against HDFC AMC’s 27.6 times.
If the deal swings Reliance Capital’s way, and it is able to secure a plum price, that would still be sweet music to investors’ ears.
But given that the valuation gap with HDFC AMC has narrowed considerably, or if the deal gets dashed or delayed, investors may well be exposed to the wrong side of volatility going forward.

402,2019-03-09,HDFC,"At present some banks pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 % on savings depositsThe bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 %

MUMBAI :
A day after State Bank decided to link its short-term loans and large savings deposits rates to the repo rate, chairman Rajnish Kumar Saturday said loans and deposits below  ₹1 lakh will continue to be linked to the present MCLR to protect retail customers from market vagaries.
In a first, the nations largest lender had Friday said from May 1, it would link its savings accounts with deposits over  ₹1 lakh and all cash credit accounts and overdrafts or short term loans with limits above  ₹1 lakh or short-term loans, to the repo rate, which currently is at 6.25 %.
At present some banks like Kotak Mahindra, Yes Bank, RBL Bank and Singaporean lender DBS Bank pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 % on savings deposits regardless of the balance, while large players like SBI and other state-run lenders, and private players like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others pay 4 % per annum.
From May 1, the savings bank deposits with balance above  ₹1 lakh will earn an interest of 3.5 %, 2.75 % lower than the repo rate and lower amounts in balance will earn 4 %.
The bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 %.
""The category which we have linked to the external benchmark is the best category--all cash credits and overdrafts above  ₹1 lakh. Here also, for accounts with  ₹1 lakh and below, we've kept out of the purview as we believe that retail customers should not be forced to suffer from the market vagaries,"" Kumar told reporters on the sidelines on event organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
He also said, across the world, retail loans are not left to the market forces alone when it comes to pricing and that it is mostly corporate accounts that are left to the market conditions.
He also said the move is in accordance with the RBI guidelines on the MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rates) and other loan pricing norms.
Kumar said SBIs retail loans are currently priced as per MCLR and the system is working well and will continue to be remain so.
""Retail loans will continue to be linked to MCLR for the time being. If the loan is long-term in nature, you cannot re-price it very frequently...that way MCLR is a good solution,"" Kumar said.
He said by linking savings bank deposits rate to the repo rate, MCLR will get adjusted automatically as and when there is a change in the repo rate.
He, however, said MCLR will not move by 25 bps if there is a similar reduction by the RBI in the repo rate.
""It will depend on what portion of our savings banks gets repriced and its consequent impact on MCLR. To that extent the MCLR will get repriced,"" Kumar said.
Currently, the bank is offering a rate of 3.50 % for savings bank deposit rates up to  ₹1 crore, and 4 % above  ₹1 crore.
As much as 33 % of its savings account-holders will get the benefit of the new pricing system, the bank said.
On the thorny issue of swift monetary transmission, Kumar said liabilities are mostly fixed for banks and transmission on the asset side alone cannot happen.
""Transmission cannot happen only on one side. If transmission has to happen it has to happen on both sides and that is why SBI came out with this solution that the deposits savings bank account with 1 lakh and above, we will link it to repo rate and all the working capital loans which are theoretically payable on demand.
Talking about NCLT clearing ArcelorMittal's  ₹42,000-crore bid for Essar Steel rejecting the  ₹54,389 crore offered by a company run by the Ruias of Essar group, Kumar said they are awaiting the final order.
""The written order is yet to come. But our stand as well as that of the committee of creditors is that we abide by the order. The final process of the resolution of Essar Steel began with the NCLT order yesterday,"" he said.
Kumar said in the case of Jet Airways, whatever is the resolution plan, it will be implemented if all the conditions by all stakeholders--Naresh Goyal, lenders, Etihad and approval from the government, are met.

MUMBAI :
Inflows into Indian equity mutual funds in February were the smallest in more than two years as savers held back investments amid market volatility and uncertainty ahead of the general election starting next month.
Stock funds took in a net  ₹5,130 crore ($736 million), a 17 percent drop over January, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India show. That’s a fourth straight monthly decline and the lowest level since January 2017.
Here’s what the top three asset managers bought and sold last month:

392,2019-03-14,HDFC,"While HDFC Capital will finance the projects through a combination of debt and equity, Tribeca will develop themThe platform will launch its first project in the second or third quarter of next financial year

MUMBAI :
HDFC Ltd’s real estate focused fund management arm HDFC Capital Advisors and Tribeca Developers, builders of Trump Towers in India, have formed a  ₹500-crore investment platform to build premium to mid-income houses in Mumbai and National Capital Region (NCR).
While HDFC Capital will finance the projects through a combination of debt and equity, Tribeca will develop them, said Kalpesh Mehta, founder, Tribeca Developers,over the phone. The platform plans to build around five projects totalling around 3000 units in Mumbai surburbs, Gurugram and Noida in the next four too five years.
These projects will comprise studio apartments, one and two bedroom flats costing between  ₹80 lakh to  ₹2 crore per unit depending on the location.
The platform will launch its first project in the second or third quarter of next financial year. Located in Gurugram, the project comprises 600 units spanning across 1 million sqft. HDFC Capital has already committed  ₹135 crore towards the project.
In the recent past, HDFC Capital has formed several such housing platforms mostly in the affordable residential category with developers including Mahindra Lifespaces Developers Ltd and Prestige Estates Projects.
In 2017, HDFC Capital had closed its second affordable housing fund of around $1-billion corpus, of which a major chunk of it was raised from the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.
“The largest opportunity today from both demand as well as land supply side is in the mid-income. It is purely opportunistic,"" said Mehta. At present, Tribeca is developing four ongoing Trump Tower luxury housing projects in Pune, Mumbai, Gurugram and Kolkata in partnership with local developers. The Trump branded residences are priced between  ₹3.5-15 crore in India.
Tribeca’s entry into the mid income to premium segment comes following Trump Organisation’s announcement two years ago not to enter any new deal to develop Trump Towers across the global. The New York-based firm is a business venture of US president Donald Trump.
Most of the funds under the new platform will invest on construction of the projects as wells deposits over land, Mehta said. “We are not taking any land risk. So we are not buying any land. We will develop the projects either through joint venture or development management agreement with land owners,"" he said.
With the residential real estate sector in a consolidation phase, several developers are increasingly choosing to be land owners while staying away from the development business, said Mehta said. “This has opened up huge opportunity for developers like Tribeca to partner with land owners or local builders to jointly develop the land,"" he added.
“Housing remains a crucial need in India and the demand for housing is expected to grow substantially with increased urbanisation. HDFC’s endeavour is to participate in the huge opportunity of mid income and affordable housing in the country. We are committed to partnering with developers who are aligned with our vision and values,"" Deepak Parekh, chairman, HDFC Ltd said in a statement"

You are presently investing  ₹7,500 in an assortment of mutual fund schemes, some of which are meant to save tax. Assuming they help you meet your tax-saving goals with respect to the  ₹1.5 lakh limit under Section 80C, you can continue doing so. Continue investing in Mirae Asset and Kotak funds. The non-tax saving scheme from DSP can be redirected and added to the Mirae Asset fund. The proceeds from this portfolio should hopefully enable you to meet your child’s school admission expense.
However, for your other goal of getting to  ₹20 lakh in five years, you would need to save and invest  ₹26,000 a month (assuming a medium-term annualized return of 10%) for the next five years. Given that this is a medium-term goal, you cannot afford to take too much risk. I would recommend that you invest in a set of hybrid equity funds such as HDFC Hybrid equity and ICICI Prudential equity and debt funds. You can start with  ₹12,500 and either add on to it as time goes by or take a loan at the end to bridge the gap, or both.

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank on Thursday said SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank will have to comply with additional capital requirement norms by April 1 as the banks continue to remain 'too big to fail' lenders, referred to as D-SIB or domestic systemically important bank.
SIBs are subjected to higher levels of supervision so as to prevent disruption in financial services in the event of any failure.
""The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs has already been phased-in from April 1, 2016 and will become fully effective from April 1, 2019. The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer,"" the central bank said.
The additional CET1 core capital requirement in case of the State Bank of India applicable from April 1 has been prescribed at 0.6% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) while for the other two banks it is 0.4%.
The Reserve Bank had issued the Framework for dealing with D-SIBs in July 22, 2014. The D-SIB framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these banks in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).
Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.
SIBs are seen as 'too big to fail (TBTF)', creating expectation of government support for them in times of financial distress. These banks also enjoy certain advantages in funding markets.

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and the process involved is simple. But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.

A brand is simply trust, proclaimed Steve Jobs once.
The statement has gathered huge momentum today, when more and more consumers engage with brands on the internet. Although the internet has its own set of perks when it comes to reaching out to customers, it also raises a question mark on brand authenticity.
How, then, do brands go about gaining customers’ trust in the digital era?
The same was taken up for discussion at the eighth edition of HT Brand Studio Live—a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more.
This episode marked the Mumbai Chapter of Brand Studio Live, where the show was webcast from the iconic BSE instead of the HT newsroom.
Speaking at the session on Tuesday, Pankaj Gupta, chief marketing officer and head of strategic alliances, credit life, speciality sales and government business, HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “There are three trust elements that every brand needs—transparency, customer-centricity, and reliability.""
Trust is especially crucial in the financial services sector because of the monetary and emotional investments involved. According to the 2015 Edelman Trust Barometer, banking and financial services are the least trusted of industries, compared to technology, consumer electronics, or food/beverages.
“If people trust you with their savings of a lifetime, then your responsibility level automatically goes up several notches,"" said Asha Kharga, chief marketing officer at Axis Bank.
For Kharga, the “human quotient"" also plays an important role in gaining a customer’s trust. “Always humanize a brand. In the banking industry, the human touch is still important,"" the ace marketer said.
Shankar Jadhav, managing director, BSE Investments Ltd, highlighted how “timeliness"" also matters in the financial services sector.
“Trust is built in the financial services sector if you are prompt in letting people know of all developments,"" he said, while also outlining how BSE—which is the world’s fastest stock exchange—contributed towards the growth of the Indian economy.
Venkat Mallik, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Tidal7 Brand Digital, however, pointed out that brand relevance matters as much as brand trust in the digital era.
“A lot of brands have lost value not because people lost their trust in them, but because they have lost relevance,"" he said, adding that brand relevance begins with “making conversations with people that matter.""
In the same vein, Sharad Mathur, head (sales and distribution) at SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “Today, customers are well-informed and intelligent; they expect as well as cherish interactions with a brand. They leave queries for companies online, and expect them to be answered immediately.""
Discussing how trust is built in the mutual funds space, Balaji Vaidyanathan, marketing director at Franklin Templeton Investments, said: “Trust is closely linked to transparency in the mutual funds space. In other words, customers must not be in the dark about where their money is being invested.""
The show ended with HT Digital Streams CEO Rajiv Bansal shedding light on how trust is fostered in the news industry. “Timeliness is of essence in the digital newsroom. You cannot build brand trust without it,"" he said. Bansal also emphasized that customer loyalty is a byproduct of brand trust.

I am 26 years old with all savings in bank FD and PPF. I would want a good retirement corpus and large sum to buy a house, say, 20 years from now. As I am a first-time investor, please suggest some mutual fund schemes.
—Name withheld on request
Starting early as you’re doing now is a great move. In the next step, you would need to identify how much you need for both goals. This will tell you how much you need to save in order to get there. For example, if your monthly expenses are  ₹30,000 today, you would need to build up to  ₹4.3 crore for retirement (assuming inflation at 6%, and a 12% return from your investments). This requires a monthly investment of  ₹7,500. Separate the investments for both goals, to tailor your funds correctly.
For both goals, mix funds across categories to maximise your returns. You have a long time frame and that will allow you to take a little more risk to generate higher returns. First, allocate 20% in both portfolios towards short-term debt, like HDFC Short Term Debt to stabilise it. You can go up to 25-30% in mid-cap or even small-cap funds such as L&T Midcap and Franklin India Smaller Companies. If you cannot take higher risk, limit this exposure to 20%. Invest the remaining in a mix of large-cap and multi-cap funds like ICICI Prudential Bluechip, ICICI Prudential Nifty Next 50, Franklin India Equity, or UTI Equity. Review your portfolio once a year to check if your funds are still on track. Don’t hold too many funds—this will simply lead to dilution. About 4-8 funds for SIP amounts of  ₹10,000 and more should be enough.

Investors can’t stop piling up on the stock of Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third-largest private sector lender. Part of this is driven by the hope that the bank’s new CEO will narrow the gap with the top private sector lender, HDFC Bank Ltd.
Axis Bank’s stock has risen 20% so far this year, while HDFC Bank and second-ranked ICICI Bank Ltd haven’t managed to notch up more than 9% increase, each. Axis Bank’s new managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Amitabh Chaudhry, is making all the right noises on strategy, and analysts seem to have bought the idea that the bank’s return on equity target of 18% by 2021-22 is achievable. 
The bank’s management made a presentation to analysts last week, wherein Chaudhry outlined a cautious game plan, which was laced with enough aggression.
“I did not come here and appear for the interview to remain No. 3. Let me put it that way,"" Chaudhry told The Hindu Business Line newspaper. This reveals much about his aggression. But he is not willing to compromise on the quality of the assets either, which is a heartening sign.
Especially so, since the lender saw its worst year in FY18, which ended with a massive loss of  ₹2,188 core for the March 2018 quarter. This was a direct fallout of its past mistakes of taking on too much risk. Axis Bank has been on the mend ever since, consciously hacking off the dodgy BB-rated loans and bringing down the share of even loans rated BBB. Its slippages have been on the decline, and it has built a reasonable insurance against risk, with a provision coverage ratio of 75%.
Under the new leadership, the lender is clear that project financing is a strict no-no and new borrowers need to be strong, if not pristine, on credit quality. At the same time, the bank is firing on all cylinders to grab retail business as well as growth in working capital financing.
But falling risk tempers returns. Axis Bank is chasing good credit and more retail loans at a time when interest rates are poised to slip. Ergo, analysts are expecting margins to compress going forward.
Besides, a superior performance under the new leadership has already been factored in by the Axis Bank stock when Chaudhry took over in January. In fact, the recent surge in the stock price looks like an overkill. The stock trades at 2.5 times its estimated book value for FY20, more expensive than ICICI Bank’s 2.1 valuation. This is beginning to make some investors edgy.
Also, not all analysts believe that Axis Bank’s performance would improve markedly from previous quarters.

Asset management companies (AMCs) would wish their fortunes were not linked to the ebbs and flows of the market. In the past few months, inflows into mutual funds have ebbed, rather than flowed. As such, AMC stocks are meandering, undershooting the broader markets.
In the last four months, net inflows into equity funds have been shrinking. From more than  ₹12,600 crore in October 2018, net equity inflows have dipped to around  ₹5,100 crore. Inflows to equity funds depend largely on the performances of schemes and market sentiment.
Mutual fund performance in the past year has been all over the place. A few large-cap funds have clocked some gains, but most mid- and small-cap funds have seen negative returns. All but a handful failed to outstrip the bellwether indices. This raises concerns about inflows into equity funds, say analysts.
“Lump-sum investors like to take opportunistic shots at the market. Such opportunities have not been seen. Most investors who make bullet investments are redeeming at the moment. SIPs are structural investments by nature. There have been some cancellations here, but unless the market goes into a tail-spin it will not impact SIP inflows. That should keep the boat steady, but not enough to move the AUM throttle higher in a huge way,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity. SIP is systematic investment plan and AUM is assets under management.
Second, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and index funds, which are low-cost index trackers, have been gaining traction in the overall AUM sweepstakes. These funds made up about 14.46% of equity funds under management in February. Five years ago, that figure was 0.95%. If the trend gains momentum, the quantum of fees that fund houses make through managing active funds could shrink.
Lastly, a larger concern is the cut in the total expense ratio by the regulator, which kicks in from 1 April. Some bigger fund houses could see up to a 25% reduction in their asset management fees. Fund houses have the option of cutting distributor fees on their already built AUM books. However, much hinges on how much of the burden asset managers can actually pass on.
Nevertheless, there may be a bigger impact on new fund inflows. Equity funds are pushed products. Hence, higher distributor commissions actually drive equity fund penetration. With lower commissions, distributors may not be inclined to drive more equity fund sales.
To top it all, the challenging markets also leave fund flows susceptible to volatility. Analysts reckon that during the election season, investors may remain on the fence rather than invest in the market. As a result, they are worried that AMCs may not be able to hold on to their Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins.
Both HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd and Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd have seen their price-earnings multiples correct marginally to 30.1 times and 21.26 times, respectively. However, analysts reckon these valuations could come further under the scanner, unless margins sustain on stable equity flows and fund management fees."

Reversing strong intra-day gains, Indian markets ended lower today amid some selling pressure in energy, FMCG, pharma and auto stocks. The Sensex, which earlier rose nearly 250 points intra-day, ended 100 points lower at 38,132. The Nifty settled 0.33% lower at 11,445, after rising to 11,546 at day's high.
Earlier in the session, banking index Bank Nifty hit a record high of 30,262. It closed 0.46% higher at 30,019.
Among the Sensex stocks, heavyweights RIL and HDFC fell over 1% each. Other major losers included PowerGrid, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors and NTPC, down between 1.4% and 2%. 
Among the major gainers, Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank surged over 5% while SBI rose 1.5%.
Midcap and smallcap stocks outperformed today, though they ended off day’s highs. The BSE midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.60% and 0.63% respectively.
Jayant Manglik of Religare Broking, said: “In the absence of key positive triggers domestically and fear of global economic slowdown, we expect the consolidation in the market to continue in the coming sessions. Global developments and movement of crude oil prices and currency would remain on market radar. Any correction in quality large/ midcap companies with strong growth prospects should be considered as a good buying opportunity for long term investors. With Lok Sabha elections round the corner, volatility and nervousness is expected to remain high in the coming weeks. Hence, traders should avoid risky leveraged positions.""
Indian markets have seen sharp gains this month on the back of strong inflows from foreign institutional investors. ""Nifty is trading with significant gains for the March series and is expected to hold on to the same. Banking space has outperformed with a significant margin while auto and metals have underperformed in the recent past. We continue to maintain a positive bias for the broader markets with bouts of correction to be used for accumulation. For the near term, support on the downside is seen at 11,200 levels while targets seen at 11800/12,200,"" said Sahaj Agrawal of Kotak Securities.

384,2019-03-29,HDFC,"The ED told the special court that it had no objection to allowing banks to sell Mallya properties provided they gave an undertaking The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court did not take up the petition and fixed 2 April for the next date of hearing

MUMBAI :
A day after the SBI-led bankers consortium raised  ₹1,008 crore by selling 7.4 million pledged shares of United Breweries, their bid to recover more money by liquidating shares of United Spirits faced opposition from HDFC Bank which moved the special PMLA court here against it.
The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court did not take up the petition and fixed 2 April for the next date of hearing.
At Thursday's closing price of  ₹532.20 on the BSE, these 6.6 million shares could fetch the banks over  ₹350 crore.
Banks are seeking court permission to liquidate 65.85 lakh shares of United Spirits which were pledged by two Vijay Mallya companies -- United Breweries Holdings (UBHL) and Kingfisher Finvest, the holding company of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines -- as collateral for loans from HDFC Bank.
The banks are trying to part-recover the  ₹6,203.35 crore of dues along with annualized interest of 11.5 per cent payable since 2013, by liquidating the confiscated assets of Mallya, who is awaiting an extradition case at the London High Court now.
In its application moved before MS Azmi, the judge of the PMLA court, HDFC Bank said as part of its business operations it's been extending loans to United Breweries since 1980. Similarly, in 2010 various loans were given and these were secured by shares and various immovable properties.
United Spirits (USL) is majority owned by British spirits major Diageo since 2013 after Mallya sold controlling stake in the country's largest spirits maker.
Under the share pledge agreement for the loan from HDFC Bank, UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest had pledged a total of 65.85 lakh shares of United Spirits in favour of HDFC Bank, the application noted.
HDFC Bank further claimed that the exclusive charge over the attached shares, especially USL shares, was disclosed in the 2011-12 annual report of UBHL.
The application states that it is not the case of consortium of banks that UBHL or Kingfisher Finvest had created a pledge in their favour, prior to creation of pledge in favour HDFC Bank.
The contention that dues of HDFC Bank are not adjudicated and hence they cannot claim right over the pledged share of USL is 'baseless' and 'unfounded', the HDFC Bank said.
Earlier, a 12-bank consortium led by State Bank had moved the PMLA court seeking release of Mallya's assets that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached.
The banks claimed ""legitimate interests"" in all the properties belonging to Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest including movable and immovable properties.
The ED told the special court that it had no objection to allowing banks to sell Mallya properties provided they gave an undertaking that they would return the money later. But this was opposed by the official liquidator appointed by the Karnataka High Court.
Later in January this year, Mallya, who owes over  ₹9,900 crore to banks, was declared as an fugitive economic offender under the provisions of the new Fugitive Economic Offenders Act which came into existence last August. This facilitated the PMLA court to allow banks to sell the stocks.
It can be noted that the official liquidator of the Bengaluru Debt Recovery Tribunal had Wednesday sold 74 million pledged shares of United Breweries, currently owned by beer major Heineken, for  ₹1,008 crore on behalf of the ED.
The proceeds would go to the banks. This is among the big recovery action taken by the authorities since Mallya left the country in March 2016.
These shares, which were pledged with Yes Bank, were attached by the ED in connection with money laundering probe involving Mallya and debt-laden Kingfisher Airlines.
The sale could go on after the PMLA court had last month directed Yes Bank to surrender these in favour of the recovery officer in Bengaluru within three weeks.
Mallya personally held 7.91% in UBHL as of December 2016, while total promoter holdings stood at 52%. UBHL is now facing liquidation. The ED attachment included 41.3 million UB shares or almost 15 per cent held by Mallya and his group companies.
Currently Heineken holds about 44% in UB, once controlled by Mallya, while 23% with UB promoters and promoter groups are pledged.
So far, the ED has attached assets of Mallya worth  ₹9,700 crore in connection with an alleged IDBI Bank loan fraud case registered by the CBI.

383,2019-03-30,HDFC,"FDs fetch a higher rate of interest as compared to savingsFDs with a lock-in period of 5 or more also offer income tax benefits under Section 80C

380,2019-04-01,HDFC,"The three-way merger, the first in the country, makes BoB the third largest lender after State Bank of India and HDFC BankAs far as net NPA is concerned, for BoB it was 4.26% in the December quarter

MUMBAI :
Bank of Baroda on Monday said the amalgamation of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank it from Monday is unlikely to bring in much changes in the financials of the combined entity, including non-performing assets.
The three-way merger, the first in the country, makes BoB the third largest lender after State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, and the second largest among state-run banks, with a combined business of  ₹15 lakh crore, of which deposits are  ₹8.75 lakh crore and advances are at  ₹6.25 lakh crore.
""Looking at capital adequacy ratio for December 2018 quarter, the numbers don't change magically as the pluses of one (Vijaya) are offsetting the minuses of the other (Dena). So net numbers of the combined entity is close to where BoB has been in terms of core capital,"" managing director & chief executive PS Jayakumar told PTI in an interaction.
He said as of the December quarter, CET1 of BoB was 8.65% and on a consolidated level it would be 8.67 percent. Of this, on a standalone basis, BoB's tier 1 capital stood at 9.86 %  and at the combined level it would also be 9.86% .
As far as net NPA is concerned, for BoB it was 4.26% in the December quarter. Given the fact that Dena has much higher NPAs, the new NPA numbers for the combined entity is marginally higher at 4.80%, he said.
""Yes, net NPA has increased but it is not a blow up by any means, and at 4.8% but this is something that we can address over the next two quarters,"" Jayakumar said.
He said in absolute terms, net NPA of BoB stood at around  ₹19,000 crore and this would move to  ₹30,000 crore on a combined basis and he hopes to see improvement in the combined numbers from the first quarter of FY20.
""We are at the end phase of NPA-related challenges. In general, everybody is expecting the recovery cycle to begin from now on. I'd think that positive movement should start from the March quarter itself,"" he said.
Ahead of the merger, government had infused  ₹5,042 crore capital into the bank, and he said he will not require any immediate capital.
From now on, all customers of Dena Bank, which is under prompt corrective action of the RBI, will have renewed access to credit facilities immediately, he said, adding credit growth of BoB and Vijay have been at 15-18% and it will continue to grow at the same pace.
Jayakumar said plans are also afoot to build on the strengths of individual banks and their gain from their synergies and scale up operations by deepening relationships with a wider customer base.
By the end of this month, BoB will bring in interoperability of the key banking services at all the 9,500 branches of the combined entities which would now be known as BoB also the 13,400 ATMs.
He said IT integration is expected to be completed over the next 12-18 months when accounts of all three banks will be migrated to single core-banking system. BoB is now on the version 10 of Finnacle, while Dena and Vijaya are on a different versions of Finnacle.
Ruling out a massive branch mergers, Jayakumar said in rural areas the overlaps are very thin, but in around 1,000 urban centres, the bank will be looking at relocating branches to areas.
Similarly, he also ruled out retrenchment as he does not see redundancy in extra-staff as there are many sectors where BoB is not present and would now focus on those areas. The combined entity will have a workforce of over 85,000.
""Our total number of employees is not going to shrink. We will, in fact, be in an expansionary mode as we need different kind of talents such as a larger outbound sales force, more competencies in analytics and artificial intelligence,"" he said, adding so there is not plan on the table to bring in a voluntary retirement scheme.
Amalgamation of Dena and Vijaya with BoB is the second merger during the past five years. The State Bank had merged five of its associate banks--that of Patiala, Bikaner & Jaipur, Mysore, Travancore and Hyderabad as also the Bhartiya Mahila--in April 2017, making SBI the 48th largest lender in the world with a balance sheet of USD 500 billion.
The BoB counter closed 3.2% up at  ₹132.85 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex rallied 0.51%to close at a near-life time high of 38,871.87.

A subsidiary of RPG Group, KEC International, is one of the leading engineering, procurement and construction companies in India. Its ability to estimate project cost at the time of bidding helped it win projects, deliver margins and mitigate risks. These estimates were based on the analysis of contour maps and physical surveys, which was both time-taking and prone to human errors. After trying out several alternatives, KEC decided to go with autonomous surveys using drones. Once the data was captured, it used image analytics, computer visions, and machine learning models to calculate excavation and backfilling of land. This allowed its bidding team to estimate project costs more accurately and this improved its bid-to-win ratio significantly. In terms of cost savings, the spending on excavation and backfilling quantity was reduced by up to 30%. Now KEC can survey 250 acres in five hours, which earlier took more than five days. This has also allowed it to build a repository of data in digital format for future use.
Internet of Things (IoT): Voltas Ltd
Voltas has seen immense benefits by using IoT to gather data to perform preventive and predictive maintenance of its cooling equipment. Providing services to a fragmented enterprise customer base of 3,500 across 45 locations in the country was proving to be a major challenge for the company. That is when it decided to turn away from a reactive after-sales service, where it had to be informed by the customer of the breakdown, to an I-T-based predictive and preventive maintenance system where all connected Voltas equipment share real-time data with their engineers, allowing them to remotely keep track of the equipment’s health. This not only helped them prevent failures but also ensured customers’ business remained unaffected by breakdowns. According to Voltas, the general turnaround time is 10-12 days, but with the help of IoT, it has managed to bring it down to three days. In terms of cost savings, this has allowed the company to reduce raw material and overhead rationalization by 10% and has led to revenue growth of 15% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) since deployment.
Robotic process automation (RPA): HDFC Bank Ltd
HDFC Bank processes around five million loan applications across multiple locations every year. The average processing time for each loan request was over 45 minutes as everything from application indexing, data entry, document verification and underwriting forward was being done manually. By using RPA, HDFC Bank has automated the data capturing process. Loan processing across all locations is now placed in a centralized server where real-time loan processing status would be visible to all credit administrators. It has also allowed the bank to allocate the cases to credit managers based on the nature of loan, location and eligibility.
This has reduced the turnaround time for processing loan requests by 50%, offering the bank the opportunity to scale up and handle more customers. The tangible benefits of RPA have been the improvement in productivity of data entry staff by 40% and decision-making staff by up to 12%. This has also minimized the scope for manual errors, resulting in better credit quality decisions.
Blockchain: ICICI Bank Ltd
ICICI Bank has emerged as one of the first banks in India to use blockchain for paperless trade process that is safe and secure. The platform is being used for exchange and authentication of overseas transactions and international trade documents. The switch to blockchain has helped the bank reduce the turnaround time of trade cycles, leading to better management of cash flow and inventories. It has also made transactions more transparent as auditing and tracing of blockchain transactions is a lot easier.
The bank hopes this will bring in new asset classes and open up new revenue generation opportunities for it. On a daily basis, the bank is processing all overseas transactions between India and Canada via blockchain. So far, it has processed Canadian $32 million on the platform. Another area where the technology has helped the bank is in trade, which is a paper-intensive process. The bank is looking at how to create a digital letter of credit within 10 minutes.
Augmented reality (AR)/Virtual reality (VR): Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd
In the intermediate commercial vehicles industry, most customers are single vehicle owners or driver owners, who usually rely on feedback or advice of friends and peers when it comes to buying new vehicles, since most original equipment manufacturers in the industry do not provide ownership experiences to them. Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is using VR to provide individual buyers a more personalized experience.
The automaker’s VR platform provides 360-degree videos of the working of its Furio trucks in real-life environment. It puts the customer in the co-passenger seat while the driver can explain the various features of the truck. It includes a VR headset developed by Procus and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro smartphone that comes preloaded with a Furio VR App and mobile device management service.
It is being used for customer/driver meets or local events and during individual customer showroom/office visits. M&M is hoping the use of Furio VR will help improve the conversion ratio of leads to sales and save around  ₹15-30 lakh per dealership."

Mumbai: More than 200 firms in India have failed to comply with a key initiative of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to enhance corporate governance at listed companies. Data compiled by NSEinfobase.com showed that 212 companies have not appointed a woman as independent director by the 1 April deadline set by Sebi.
Of these companies, 52 rank among the top 500 companies in India. These include HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (IndiGo), Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, Union Bank of India (UBI), Indian Overseas Bank, and BSE Ltd.
Most of the non-compliant companies are public sector enterprises, according to NSEinfobase.com, an offering of PRIME Database, a primary market tracker.
Sebi had on 28 March 2018 approved at least 40 proposals, based on a October 2017 report by a Uday Kotak-led panel, to boost corporate governance at listed firms. Some of these provisions had to be met by April 2019.
The proposals include appointing at least one woman as independent director, ensuring that no director is more than 75 years old and that there are at least six directors on the board.
“Partly this represents an attitude issue. In the past, we have seen that larger-sized companies tend to take regulations seriously and are compliant. The second issue is that the consequence of non-compliance is generally very small. It is usually negligible monetary penalties,"" said Amit Tandon, chief executive officer of proxy advisory firm Institutional Investors Advisory Services.
Four years ago when faced with a similar issue of having at least one woman director, Sebi helped out companies by extending the deadline by six months. A financial penalty was imposed on companies that were non-compliant even after the extended deadline.
“It is surprising that many of the top 500 firms are not compliant. The biggest surprise is about directors who continue to be on the board of listed firms despite attaining the age of 75. There are 342 companies who are yet to propose a special resolution for the extension of these ageing non-executive directors,"" said Pranav Haldea, managing director, PRIME Database Group.
ALSO READ | What drives companies to hire women
As of Tuesday, 1,026 non-executive directors in 614 listed firms were at least 75 years old, the age set by Sebi for retirement. Of these, 257 companies have passed special resolutions seeking extensions of 463 directors. However, the result of special resolutions for 15 other companies having 26 directors are still pending. The 342 companies not compliant yet include Reliance Industries Ltd, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd, Berger Paints India Ltd and TVS Motor Co.

Also, at least 35 firms are still to meet Sebi’s mandate of having at least six directors on their boards. “Many companies are banking on getting an extension on the date of compliance. However, no communication has come from Sebi on extending the deadline,"" said a lawyer who is consulting with companies on compliance with the governance norms.

Another important change recommended by Sebi was to split the role of the managing director and chief executive officer. The companies have time till April 2020 to comply in this regard, but as of Tuesday at least 154 companies were still to do so."

India’s asset management companies (AMCs) own assets under management (AUM) worth  ₹24.46 trillion, according to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), a mutual fund industry lobby, for the January-March period. Out of the total industry assets, a huge 82.7% is owned by the top 10 AMCs, who have owned around 80% of the industry assets over at least three years now.

HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd has claimed the top spot with an average AUM of  ₹3.42 trillion, overtaking ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. Ltd with an average AUM of at  ₹3.20 trillion. HDFC AMC saw a solid AUM growth of 14%.
SBI Asset Management Co. Ltd climbed two places from the fifth to the third spot with an AUM of  ₹2.83 trillion.

SBI Mutual Fund recorded the second fastest growth rate at 30% despite its already huge size. “Among the fund houses that grew the largest in FY18-19, the AUM growth of SBI Mutual Fund is likely to be the result of ETF (exchange-traded fund) inflows. It gets huge inflows from the EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation).

On the other hand, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd saw a 24% contraction in AUM, while Sundaram Asset Management Co. Ltd witnessed an 11% contraction.
A financial planner, on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the contraction in Sundaram Mutual Fund may be on account of a clampdown on closed-end funds by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

371,2019-04-11,HDFC,"Kotak Mahindra AMC, HDFC AMC among mutual funds forced to withhold or roll over FMPs with exposure to the Essel GroupMutual funds have  ₹7,000 crore exposure to Essel Group. The paper in question was backed by shares in Zee

Troubles in the debt market have finally reached the doorsteps of mutual fund investors, with Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd withholding part of the redemptions from one of its fixed maturity plans (FMP).
The development has attracted the attention of the stock market regulator, which has asked all mutual funds to provide details of debt schemes backed by promoter shares.
Two Essel Group companies in which the FMP had invested had not repaid in full. That forced the asset manager to hold back part of the payments when the plan matured on 8 April.
The redemption clock began ticking in January when the Essel Group companies, to which mutual funds had lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against debt securities, neared a payment default. The funds agreed not to sell the pledged promoter shares until end-September. In the meantime, Kotak’s FMP—which too had lent to Essel—has come up for redemption, rendering the AMC unable to pay the entire redemption amount.
Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak AMC, said except for one FMP, the fund had returned “100% of the principal amount"" to investors. “The impact is primarily on the returns. We have kept aside some units with their corresponding net asset value (NAV) and we expect to allow investors to realize these units once the Essel Group companies pay us back, latest by 30 September 2019. We refrained from selling the shares that were collateral for the papers concerned because this would have caused a market panic and wouldn’t have allowed us to realize their full value,"" Iyer said over the phone.
FMPs are close-ended funds with a fixed maturity period. They invest in debt instruments, with maturity matching the tenure of the scheme. In this case, the loan was given against pledged shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, the flagship company of Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group.
Nilesh Shah, managing director of Kotak Mahindra AMC, said that in return for forbearance on selling the collateral against the Essel Group companies’ debt, the AMC has secured additional concessions. “We have taken personal guarantee of Subhash Chandra, the promoter of Essel Group, over and above Zee Entertainment shares for better security. We have also secured upside sharing on a graded basis on stake sale in Zee over and above the coupon rate of the existing debentures,"" he said. The Essel Group has put 50% stake in Zee on the block to raise money and repay debt.
An Essel group statement said: “The lenders have unanimously extended support to the Group and the same has positively resulted in saving the loss of public money. The arrangement with the lenders has also given the Group, the required time to realise the right value from the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and has indeed stabilized the stock performance of the mentioned public listed entity.""
Separately, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, India’s largest asset manager, on Wednesday extended the maturity of one of its FMPs maturing on 15 April 2019 to 29 April 2020.
“The purpose of rollover or extension is due to current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning; the yields prevailing in the short-maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock in their investments at current prevailing yields,"" an HDFC AMC statement to investors said.
Typically, in a situation where assets are not realized, AMCs have three options—take a hit on their books, roll over the scheme or mark down the value of security to zero.
Altogether, nine AMCs have lent to Essel Group across 87 schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds. As a percentage of scheme assets, exposure to Essel Group ranges from a negligible amount to as much as 21.01% in Kotak FMP Series 187. Kotak AMC has exposure to Essel Group debt across six FMPs.
Other funds that have exposure to Essel Group debt are SBI Asset Management Co. Ltd, HDFC AMC, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd, UTI AMC Ltd, Baroda Asset Management India Ltd and ICICI Prudential AMC.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was watching the situation closely, said a person aware of the matter.
“Sebi will write to Kotak for an explanation on whether trustee approvals were taken. Sebi has so far not given any opinion on the agreement between the fund houses to not sell the Essel Group securities. But Sebi is concerned and has asked all fund houses to give details of debt schemes, which hold paper backed by promoter shares. The roles of trustees on giving approval to such debt schemes is being monitored very closely,"" said this person.
Kotak AMC’s action and the regulator’s response are likely to lay down a precedent for other mutual funds exposed to bad debt. In December 2018, Sebi had allowed so-called side pockets for mutual funds, to segregate bad debt without affecting the larger scheme.
“This is not a side pocket in the literal sense but more of holding back the securities that were not realized,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, manager- research at Morningstar.
Fair valuation norms require all schemes holding other bonds of the defaulting issuer taking a write-down on their holdings; this would impact NAV and returns of those funds, said Arvind Chari, head-fixed income and alternatives at Quantum Advisors Pvt. Ltd."

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has asked Kotak Asset Management Co. Ltd to clarify under what provisions of the existing rules it has held back redemption of fixed maturity plans (FMPs), two people familiar with the development said.
Sebi wrote to both Kotak AMC and HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd late on Thursday with questions on the FMPs.
Two Essel Group companies, Konti Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt. Ltd and Edisons Utility Works Pvt. Ltd, failed to repay in full the investment of the FMPs. This led to Kotak AMC to hold back part of the payments that were due to mature on 8 April.
HDFC AMC, ahead of the maturity date of 15 April, decided to roll over the FMPs that held the Essel paper by more than a year. HDFC AMC needs the consent of at least 75% of its investors before it can roll over the FMP.
Till Friday evening the status of consent from investors was not clear.
“Sebi has asked Kotak AMC under what provision did it stop part redemption in one of its FMP,"" said one of the two people mentioned above. The market regulator also wrote to HDFC AMC on Thursday seeking answers on its FMP maturing on 15 April.
“Sebi has sought (to know) from HDFC AMC what happens if it does not get 100% consent from investors to roll over the FMP. How will the deal with Essel impact the FMP payment to the rest of the investors who may not consent? The majority of investors are believed to have consented to the rollover,"" said the second person.
“Sebi’s queries to the fund houses are to ascertain whether the actions of the mutual fund houses are in the best interest of the unit holder and whether there was any violation of the code of conduct by the fund managers under the mutual fund regulations,"" said the first person.
Typically in situations when the underlying assets are not realized, the fund houses have three options—take a hit on their books, roll over the scheme or mark down the value of security to zero.
Emails sent to HDFC AMC and Sebi remained unanswered at press time.
Lakshmi Iyer, Head of fixed income at Kotak AMC, said the company’s actions were within the regulatory ambit.
“Sebi’s winding down of asset clause says that when you are liquidating assets, you have to ensure that you are realizing a fair value, either above that not below. I am being governed by a regulator and a regulation which has given regulations for the working of the mutual fund and the scheme and that is exactly what I am doing. For instance, I decide to wind down an ETF (exchange traded fund) that also comes under the winding down clause,"" Iyer told Mint.
She did not confirm or deny receiving Sebi queries.
Kotak AMC also defended its actions in a note to investors on Friday.
“While we regret that we had to withhold certain part of units in FMPs represented by portfolio investment in Essel Group companies for now, we believe that our actions are in the interest of our unitholders,"" it said.
Kotak AMC in a bid to mitigate reputational risks also said that its exposure to Essel Group remained in six FMPs and in Kotak Credit Risk Fund to an extent of 0.37% of its assets under management. It is also working with the promoters of Essel Group to ensure “optimal recovery"" of dues owed by the conglomerate.
“I don’t think it is right to second guess the investment decision of a fund manager. In hindsight they do look like poor decisions to invest. Similarly, the call to restructure and negotiate with the promoters if it comes with an additional personal guarantee of the promoter should not be second guessed. Having said that, fund managers need to be transparent and humble in their approach rather than hide behind legalese,"" said Sandeep Parekh, managing partner, Finsec Law Advisors.
“Essel Group remains committed to achieve the resolution, with a sole objective of saving the loss of public money and the repayment, as per the agreed timelines indicated in the arrangement with lenders,"" an Essel spokesperson said in a statement.

369,2019-04-13,HDFC,"Stock funds took in about  ₹118 billion, the highest since OctoberIndia’s largest money manager held  ₹1.5 trillion in equities

Inflows into Indian equity mutual funds hit a five-month high in March, induced by the rally that recently lifted the $2.2 trillion stock market to a record.
Stock funds took in about  ₹118 billion ($1.7 billion), the highest since October, and more than double over the previous month, data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India show.
Here’s what the top three asset managers bought and sold last month:
HDFC Mutual Fund
India’s largest money manager held 1.5 trillion rupees in equities, with financials accounting for about 33 percent of stock assets followed by industrial companies at about 14 percent.
ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund
The money manager held equity assets of 1.3 trillion rupees, with financials making up 27 percent of assets followed by materials at about 10 percent and energy at 9.7 percent.
SBI Funds Management Pvt.
The fund house had about 1.6 trillion rupees invested in more than 300 stocks. Financials made up about 36 percent of assets, followed by technology at 10 percent."
367,2019-04-14,HDFC,"The financial sector crisis in the country has also put banks on the back foot in lending to firms building roadsInfrastructure stocks began their descent after news of weak orders in FY19

All is not well for road-construction companies. Weak order flows in a normally robust March quarter, lower-than-expected pace of construction and stretched working capital may take a heavy toll on profit growth in the March quarter.
Infrastructure stocks began their descent after news of weak orders in FY19 (see chart above). Also, the government estimate of 10,000km of roads constructed during the fiscal year is almost 40% lower than the original forecasts.
This is ironical, given that investors expected a ramp-up in order flows in the March quarter before the lull that would set in before and during the general elections. Order flows under the new government will now pick up only in the second half of FY20.
Meanwhile, the ills of land acquisition and funding have resurfaced in the last few months. The situation is better than a decade ago under the hybrid annuity model, but a few projects have been stuck because of last-mile land-acquisition issues. Hence, delays dog the project.
Developers and bankers insist on at least 80% land acquisition before taking the appointed date, which is important in securing advances to kick-start a project and bank funding for execution, says a report by HDFC Securities Ltd.
Dilip Buildcon Ltd has nearly eight projects pending appointed date, while KNR Construction Ltd, PNC Infratech Ltd and IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd have three each, and Sadbhav Engineering Ltd and Ashoka Buildcon Ltd, four each.
These delays have led to holdups in advances, which in turn is reflected in higher working capital required across the sector. The financial sector crisis in the country has also put banks on the back foot in lending to this sector. The cost of borrowing for mid-sized firms is high even in a falling interest rate regime because of the risk associated with infrastructure. For most such firms, in the last three quarters interest cost as a percentage of sales has risen.
A report by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd points to a contraction in the Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin in the March quarter due to adverse revenue mix and modest profitability. “Net profit may decline 20% YoY (for the companies it covers), given that most of them would have a higher tax burden on the expiry of the tax holiday under Section 80IA,"" said the report.
That said, the sector would be back on the fast track from the second half of FY20 as road capex is one of the highest in terms of central and state government allocations. Stocks too would return to the spotlight once ordering activity improves."

Corporate earnings for the March quarter and elections are expected to be key drivers of equity markets in this truncated week. Indian markets are shut for trading on Wednesday and Friday. Most analysts expect volatility in the markets is likely to continue till general elections are over.
Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said the current corrective phase in the markets has just begun and it may last till the middle of May, however, the undertone of the market will not be weak. ""The amount of price correction would be difficult to estimate but the markets will take their own time till May to correct. The markets are witnessing a whipsaw phase where neither the bulls nor the bears could make headway during the week. This is typically a corrective phase which the markets are undergoing after witnessing a strong rally. Statistically, similar such corrections in the past have taken around a month’s time.""
As India is set to see a new government post elections, analysts and investors will be keenly watching out for commentary and guidance by companies, which are expected to be indicative of economic and business growth. The surge in crude oil prices in the January-March period is expected to further delay a recovery in corporate earnings.
While private banks, cement and utilities, which have been a drag on earnings, are likely to post good numbers, the performance of former champions such as metals, auto, retail, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is likely to moderate in Q4FY19, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a 5 April note.
Major companies that will declare Q4 earnings this week are Reliance Industries, Wipro, HDFC Bank, RBL Bank, Mindtree and ICICI Lombard General Insurance.
This week investors are likely to react to TCS and Infosys stocks as the IT majors announced their March quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. Infosys reported a mixed bag in Q4FY19, with margins below expectations even as revenue was in-line. For the full year FY19, Infosys has posted 9% revenue growth in constant currency terms versus a guidance of 8.5- 9% and EBIT margin of 22.8% versus guidance of 22-24%. It has provided 7.5-9.5% growth guidance and has lowered its margin guidance by 100 basis points (bps) to 21-23% for FY20 – both lower than the street’s expectations. Analysts believe that lower-than-expected growth and margin guidance may lead to a cut in street’s earnings estimates.
“We believe Infosys is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, given that YoY constant currency growth was 11.7% in Q4FY19, with robust order wins also reflecting underlying revenue strength,"" Reliance Securities Ltd said.
TCS ended FY19 with full-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 11.4% YoY, EBIT margin of 25.6% and net income growth of 22.5% YoY.

Mumbai: Bandhan Bank Ltd has received approval of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for the proposed acquisition of Gruh Finance, the Kolkata-based bank said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. Gruh Finance, the affordable housing finance arm of HDFC Ltd, was taken over by Bandhan Bank in a share-swap deal in January.
The Reserve Bank of India approved the Bandhan-Gruh Finance merger in March.
""The Competition Commission of India has by way of its letter dated April 15, 2019, intimated that CCI, at its meeting held on April 15, 2019, considered the proposed combination and approved the same,"" the bank said in a regulatory filing.
As part of the deal, Bandhan Bank has to transfer 14.9% stake to HDFC for merging Gruh Finance with itself.
The Gruh Finance deal will reduce stake of Bandhan Financial Holdings Ltd in Bandhan Bank to about 61% from the current 82%. HDFC will hold about 15% stake in the merged entity from about 57% in Gruh Finance. 
The share swap ratio for the merger will be 568 shares of Bandhan Bank for every 1,000 shares of Gruh Finance.

363,2019-04-17,HDFC,"In another option, HDFC AMC will extend maturity date, thus extending time for repaymentInvestors who don’t consent to the rollover will get their money back at the prevailing NAV

Mumbai: HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, which has a series of Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) exposed to Essel Group, on Monday issued a note on how it will handle them at maturity.
HDFC AMC, India’s largest asset manager, said it will choose one of two options. In the first option, it will distribute proceeds of the FMP on due date of maturity after excluding the value of debt exposures to the Essel Group. 
The residual amount of the maturity proceeds would be paid on receipt of dues from Essel. The same approach was followed by Kotak Asset Management Co. with its Essel-exposed FMPs. 
In the second option, HDFC AMC will rollover the scheme (extend the maturity date) thereby extending the time for possible repayment. Investors must give their consent in writing to such a rollover. Investors who don’t consent to the rollover will get their money back at the prevailing NAV. 
If the Essel papers have been marked at a lower valuation by the AMC to account for the repayment uncertainty, this will be incorporated in the NAV. Also, investors who fail to consent to the rollover and exit at this stage will not benefit from future recoveries in the troubled paper. 
FMPs are close-ended funds with a fixed maturity period. 
They invest in debt instruments, with maturity matching the tenure of the scheme.
Nine AMCs have exposure to Essel Group firms across 87 schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds. The mutual funds have lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against debt securities.
HDFC AMC has already rolled over one of its FMPs before this note was released. HDFC Fixed Maturity Plan—1,168 days—February 2016 (1) - Regular Plan was due for maturity on 15 April 2019. It was rolled over to 29 April 2020.
The scheme had a roughly 20% exposure to Essel firms. The AMC has another eight FMPs up for maturity between Tuesday and 30 September 2019 with more than 10% exposure to Essel companies.
HDFC AMC’s note has added uncertainty to the woes of investors in debt mutual funds. This is because the AMC has not explained on what basis it will choose one of the two options. The divergent paths chosen by Kotak AMC also lays open the possibility of widely differing approaches of mutual funds hit by the crisis at Essel.
In case of a rollover, investors have to decide whether or not to consent to it. However, there is little information available to unit holders on how the troubled securities are being valued and how they would affect the prevailing NAV. Sebi rules dictate debt securities to be valued by two independent valuation agencies. However, what value has been assigned to the specific securities in question is not disclosed to investors on a day-to-day basis. “For investors who have liquidity requirements, there is no choice. They should take what is on offer now. For those without any liquidity requirements, the chance of the Essel promoter completing a strategic sale and being able to return the money within the next six months is relatively higher based on current news flow. Such investors should give their consent to a rollover,"" said Vishal Dhawan, founder and CEO, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors."

Benchmark stock market indices Sensex and Nifty today closed at record highs, led by gains in banking stocks and IT heavyweight TCS. The Sensex rose as much as 458 points intraday to 39,364, before ending at 39,275, up 369 points. Broader benchmark index Nifty, which hit a fresh high of 11,810 intraday, settled 0.90% higher at 11,787. Banking stocks led the gains with Nifty Bank index rising 1.5%. Earnings, investment flows and elections are likely to be the key drivers for Indian markets this truncated week. Indian markets would remain closed on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday. Voting for the second phase of Lok Sabha elections will take place on April 18. The global cues remained positive with Asian and European markets higher today.
Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets:
1) The earnings season got off to a good start with market heavyweight TCS reporting yet another quarter of strong results and the management expects continued strong growth in the new fiscal year starting April 1. TCS shares ended 1% higher, extending their Monday's 5% gain.
2) ICICI Bank surged 4% on reports that Goldman Sachs has raised its target price to  ₹492, from  ₹451. IndusInd Bank (4%), Axis Bank (1.6%), and HDFC Bank (0.80%) were among the other top gainers in the banking pack.
3) Infosys shares continued to drag after its margin and growth guidance disappointed the Street. Infosys shares ended 0.40% lower, after falling nearly 3% on Monday.
4) Wipro shares ended 2.3% lower ahead of its earnings announcement later in the day. RIL and HDFC Bank are also set to report quarterly numbers later this week.
5) Polycab India made a blockbuster debut today on bourses, with shares listing at 20% premium. Shares of Polycab India Ltd was listed on the stock exchanges at  ₹644.45, up 19.8% from its issue price of  ₹538 per share on Monday. The IPO had got a massive response, with subscription of over 50 times.
6) Elsewhere, SpiceJet shares extended gains to the fourth day as investors bet that the airline will be able to increase capacity amid Jet Airways's financial woes. SpiceJet shares rose 11% today. Jet Airways shares fell 7% after reports, citing sources, said that the management of airline has proposed to suspend all operations of the debt-laden airline at its board meeting today.
7) ""Indian markets had a dream run over the last few weeks on the back of dovish and accommodative global central banks and unprecedented foreign flows. The sentiment got a fillip once the Meteorological Department forecast near normal south-west monsoon,"" said Devang Mehta, head of equity advisory at Centrum Wealth Management.
8) ""The Street is also anticipating further rate cuts to reverse the economic slowdown and sensing a return of consumption demand, post the election results. The banks continue to have a lion’s share in the ongoing rally and the onus to lead the earnings for Nifty will lie with the corporate banks,"" Mehta said. ""With two good primary market listings (Metropolis Healthcare and Polycab India) in two days and upbeat mood, all eyes are now set on the ongoing fourth quarter earnings season.""
9) Expectations are rising that the RBI could deliver yet another rate cut in June to boost the economy. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at a measly 0.1% in February. Consumer inflation rose at a faster pace than anticipated in March, but remained below the central bank's target for an eighth straight month, increasing the chances for a key interest rate cut in June.
10) Crude oil price remains a key risk for Indian markets as any substantial movement beyond $70 per barrel is not conducive for the Indian economy, analysts say. Brent crude prices are hovering near five-month high of around $71 a barrel."

I want to invest  ₹5,000 each month in SBI Life Retire Smart Fund for 16 years. It has already been two years since I made the first investment. Please advise whether I should move to another fund or change my investment in order to accumulate  ₹4 crore in the next 16 years
—Name withheld on request
There are two issues with your question—one, the product that you are talking about (and investing in) is not a mutual fund product, but a unit-linked insurance product (Ulip). Also, it appears that this is a product that guarantees a certain amount of return to the investor, which implies that it is a very conservative investment vehicle.
Two, even if you were investing in a mutual fund, investing  ₹5,000 a month for 16 years means you would be investing Rs9.6 lakh total. It is very improbable that this amount will turn to Rs4 crore in this period (it would mean an annualized return of more than 30% sustained for 16 years, which has never happened). Moreover, it is impossible for it to happen with this investment-cum- insurance product.
So, my advice to you would be to switch to mutual fund systematic investment plans (SIPs) for your long-term investing needs, and increase your monthly investment considerably to get to your target.
I am a 27-year-old bachelor and I want to accumulate Rs2 crore by the time I turn 50. I plan to use this money to travel the world. To this end, I am investing  ₹65,000 in mutual funds through direct plans since 2015. Of this amount,  ₹5,000 in Reliance Small Cap Fund, and  ₹15,000 each in in Kotak Emerging Equity Scheme, Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund and Aditya Birla Sunlife Frontline Equity Fund. For debt, I save about  ₹9,000 per month in my Provident Fund account and  ₹2,000 each month in Public Provident Fund (PPF). Could you please evaluate my portfolio and suggest changes in my mutual fund investments, if necessary?
—Sanjay Kumar
It is not quite clear from your question whether your investments in mutual funds are ongoing SIPs or if they were one-time investments made four years ago. If they are SIPs, then you are very well-positioned to reach your goal of accumulating  ₹2 crore long before you reach 50 years of age. You might even achieve it by the time you turn 40 years old.
However, if they were one-time investments made a few years ago, they would not be enough, just by themselves, for you to reach your goal, since this money would grow to only about  ₹15 lakh in the given time frame of 23 more years.
If this is the case, then you should start an SIP for about  ₹20,000 a month (or as much as you can invest) in a diversified, aggressive portfolio. From among the schemes you have selected for this purpose, you can continue investing in Parag Parikh and Aditya Birla Sunlife funds. You can consider replacing the Kotak Emerging Equity Fund with Kotak Standard Multicap Fund. For the allocation to small-cap, consider adding HDFC Small Cap Fund into the mix and splitting the allocation with the Reliance Small Cap Fund, which you already have.

HDFC Bank Ltd reported a record quarterly net profit of 58.85 billion rupees ($848 million) on Saturday, meeting market expectations as the country's biggest lender by market value raked in higher interest and fee income.
The bank also said its board had approved raising up to 500 billion rupees by issuing debt over the next 12 months.
Net profit rose 22.6 % in the fourth quarter through March from 47.99 billion rupees a year ago. Analysts were looking for a profit of 58.46 billion rupees, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.
The private sector lender, which focuses on retail consumers and has a relatively small exposure to the troubled infrastructure sector, has been able to tame its bad loans and stay profitable at a time when high levels of soured assets have swept the sector.
HDFC Bank is the first major Indian lender to report results for the final quarter of the year.
Overall its loans grew 24.5 % as of end-March, of which domestic retail loans climbed 19 %.
Net interest income was up 22.8 %, while the net interest margin was 4.4 %.
Asset quality improved slightly, with gross bad loans as a percentage of the total at 1.36 % by the end of March, compared with 1.38 % in the previous quarter and 1.30 % in the same period last year.

359,2019-04-21,HDFC,"FMPs are market-linked instruments and are, therefore, exposed to the return and risk characteristics of the underlying bonds in the portfolioInvestors must recognise the risky nature of these products, and fund managers must turn more cautious as FMPs are often sold as replacement for FDs. They aren’t.

In the past few days, two fixed maturity plans (FMPs), from Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd and HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, have faced trouble due to their exposure to Essel Group’s debt papers. In one case, investors got most of the payment, but the AMC held back some units until the recovery of money from Essel Group. In the other, the AMC rolled over the FMP for clients who agreed to it. In the coming months, the trouble may spread to FMPs of other fund houses having exposure to Essel Group. Shaikh Zoaib Saleem asked experts which of the two ways is better for investors:
It’s better to book losses and invest elsewhere
Pattabiraman Murari, Founder, FreeFincal
The way AMCs and rating agencies have dealt with the crisis is far from inspiring trust. Should investors exit or opt for roll over if the AMC gives that option? Even if one opts for a rollover and the fund house is able to recover the money, the delay will reduce the yield as the net asset value (NAV) will take weeks or months to recover to its pre-crisis value. I think it would be better for investors to take the loss, get rid of the uncertainty associated with debt recovery and invest elsewhere.
What else can be done to safeguard investors? Risk in a debt mutual fund is inevitable, but it can be compartmentalized. One can have debt funds that invest only in short-term gilts, only in long-term gilts, only in corporate bonds or only PSUs and so on. Such style of purity, especially in FMPs, offers choice. Those seeking higher yields can choose corporate- or PSU-based FMPs. Those who cannot stomach any credit risk can stick to gilt FMPs.
Investors must recognize that FMPs can’t replace FDs
Sandeep Parekh, Partner, Finsec Law Advisors
The mutual fund imbroglio is not as bad as it sounds. Had investments completely soured, the specific scheme would have written off the amount and returned the balance to investors. The deferral is the lesser of two evils. What was likely to be a default situation has been deferred with a higher security cover. There is higher probability of investors getting their money back , but there is no guarantee.
Whether to hold back units, or roll over the payback period, or just take a haircut is a call fund managers and investors must take. None of the options is inherently superior to the other as immediate liquidity must be faced with an immediate haircut, while a deferment is likely to return more money but only in the future. Ultimately, investors must recognise the risky nature of these products, and fund managers must turn more cautious as FMPs are often sold as replacement for fixed deposits (FDs). They aren’t.
Getting back some of the money is the better option
Suresh Sadagopan, Founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories
The way the two fund houses have handled the problem is slightly different. But, fundamentally, in both the cases, the risk is still very much with the investor. That being said, I would prefer the Kotak AMC way of handling this situation because that would mean that I would have got almost 100% of my money back. If I invested  ₹100 and it has gone up to  ₹127 over a period of time, some money, maybe  ₹20, is stuck, but I still got  ₹107.
The fund houses are expected to do the due diligence, but as a debt fund investor, the risk also belongs to me.
One of the things that’s been said, which I agree with, is that AMCs should not get into the lending business. There is a thin line between direct lending to a business and buying securities. Direct lending involves more due diligence. AMCs are not business consultants and should not get into the business of being part-owners, which has happened in some cases.
FMP investors should get to decide if they want to stay
Vishal Dhawan, Founder, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors
FMPs are market-linked instruments and are, therefore, exposed to the return and risk characteristics of the underlying bonds in the portfolio.
As they have a maturity date, they are perceived to be similar to bank FDs; also, they offer the benefit of tax arbitrage to investors in higher tax brackets. Thus, a lot of investors tend to use them for specific goals. Any fixed maturity instrument that does not permit liquidity at the point that it was promised could, therefore, create challenges for investors. So it is critical that, irrespective of the underlying performance, investors are able to choose whether they wish to stay or not. Investors who do not need liquidity could decide on the basis of the risk in the underlying security.
Ideally, investors should use open-ended debt funds so that they have more flexibility to make these changes, as underlying security performance, tax laws and needs of liquidity can change over a period."
358,2019-04-22,HDFC,"Puri may have to hang up his boots in FY21 as the age limit for top banking executives to hold office is 70 yearsIts March quarter and full-year earnings released on Saturday show that its bad loan stock is under 2% of its loans and its net interest margin remained at 4.4%

MUMBAI :
What happens to a bank with a stellar performance if the leader behind the strong run has to leave? Investors of HDFC Bank Ltd have a year and a half to find the answer.
HDFC Bank’s chief Aditya Puri may have to hang up his boots midway in FY21 due to a rule that sets 70 years as the maximum age for top banking executives to hold office.
Some analysts fear that Puri’s shoes are too large to fill, and a fitting successor is yet to emerge after his deputy Paresh Sukthankar left last year. Under Puri’s watch, HDFC Bank became the largest lender and even the most valued. It has consistently bucked the broad sector trend for many years now.
Even in FY19, when most other lenders had a troublesome run, HDFC Bank reported profit growth of 20.5%, something investors have taken for granted now.
Its March quarter and full-year results released on Saturday show that its bad loan stock is under 2% of its loans and its net interest margin remained at 4.4%. Its comparable private peers are likely to report ratios far worse and public sector lenders even more so.
It is no surprise there is a view that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) should perhaps look at the age limit again. Ashvin Parekh, an independent banking expert, says that since public sector lenders are still not out of the woods, chiefs of private lenders should be allowed to continue, simply because continuity is critical for sustained balance sheet performance.
After all, a moot point in the dismal performance of public sector lenders is that their chiefs have short tenures. But tenures too long haven’t gone without their issues too. A case in point is ICICI Bank, the head of which is under investigation for violation of lending norms. Chanda Kochhar was chief of the lender for a decade before she quit against the backdrop of allegations of granting loans to the Videocon group as a quid pro quo for the business group’s dealings with her husband Deepak Kochhar.
But the biggest challenge in allowing bank chiefs to serve too long is succession planning.
“Extending is just postponing the issue for some future date. Succession planning is more critical. There is no point in having a dilemma over a successor, especially if you are a listed company,"" said Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader of financial services at EY India.
A sense of continuity can be given to investors through succession planning. Parekh says talent always emerges either from within or outside the organization and succession planning isn’t a make-or-break event. For instance, both ICICI Bank and Axis Bank found new chiefs despite sudden departures. Investors have taken a sanguine view on the lenders after the new executives took over. In that regard, HDFC Bank is in a far better place as Puri’s exit date is known.
To be sure, HDFC Bank has kick-started the process to find a successor to Puri.
But talk that RBI should consider extending the tenure of bank CEOs must be nipped in the bud. As Chuck Noll, the famous coach who won a record four Super Bowl titles once said, “Everyone’s job is important, but no one is indispensable.""
HDFC Bank’s rich valuations on the Street also show that investors aren’t worried too much about its prospects despite the impending change of guard."

March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this week. In the global markets too, earnings will be key for equities. This week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by US companies.
In the US, big companies like Facebook, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft will report earnings this week. Among key Indian companies to declare March quarter earnings this week are Maruti Suzuki, Yes Bank, Hero Motocorp, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Bharti Infratel ACC, SBI Life, HDFC Life.
During this week, the markets are expected to consolidate and then turn volatile due to expiry of April series Futures and Options.
“The near term trend of Nifty is range bound and one may expect this high low range of 11,750-11,550 levels to continue for the next curtailed week.

On Monday, HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries stocks will be in focus after posting their quarterly earnings.
Net profit of Reliance Industries rose 9.79% to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March while revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion in the same period. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.
HDFC Bank Ltd reported a record Q4 net profit of  ₹5885 crore up 22.6% meeting market expectations as the country's biggest lender by market value raked in higher interest and fee income.

Asian shares got off to a subdued start on Friday, while the dollar held near two-year highs against the euro on speculation that data later in the day will show the US economy outperforming the rest of the developed world. The dollar was down at 111.51 yen, after shedding 0.5% overnight, but was buoyed elsewhere by solid data on US capital goods orders.

A savings account is one of the basic financial products that everyone must have. All the major banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Bank Of Baroda (BoB), Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer their customers several variations of savings accounts. These are just basic savings accounts where you can leave your money and earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6%, depending on the amount and the bank. The interest amount then gets credited to the customer on a quarterly basis, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules.
Here are the savings account interest rates for major Indian banks:
SBI: The State Bank of India, the largest one, offers its customers 3.50% interest rates on savings deposit balance of up to  ₹1 crore. Above  ₹1 crore, the interest rate levied on savings balance is 4% per annum. Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4 April, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft rate will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
Kotak Mahindra Bank: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh. The rate of interest has been lowered to 4.5% from 5% earlier, according to the bank’s website. The revision in interest rate came into effect from 15 April 2019. The interest rate on savings account deposits on balance above  ₹1 lakh and up to  ₹1 crore remains unchanged at 6%. Similarly, the interest rate on savings accounts balance of above  ₹1 crore remains steady at 5.5%.
Bank of Baroda: Bank of Baroda (BoB), which has become the second largest public sector bank after SBI following its amalgamation with Bengaluru-based Vijaya Bank and Mumbai-based Dena Bank, offers an interest rate of 3.50% to 4.00% on savings account.
HDFC Bank: HDFC Bank is offering an interest rate of 3.50% per annum (p.a.) on savings deposit balance below  ₹50 lakh. Above this amount, HDFC levies an interest rate of 4% p.a.
ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank, too like HDFC, gives its customers the same range of interest rates. For account balance below  ₹50 lakh, the interest rate is 3.5% per annum. The interest rate of 4% for savings balance amount over  ₹50 lakh."

Within 10 days of the last set of downgrades on Reliance Commercial Finance and two other Reliance ADAG Group companies - Reliance Capital and Reliance Home Finance, CARE Ratings has downgraded long term bank facilities worth  ₹12,700 crore of Reliance Commercial Finance from CARE BBB+ to Care D. According to CARE Ratings, a rating of 'D' means instruments in this category are either in default or expected to soon be in default. The ratings agency also downgraded another  ₹5,000 crore worth debt of Reliance Commercial Finance to CARE C from BBB+. 13 mutual fund schemes across 4 AMCs are exposed to Reliance Commercial Finance.
CARE Ratings cited rescheduling of NCDs and delays in repayment of bank loan facilities as the rationale for its action. It added that the “liquidity profile of the group continues to be under stress on account of delay in raising funds from the asset monetisation plan and impending debt payments."" Along with Reliance Commercial Finance, two other Reliance ADAG Group companies were downgraded on 18th and 19th April, one by CARE and another by Brickwork Ratings which we wrote about here.
The AMCs exposed to Reliance Commercial Finance are Reliance Nippon AMC, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, DHFL Pramerica AMC and L&T FMP. 8 out of the 13 schemes are Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs). As a percentage of scheme assets, exposures extend up to 13.6% in case of DHFL Pramerica Short Maturity Fund according data released by Value Research as on 31st March 2019. The downgrades come at a time when the mutual fund industry is reeling from downgrades or delayed payments from troubled groups like IL&FS, Essel and DHFL. ""There is nothing investors can do, once locked into an FMP,"" said Lovaii Navlakhi, Founder and CEO, International Money Matters Pvt. Ltd. ""The problem arises at investment stage, with the thinking that an FMP is an FD with tax benefits. I expect that SEBI will further tighten the issuer and group exposure norms on these products.""
It is unclear how much debt held by mutual fund schemes has been individually affected by the downgrade. A spokesperson from DHFL Pramerica AMC in an e-mail to Mint responded by stating, “Our exposure to Reliance Commercial Finance is a structured transaction based on the credit enhancement offered by the Parent - Reliance Capital which is rated Care A. As such our structure also carries the rating of Care A (So). There is no change in the ratings of our instrument despite the change in rating of Reliance Commercial Finance on a stand-alone basis.""
Kotak Mutual Fund recently held back some of its FMP units against payments due from the Essel Group and HDFC Mutual Fund rolled over (extended) the maturity of one of its FMPs with Essel exposure. A surge of redemptions from some AMCs like DHFL Pramerica Mutual Fund has also caused their exposures to the troubled groups to breach SEBI limits. The Regulator has not initiated any penal action in this regard at this point of time. Kalpesh Ashar, Founder, Full Circle Financial Planners and Advisors, pointed to three aspects of the current crisis in debt funds and FMPs. ""First, fund managers have prioritized yield generation over investor safety. Second, too much money entered debt mutual funds without sufficient corresponding depth in the bond market. Third, AMCs are not communicating troubles with their holdings until the very last minute or sometimes after a default has happened. This aggravates the problem,"" he said.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s profitability metrics for FY19 outshone those of its closest rivals SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
HDFC Life reported growth of 13% in annualized premium equivalent (APE), slower than its past performance. But its rival ICICI PruLife reported no growth at all. SBI Life did marginally better with 14% growth in APE.
But its value of new business margin of 24.6% was superior compared with SBI Life’s 17.7% and ICICI PruLife’s 17%. But there is no secret sauce here. All insurers have realized that growing the margin-friendly protection business is key to better profitability.
HDFC Life has just been more successful than others in pushing plain term plans. In FY19, more than a quarter of its new business came from selling plain protection products. ICICI PruLife is far behind with a share of 9.3%, while SBI Life had 12% of new business coming from term plans.
So, why are analysts wary on HDFC Life and prefer to be bullish on SBI Life and even ICICI PruLife? Nomura Securities India Pvt. Ltd has a neutral rating on HDFC Life, while Deutsche Bank recommends hold. Both have a buy rating on SBI Life and ICICI PruLife.
According to analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, SBI Life has the muscle for distribution compared with others as it has exclusive access to parent State Bank of India’s (SBI’s) branches. It has also shown superior traction in its protection business and its persistency ratios outshine those of peers.
“(SBI’s) management is confident of growing protection faster than the overall annual premium equivalent. Persistency trends and surrender ratio of SBI Life remains favourable,"" noted analysts at Deutsche Bank.
However, a large part of analysts’ stock preferences within the life insurance space has to do with the valuations of the three companies. HDFC Life has run up 13% over the last two months and trades at a multiple of more than four times its embedded value for FY19.
Compare this to SBI Life’s multiple of about three times and ICICI PruLife at about two times, HDFC Life indeed looks richly valued."

345,2019-04-30,HDFC,"Fees and other commissions declined sharply to  ₹29.85 crore in the March quarter from  ₹100 crore a year earlierThis came on the back of an 18% year-on-year increase in assets under management to nearly  ₹3.44 trillion

HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, one of the largest fund houses in India, posted a steady 28% rise in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) for the quarter ended March 2019. This came on the back of an 18% year-on-year increase in assets under management (AUM) to nearly  ₹3.44 trillion.
Some of the rise in net profits also reflects the changing nature of the business. Last year, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) banned asset management companies (AMCs) from paying upfront commissions and other such fees through their profit and loss accounts. This substantially lowered operating expenses as the payment of commissions fell substantially. Fees and other commissions declined sharply to  ₹29.85 crore in the March quarter from  ₹100 crore a year earlier. Ebitda margins climbed to 73.3% in the last quarter from 59.61% a year earlier.
There are more regulatory changes coming up that affect financials and, unfortunately for investors, the impact will be negative this time. Sebi has notified a cut in the total expense ratio (TER), which fund houses charge to manage assets. The new structure has introduced slabs, which progressively reduce total expenses. As a result, revenues of all large fund houses will be hit.
HDFC AMC expects to pass on some of this impact to its distributors in the form of lower trail fees.
Analysts expect the net impact to be low. A report from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd points out that HDFC AMC’s blended equity fund TER is about 24 basis points. Of this, about 21 basis points are likely to be passed on. Hence, the net impact on HDFC AMC’s revenue is expected to be about three basis points.
The scenario, however, is evolving and it is to be seen how much the firm can actually pass on. This is especially because Sebi has banned upfront commissions and a substantially lower TER reduces distributor margins. This may not be taken too well by distributors. Last year, though, some TER changes were passed on to distributors.
“It remains to be seen whether AMCs (especially the large ones with higher bargaining power, such as HDFC AMC) are able to pass on the bulk of the TER cut to distributors as well,"" said JM Financial in a note to clients.
The HDFC AMC stock is expensive. It has slipped 11.1% since August 2018 but still quotes at a lofty earnings multiple of 36.7 times FY19 earnings. The company has a valuation of 10.5% of its average AUM in the March quarter, almost exactly the valuation it had last August, before Sebi announced its drastic TER changes. Investors’ hopes are undoubtedly running high with HDFC AMC."
344,2019-05-02,HDFC,"Top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and others offer FDs starting from 6 months up to above 5 yearsRemember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."
343,2019-05-02,HDFC,"Out of the entire pool of government bonds, MFs owned 0.64% in December 2018, down from 1.41% three months agoR. Sivakumar of Axis Mutual Fund said the switch to SDLs may also indicate the flow of funds favouring it

Mumbai: A few months after the liquidity crisis erupted in September, mutual funds switched a chunk of their sovereign bond holdings from central government securities to state development loans (SDLs), showed data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
According to the data, mutual funds held  ₹36,851 crore worth government securities (G-Sec) in December 2018, against  ₹78,999 crore in September 2018, and  ₹70,241 crore in December 2017. Out of the entire pool of government bonds, MFs owned 0.64% in December 2018, down from 1.41% three months ago. This data is typically released with a lag of four months. The December data is the latest available so far.
Following a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) last year, mutual funds with exposure to debt papers of the company had to write off a chunk of their holdings. This, and the ensuing defaults by some non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), had led to the liquidity crisis.
Interestingly, in the same period, mutual funds bought SDLs issued by state governments. They increased their holding in SDLs to  ₹32,833 crore in December 2018, from  ₹26,951 crore in September 2018. Of the total base of SDLs, mutual funds had a share of 1.23% in December, against 1.05% in September.
States raise money from the market through SDLs, which are dated securities issued through auctions similar to those conducted for those issued by the central government. Interest on SDLs is paid every six months and the principal is repaid on the maturity date. SDLs are backed by the sovereign and acknowledge the government’s debt obligation.
According to a treasurer at a mid-sized public sector bank, G-sec yields dropped in the last quarter of 2018, and liquidated some of their holdings. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. “The spread between the G-sec and SDLs is typically 50-100 basis points (bps), and while SDLs are not very liquid compared to G-secs, they have the same sovereign backing,"" the banker said, asking not to be identified.
The yield on the 10-year G-sec fell to 7.283% on 31 December, from 8.024% on 29 September.
R. Sivakumar, head-fixed income, Axis Mutual Fund said the switch to SDLs may also indicate the flow of funds favouring it.
The central bank’s holding of G-secs rose 205 bps between September and December 2018, as it conducted open market operations (OMO) to infuse liquidity. In December alone, the RBI had announced OMOs of  ₹50,000 crore.
Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer (debt) and head (products), Kotak AMC, attributed the uncertainty on the fiscal front to mutual funds reducing exposure to government securities. “Given that there is a question mark over the pace and quantum of OMOs, one is not sure of the demand levers. Besides, the FPI continues to be net negative sales in debt.""
Iyer added that until clarity emerges on the fiscal front, this situation may continue. “The market also needs clarity on the political outcome, which is a month away. Hence, near-term uncertainty may not abate anytime soon.""
Others said that if inflation measured on the consumer price index (CPI) pans out as per the RBI’s projections, room for further easing of monetary policy and liquidity should open up.
Murthy Nagarajan, head, fixed income, Tata Mutual Fund, said that supply of state government papers is the highest in the third and fourth quarter of the financial year.
“The supply tapers off in the first and second quarter of the financial year. The spread between government securities and state government papers tends to widen in the third and fourth quarter, and comes down when supply reduces in the first and second quarter,"" said Nagarajan.
Meanwhile, the central bank announced on Tuesday that it will inject  ₹25,000-crore liquidity through open market operations (OMOs) in May. The RBI also conducted its second successful dollar swap auction of $5 billion, receiving bids worth $18.65 billion, or more than three times what was on offer, besides injecting  ₹34,874 crore liquidity into the system.
To be sure, debt mutual funds witnessed outflows last December. Data from industry body, Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), showed that there was a net outflow of  ₹3,387.5 crore in debt mutual funds in December 2018, while there was a net inflow of  ₹12,939.70 crore in March."

340,2019-05-02,HDFC,"Parent Reliance Capital has announced its intention to sell its balance 43% stake in Reliance Nippon Life AMCWhile profit growth was impressive, investors seemed to be worried about the slower assets under management growth

Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd’s (RNAM’s) stock has slipped 5% in the last two trading sessions, despite the company clocking a steady increase in its margins and earnings.
The largest retail fund house saw its Ebitda margin for the March quarter increasing 10 percentage points year-on-year to 41.2% on lower costs. Profits surged 34.2%, showed its quarterly results released on Monday. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
While profit growth was impressive, investors seemed to be worried about the slower assets under management (AUM) growth. The company’s AUM in March 2019 decreased 4.6% over last year to  ₹2.34 trillion (see chart above). In contrast, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd’s AUM increased by 18% over the same period.
“RNAM’s funds are considerably exposed to the ADA Group (a few group companies were recently downgraded to ‘D’). As we have seen in the recent IL&FS fiasco, this might lead to redemption pressure in fixed-income schemes/stoppage of SIP flows, affecting RNAM’s revenue growth,"" said Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a note to clients.
Regulatory changes have also seen commission costs come off significantly in the last quarter, toabout  ₹63 crore, from  ₹103 crore in the year-ago quarter. That’s been one of the key reasons why the net profit looked up. From April 2019, the reduction in the total expense ratio on large funds will reduce revenue.
But the impact could be limited. “Management expects to pass on most of the TER cut (effective from April 2019) and does not expect the impact on profitability (PAT/ avg. AUM) to be more than 1.5-2 bps,"" said JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.
The market is also looking forward to a change in ownership, ever since parent Reliance Capital Ltd announced its intention to sell its remaining 43% stake in RNAM. Analysts say that a new promoter could boost the return metrics of the company. That could keep the stock stable for now. But pressures on the ADAG firms could be quite an overhang.

339,2019-05-03,HDFC,"It’s not a Lehman-like thing, resolution of liquidity issues will take another 12 to 18 months: Aditya PuriThe banking industry has made substantial progress in dealing with its non-performing loan problem, he says

Troubles among India’s non-bank financiers will persist for at least a year even if the danger of a full-blown financial crisis has passed, according to the head of the nation’s most valuable bank.
Tighter regulatory oversight and asset sales have staved off the worst of the problems afflicting India’s non-bank financial firms following last year’s defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., according to HDFC Bank Ltd.’s Managing Director Aditya Puri. Even so, it will be another 12 to 18 months before the liquidity issues in the wider sector are resolved, Puri added in an interview with Bloomberg in Mumbai on Thursday.
“It’s not a Lehman-like thing that comes and then there is contagion across the system,"" Puri said, referring to the US firm that collapsed a decade ago and plunged the global economy into a downturn. “The crisis is over, the problem remains.""
Last year’s defaults by IL&FS exposed fault lines among India’s shadow lenders, which had grown rapidly to account for a third of all new loans over the previous three years. Though the government’s decision to seize the company helped contain the crisis, a lingering credit crunch has led to reduced demand for goods like automobiles and triggered investor concerns about Indian mutual funds that hold debt issued by non-bank finance companies.
Shadow banks are still struggling to raise funds, including from the mutual funds which already hold about $46 billion of the sector’s debt, according to an estimate by Credit Suisse Group AG. Those that can tap the markets are paying about 30 basis points more than other top-rated corporates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
HDFC Bank had an exposure of $7 billion to non-bank finance companies and related firms as of December, compared with $11 billion for its nearest private-sector rival ICICI Bank Ltd., filings show. The exposure of the wider Indian banking industry was about $92 billion in March, according to an estimate from the ratings firm ICRA Ltd. Puri said HDFC Bank has no exposure to IL&FS.
Substantial Progress
Under Puri, HDFC Bank has also skirted India’s bad-loan crisis, which hurt many of the country’s other lenders. That has helped its shares outperform the broader banking index each year since 2014, boosting its market capitalization to more than double that of State Bank of India, the nation’s largest lender by assets.
Though India still has among the world’s worst stressed asset ratios, soured credit as a share of total loans is estimated to have shrunk to 10.3% by March from 10.8% in September, according to the central bank.
The banking industry has made “substantial progress"" in dealing with its non-performing loan problem, Puri said. He pointed to better recognition of soured debt, closer central bank inspections and more disciplined behavior by borrowers after the implementation of the nation’s new bankruptcy law.
This gives the government a window to add fresh capital into struggling state-run banks, Puri said. Government-controlled lenders account for about 90% of bad debt and Moody’s Investors Service estimates they will probably need some $3.5 billion to bridge capital needs this financial year, on top of the $28 billion the government has injected over the past two years.
For now though there is an adequate amount of money in the system to fund India’s economic growth, Puri said. “When new capital investment comes into the private sector, the demand could possibly be slightly more than what the capability is, by which time I hope they would have infused the capital.""

MUMBAI :
Private lender YES Bank Ltd has slipped three notches to 10th spot, in terms of market valuation, for the first time, as its shares slumped over 30% in the last four sessions after the bank reported a surprise net loss in its March quarter earnings.
YES Bank is now the 10th most valued bank from seventh earlier, slipping below market valuation of state-run lenders - Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank.
HDFC Bank Ltd is the most valued Indian bank with a market cap of  ₹6.34 trillion, followed by State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank with market cap of  ₹2.76 trillion and 2.68 trillion, respectively.
Data from BSE showed that Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) have a market capitalization of Rs.39,720 crore each. Shares of BoB traded at  ₹116.20 on BSE, down 2.31% from previous close, while those of PNB were down 1.03% at  ₹86.30. So far this year, BoB has declined 2.6%, while PNB has risen 9%.
Shares of YES Bank were down 5.3% at Rs.166.30 on Monday after rating agency ICRA downgraded its long-term ratings on the bank along with a negative outlook. Its market capitalization stood at Rs. 38,515.71 crore. The shares were also under pressure after BloombergQuint reported that the lender may see pain emerging from its exposure to the Anil Ambani Group companies. That exposure, according to information provided by the bank’s management in investor interactions held this week, could be close to  ₹13,000 crore
ICRA downgraded Yes Bank’s Tier 2, lower Tier 2, infrastructure bonds to AA- from AA, and cut upper Tier 2, Tier 1 notes to A+ from AA-, citing an increase in its lower-rated advances. ICRA also cited further weakening in the bank’s capital buffers following voluntary provisions and losses in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Last week, YES Bank reported a net loss of  ₹1,500 crore for Jan-Mar, led by elevated credit cost and a steep decline in non-interest income. The bank also reported a new stress book.
""New management will aim for full blown kitchen sinking along with realignment of its business towards more granular business with focus on retail segment. Shift in accounting policies for recognition of fee income will take a toll on medium term earnings. Indicated stressed book will keep credit cost higher. Also its immediate need on raising capital will be an overhang on the stock"", said IDBI Capital in a note.
Both BoB and PNB have not announced dates for releasing March quarter earnings. However 20 Bloomberg analysts expect BoB to report a profit of  ₹913 crore, while PNB is seen reporting a net profit of  ₹9.96 crore.
""We expect a steady performance from PSU banks (PSBs). PSU banks have been benefitted by the recapitalization by the Govt. as well as some marginal benefit from Employee Share purchase scheme (ESPS) as well, which has been another avenue to provide PSBs with capital. As a result, allowing most PSBs to show stable operating performance and also facilitate higher provisions, thereby keeping NPAs under check"", said brokerage firm Sharekhan in a 9 April note.
""However, hobbled with bad assets and constraints on capital, we don’t expect PSBs to be targeting too many growth avenues, which is why we believe their pricing power, and thereby margins are also likely to be tepid, keeping the outlook subdued for most of the PSBs"", a Sharekhan report added."
333,2019-05-09,HDFC,"With the latest purchase, L&T has managed to buy 6% in Mindtree from the open market and a 20% stake jointly held in Mindtree by Café Coffee Day founder VG Siddhartha and two CCD affiliate firmsL&T will also purchase an additional 15% from the open market and 31% in the open offer, beginning Tuesday

Mumbai: Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) has scooped up more shares of Mindtree Ltd on Thursday to raise its total ownership in the software services firm to 26%, two people aware of the transactions said, crossing the 25% mark that ensures L&T gets a board seat and the power to propose or block special resolutions.
Ever since L&T acquired a 20.32% stake in Mindtree from Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder V.G. Siddhartha and two of his affiliate firms, India’s largest engineering company has been buying up shares of Mindtree from the market, with a target of 15%. L&T has also announced an offer to buy 31% of Mindtree shares from public shareholders, starting Tuesday. If all share purchases go as planned, L&T will end up with more than 66% in Mindtree.
L&T bought an additional 1% of Mindtree shares on Thursday at a price of up to  ₹980 per share, the two people cited earlier said on condition of anonymity.
According to the two people, L&T bought the shares from mutual funds, alternative investment funds (AIFs), insurers and wealthy individuals. A final confirmation will be available when details of the deals are available on the exchange websites. The websites did reflect higher traded volume in the Mindtree counter, but further details are unavailable.
Mindtree investors that sold shares to L&T include White Oak Capital Management founded by former Goldman Sachs executive Prashant Khemka, according to one of the two people cited earlier. White Oak Capital had close to 1% in Mindtree, this person added.
Axis Capital is managing the open market purchase for L&T.
Emails sent to L&T, Mindtree and Axis Capital remained unanswered. When contacted on the phone, an L&T spokesperson declined to comment.
As of 31 March, AIFs held 1.49% and mutual funds 9.02% in Mindtree, while Enam Group co-founder Nemish Shah’s wife Rekha N. Shah held 1.67% and S. Janakiraman 1.52%.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, investors Enam Group and HDFC Life Insurance sold their 2.2% and 1% stakes, respectively, according to the first person. Akash Bhansali, who heads the investment venture at Enam, did not respond to messages sent by Mint on Wednesday. An HDFC Life spokesperson said, “As financial investors, we transact in various securities on a daily basis in the normal course of business and do not comment on specific transactions.""
Rekha Shah holds 1.67% and other Enam Group entities hold around 0.53% in Mindtree.
On 30 April, Siddhartha and two CCD affiliate firms, Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd and Coffee Day Trading Ltd, together sold around 20.32% to L&T for about  ₹3,200 crore.
On 18 April, L&T announced that buying at least 26% in Mindtree would be its first priority and critical for the engineering company’s overall aim of raising its stake to as much as 66.32% and gain management control. The  ₹10,700 crore deal is India’s first hostile takeover in the IT industry.
L&T began its open market purchase on 30 April.
“Irrespective of the amount of purchase in the upcoming open offer, L&T will continue to buy Mindtree shares from the open market. L&T plans to buy 9% more from the open market, which should be completed within the next two weeks, considering the market response so far,"" said the first person.
“With 26% stake, L&T can now demand board representation at Mindtree, irrespective of the amount of purchase in the proposed open offer,"" said the second person.
After L&T announced its open offer, Mindtree formed a committee of independent directors headed by Apurva Purohit. The committee has time till Friday to make a recommendation on the L&T offer price to Mindtree shareholders.
Mindtree founders, who together hold 13.32%, have been resisting L&T’s takeover bid.
With a 26% stake, L&T will be entitled to receive a special dividend of  ₹102 crore; if it succeeds in acquiring a total of 66.32% in Mindtree, the engineering firm will be entitled to a total dividend income of around  ₹260.5 crore. This is because Mindtree, while declaring its annual financial results on 18 April, announced a fat special dividend of  ₹20 a share and a final dividend of  ₹4 a share.
Apart from the special and final dividends, Mindtree announced an interim dividend of  ₹3 a share. The record date for the interim dividend was 27 April, but L&T is not entitled to receive this as it bought shares in Mindtree after that date. However, L&T will be eligible to receive the proposed special and final dividend if Mindtree shareholders approve the proposal at the annual meeting scheduled in July. If the proposal gets cleared, it will be Mindtree’s highest dividend payout since its inception two decades ago."

Over the last week, markets bore the brunt of escalating trade tensions between the US and China.
""The important question this week would be amongst the trio — US-China tiff, political outcome or quarterly results which one will dominate the markets and swing the bourses accordingly in their favour.

Top US and Chinese trade negotiators concluded the first of two days of talks on Thursday to rescue a trade deal that is close to collapsing as Washington prepares to go ahead with plans to hike tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods imported from China. Tension between Washington and Beijing has risen after a major setback in negotiations last week when China revised a draft deal and weakened commitments to meet US demands for trade reform.
US President Donald Trump responded by ordering a tariff hike, and China has said it would retaliate. The 10-month-old trade war has already cost companies in both countries billions of dollars.
Meanwhile, major companies that will announce March quarter earnings this week are HDFC, ITC, Vodafone Idea, Oriental Bank, IDBI Bank, Union Bank, and Indian Bank.

MUMBAI :
Pristine asset quality and stellar profit growth is almost a given when it comes to Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Ltd, and the mortgage lender didn’t disappoint in the March quarter.
The company reported a 27% jump in net profit for the March quarter, beating the Street’s estimates. It also reported enviable asset quality metrics as its bad loan ratios improved from a year before. Bad loans formed just 2.2% of its total loan book and the company continued to make provisions far higher than required by the regulator.
This was thanks to HDFC’s sensible move to focus on retail borrowers, even though margins are low here, compared with giving loans to developers and their allies.
Ergo, the over 1% gain in the stock in a weak market was due to the fact that there no unpleasant surprises from the mortgage lender. After all, its peers have reported troublesome asset quality and a deceleration in growth due to the slowdown in the real estate sector. The pain from developer financing is widespread among housing finance companies.
Over the last one year, the slowdown in real estate has deepened even as a liquidity crunch at financing companies has hurt real estate developers.
In this backdrop, HDFC has managed to maintain its 15% loan growth through its focus on its strengths which are retail borrowers. Since lending to developers has become fraught with risks, the lender has embraced lending to affordable housing in a big way on the retail side. During the year, 18% of HDFC’s total loan approvals were to customers from the economically weaker section and low income groups.
But the malaise in real estate is too deep and the liquidity problem too wide for even HDFC to completely escape it. Hence, the mortgage lender has seen its loan growth decelerate to a multi-quarter as its developer loan book shrank. In FY19, HDFC gave 85% of disbursals to retail customers and the rest to construction and lease rental firms. Developers didn’t get anything from it. To be sure, the slowdown is also due to a jump in sale of loans to HDFC Bank. “We believe that the gap in growth rates of AUMs and loans will narrow from mid-FY20 onwards as base of sell-downs normalise,"" said analysts at CLSA India Pvt. Ltd.
As the adjoining chart shows, the mortgage lender has seen a sharp drop its loan growth rate. That said, HDFC has managed to maintain its spreads, and margins improved slightly in the March quarter.
The company’s asset quality and reasonable loan growth buttress its valuations and the performances of its subsidiaries too add weight. The stock trades at a multiple of nearly four times its estimated book value for FY20."

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has initiated adjudication against HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd or HDFC AMC and Kotak Mutual Fund over the so-called Fixed Maturity Plan (FMP) woes. The FMPs of these asset management companies were impacted due to their investment in Essel Group papers forcing Kotak to hold back redemptions and HDFC to rollover the entire FMP.
HDFC in disclosure to stock exchanges said that it has received two show cause notices from Sebi on 10 May for violation of mutual fund regulations.
A spokesperson for Kotak did not reply to an email seeking comments.
As per two people directly aware of the developments, Sebi’s show cause notices to the two fund houses have cited violation of mutual fund regulations and investor protection.
“The maturity of the under lying papers of Essel group companies was more than the maturity of the FMP which is a violation of Sebi rules,"" said the first of the two people.
Two Essel Group companies, Konti Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt. Ltd and Edisons Utility Works Pvt. Ltd, failed to repay in full the investment of the FMPs.
The AMCs in January, which had exposure to Essel group papers, decided to not sell promoters’ pledged shares to recover their dues. Reliance mutual fund was one of the few AMCs which did not agree to this so-called standstill agreement and sold the Essel papers on 8 May.
To honour this agreement Kotak AMC decided to hold part of the payments that were due to mature on 8 April.
HDFC AMC on the other hand, ahead of the maturity date of 15 April, decided to roll over the FMPs that held the Essel paper by more than a year.
Due to holding back payments the maturity of the underlying paper invariably became higher than the maturity of the debt mutual fund. This is against the Sebi norms governing mutual funds.
“In case of Kotak the maturity of underlying paper has exceeded the debt fund by more than 30 days. In case of HDFC the maturity of underlying paper exceeded the debt fund by two days,"" said the second of the two people quoted above.
“Kotak also failed to take consent from investors before deciding to hold back part redemption,"" he added.
This is a fallout of fund managers investing in papers which are backed by pledged shares, popularly known as Loan against Shares (LAS). The fund industry as of January had an exposure of  ₹51,000 crore to such papers.
“This is a significant policy issue where Sebi will have to relook at mutual fund regulations. The foundation, for which investors invest in FMPs on one hand and the risks fund managers take by investing in assets which turn a bad investment in hindsight, will require balancing. Within Sebi limits concentration of portfolio in such assets is a business decision and tweaking of such limits with disclosures may be something Sebi may look at from policy view. The idea is to protect the sanctity of product and promise to unit holders."" said Sumit Agrawal of Regstreet Law Advisors & ex-Sebi official."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

316,2019-05-20,HDFC,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India."

Mumbai: The predicted victory of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections drove stocks of 40 companies to record highs on Monday. This included blue-chips, mid-caps, small-caps and penny stocks.
Some of the blue-chip stocks that hit all-time highs were Bajaj Finance Ltd (up 3.2%), DCB Bank Ltd, Federal Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd (both 3%), ICICI Bank Ltd (4.5%), Titan Co. Ltd (3.4%) and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (2.8%).
Among large-caps, Adani Enterprises Ltd jumped 27%, with the forecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s win and the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Morrison’s re-election is seen as a positive for the Adani group’s mining operations in Australia, as he is widely expected to ease restrictions on its mega coal mines in Queensland, facing protests over concerns of environmental impact.
“Adani group shares rallied on exit polls’ prediction that Narendra Modi-led BJP would come back to power. The rally was further fuelled by Australian poll results, which too augurs well for the business interests of Adani group,"" an analyst said on condition of anonymity. “We expect the positive momentum to continue in the coming trading session in view of the positive political development.""

Indian markets edged higher today, a day ahead of counting of votes in the general election, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to retain power. Exit polls that came out on Sunday after the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections ended showed Modi is set for a clear win. Markets have been on a bull run with both the NSE Nifty and the BSE Sensex gaining 6% in three sessions to Monday.
The Sensex closed 140 points higher 39,110 while Nifty settled at 11,737, up 0.25%. Financials led the markets higher, with ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and HDFC among top gainers.
IndusInd Bank shares surged 5% even though the lender reported a dip in net profit due to higher provisions. 
Tech Mahindra shares fell 3% after March-quarter profit dropped 7.4% and missed estimates. Shares of DHFL, one of India's biggest home loan lenders, fell 9%, after it stopped taking new deposits and blocked premature withdrawals following a credit rating downgrade.
However, analysts predict that the markets will quickly discount the election results. ""Going forward in the medium term...we expect the markets to consolidate post the election outcome as focus would shift back to fundamentals and global cues which have been volatile due to re-escalation of US-China trade tensions,"" said Jayant Manglik, president - retail distribution at Religare Broking.
Technically, the underlying trend remains up, says Sahaj Agrawal, head of research for derivatives at Kotak Securities. ""We remain structurally positive on the markets and expect the markets to trade with a positive bias post elections. We expect Nifty to test 12200-12500 on the higher side while meaningful support is seen at 11,400 levels,"" Agrawal said.

312,2019-05-23,HDFC,"""From here onwards focus will shift to priorities in public expenditure, and economic reforms,” said Sachin Relekar, CIO (Equities) at LIC Mutual FundSome fund managers have advocated taking a long term view

Even as the Sensex rallied to touch the 40,000 mark, investment professionals and wealth managers have urged investors to be cautious even while recognizing benefits of a stable government. ""Markets were looking for stability, continuity and strong leadership rather than a fractured mandate - this has led to the new high,"" said B Gopkumar, ED and CEO, Reliance Securities. However other experts sounded a more cautious note.“Valuation wise Nifty at 12,000 trades at around 19x on forward PE basis. Hence we see limited upside potential in the Nifty in the near future. Part of the passive money that has come by way of ETFs in the last three months could move out if Nifty goes above 12,000 level,"" said Rusmik Oza, Head of Fundamental Research, Kotak Securities Ltd. Experts noted that even on a trailing basis, the markets trade at relatively high valuations. “The Nifty trailing PE is close to 29 and this is not a cheap market. There is a trade war internationally between the US and China,"" said Ankur Maheshwari, CEO, Equirus Wealth. ""The Nifty has risen from the recent lows of 11100 odd after the exit polls. To that extent a large part of the election results is already priced in."" said Deepak Jasani, Head, Retail Research, HDFC Securities.
Some fund managers have advocated taking a long term view. “Given the macro economic indicators, earnings reported and management commentary and valuation, it’s prudent to take a longer term view of the investment opportunity. From here onwards focus will shift to priorities in public expenditure, and economic reforms,"" said Sachin Relekar, Chief Investment Officer (Equities) at LIC Mutual Fund. Experts also identified market segments that hold potential even in relatively expensive scenarios. “We see more value and upside in the Mid and Small Cap space hereon. With NDA coming back into power we can expect local investors to take comfort in the Mid and Small cap space with a longer 2-3 year horizon and inflows could resume in them,"" said Oza. “Mid and small caps tend to rally in a bullish phase and investors should have some exposure to them,"" said Maheshwari.
Fund Managers have also identified areas of policy reforms that are needed to drive investor returns. “Not fixing the banking sector NPA woes early on perhaps was a big miss. Aggressive recapitalization of banks should have been done early on to ensure smooth credit flow. We lost a lot of time in multitude of regulations before eventually drafting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code Law. Even under IBC, progress has been patchy,"" said Anand Radhakrishnan, Chief Investment Officer (Equities), Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd. He also pointed to the housing sector as the key area for policy change in the next 5 years. “If we have to single out one area that requires a big thrust and will have wider impact on the Economy, it would be Housing sector. The government should give attractive tax benefits for home buyers and encourage revival of Housing sector demand at the earliest."""
311,2019-05-23,HDFC,"Sensex also hit 40,000 for the first time as the early leads suggested a clear BJP victoryThe new government should definitely work something out in terms of taxation and remove the 10% LTCG tax, says financial advisor

With clear trend suggesting the NDA-II forming the government, many hope that the government will review the unpopular long term capital gains tax on equity that it introduced in Budget 2018. Long term capital gains of over  ₹1 lakh in a financial year are taxable at a flat rate of 10%.
“The new government should definitely work something out in terms of taxation and remove the 10% LTCG tax. You are not giving that bonus or appreciation to someone who is investing into the growth of the country,"" said Alpana Singh (40), a Lucknow-based mutual fund distributor and financial advisor.
29-year-old Gautam Nimesh, a software developer with SAP Labs in Bangalore echoes the sentiment. “Tax on LTCG is one of the negative things that the government had in its last term and I feel they should remove it,"" he said.
But with the BJP getting a clear majority, and a stable government in place, people are hopeful that their investments will grow in the future. “With a stable government in place, new policies will also come in, which will further boost the industries and economy, and in turn improve the investments,"" said Nimesh. Singh, who has 95% of her assets in equity, also feels her investments will get better because of a stable government in place. “The new government will certainly look at key issue resolution like ease of doing business, and they are looking to grow and bring inflation also down. I am a very aggressive investor; so the sentiment right now is extremely positive and I see a stable government coming in as a very positive thing,"" said Singh.
Sensex also hit 40,000 for the first time as the early leads suggested a clear BJP victory. However, many want to wait and watch to see how the election rally settled. Bangalore-based Harshit Dravid (32), senior manager-business development at Flipkart, who belongs to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency Varanasi said that he will not go by the current market rally euphoria and wait and see what new policies the government makes before making any new investments. “If I talk about the stock decisions, it will mostly be in large-caps. Keeping the election euphoria aside, I will actually wait for some actual reforms and some signals at the sector-level to come in before I choose my small-cap and mid-cap stocks. This euphoria and market rally may be short-lived if structural reforms are not brought in place. Without having a fundamental confidence in place or any healthy indicators of growth, I won’t go by euphoria and stick to my large-cap picks,"" said Dravid.
The government’s inability at creating jobs is also one of the things that people hope the government will prioritize. “Government also knows its weak points right now and jobs have been one of them. So whatever they have missed in the last five years, they should definitely look at improving on that front now,"" said Nimesh. Dravid also hopes the BJP government, who is coming back to power, in its second terms makes job creation a priority. “I hope the top-most priority of the government is to create more jobs. After the GST and demonetization shock, I hope the small and mid-level companies should pick up now. If the government looks at improving the stability of these companies, jobs should a result of that. Hopefully creating more government jobs should also help,"" said Dravid.
While the equity market performance is a hit now, many don’t expect much appreciation in real estate despite whatever government comes in. “The builders who are coming up with luxurious housing projects, I don’t expect them do well. Though there is focus on affordable housing from the government, I will stay away from it overall,"" said Singh. Dravid said that if at all he has to look at real estate investments, he would probably invest in his hometown in Varanasi as there is some price appreciation there. “As far as metro cities are concerned, I would probably stay away as there could probably be a correction also as there is lot of unsold inventory. So i would stay away from investing in real estate in metro cities,"" said Dravid."

NEW DELHI :
Mortgage lender HDFC has sold 6.10 % stake in its subsidiary Gruh Finance, to comply with the RBI requirement for facilitating the proposed merger of the housing finance arm with Bandhan Bank.
The sale was carried out through stock exchanges at the prevailing market price.
The average price was  ₹260.07 apiece for shares sold on March 28 and  ₹310.126 apiece for shares sold on Friday (May 24), HDFC said in a regulatory filing.
The 6.10% stake sold represents 4,47,86,774 equity shares of Gruh.
Break-up wise, HDFC had sold 1,22,00,000 shares (1.66%) in March and the balance 3,25,86,774 shares (4.44%) were sold on Friday.
Thus, HDFC has mopped up  ₹1,327.89 crore by selling the stake in Gruh Finance.
""The Corporation (HDFC) being a shareholder of Gruh is entitled to 14.96 per cent of post-amalgamation paid-up capital of Bandhan, based on the share exchange ratio. However, the RBI has directed the Corporation to hold 9.9 per cent or less of the paid-up capital of Bandhan, post the merger.
""In view of this, the Corporation is required to sell such number of shares in Gruh so as to be entitled to 9.9 per cent of the post amalgamation paid up capital of Bandhan,"" HDFC said.
Shares of HDFC closed 0.56% higher at  ₹2,127.50 apiece on the BSE, while Gruh Finance was down 4.42% at  ₹313.30."
309,2019-05-25,HDFC,"The number of shares you hold increases. “Shares held go up by the split numberStock split is a corporate action in which a company’s shares increase but the market cap remains the same

Stock split is a corporate action in which a company’s shares increase but the market cap remains the same. “Stock split is splitting of shares by a certain denomination like two, three and four, which increases the total outstanding shares by two times, three times and so on. The share’s value declines by the corresponding denominator, but the market capitalisation remains the same,"" said Navin Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities. The existing shares of the company are split but the market value of each share falls, keeping the total value of equity capital the same, but changing the number of shares.
WHY IS IT DONE?
The number of shares you hold increases. “Shares held go up by the split number. So if one is holding 100 shares of a company and the company announces 1:10 split, the number of shares held goes up by 1,000 shares,"" said Kulkarni. Companies go for a stock split to improve the liquidity of shares and also to make it more accessible for retail investors. It expands the customer base for the company. “Investors tend to avoid highmarket value stocks while institutional investors avoid low liquidity stocks. Thus, after stock split, firms see improvement in demand for stock,"" said Sanjeev Hota, head of research, Sharekhan.
THE MATH
Gujarat Gas had 14 crore shares and it announced a stock split into  ₹2 per share from  ₹10 per share. The number of shares with investors increased in 5:1 ratio (five shares for every share held) with outstanding shares at 69 crore, said Hota. But the portfolio value remained unchanged as price also reduced in the split ratio. “If you hold 100 shares in Gujarat Gas at  ₹717 per share, the value of portfolio is at  ₹71,700. After the split from face value of  ₹10 to  ₹2, you hold 500 shares of Gujarat Gas. Thus, the stock price also got adjusted and reduced to  ₹143 per share in January from  ₹717,"" Hota added."

""FASTags are now available on e-commerce platform Amazon...The online NHAI FASTag has been conceived in a DIY (Do-It-Yourself) concept wherein a customer can self-activate it by entering customer and vehicle details in My FASTag mobile app. Thereafter, the customer will have to link the tag to an existing bank account of his/her choice,"" the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways said in a statement.
Currently, the account linking facility is available for seven member banks -- SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Paytm Payments Bank and Equitas Small Finance Bank.
FASTags were launched by the Indian Highways Management Company Limited (IHMCL), promoted by NHAI, in January 2019.
""NHAI FASTag is a 'bank-neutral' FASTag i.e. no bank is pre-assigned to the FASTag at the time of purchase by customer from a Point-of-Sale or Online and offers the flexibility to customer to link the FASTag with their existing bank account by using My FASTag Mobile app, currently available on Google Play Store,"" the statement added.
It said IHMCL is focused on enhancing the user experience of FASTag customers and is constantly working on new strategies to ensure efficient tolling experience.
""FASTag is also available at selected petrol pumps in Delhi NCR and identified Common Service Centers (CSCs) and we are also in process of expanding the outreach to other Metros cities.
""This online sale initiative is an important achievement for IHMCL and will ensure easy availability of FASTag at the doorsteps of the customers,"" the ministry added.
FASTags are also being issued by 22 certified banks at places like National Highways toll plazas and selected bank branches. However, these FASTags do not offer customers the option for linking with a bank account of his/her choice.
""The online availability of NHAI FASTag by IHMCL will eventually help enhanced adoption of FASTag programme by increasing user convenience and offering seamless digital payments of toll and thereby saving time, money and fuel,"" the statement said.
Further, the digital payments of toll shall enhance transparency and promote cashless transactions, converting India into less-cash society supporting the Digital India Programme, it added.

Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd’s shares have declined by 14% so far this calendar year. On the other hand, the Nifty 200 index has increased by 7.4%. In general, sentiments for consumer stocks haven’t been the best thanks to the demand slowdown firms are experiencing.
In particular for Colgate-Palmolive, one of the worries has been the slow erosion in its toothpaste market share over the years. On that front, the company has told analysts after its March quarter results were published that its toothpaste volume market share has stabilized at about 52.5%. The key positive is that market share has now begun to stabilize over the half-year ended March 2019, wrote analysts from HDFC Securities Institutional Research in a report on 28 May. Needless to say, hereon, investors will watch improvement in the measure closely.
Meanwhile, the company, famous for its Colgate brand of toothpastes and other oral care products, coughed up somewhat lacklustre numbers for the March quarter. Revenue increased by 5.7% over the same period last year to  ₹1,154 crore. This was largely driven by domestic volumes, grew by 5%. While this may not appear all that bad considering volume growth in the March 2018 quarter was 4%, the volume growth for the March 2019 quarter isn’t particularly impressive. For perspective: volume growth for the December quarter was 7% on a relatively higher growth in the base December 2017 quarter.
For the March quarter, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin declined by nearly 130 basis points to about 27%.
Raw material costs increased at a relatively faster pace dragging margins down. A basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Meanwhile, despite the recent underperformance in the Colgate-Palmolive stock, it’s not as if valuations are mouth-watering. Currently, the shares trade at 38 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data.
As such, investors should track market share gains and volume growth. “We don’t expect the company to deliver high-single digit to low double-digit volume growth unless it begins to gain significant market share,"" said HDFC Securities.
Analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a report on 27 May, “While management is now targeting to regain lost shares, revenue growth trajectory in the near-term could still remain subdued given emerging weakness in demand environment."""

304,2019-06-03,HDFC,"During March, transactions hit a record high of 799.54 million worth  ₹1.33 lakh croreCurrently, 143 banks are live on UPI, down from 144 in April

After hitting a record high in March, payment transactions via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) declined second time in a row in May. Last month, as many as 733.54 million transactions were clocked across its various platforms, down 6% from April, according to data from National Payments Corp. of India.
Despite a slowdown in volume, value of such transactions continued to expand. Data showed that transactions worth  ₹1.53 lakh crore were made, up 7.3% from April.
During March, transactions hit a record high of 799.54 million worth  ₹1.33 lakh crore, up from 93,000 transactions when it was launched close to three years ago. UPI’s growth has more or less been consistent since then, both in terms of value and volume.
“In case of smaller banks across the country and regional rural banks, the UPI adoption is still happening in a big way and hence we have been witnessing growth in both volumes and value,"" Mandar Agashe, Founder and Vice Chairman of payments solution provider Sarvatra Technologies said. “The existing user base of customers is now opting for higher value and more frequent transactions, instead of smaller value transactions.""
Currently, 143 banks are live on UPI, down from 144 in April.
UPI allows users to transfer money across multiple bank accounts on a real-time basis, without putting out details of the beneficiary’s bank account. Funds can be immediately transferred through one’s mobile phone 24x7 and 365 days, regardless of the bank’s working hours. The payments system was developed by the NPCI, which is an umbrella organisation for all retail payments in the country.
While the pilot was launched in April, 2016, banks started uploading their UPI-enabled apps four months later. UPI gained momentum after Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the UPI-based, Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM) app, in December 2016, soon after he announced the massive exercise to scrap  ₹500 and  ₹1,000 notes in November 2016.
The growing popularity of UPI can be attributed to its simple, safe, cost-effective and mobile-based payment system. Transactions via UPI have surpassed mobile wallet payments in terms of volume of transactions as well as value.
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), payment systems such as UPI and Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) are likely to register average annualised growth of over 100% by 2021.
With an aim of a less-cash society, the banking regulator in May announced the vision for payments in India during the three-year time period of 2019-2021, which will enable safe, secure, accessible and affordable payment system. The idea is also to provide more payment options to the population that has been untouched by payment systems. It expects digital transactions to quadruple to 8,707 crore in December 2021 from 2,069 crore in December 2018."
303,2019-06-03,HDFC,"HDFC Life Sanchay Plus bundles life insurance with guaranteed maturity benefitsThe product caters to the need of guaranteed income for various milestones in life which is ideal for risk-averse individuals but could also be considered by aggressive investors

A guaranteed return product never goes out of flavour, especially if it is from the stable of life insurance companies. One such guaranteed plan that was launched by HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd sometime back is called HDFC Life Sanchay Plus. In insurance parlance, guaranteed plans are called non-participating products as they guarantee the investment benefit upfront. HDFC Life Sanchay Plus bundles life insurance with guaranteed maturity benefits that you can choose to take either as a lump sum at the end of the policy term, or as periodic income for a certain number of years. Here are the details of the policy.
What do you get?
Sanchay Plus is an insurance-cum-investment plan that guarantees investment return upfront. Depending on factors such as age, premium and the premium payment term you chose, the policy promises a guaranteed payback at the end of the term. The policy designs this payback in four variants.
The first pays you a lump sum at the end of the policy term. The corpus is the sum of all premiums paid plus guaranteed accruals that take place towards the end of the premium payment term. These additions depend on your age and the premium payment term chosen.
The second version pays an annual income after the term for a certain number of years. The third version gives you annual income for life (till the policyholder is 99 years); the entry age, however, in this case is 50 years. The last version offers annual payment for longer tenures of 25-30 years. The last two options also return the premiums. The payouts are defined as a percentage of the annual premium and it varies as per the options chosen, age and term.
In terms of insurance benefit, on death of the policyholder during the term, the policy will pay the higher of 10 times the annual premium or 105% of the total premium paid or the guaranteed sum assured promised on maturity or death in addition to guaranteed accruals in the first option. In the case of periodic payout option, the death benefit would be the higher of the options listed above, but this list includes premium accumulated at a rate of 5% per annum. “We offer a slightly higher benefit if you buy this plan online. The benefits go up by 3% so the net return from the product will increase by 15-20 basis points,"" said Chinmay Bade, vice-president, products, HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
How does it work?
According to the illustration mentioned in the brochure, if a 30-year-old chooses the first option, then for an annual premium of  ₹1 lakh and for a policy term of 20 years and premium payment term of 10 years, the guaranteed sum on maturity will come to  ₹10 lakh. The total accrued additions for this age group over the given premium payment term will be  ₹1,400 per  ₹1,000 sum assured on maturity. This would come to a total of  ₹14 lakh. The maturity corpus, hence, would come to  ₹24 lakh, which is a return of 5.72%.
In the second variant, for the same annual premium and age, but for a policy term of 13 years and premium payment term of 12 years, the policy will pay a guaranteed income that’s 225% of the annual premium from the end of the 14th year for 12 years. In this case, the annual payout will come to  ₹2.25 lakh every year, and the net return is about 5.96%.
For the third variant, which works like a whole-life plan, the age at entry is 50 years. Again for an annual premium of  ₹1 lakh, for a 50-year-old and for a policy term of 11 years and premium payment term of 10 years, the guaranteed payout till age 99 years will come to 100% of the annual premium which is  ₹1 lakh per annum. Plus, at the end of the payout term or when the policyholder is 99 years of age, the policy will return  ₹10 lakh. The internal rate of return in this case will come to 6.37%. The net return is similar for the fourth variant.
Should you buy?
Firstly, compared to other guaranteed products from the stable of life insurance companies, this product offers one of the highest guaranteed rates of return, making it a top-notch product in the space.
According to Bade, the product caters to the need of guaranteed income for various milestones in life which is ideal for risk-averse individuals but could also be considered by aggressive investors. “Individuals who invest in high-risk instruments can use this as a secured instrument where the interest rate risk can be transferred to an insurance company,"" he added. Suresh Sadagopan, founder, Ladder 7 Financial Advisories, said long-term income options can be looked into as one of the products in one’s retirement portfolio as they offer tax-free returns.
But with so many benefits packed into one policy, the product can be difficult to understand.
Before you decide if long-term guaranteed products should be a part of your portfolio, you need to understand a few things. Shyam Sekhar, chief executive officer, iThought, said the rate of return sounds good at the moment because we are in a benign inflation regime—the consumer price inflation is at 2.92%—however, when inflation increases, a rate of 6% may not be great. “I don’t recommend locking into long-term guaranteed products because they work when inflation is low. Investing in Public Provident Fund, in comparison, is better because it mirrors the interest rate trend and gives above-inflation rate of return,"" he added.
Remember that guaranteed returns come to you only if you stay the course. Even in this case, if you surrender the product mid-way, you will have to let go of your insurance cover, though bundled plans don’t offer a great amount of cover.
A very risk averse investor who buys insurance polices for safety of capital, may consider this plan."
302,2019-06-05,HDFC,"The stock trades at an EV/Ebitda multiple of almost 32 times, as per HDFC Securities’ estimates for fiscal year 2020High valuations apart, operating performance hasn’t kept pace lately either

Lemon Tree Hotels Ltd operates in the so-called mid-priced segment, but its valuations are of the premium variety. The stock trades at an EV/Ebitda multiple of almost 32 times, according to HDFC Securities Institutional Research’s estimates for FY20. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
High valuations apart, operating performance hasn’t kept pace lately either. The company’s March quarter results were disappointing. Average daily rates (ADRs) realized on its hotel rooms increased only 4% year-on-year, missing Street expectations. For perspective: ADRs had increased by 8.5% year-on-year for the nine months ended December.
The hotel chain suffered due to the overall slowdown in consumption in the economy. Secondly, the collapse of Jet Airways (India) Ltd meant higher airfares, adversely affecting passenger traffic volumes. Plus, there was some softness in corporate travel in the run-up to the general elections. Despite this, Lemon Tree managed to improve its occupancy rates marginally to 77.6%. A basis point is 0.01%.
But this evidently came at the cost of realizations, which is reflected in the drop in ADR growth rates.
Overall, the company’s revenue increased by 14% to  ₹150 crore, while pre-tax and one-time profit rose at a slightly slower pace of 12.6% to around  ₹15 crore.
Kotak Institutional Equities has revised downwards earnings for FY20 by 11%, though it added that inclusion of new projects in the management portfolio as well as higher ADRs for Mumbai properties leads to upward revision of 14% in FY21 earnings.
The company said its Pune property, launched at the end of the March quarter, should reach steady state over the next few quarters. It is also expected to launch a 303-room Mumbai hotel in June this year. “We have a large supply of high value inventory getting operationalized in demand dense regions with high occupancies which will help augment our ADRs,"" said Lemon Tree in its presentation.
As on 15 May, Lemon Tree had a portfolio of 5,525 rooms across 56 hotels. Hereon, investors will watch for improvement in ADRs closely. Until that happens, it is likely that valuations would remain in check especially given that they are already pricey. Plus, they also need to keep an eye on the impact on margins caused by the addition of new properties."
301,2019-06-05,HDFC,"Top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and others offer fixed deposits (FDs) starting from 6 months up to above 5 yearsRemember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures.

MUMBAI :
When city-based financial planner Melvin Joseph, now 52, started working 25 years ago, he had made up his mind that he would not buy a property. “Immediately after my wedding, I got transferred from my home town in Kerala to a hill station while working for an insurance company. Since then, I have always stayed on rent as I knew I would be changing cities owing to my work profile,"" says Joseph. In the past 25 years, he has shifted multiple cities across Kerala and Tamil Nadu, before winding up in Mumbai. Not owning a property has actually given him the freedom to explore his career without any restrictions, says Joseph. “Had I purchased a house in Kerala 25 years ago, then my career would have been limited, as I would be thinking about my real estate investment and would have been locked into an EMI [equated monthly instalment],"" he says.
Unlike Joesph, who was clear about his decision, majority of salaried individuals, at some point or the other, have to tackle this common dilemma—to buy a house or rent one. Once you keep your emotions aside, it gets easier to decide this. Here are some key questions you need to ask yourself to make an informed decision on property for self occupancy:
PLAN TO LIVE IN THE CURRENT LOCATION FOREVER?
Today, most individuals tend to change cities for better opportunities. “Don’t purchase a house in the early part of your career if you are likely to move cities or if there is no job certainty,"" says Joseph. Real estate is an illiquid asset and you also can’t predict the growth on it. Plans to sell and buy properties at your convenience may not work. “With the need for flexibility being paramount in careers and the requirement to reskill at multiple stages, the flexibility of renting and not having EMIs can be very advantageous,"" says Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house if you don’t plan to live in the city for long.
CAN YOU AFFORD IT?
Real estate is an expensive asset. In case of salaried individuals, a house is likely to be the most expensive buy. Hence, you need to ask yourself if you can afford to buy a property. “A house requires a huge amount of capital and for most of us it entails taking a loan. Buying a house to live may make sense if you are going to be in the city for long, travel time to work place is less and have at least 25% of the amount available as down payment,"" says financial planner Deepali Sen.
Verdict: If the rent is 1-2% of the property value and EMI is likely to be 1.5 times above monthly rent, stay on rent.
SETTLE FOR A SMALL HOUSE?
To woo homebuyers amid high prices, developers reduce the size of the property to try and fit the house in your budget. But do you actually want to live in it? Besides location and affordability, you also need to factor in the property size. Just because you can afford only 280 sqft for  ₹1 crore in Mumbai, you shouldn’t lock yourself in. Similarly, just because you fancy a big house, you shouldn’t go for it if you can’t afford it.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house which doesn’t fit your requirement.
CAN YOU REPAY THE LOAN?
Remember that home loans are of longer duration and are large ticket-size loans. And you should have the long-term ability to service these loans. You have to make sure your home loan repayment is cushioned against job loss, loss of income due to medical emergency, and any other unforeseen circumstances.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house if you don’t have the ability to repay your loan.
CAN YOU MEET OTHER GOALS?
Remember, buying a house is only one of the financial goals. You will also have other goals to fulfil, such as higher education, child’s education, buying a car, travel plan and retirement. You have to ensure you are able to meet these goals too. “You should think of buying a house without hurting your lifestyle and your other goals.
Usually, a bigger home loan means the future cash flow gets used up for at least two decades. This leaves little room for other key goals,"" says Sen.
Verdict: Buy a house only if it doesn’t hurt your lifestyle and other goals."
297,2019-06-10,HDFC,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

MUMBAI :
The largest private sector lender HDFC Bank has decided to begin a global search to find a successor to the founding-chief executive Aditya Puri, who retires in October 2020.
Meanwhile, Puri, the managing director and chief executive since 1994 when the bank was set up, has seen a whopping 41% increase in total remuneration in FY19 to  ₹13.67 crore.
""The nomination and remuneration committee of the board will constitute a search committee to undertake a global search of both internal and external candidates,"" the second largest bank said in FY19 annual report.
Puri turns 70 next year and has been instrumental in getting the bank to its current stature as one of the most valued banks globally in terms of price to earnings ratio. There are reports that Puri, an ex-Citibanker, may continue as the non-executive chairman post retirement.
His salary grew to  ₹10.73 crore from  ₹7.26 crore in the previous fiscal, while the value of his perquisites grew to  ₹2.26 crore from  ₹1.82 crore.
Stock options exercised by Puri amounted to  ₹42.20 crore as against  ₹31.41 crore, as per the annual report.
Puri's long-time colleague and deputy managing director Paresh Sukthankar, who left office last November in a hurry citing ""personal reasons"", drew a salary of  ₹6.33 crore during the year as against  ₹5.30 crore in FY18.
Sukthankar exercised  ₹137.46 crore worth of stock options during the year, up from  ₹20.60 crore.
However, the median remuneration increase per employee of the bank stood at 10.31 percent, which is marginally down from 11.17% in the previous fiscal.
There was a big jump in the overall employee base to 98,061 in the year, up from 88,253. It can be noted that the lender made headlines a few years ago for a decline in staffing as it adopted more and more technology.
Puri's salary was 248 times higher than the average employee salary in FY19, which is a jump from FY18, when his salary was 209 times higher.
The bank's chairperson Shyamala Gopinath said FY19 was a ""challenging"" year for the economy but said bank is ""well- poised"" to tap the opportunities of what is still an under- penetrated market by leveraging its strong balance-sheet and retail franchise. The bank will focus on customer focus, operational excellence, product leadership, people and sustainability, she added.
Following the RBI order asking its regulated entities not to engage with SR Batliboi & Co as statutory auditors, the bank has appointed MSKA Associates as its statutory auditors for three fiscals starting FY20.

Inflows into Indian equity mutual funds in May rebounded from the smallest in 31 months as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comfortable electoral win spurred appetite for risk assets.
They took in 54.1 billion rupees ($778 million), according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. That’s an increase from 46.1 billion rupees that the funds received in April, the least since September 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

That Life Insurance Corporation of (LIC) India is losing market share to private insurers hand over fist over the last several years is well known.
The insurance behemoth’s market share in adjusted individual business premium was 42.4% in May, a decline from the previous month.
Analysts at Kotak Securities noted that LIC reported 3% decline in retail annualised premium equivalent.
But the battle within the private sector life insurance pie is getting interesting with smaller players gaining heft. The latest monthly business data from the insurance regulator shows that smaller insurance players such as India First Life Insurance, Canara HSBC Life Insurance and Tata AIA Life Insurance have grown exponentially in the month of May.
Of course, a low base has contributed to the high percentage growth. Even so, Tata AIA Life has managed to garner a higher share in the market. “A low base and focus on ULIPs coupled with moderate appetite for equity investments were the likely reasons,"" said analysts at Kotak Securities.
That said, the top three insurers—SBI Life Insurance Co, HDFC Standard Life and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance still hold a lion’s share of the private sector life insurance market.
ICICI PruLife has seen its annualised premium equivalent (APE) growth collapse over the last several months. This stems from the change in approach by the management after the life insurer’s leadership change last year.
ICICI PruLife has consciously focussed on small ticket sized policies and begun to stay away from selling bulky products. As are result, its market share has come down marginally while the growth rate of its retail portfolio was a mere 1% in May.
Rival HDFC Standard Life has reported a surge in growth to 59% in May for retail APE. Even SBI Life Insurance Co saw its retail APE growth surge to 37%.
LIC, however, continues to dwarf others in group business segment with a market share of over 80%."

290,2019-06-13,HDFC,"The special fund will invest in upcoming and completed projectsThe fund will focus on mid-market and affordable projects where homes are priced at  ₹45-60 lakh

HDFC Property Fund has hit the road to raise a $500-million special situations fund, which will invest in residential projects, both under development as well as buyout projects with ready, unsold inventory at a discount, a person familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity.
This is an offshore fund, which will offer long-term, semi-equity to projects in the top seven cities, and to smaller property markets such as Bhopal and Indore. The focus, as is the case with most residential investors today, will be on mid-market and affordable housing projects, where homes are priced at  ₹45-60 lakh.
Deal sizes will vary from  ₹75-80 crore in smaller cities and  ₹250-300 crore in the metros. The projects’ profile will vary from regular-sized housing projects to townships. The fund is expected to be raised this year itself.
A couple of prominent financial institutions are expected to come in as anchor investors in the fund.
Fund-raising has been a challenge for many alternative investment funds (AIF) in India, particularly for residential projects, given that home sales have seen a prolonged slump, and prices have been stagnant for a few years now. Limited partners (LP), or investors, who back these funds have been wary of the road ahead for the residential sector, even as the commercial office space has performed rather well.
“This time, the fund will focus on brownfield developments where the developer can’t service debt, but also on projects, with unsold, ready inventory, which can be bought at a discount. The fund can wait for 2-3 years, and then sell the inventory,"" the person added.
The other strategy HDFC may explore is to go the rental way, and put some of the unsold, ready-to-live in homes on rent and generate annuity income.
This will be HDFC Property’s third offshore fund after raising a $750-million fund in 2007-08, and a $350-million fund in 2014-15.
HDFC Property Fund’s other focus will be to complete the remaining 4-5 exits from its previous fund, and return around  ₹2,600 crore to its investors.
In March 2018, ASK Property Investment Advisors had raised a  ₹900-crore ASK Real Estate Special Situations Fund (ARESSF) for under-construction housing projects, which were either stuck due to sluggish demand or the developer’s inability to complete the project due to lack of capital.
The investor is currently deploying capital both from the special situations fund as well as the Real Estate Special Opportunities Fund of around  ₹1,400 crore that it had raised in 2016.
Amit Bhagat, CEO and managing director, ASK Property Investment Advisors, said there are two kinds of investment opportunities for a special situations fund in the market today. “There are weaker developers surrendering to stronger players in certain projects where we can come in, or in projects where the developer is good, but has taken debt and that can be replaced with our flexible capital,"" he added."

284,2019-06-17,HDFC,"Investors are like doctors and a small cut on the balance sheet would prompt them to check for trouble elsewhereWith their trust on asset quality blown by Yes Bank Ltd recently, investors are not willing to bestow faith on IndusInd Bank yet

There were pristinely priced private sector bank stocks and then there was IndusInd Bank Ltd.
Just about a year back, the lender’s stock was priced to perfection, and a darling of both foreign and domestic investors. At that time, it traded at nearly four times its estimated book value for FY19, which was higher than larger-sized HDFC Bank Ltd. The latter, seen as the benchmark for the sector, traded at 3.5 times FY19 book value then.
But IndusInd Bank has fallen out of favour now. Its shares have lost more than 28% in the past year and the lender now trades at a far more modest valuation multiple of 2.7 times estimated book value for FY20. In comparison, HDFC Bank trades at 3.9 times its estimated FY20 book value.
Some analysts see more downside. Last week, UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd downgraded IndusInd Bank to sell from neutral, and even cut its target price by a steep 17%. The step by UBS comes a month after the bank reported one of its worst performances in the March quarter. Its exposure to stressed infra financier, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), had caused a 62% drop in net profit.
Investors are like doctors and a small cut on the balance sheet would prompt them to check for incipient trouble elsewhere on the books.
In IndusInd Bank’s case, UBS found out that the lender could be at risk given its retail deposits are just 20% of its external liabilities. “It is a structural issue and often manifests in credit quality surprises,"" the firm said in its note.
UBS was also bothered by the fact that 1.9% of the lender’s loan book comprises loans to conglomerates that are no longer able to pay back lenders.
The bank’s chief Romesh Sobti said the lender has provided for all possible stress in the March quarter.
With their trust on asset quality blown by Yes Bank Ltd recently, investors are not willing to bestow faith on IndusInd Bank yet.
Ergo, the question asked is whether there are more skeletons in the bank’s closet. IndusInd Bank’s total fund-based exposure to non-bank lenders including housing finance companies is 4.38% as of March. This could be a potential pain point as well.
Since credit costs are going to be high, the bank no longer deserves a lofty premium on its stock, according to analysts. Analysts at JM Financial noted that much of the bad news is already priced in the stock and the management has assured investors on earnings. To be sure, the stock still has numerous buy ratings, according to Bloomberg data.
That said, some analysts are concerned that the current valuations too could be challenged, depending on how slippages pan out."
285,2019-06-17,HDFC,"Nifty earnings touch  ₹400.69 per share as rural stress, liquidity shortage and weak pick-up in capex cycle impact firmsAn across the board annual drop in margins largely due to input cost was disappointing

Corporate earnings continued to disappoint, dashing hopes of a much-awaited recovery with Nifty earnings for the March quarter touching a five-quarter low of  ₹400.69 per share. The divergence between estimates and actual earnings per share (EPS) has been in the range of 32-40% in the past three quarters, according to Bloomberg data.
Earnings growth is critical for a sustained rally in the markets at a time when domestic equities continue to enjoy lofty valuations levels despite lack of any fundamental support.
Major challenges such as rural stress, liquidity shortage and weak pick up in capex cycle have been reasons for companies falling short of their expected earnings, according to analysts.
“Uncompetitive rupee value, intermittent volatility in oil prices, poor investment decisions of the past, few policy actions, slippages or accumulation of NPAs, economic slowdown, liquidity squeeze, slow judicial process, rural income slowdown and over bullish analyst estimates are some key reasons for the actual Nifty earnings falling short of estimates,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of research, HDFC Securities Ltd.
According to Nomura, Nifty universe reported a 9.1% annual earnings growth for the March quarter. However, excluding financials, earnings fell 3% year-on-year, in line with consensus estimates. Excluding financials, earnings growth was 5.4% from a year earlier for FY19. Earnings missed analysts’ estimates for consumers, autos, healthcare and media, and were ahead for cement, utilities and IT services.
Analysts said a key disappointment in Q4FY19 earnings was an across-the-board annual drop in margins largely due to input cost pressures resulting from commodity prices, appreciating rupee leading to fall in EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins for IT companies, competitive intensity in discretionary consumption space and lower gross refining margin (GRM) for oil marketing companies.
“Earnings growth for Nifty has remained in single-digits for the past five years...Although we remain constructive on medium-term earnings growth on a low base, near-term slippages due to growth slowdown cannot be ruled out,"" Nomura said in a note on 7 June.
According to the Japanese brokerage firm Nomura, the intensity of consensus’ earnings cuts in FY19 has been higher than in the past two years. For Nifty universe, FY19 earnings were 11.4% lower than the estimates at the start of the year. “Consumption growth is adversely impacted by slower income growth, higher oil prices, liquidity tightening caused by consumption,"" it said.
Other analysts largely agree that negative earnings surprises continued as majority of companies missed consensus estimates for net profit and EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) estimates while sales were mostly in-line, which led to earnings downgrade in FY19.
Earnings estimates by analysts have been cut not only for fiscal 2020, but also for the next one. According to Bloomberg, for fiscal 2020, earnings estimates for Nifty 50 have been cut 1.6% since April. For FY21, the estimates are down 1.9%. “Global integration of businesses, disruption in business models, regulatory overkill, over investment in capacities in the past without considering competitiveness, promoter incapability to face turbulent times/shady promoter motives, availability of liquidity, over leveraged balance sheets are some reasons for continuous earnings downgrade,"" said Jasani at HDFC Securities.
Other factors that may impact corporate earnings growth include deficient monsoon, global trade war, deteriorating macro situation and weak local currency.
Despite the cut in FY20 Nifty EPS, Edelweiss Securities Ltd believes the street estimates are still quite high. “This, along with high valuations, renders us cautious on the markets,"" said analysts at Edelweiss.
Amid the continual earnings downgrades, premium valuations of Indian stocks are a concern for analysts.
Analysts said positive sentiment, expectations of reforms and a potential revival in domestic flows could keep valuations rich. “At 20 times FY20 EPS, Nifty is trading at 15% premium to long period average. Optimism on stable government and potential reforms, earnings recovery and FII flows has driven Nifty to an all-time high,"" Motilal Oswal Finacial Services Ltd said. The brokerage’s NiftyFY20/21 EPS estimates remain unchanged at  ₹604 and  ₹706, building in growth of 25.6% and 16.9%, respectively but said the direction of earnings revision for the broader markets still remains downward.

A year ago, India’s third-largest brokerage advised investors to load up on shares of the nation’s biggest companies. Now, it’s telling them to shift holdings to mid- and small-sized counterparts after a steep decline made the stocks cheaper.
“Mid- and small-cap indexes have slumped from their peak in January 2018 and, because of the time and price correction, there’s an opportunity in these stocks,"" Dhiraj Relli, chief executive officer at HDFC Securities Ltd., said in an interview at his office in Mumbai. “There’s limited prospects in large-caps as they are quoting at all-time high valuations.""
The brokerage has joined a growing chorus to invest in smaller stocks after their share prices declined, citing the prospect of a rebound triggered by expectations of better earnings growth. Since Relli gave his previous advise about a year ago, the NSE Nifty 50 Index has gained about 8%, a measure of mid-sized companies fell more than 7% and that of small-cap shares slumped 19%.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election with an even bigger majority last month has spurred hopes that the new government will take steps to boost economic growth and increase spending on infrastructure, while giving more cash to consumers to help bolster demand. Lower borrowing costs, a reduced oil price and slowing inflation have also improved the earnings outlook for Indian companies.
“If we get a ‘high teens’ kind of earning growth, there will be a huge catch-up for mid- and small-caps,"" Relli said. He sees individual investors continuing to pump more money into stocks as returns on equities are still seen beating other assets, such as property and gold.
Domestic investors in mid- and small-cap stocks pumped  ₹27 billion ($387 million) -- about half the total inflows from funds -- into the nation’s equities last month, data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India show. Local funds are the largest investors in shares of India’s smaller companies as their foreign counterparts stick with larger stocks due to risk concerns.
HDFC Securities’s shift in strategy was prompted by the Nifty MidCap 100 Index’s more than 20% tumble from a January 2018 record and a more than 35% slide in the Nifty SmallCap 100 Index as the Nifty 50 climbed by nearly 9%, Relli said. The brokerage advises selectively buying stocks of smaller companies with good governance, stronger earnings outlook, and those that are gaining market share.
“Investors need to do enough due diligence and take reasonable care to enter and book profits at or near the right times,"" Relli said. HDFC Securities had more than 650,000 trading accounts out of the nearly 9 million total active profiles in India as on May 31, according to data provided by the National Stock Exchange of India.

282,2019-06-18,HDFC,"HDFC AMC is making a provision of up to  ₹500 crore to provide liquidity to the unit holders of FMPs that were affected by exposure to NCDs of some Essel group companiesThe impact on the investors will depend upon the price at which the NCDs are transferred

HDFC Asset Management Company has in a filing with National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the BSE disclosed that it is making a provision of up to  ₹500 crore to provide liquidity to the unit holders of fixed maturity plans (FMP) of HDFC Mutual Fund that were affected by exposure to the non-convertible debentures (NCD) of Essel group companies, Edisions Infrapower& Multiventures Private Limited and Sprit Infrapower & Multiventures Private Limited.
Under the liquidity arrangement, HDFC AMC proposes to buy out or take on its own books these debentures that the issuer could not redeem on maturity in April of this year. It also applies to FMPs that hold these NCDs, which will mature by September 30, 2019. This is the date up to which the Essel group has been given time to make good their dues under the ‘standstill’ agreement entered into between lenders, including mutual funds, and the Essel Group in January 2019. The NCDs will be acquired by HDFC AMC at the current valuation on the respective maturity/purchase date.
The impact of the ‘standstill’ agreement was first felt by mutual fund investors in April of this year when FMPs of HDFC Mutual Fund and Kotak Mutual Fund matured and could not be redeemed because of their exposure to these NCDs. Three FMPs of HDFC mutual fund were affected by this in April of this year and HDFC AMC gave the investors the option to rollover or extend the maturity of the scheme giving the issuer the time to make the repayments.
The market regulator, Sebi, had sent show cause notices to HDFC AMC and Kotak Mutual Fund over their handling of the FMPs. There are five more FMPs of HDFC mutual fund alone maturing over the next three months. Under all these FMPs, the exposure was to the tune of around  ₹430 crore.
While this move by HDFC AMC does give the schemes the liquidity necessary to redeem the units, the impact on the investors will depend upon the price at which the NCDs are transferred. Since the rating agency, Brickwork Ratings, reaffirmed the ratings of Edison Infrapower and Multiventures Pvt Ltd and Sprit Infapower and Multiventures Pvt Ltd. in April 2019, there may not be write down in the value of the NCDs held by the FMPs. In that case the FMP investors will not see a cut in the NAV at which their units are redeemed. But if the value of the instruments has been marked down then the transfer will take place at the lower value and investors will see a lower redemption value."

MUMBAI :
Reserve Bank of India on Tuesday fined country's largest private sector lender HDFC Bank ₹1 crore for not reporting frauds and non-compliance with other directions.
The fine pertains to submission of forged bill of entries (BoEs) by certain importers to HDFC Bank for remittance of foreign currency, the RBI said.
""Examination in this regard revealed violations of RBI directions on 'KYC/AML norms' (know your customer/anti-money laundering)and on reporting of frauds,"" RBI said on its website.
A notice was issued to HDFC Bank on why monetary penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with the directions, the apex bank said.
The fine was imposed through an order last Thursday after considering HDFC Bank's reply, oral submissions made during the personal hearing and additional submission made, the apex bank said.
The penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers vested in RBI under the provisions of Section 47A(1)(c) read with Section 46(4)(i) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, it said.
""This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers,"" the RBI clarified.
In a statement to exchanges, HDFC Bank said it has ""taken necessary measures to strengthen its internal control mechanisms so as to ensure that such incidents do not recur""."
280,2019-06-18,HDFC,"Shareholders, investors in open-ended debt funds and FMPs maturing later in the year won’t benefitHDFC AMC’s move does nothing for FMP investors whose holdings are maturing after 30 September 2019

Some investors of fixed maturity plans (FMPs) issued by HDFC Mutual Fund can finally breathe a sigh of relief. On 17 June, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, India’s largest asset manager, announced the acquisition of troubled debt issued by Essel Group companies up to  ₹500 crore from the books of HDFC schemes. This will allow FMP investors to withdraw their assets on maturity.
However, it seems the cost of this bailout may be borne by shareholders of HDFC AMC. If the full Essel debt goes bad, more than half of the AMC’s profit after tax (PAT) will get wiped out. The AMC’s trailing 12-month PAT is  ₹931 crore, according to data from Value Research.
Moreover, the announcement applies only to FMPs that matured in April or those maturing before 30 September. The latter is the date on which the “standstill agreement"" between Essel (Zee Group) and its consortium of lenders (including mutual funds) comes to an end. Under the agreement, lenders agreed to refrain from selling the collateral against the debt securities issued by Essel group companies to give the conglomerate some time to repay.
FMPs mature on specified dates and their structure does not allow investors to wait indefinitely for the values to recover, hence these investors are vulnerable to debt downgrades or defaults. On the other hand, open-ended funds allow investors to enter or exit any time, which means they can wait for a possible recovery in any distressed paper. Fund houses can also undertake side-pocketing or separating bad debt from the rest of the portfolio; this allows investors to liquidate other holdings and get money against the bad debt later when it recovers.
The background
About a month ago, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) sent notices to HDFC AMC and Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd with regard to the bad debt affecting their FMPs and commenced adjudication proceedings against them (read more here). This process typically involves a monetary penalty on the defaulting party.
A fund manager, who did not wish to be named, said that the HDFC AMC’s move seems to be a response to the notice.
In 2016, Franklin Templeton Asset Management had taken bad debt issued by Jindal Steel and Power Ltd on to its own book, laying down a precedent for HDFC AMC’s action.
HDFC AMC’s announcement places other fund houses with FMPs containing bad debt, in a quandary. Eighty-seven schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds, across nine fund houses are exposed to securities of Essel Group firms. The fund houses have lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against Essel group’s debt securities (as of April 2019).
While some fund houses like Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. have reduced or eliminated exposure to Essel group, those that are still exposed to Essel’s securities may come under pressure from their holders and Sebi to make similar moves.
Interestingly, in a note issue in April 2019, HDFC AMC gave two different options to its investors. Under the first option, it said it will distribute the FMP proceeds at maturity, excluding the value of debt exposures to the Essel Group. The residual amount of the maturity proceeds would be paid on receipt of dues from Essel. The same approach was followed by Kotak AMC with its Essel-exposed FMPs.
In the second option, HDFC AMC said it would roll over the scheme (extend the maturity date), thereby extending the time for possible repayment. It sought investors’ written consent for such a rollover, adding that investors who don’t consent to the rollover would get back their money at the prevailing NAV.
Out of purview
Other MF investors: The move has raised questions about equitable treatment to all investors. There are several categories of investors that will not benefit from the current bailout.
One, the move does nothing for FMPs maturing after 30 September. Two, it won’t benefit investors of the scheme the fund house rolled over in April this year. HDFC AMC rolled over HDFC Fixed Maturity Plan (issued in February 2016 for 1,168 days), which was due for maturity on 15 April 2019, to 29 April 2020. This FMP had roughly 20% exposure to Essel Group companies. Three, investors in open-ended schemes with exposure to the group will not benefit.
This may open up the HDFC AMC decision to legal challenges.
Shareholders: In its exchange filing, HDFC AMC indicated that it was acquiring non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued by the Essel Group companies at the “prevailing valuation on the respective maturity/purchase dates"". This means that shareholders of HDFC AMC will be burdened with debt with little upside and much downside.
“Investors in FMPs knowingly took the risks. There is no logical basis for transferring this risk to shareholders who have not signed up for the bad debt in question. It also sets a precedent. If a bigger loss crops up tomorrow, it can wipe out the company’s entire equity capital,"" said Shriram Subramanian, managing director, InGovern Research Services, a corporate governance advisory firm.
However some market analysts took a more sanguine view of the transfer of debt. “It’s a goodwill gesture that is likely to protect the future cash flows of the company as confidence of mutual fund investors gets restored. Even if there is no recovery against the debt, the amount is not large from the point of view of the market cap of the company,"" said Vinit Bolinjkar, head of research at Ventura Securities, a brokerage. HDFC AMC has a market cap of around  ₹39,000 crore. The stock of the company closed 6.34% lower at  ₹1,809.10 on the Nifty on Tuesday.
Takeaways
The message from India’s largest mutual fund by asset size is a positive one for mutual fund investors. Their interest has largely been protected by this move. On the flip side, shareholders of AMCs have new risks to take into account.
However, this may also mean that mutual fund investors may now gravitate more towards large asset managers, who are able to absorb losses in times of crisis, accentuating concentration of market share in the industry. “There is a risk that distributors may recommend schemes on the basis that the sponsor or AMC will step in, in case of a default,"" said Prakash Praharaj, founder of MaxSecure Financial Planners, a financial planning firm."
279,2019-06-18,HDFC,"HDFC AMC’s decision to provide ‘liquidity’ to its investors in some fixed maturity plans has come as a shock to its shareholdersHDFC hopes that the gesture will help it win the trust of MF investors, which will eventually result in higher growth of assets under management, and ultimately benefit its shareholders

MUMBAI :
Investments in mutual funds are subject to market risks. Investments in shares of mutual fund companies are subject to those risks as well and more.
HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd’s decision to provide ‘liquidity’ to its investors in some fixed maturity plans (FMP) has come as a shock to its shareholders. The AMC’s shares nosedived 6.3% on a day when it became clear that the tab of protecting these FMP investors will be picked up by shareholders.
This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. The cost of bearing market risks was meant to be at the door of mutual fund investors. One concern among investors is whether there will be a repeat.
In the current instance, HDFC AMC’s arrangement to provide ‘liquidity’ of about  ₹500 crore entails taking over the non-convertible debentures (NCDs) issued by firms promoted by the Essel group on its books. This liquidity will be used to fulfil obligations to the unitholders of the FMPs under which these debt instruments were held.
As HDFC and other mutual funds have a standstill arrangement with the Essel group until September, the value realized from the NCDs will be known only then.
If there is an under-recovery, the cost will be borne by shareholders, rather than the FMP unitholders. The NCDs are backed by collateral of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd shares. If the Essel Group is unable to redeem the debentures by September, the AMC will have to offload the stock in the market. Normally, large stock sales in the market tend to have a high impact cost during the offloading process. It could also mean that HDFC AMC recovers far less than the  ₹500 crore it has provided in liquidity. Any under-recovery can also directly impact its bottom line.
HDFC AMC is one of the largest fund houses and should ideally be leading from the front. However, according to experts in the mutual fund industry, it is doing the opposite and setting a wrong precedent. Perhaps it hopes that the gesture will help it win the trust of mutual fund investors, which will eventually result in higher growth of assets under management, and ultimately benefit its shareholders. However, as the Roman poet Ovid said: “The end doesn’t justify the means.""
Besides, it unnecessarily complicates a simple and elegant fee-based business model.
“AMCs might be tempted to take such stressed exposures of their investors to preserve their reputation. This would eventually devolve their simple agency model to a far more complex structured financing business,"" according to analysts at Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd in a recent note to clients.
It’s little wonder that shareholders are revolting."

Axis Bank has lowered the FD interest rates applicable on the maturity periods of two years to less than three years, according to the bank's website, axisbank.com. The bank is offering an interest rate of 7.3% now. Previously, the bank paid an interest rate of 7.5% to general public on fixed deposits below  ₹2 crore for maturity periods between 2 years to less than 3 years.

On deposits which are 1 year to less than 2 year, the rate of interest has been increased from 6.8% to 7%, according to the SBI website. But across many other maturities SBI has lowered interest rates.

I have been investing  ₹25,000 in mutual funds each month through systematic investment plans (SIPs) for a year now. I am investing in ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund, HDFC Hybrid Equity Fund, Tata India Consumer Fund, Axis Long term Equity Fund and Mirae Asset India Equity Fund. All my investments are direct plans (growth option). I want to accumulate a corpus of  ₹5 crore in the next 15 years. At this point, I can enhance my investments by another  ₹25,000. Am I on the right track to meet my goal or does my portfolio need to be rejigged? I have a moderate risk profile. How should I invest the additional amount?
—Kumar Y.
First, let us do the math on your goals and investments. You have said that you would like to create a corpus of  ₹5 crore over the next 15 years. In order to o get there, assuming an aggressive 12% annualised portfolio return over this period, you would need to save and invest  ₹1.05 lakh every month.
At present, even with your additional investment of  ₹25,000, you are only planning to invest about half of the required amount, and we can safely say that this will get you only halfway to your goal. So, in order to meet your target, you would either need to amp up your monthly investment significantly, or tone down your aspirations.
Regarding your current portfolio, I am assuming that at present you are investing  ₹5,000 each in the five funds you have mentioned. If that is the case, you are investing 20% in a large-cap fund, 20% in a thematic fund, 20% in a hybrid fund, and the remaining 40% in a couple of diversified funds.
Overall, about 55% of your portfolio is going to a diversified set of stocks (including the equity allocation of the hybrid fund as a diversified holding). I am not in favour of having thematic funds in a long-term portfolio. So unless you have high conviction in the consumption theme over the next 15 years and you chose the fund with that in mind, I would advise you to replace it with a small-cap fund such as Franklin India Smaller Companies Fund, which has a relatively conservative style.
The additional amount you are planning to start investing can be deployed in the funds that are already in your portfolio and the recommended small-cap fund in equal proportions.

Mumbai: HDFC Ltd, India’s largest mortgage financier, has agreed to acquire the entire 50.8% stake of Apollo Hospitals Group in a health insurance joint venture with German reinsurer Munich Re Group as part of its strategy to tap this potential growth market.
HDFC will pay  ₹1,336 crore to Apollo Hospitals for the deal. It will pay an additional  ₹10.84 crore to employees of Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co. Ltd to purchase their 0.4% stake in the company.
The total deal size of  ₹1,347 crore for the entire 51.2% stake values Apollo Munich Health Insurance at 1.2 times the gross written premium for fiscal 2019, Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC, said at a news conference on Wednesday.
HDFC currently runs HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co., a joint venture with Ergo International AG, the primary insurance entity of Munich Re. Separately, Munich holds a 49% stake in Apollo Munich Health Insurance.
In a two-stage transaction, HDFC will first acquire the 51.2% in Apollo Munich, subject to approvals by the National Housing Bank, insurance regulator Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) and the Competition Commission of India. “Thus, Apollo Munich will be held as a subsidiary of HDFC,"" said Parekh.
“In the second stage, there will be a merger of Apollo Munich with HDFC Ergo, subject to the approval of the National Company Law Tribunal and final approval of Irdai. Post the scheme of amalgamation, HDFC Ergo and Apollo Munich will merge into one entity under the HDFC Ergo brand,"" he added.
Munich will hold a 49% stake in the merged entity.
“Over the years, Munich Re Group has enjoyed an excellent relationship with the Apollo group, in building a powerful franchise in health insurance. With this transaction, we are very much looking forward to further strengthening our ties with HDFC Group and consolidating our presence in India,"" said Markus Riess, chairman of Ergo Group and member of the board of Munich Re.
The merged entity will have a gross premium of  ₹10,807 crore and a market share of 6.4% in India’s non-life insurance market. In the accident and health insurance space, it will be ranked number two with an 8.2% market share.
Parekh said the non-life insurance industry is seeing structural changes, with health insurance expected to become the dominant product in the future, prompting HDFC to seek inorganic opportunities in this space.
“In the general insurance space, it is expected that the share of accident and health insurance will rise from 30% currently to 39% in the next five years. This growth means that accident and health will have a larger share and overtake motor insurance, which currently accounts for the largest component in general insurance,"" said Parekh.
He, however, said that unlike the group’s life insurance business, HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd, there was no plan to list the non-life insurance business in the near term as the focus would be on expansion. “We will think of the IPO maybe two years later. It will not be happening in 2019 or 2020.""
This marks the second inorganic growth attempt in the insurance space by HDFC. In 2016, the life insurance arm of HDFC said it would merge with Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd, but the deal fell through.
“HDFC has been growing its general insurance business through the inorganic route and the current acquisition is a similar extension of that strategy,"" said Anirudh Jain, business director for insurance at Centrum Capital.
In June 2016, HDFC Ergo had acquired 100% of the equity of L&T General Insurance Co. Ltd for  ₹551 crore, which helped it expand its distribution network and non-health product portfolio.
“The current acquisition of Apollo Munich will also help the insurer to expand its agency network and premium book in the health insurance segment, giving it a better prospect for growth in its health portfolio,"" Jain added.
For Apollo Hospitals, the transaction will help trim its debt. Besides the  ₹1,336 crore from HDFC, the Chennai-based firm will receive  ₹294 crore from Munich, leading to a total payout of  ₹1,630 crore.
“The transaction will improve our cash flows, which we will use to invest in creating new infrastructure as well as for existing infrastructure. It will also help us deleverage our balance sheet,"" said Suneeta Reddy, managing director of Apollo Hospitals. Since inception, Apollo has invested  ₹300 crore in the insurance business, she said. The deal will help Apollo’s promoters to free up part of their pledged shareholding of listed entity Apollo Hospitals Enterprises.
Apollo Hospitals had a debt of  ₹3,430 crore, according to a Bloomberg report in February.
This marks the third health insurance deal in the market.
Private equity firm True North bought Max India’s controlling stake in Max Bupa Health Insurance Co. Ltd last December for  ₹2,000 crore. In August 2018, Star Health and Allied Insurance Co. Ltd, India’s largest stand-alone health insurer, said private equity firms WestBridge Capital and Madison Capital and billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala had jointly agreed to buy the company."

Apollo Hospitals Group is looking to sell its stake in two more subsidiaries to raise up to $200 million, two people directly aware of the matter said on Thursday, a day after it agreed to sell its stake in a health insurance joint venture to HDFC Ltd.
Apollo group currently runs more than a dozen brands in healthcare, including clinics, pharmacies, hospitals and health insurance.
The people cited above, who have direct knowledge of ongoing talks and requested anonymity, said the group is in discussions to sell stakes in Apollo Health And Lifestyle Ltd (AHLL) and Apollo Proton Therapy Cancer Centre Pvt. Ltd. Proceeds from the transactions will be used to reduce promoter debt.
As on 31 March, 78.13% of promoter shareholding in the group’s flagship listed company Apollo Hospitals was pledged, compared with 74.81% as on 31 December, according to Capitaline data. Apollo Hospitals had a consolidated debt of  ₹3,450.29 crore as on 31 March 2019.
“Among potential buyers there are several large private equity funds, which have shown initial interest,"" said the first person cited earlier.
An email sent to Apollo Hospitals did not elicit a response.
Apollo Health and Lifestyle is in the business of providing primary healthcare facilities through a network of owned/franchised clinics across India offering specialist consultations, diagnostics, preventive health checks, telemedicine facilities and a 24-hour pharmacy. For the year ended 31 March 2018, it posted a revenue of  ₹471 crore and a net loss of  ₹165 crore, widening from a loss of  ₹141 crore on revenue of  ₹388 crore, according to its annual report.
In January this year, Apollo opened the Proton Cancer Therapy Centre, considered South Asia’s first such facility. The 150-bed centre has three proton therapy rooms, an advanced radiation oncology centre, medical oncology and immunotherapy facilities and high-end day care chemotherapy wards.
On Wednesday, HDFC, India’s largest mortgage financier, said it would buy Apollo Hospitals’ 50.8% stake in Apollo Munich Health Insurance for  ₹1,336 crore. Besides the money from HDFC, Apollo group will also receive  ₹294 crore from its German joint venture partner Munich Re, taking its total payout to  ₹1,630 crore.
The health insurance deal will help lower debt at Apollo group.
“The transaction will improve our cash flows, which we will use to invest in creating new infrastructure as well as for existing infrastructure. It will also help us deleverage our balance sheet,"" Suneeta Reddy, managing director of Apollo Hospitals, said on Wednesday.
On Thursday, shares of Apollo Hospitals rose 1.5% to  ₹1,372.95 apiece on the BSE. In comparison, the benchmark Sensex rose 1.25%.
Even as Apollo looks to trim debt, the hospital chain industry is witnessing other big deals and investments. Mint reported on 12 June that buyout firm TPG Capital and Manipal Hospitals are set to close the acquisition of Dr Naresh Trehan’s Medanta chain of hospitals soon, in one of the largest acquisitions in India’s healthcare industry.
KKR and Co.-backed hospital chain Radiant Life Care Pvt. Ltd is also on an expansion drive, with its acquisition of Max Healthcare Institute Ltd last year, which will make the combined entity India’s third-largest hospital chain by revenue. The merged entity will own more than 3,200 beds in 16 hospitals across India."
272,2019-06-20,HDFC,"Changes may not affect large HFCs such as HDFC and Repco Home Finance, which are capitalized at above 15%The decision to review the regulatory framework for HFCs comes in the wake of the liquidity crisis, sparked off by the defaults by IL&FS

The National Housing Bank (NHB) has tightened its rules on leverage and capital adequacy ratio for housing finance companies (HFCs). The regulator now mandates HFCs to bring down their total borrowings in a phased manner to not more than 12 times their net-owned funds as on 31 March, 2022, compared to the existing 16 times. LIC Housing Finance is the only HFC to have the highest leverage ratio of 14 times of NOF.
In a recent statement, the NHB also said that capital adequacy ratiofor HFCs has been increased to 13% by March 2020, 14% by March 2021 and 15% by March 2022. Tier I capital should not be less than 10% versus 6% currently, it added. 
The regulatory changes are not likely to impact large HFCs such as Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC), Repco Home Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Dewan Housing Finance, which are well capitalized at above 15%. LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance have capital adequacy ratio below 15%.
“Leverage can be a double-edged sword. In troubled times, it cuts the wrong way. NHB’s decision to increase CAR gradually to 15% will ensure adequate capitalization and strengthen balance sheets. It will impact very few HFCs as they are already well capitalised,"" said SanjayChaturvedi, chief executive officer, Shubham Housing Development Finance.
The decision to review the regulatory framework for HFCs comes in the wake of the liquidity crisis, sparked off by the defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd which first unfolded last September. 
The crisis led to a spike in borrowing costs for NBFCs and HFCs, raising fears of contagion.
The National Housing Bank added that housing finance companies cannot accept fixed deposits of not more than three times their NOF. 
“A housing finance company having obtained credit rating for its fixed deposits not below the minimum investment grade rating as above and complying with all the prudential norms, may accept public deposits not exceeding three times of its NOF,"" it said.
However, analysts believe that these revised guidelines are likely to impact HFCs. 
“NHB has come out with formal regulations for HFCs like banks on their Tier 1 capital requirement and how much deposit they can raise, what will be their terms and conditions. This will impact housing finance companies across segments, as they will have to adhere to relatively tougher norms compared to the earlier regime,"" said Asutosh Mishra, head of institutional research at Ashika Stock Broking."

Indian markets are expected to gain on Thursday as global equities rallied following US Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady with a dovish stance. SGX Nifty trends suggest a positive opening for Indian equities as it has risen 40 points or 0.34%. A gauge of global stock markets edged near this year's peak while benchmark US Treasury yields and the dollar dropped after the Federal Reserve signalled possible interest rate cuts later this year.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei gained 0.5%. The MSCI ACWI, which incorporates readings of 49 equity markets across the world, gained 0.2%, having recovered a large part of its losses made after US President Donald Trump threatened new tariffs on all of China's imports last month.
Signs that China and the United States are returning to the negotiating table after a six-week hiatus also bolstered risk sentiment.
The rally in stocks comes as a host of Asian central banks are scheduled to hold policy meetings later in the day, with most expected to flag moves toward looser monetary settings.
On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained 0.3% to 2,926, just 19 points off its record closing high hit on April 30.
The US Federal Reserve said on Wednesday it was ready to battle growing global and domestic economic risks with interest rate cuts beginning as early as next month, as it took stock of rising trade tensions and growing concerns about weak inflation.
Back home, HDFC Ltd, India’s largest mortgage financier, has agreed to acquire the entire 50.8% stake of Apollo Hospitals Group in a health insurance joint venture with German reinsurer Munich Re Group as part of its strategy to tap this potential growth market. HDFC will pay  ₹1,336 crore to Apollo Hospitals for the deal. It will pay an additional  ₹10.84 crore to employees of Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co. Ltd to purchase their 0.4% stake in the company.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED), which is investigating a case of alleged money laundering at the debt-ridden Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), on Wednesday evening arrested two former directors of the financial services company. They were arrested under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Meanwhile, the bulk of Fed policymakers slashed their rate outlook for the rest of the year by roughly half a percentage point, and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said others agree the case for lower rates is building. Many investors viewed the overall tone as more dovish than their expectations, sending the 10-year US Treasuries yield to as low as 1.986%, its lowest level since November 2016. The two-year yield fell to 1.721%, a level last seen in November 2017.
Money market derivatives, such as Fed funds futures and overnight indexed swaps, are fully pricing in a rate cut of 25 basis points at next policy review on 30-31 July, with about one-third chance of a bigger 50 basis point cut. A total of 75 basis point reduction is priced in by the end of year.
However, such aggressive rate cuts when the stock prices are so close to record peaks would be rare, if not unprecedented, making some investors nervous about whether the Fed may be over-reacting.
The Chinese yuan has recovered over the past couple of days on hopes of US-China talks next week on the sideline of Group of 20 summit. The offshore yuan traded at 6.8911 to the dollar, having hit a five-week high of 6.8880 overnight.
The euro bounced to $1.1254 after the Fed's dovish signals undermined the dollar's yield attraction, pushing the common currency away from this week's low of $1.1181 touched on Tuesday. The dollar hit a five-month low of 107.72 yen. The Bank of Japan is widely expected to keep its policy on hold on Thursday. The British pound rebounded to $1.2648 from Tuesday's 5-1/2-month low of $1.2507 as investors trimmed their short bets before the Bank of England's policy meeting on Thursday where it may strike a more hawkish tone than those of its peers.
Gold also shot up to as high as $1,362.20 per ounce, the highest level since April last year.
Oil prices held firm, underpinned by a larger-than-expected decline in US crude inventories. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1.25% to $54.43 a barrel.
Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed to meet on July 1, followed by a meeting with non-OPEC allies on July 2, after weeks of wrangling over dates. Oil producers will discuss whether to extend a deal on cutting 1.2 million barrels per day of production that runs out this month.

270,2019-06-21,HDFC,"At over 6 times the book value, HDFC Group’s purchase of Apollo Munich has not come cheapThe return on equity of Apollo Munich is significantly low at just about 2-3% for fiscal year 2019

Why is there such a hefty price tag for a piece of the health insurance market? Last year, investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, along with West Bridge AIF and Madison Capital Ltd, acquired Star Health and Allied Insurance Co. Ltd at about 6.5 times its book value.
This time around, the HDFC group is acquiring a majority stake in pure health insurance company Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co Ltd at about 6.1 times its book value.
Analysts say these valuations are expensive, especially given the poor profitability metrics of pure health insurance companies.
“Standalone health insurers still struggle to build sufficient economies to profitability, reflected in low return on equity,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients. “In this context, we find deal valuations for Apollo Munich and Star Health expensive.""
The deal involves a two-step process, wherein HDFC Ltd will first acquire the stake of Apollo Munich’s local promoters for about  ₹1,350 crore. In about nine months, the company will be merged into HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co. Ltd.
While Apollo has a decent market share (about 9%) among private health insurance providers (~4.5% market share including public sector companies), it still ran underwriting losses, according to Jefferies’ calculations. The return on equity of Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co. Ltd is a mere 2-3% for fiscal year 2019, which is significantly low.
Additionally, raising the market share further for standalone health insurance players is not likely to come without a cost. “Apollo is valued at  ₹2,600 crore, or 1.2x FY19 gross premiums, but earnings are still low (profit of  ₹11 crore and return on equity of 3% in FY19). Therefore, synergies and cost savings post-merger will be key to improve profitability; it may also need capital infusion to support growth,"" said CLSA India Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients.
Still, the deal will help the HDFC group expand its presence in the health insurance market, where its share is low. The deal will give HDFC a combined market share of about 7.2% of the gross written premium in FY19, and will also make it the second largest private sector health insurance player.
A positive has been that public sector insurers have been reducing their aggressive pricing of health insurance products.
This should improve the profitability of health insurance companies. Besides, some synergistic benefits could also play out in the long run. Domestic penetration of health insurance is low, which is probably another reason for the stiff price.
Of course, given HDFC’s large size, the premium valuation doesn’t hurt much. The  ₹1,350 crore price tag compares with a market capitalization of  ₹3.78 trillion for HDFC."

266,2019-06-23,HDFC,"The scales tilt from one side to the other, depending on who has greater bargaining power

The current crisis in the financial services sector has once again focused on an elusive policy objective: How to balance the public good with benefits to smaller private interests.
Recently, HDFC Asset Management Co Ltd (HDFC-AMC) decided to buy out bonds worth  ₹500 crore from its fixed maturity plan (FMP) schemes; this one-of-a-kind transaction is designed to help the schemes repay investors on maturity of their FMPs. The schemes had invested in debt papers of two Essel Group companies, with the company promoter’s shares pledged as security. In April, after negotiations, the Essel Group promoters entered into a “standstill arrangement"" with fund houses, including HDFC-AMC, under which the fund houses promised not to sell the shares till September 2019. FMP investors were repaid part of their investment, with the promise to get the balance in September, when the Essel Group borrowers repaid their outstanding dues.
HDFC-AMC’s announcement to buy the Essel bonds from the plan schemes up to a maximum of  ₹500 crore has stirred up a hornet’s nest. The ensuing debate has pitched the AMC shareholders (HDFC-AMC had its initial public offering in July 2018) against FMP investors. Shareholders are particularly angry because the bail-out funds have come from the company’s profits for 2018-19, and this has an impact on its share price. But, that is not all.
Shareholders argued that investing in mutual fund schemes is fraught with market risks and, if the FMPs are unable to repay, then investors must grin and bear that risk. All fund offerings come with the standard caveat: “Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks, read all scheme related documents carefully."" Secondly, with the asset management company deciding to bail out one class of investors, it not only creates moral hazard problems (fund managers expecting parent AMC to bail out their suspect investment decisions each time), but creates undesirable expectations among all mutual fund subscribers who invest in debt schemes.
Those batting for FMP investors argue that the fund house’s rescue act has restored confidence in the system. Confidence in the financial system is currently in short supply with loan defaults, write-downs and sticky credit flows. The fund house’s helping hand perhaps doesn’t quite restore faith, but does not let it erode further. Its trump card is its caveat emptor defence. Item 17 under Risk Factors in the AMC’s IPO prospectus clearly states: “We are required to prioritize the interests of our customers, which could conflict with the interests of our shareholders. In terms of the SEBI Mutual Fund Regulations, we are required to avoid conflicts of interest in managing the affairs of our mutual fund schemes and keep the interest of our customers paramount in all matters…Further, we may endeavor to safeguard the interests of our customers by acquiring certain non-performing/downgraded investments held by the schemes and by bearing the interest costs arising out of borrowings that may be availed of by our schemes to meet its redemption requirements."" If shareholders feel that fund subscribers should be cognisant of market risks, even stock investors are expected to read risk factors before investing in shares.
The last word on this has not been spoken yet. The regulatory challenge worldwide has been to balance customer interest with investor interest. The scales frequently tilt from one side to the other, depending on which side has the superior political bargaining power, and can influence the regulator’s belief system.
This is currently playing out in yet another part of the financial system: non-banking financial companies, or NBFCs. Termed as shadow banks by global financial regulators, NBFCs have traditionally provided the last-mile linkages in the Indian financial system. With commercial banks weighed down by excessive regulatory costs and systemic financial repression, NBFCs have gone where banks were unable to venture.
Ironically, though, NBFCs have also been found to suffer from the typical Indian business malady: A disregard for risk and a virulent allergy to regulation. With systemic liquidity being easy over the past few years, NBFCs have feasted on easy credit to the point of indigestion. This included bingeing on short-term loans to finance long-term assets. This could be sustained as long there was easy liquidity in the system.
With the Reserve Bank of India making inflation-targeting the centre-piece of its monetary policy actions, liquidity became the collateral damage. NBFCs found themselves stranded and unable to roll over their loans. They have now started petitioning RBI and the government to provide some sort of a bail-out, including a liquidity window, which will allow them to borrow and repay their bond-holders. The RBI has refused to relent so far; action has shifted to the government’s pre-budget consultations.
This raises the equilibrium question once again: If resources are to be earmarked for NBFCs, it means lesser resources for some other class of beneficiaries. The contours of the ensuing debate are predictable: Why should public funds bail out private transgressions, versus, restoring confidence via NBFCs is beneficial for overall economic growth. The optimum solution actually might be to recapitalise public sector banks, which can then re-start lending to all eligible borrowers, including credit-worthy NBFC.

A year after a rare default in India’s credit market led to its mini-Lehman moment, several shadow banks in the country, its oldest surviving private airline and the parent company of its biggest television broadcaster are still reeling.
The fear which erased more than 1 trillion rupees ($14.4 billion) in market capitalization of the 11 worst-hit firms is refusing to ebb.
A custom index of shares of these 11 companies -- ranging from Dewan Housing Finance Corp. to Reliance Capital Ltd. -- has slumped 54% since June compared with the S&P BSE Sensex’s 12% advance.
Risk aversion in the credit market that followed the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. roared back this month after Dewan Housing’s rating was cut to default. Many of these junk-rated borrowers have turned untouchable in credit markets curtailing their ability to refinance outstanding bonds of 2.03 trillion rupees.
Money is not cheap for non-bank lenders outside this group of eleven either as financing costs surge. For instance, to issue a two-year paper even a top rated shadow lender has to pay a premium of 162 basis points over sovereign debt with a similar maturity. The spread has widened by 50 basis points in the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Rollover risks for outstanding borrowings are rising as these companies could only raise less than one-seventh of debt they did in the year before. Founders of most of these companies are selling businesses to tide over the crunch.
The impact of the credit crisis is spreading. Local asset managers such as HDFC Asset Management Co., which have holdings of some of these stressed debt papers, are facing the heat as the firms delay or default on payments. Investors are also scrutinizing Indian banks who have loan exposure to companies with stressed debt.
Even as the cracks of the credit crunch spread far and wide, some investors are waiting to see if the government and the central bank will come up with enough measures to tide over it.
Policy makers have taken steps to provide liquidity to the system. But before this crisis is over, in all likelihood we will see “a number of companies going under or barely surviving by selling off their crown jewels,"" said Andrew Holland, chief executive officer at Avendus Capital Ltd. in Mumbai."
264,2019-06-26,HDFC,"HDB Financial Services’ share sale likely in the current fiscal yearHDFC Bank has reportedly appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to manage the initial share sale of HDB Financial

Mumbai: India’s largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank Ltd, is eyeing an initial public offering (IPO) of its non-bank lending unit, HDB Financial Services, that could see the company raise more than $1 billion, said two people aware of the development.
HDB, founded in 2007, offers various products such as personal loans, commercial vehicle loans, gold loans, and loans against property.
“They have been engaging with various investment banks over the last one month regarding their plans to list HDB Financial Services. They are likely to raise around  ₹7,000-8,000 crore or more through the IPO. While the IPO is expected to be a mix of primary and secondary share sale, it will largely be a primary capital raising exercise given the current market conditions,"" said the first person cited above. HDFC Bank is likely to target the IPO of the non-bank arm within this fiscal, he added.
Earlier on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that HDFC Bank had appointed investment banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley to manage the initial share sale of HDB Financial.
HDFC Bank held a 95.53% stake in HDB Financial Services as of 31 March. The rest is held by individual shareholders and employee trusts.
A spokesperson for HDFC Bank declined to comment on the development.
The plan to list HDB Financial comes at a time when non-banking financial companies (NBFC) are facing a liquidity crunch owing to defaults by the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) group in September 2018.
The liquidity crunch has forced several non-bank lenders to seek alternative sources of capital through divestment of various assets.
Lenders such as Dewan Housing Finance Ltd, which has found itself in the eye of the storm, has sold various subsidiaries including its affordable home finance arm Aadhar Housing Finance, which was acquired by private equity firm Blackstone, and the group’s education financing arm Avanse Financial Services, which was bought by Warburg Pincus.
The liquidity crunch has also meant that several non-bank lenders have gone slow on fresh loan disbursals.
An IPO will make HDB Financial the fifth HDFC group company to be listed on stock exchanges, following the listing of HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd in 2018 and the listing of HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd in 2017. HDFC Bank and Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd are the other listed entities of the group.
HDB reported a rise 25% rise in assets under management to  ₹55,425 crore in fiscal 2019, up from  ₹44,268 crore in the previous fiscal. Net profit rose to  ₹1,153 crore in fiscal 2019 from a profit of  ₹933 crore a year ago."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

NEW DELHI :
Asset restructuring firm JM Financial ARC Wednesday said it had taken over Unitech's loan from a financial institution in November 2016 and no new debt of the realty firm has been acquired thereafter by it.
The company disbursed some funds over a period of time to help Unitech restart/complete certain projects, JM Financial ARC said in a statement.
""JM Financial ARC had taken over debts pertaining to Unitech Group from a financial institution in November 2016. As part of restructuring of the debts so taken over, some funds were provided to them to help them restart/complete certain of their projects,"" the statement said.
The funds were disbursed by JM Financial ARC over a period of time from the date of taking over their debts, it further said.
JM Financial ARC has taken over debts and provided additional loans as a lender and has not taken over projects, it said adding that the asset restructuring firm does not control or manage the projects.
The Gurugram-based developer had 74 pending real estate projects, comprising 16,500 housing units, in August 2017, when its two managing directors Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra were arrested.
In the last two years, the company has completed about 22 projects comprising 4,000 units, while 52 projects are still incomplete, according to sources.
Chandra brothers were arrested after some homebuyers dragged the company and its directors to court for non-delivery of their apartments and sought refund.
A bail application was filed before the Supreme Court, but the apex court had directed Unitech to first deposit  ₹750 crore in the registry. The realty firm has so far deposited about  ₹480 crore.
To secure bail of its two directors, Unitech is in process of monetising its land bank to raise funds and deposit the same with the registry, they added."

258,2019-06-29,HDFC,"Before you put your money in any investment instrument, it is important to understand NPS and how it worksIf your reason to invest in NPS is tax benefit, then your investment approach is incorrect

MUMBAI :
Have you considered investing your money in National Pension Scheme (NPS)? If you have, was it to fulfil your retirement needs or was it to save additional tax on  ₹50,000 every year? If your reason to invest in NPS is tax benefit, then your investment approach is incorrect. The dangling carrot of tax benefit should not be looked at in isolation. Here is what you should know about NPS and how you should use it to build your retirement kitty effectively:
UNDERSTANDING NPS
Before you put your money in any investment instrument, it is important to understand it. Firstly, know that NPS is a defined contribution pension plan. Your money will be pooled in a pension fund. You can make an annual contribution till you turn 60 years of age and the minimum age requirement to invest is 18 years. If you invest in NPS, you can avail a deduction of  ₹1.5 lakh under section 80C and also an additional deduction benefit of  ₹50,000 under section 80 CCD. If you are in the highest tax bracket, it means a savings of  ₹15,600 a year. Managed by Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA), NPS is not like a public provident fund (PPF) account where everyone just has one option—you invest and get a predetermined interest rate. In case of NPS, you have to make a choice. There are two accounts—tier 1 account, the pension account, which gives tax benefit and is mandatory to open for NPS, and tier 2 account, an optional account with withdrawal flexibility. Once you open an NPS account, you have to contribute a minimum of  ₹1,000 in tier 1 account.
NPS gives you options in the form of fund manager and the type of investment choice. There are eight pension fund managers to choose from such as HDFC Pension Management Co. Ltd, Reliance Capital Pension Fund Ltd and UTI Retirement Solutions Ltd.
In terms of investment choice, you can opt for either active choice or auto choice. In active choice, you can create your portfolio with equity, corporate bonds and government securities. If you opt for auto choice, the fund manager will create a portfolio with the same option, but the percentage of investment in each asset class will be pre-decided.
At any point, the maximum investment shouldn’t be more than 75%. “For equity, till two years ago, PFRDA had limited the choice as there was a condition that you could invest only in Nifty stocks. Then they amended the guidelines and included broad-based stocks. As there is a Nifty hangover, in most portfolios, there is a Nifty bias,"" said Sandip Shrikhande, chief executive officer, Kotak Pension Fund.
HOW TO USE NPS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO?
Firstly, don’t look at NPS in isolation only for tax benefit. “People who put only  ₹50,000 to save tax, if you continue investing for 20 years, the corpus is not going to grow significantly to meet your entire retirement needs,"" said Shrikhande. You should instead link the NPS investment to your retirement plan.
“Using NPS is a means to build a retirement fund. However, if you are in your 30s, simply using NPS will not work because the asset allocation changes. Someone in 30s will be fairly aggressive. Now, if you have a cap on how much you can invest in a particular asset class to restrict yourself, you can’t be flexible. So it would be better to have a basket of mutual funds to choose from. For someone who is younger, it is restrictive. Look at it as an add-on product for tax saving,"" said Priya Sunder, director and co-founder, Peakalpha Investments.
Consider using NPS as one of the retirement investment tools, but don’t depend on it entirely."
256,2019-06-30,HDFC,"Foreign strategic investors, debt woes drive surge in deals via offer for sale route in Jan-JunThe first six months of 2019 saw  ₹18,545 cr being offloaded by promoters via the OFS route

MUMBAI :
Promoter stake sales through the offer for sale (OFS) route in listed Indian companies hit a near four-year high in the first six months of calendar year 2019, driven by foreign strategic investors and debt-related issues.
The first six months saw  ₹18,545 crore being offloaded by promoters, which is nearly double the shares sold via the OFS route in calendar year 2018, and a little more than the  ₹18,094 crore sold in 2017, according to primary market tracker Prime Database.
The biggest driver of activity through the OFS route has been foreign strategic investors selling their stakes, both to meet regulatory obligations and also because of strategic business needs.
“One of the reasons for the increase in share sales through the OFS route is to meet Sebi’s (Securities and Exchange Board of India) minimum public shareholding norms,"" said Pranav Haldea, managing director at Prime Database. Valuations have been rich in the last few months, thus making it an opportune time for promoters to dilute their stakes, Haldea said.
The offer for sale route is frequently used by promoters to either raise capital or reduce their holding in listed firms by selling shares mainly to institutional investors, with a mandatory 10% reservation for retail investors. According to Sebi rules, listed companies are required to increase public shareholding to at least 25% within three years from their date of listing.
Foreign firms that have sold stakes through OFS this year include BNP Paribas Cardif, Prudential Corp., and Standard Life. Last week, French insurer BNP Paribas Cardif sold a 2.5% stake in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd in an offer for sale. In May, Standard Life, one of the promoters of HDFC Life Insurance, sold a 1.78% stake in the insurer for  ₹1,404 crore, bringing the promoter holding down to 74.36% from 76.14%.
That happened two months after Standard Life sold a 4.93% stake worth  ₹3,500 crore in HDFC Life through the OFS route.
“Some of the foreign strategic investors have been facing shareholder pressure in their home geographies because of stagnant or underperforming share prices. At the same time, their Indian investments have seen sharp rise in valuations, thus they have sold parts of these investments to raise capital, which can be deployed back home or elsewhere to push business growth,"" said an investment banker, on condition of anonymity.
Indian promoters have also used this route to bring down their shareholdings and meet regulatory requirements. In June, L&T Technology Services’ parent firm, Larsen and Toubro Ltd sold a 3.88% stake in the firm via an offer for sale.
While meeting Sebi norms was a major reason behind the increase in OFS activity this year, another reason was the promoters’ need to deleverage in the face of existing liquidity stress in the market.
“The trend of increase in OFS, in my view, will continue for the next 12-18 months wherein Indian promoters will use it as a deleveraging tool as the present liquidity crisis in the system leaves less room for accessing funds otherwise,"" said Gopal Agrawal, co-head, investment banking at Edelweiss Securities. “Parallelly, liquidity with mutual funds fuelled by continued systematic investment plans (SIP) inflow has created enough appetite in the market for secondary trade,"" he said.
The year saw Anil Ambani-led Reliance Capital Ltd selling 10.75% of its stake in Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management (RNAM) in two successive transactions. Later, it exited the mutual fund business by selling a 22.49% stake in RNAM to Nippon Life Company. The entire proceeds worth  ₹6,000 crore from the two OFS and the transaction with Nippon Life would be used to reduce Reliance Capital’s outstanding debt, the company had said in a statement.
There have also been other instances such as promoters of debt-laden Emami Ltd selling 10% stake sale in the group company and Bajaj Resources’ 7% stake sale in Bajaj Consumer Care.

The bank has lowered the interest rate on maturities with tenures of 7 to 14 days and 15 to 29 days, according to the banks' website. The bank is offering 5.5% interest rate to general customers and 6% to senior citizens for 7- 14 and 15-29 days. Earlier the bank was offering 5.75% interest rate on FDs of up to  ₹2 crore for maturity periods between 7-45 days.
For one-year FDs, PNB is offering 7% rate of interest. For maturity term of more than one year and up to three years, PNB offers 6.75% interest rate. On FDs maturing between three years and 10 years, PNB is offering 6.25% interest rate.
Senior citizens will continue to get an additional rate of interest of 0.5 per cent on their deposits.
Earlier, top banks like ICICI, Axis and HDFC had initiated deposit cuts between 0.10% and 0.25% in the middle of June on select maturities.
In another development, ICICI Bank has cut its marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) across all tenors by 0.10%. The new rates are effective immediately. The one-year MCLR, to which a majority of loans like residential mortgages and auto loans are tied, now stands at 8.65%.
At the June 6 review, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had said banks have cut rates by a measly 0.21 percent as against the 0.50 percent cut in key rates, and had asked banks to do more. The same day, it cut the key policy rate by another 0.25 percent and also hinted at further easing by shifting its stance to accommodatory from neutral, taking the total quantum of rate cut to 0.75 percent in 2019. The RBI initiated the rate action with an eye to prop up the sagging growth amidst a sustained period of inflation trending below the 4 percent set for the central bank as part of the medium-term inflation targeting framework."

MUMBAI :
Mortgage lender HDFC on Thursday moved the NCLT seeking to keep the Jet Airways headquarters in the city out of the bankruptcy process.
The HDFC counsel told the National Company Law Tribunal that three floors of the building are mortgaged with the lender.
The tribunal will hear HDFC's plea on Friday along with the main petition.
Last month, NCLT had admitted the insolvency petition filed by the lenders' consortium led by State Bank against Jet Airways which stopped operations on April 17 after running out of cash.

The consortium of 26 bankers led by State Bank took the grounded Jet Airways to NCLT to recover their dues of over  ₹8,500 crore.
The lenders have been trying to sell the airline as a going concern since the past five months, but failed due to many a reason.
Apart from banks, the airline also owes over  ₹10,000 crore to its hundreds of vendors, primarily aircraft lessors and over  ₹3,000 crore to its employees who have not been paid since March.
The airline has been having negative networth for long and has run a loss of over  ₹13,000 crore in the past few year. Thus it has over  ₹36,500 crore of dues and being a services company negligible assets to recover."

BENGALURU :
India's blue-chip shares are vastly outperforming those of smaller companies as investors avoid risky bets in a slowing economy, with the gap between the two groups at its widest in more than a decade.
The country's benchmark blue-chip indexes hit record highs last month after Prime Minister Narendra Modi cruised to re-election, but the stock markets remain polarised.
While the blue-chip Nifty 50 has climbed about 12% in the last one year, the Nifty Smallcap 100 has slipped nearly 13%. The divergence between the two is at its widest since 2005.
Money managers say increasing caution about a prolonged economic slowdown at home and a global trade war has driven portfolio investment flows into a handful of India's largest firms, such as IT services provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, lender HDFC Ltd and oil-to-telecoms group Reliance Industries Ltd.
Their position as established market leaders with double-digit revenue growth makes them safer bets in a slowing economy.
Asia's third-largest economy grew at its slowest pace in more than four years in January-March. A delay in crucial monsoon rains this year could further undermine the agriculture sector that makes up 15% of the economy.
""There is a cyclical slowdown in the economy, and investors are not so confident about the near term,"" said Mahesh Patil, co-chief investment officer at Mumbai-based Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC, whose team oversees about $13 billion in equities.
CREDIT CRUNCH, RISING DEBT
A growing funding crisis among India's shadow banks is also hurting private consumption, hitting sales across markets from construction tools to auto parts.
March-quarter earnings at plywood manufacturer Century Plyboards and tyre maker CEAT - two Nifty Smallcap 100 firms - both fell due to lower sales to real estate and auto companies, respectively, two industries where the credit crunch has exacerbated a slowdown.
Profit margins at smaller firms lagged those at their larger peers, Refinitiv Eikon data shows, even as both sets of companies showed similar levels of revenue growth.
Several small companies are either heavily indebted, or have faced allegations of corporate misgovernance.
Jet Airways, once India's biggest private airline, suffered a spectacular decline after running out of cash, while companies part of business tycoon Anil Ambani's Reliance Group face mounting debt or allegations of improper accounting.
""If we find corporate governance that is not in line with our estimates, we don't put money in the market,"" said Jinesh Gopani, head of equities at Axis Mutual Fund in Mumbai."

Mumbai: Investors and the market should not expect any big surprises from the first Budget by the finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman today, economists at largest private sector lender HDFC Bank have said.
Citing ""time constraint"", they said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman's first budget will ""broadly be a replication"" of the interim budget, with some action on the election promises and some tweaks on the tax and expenditure figures.
The room for a fiscal stimulus is ""constrained"" considering that achieving the interim budget's target of 3.4% can in itself be a ""tall order"", they said in a note penciled Thursday.
Follow Budget 2019 LIVE updates here
Stating that fiscal deficit assumptions in the interim budget rested on a higher nominal growth of 11.5%, it warned that if the slowdown and low inflation spill into the first half, nominal growth can be much lower than what is being currently assumed.
There can be some revisions on the revenue side as the interim budget implied a robust 34% growth in tax collections, but such a buoyancy is not possible even in a good growth year, they said.
There are bigger constraints on the expenditure side, it said, adding the fiscal commitments to the ongoing schemes are already high and financing for them can be an issue.
However, the report noted that in FY19, government had cut expenditure by a whopping  ₹1.45 trillion, resorted to off-budget borrowings and transferred its expenditure to central enterprises to meet the fiscal deficit target.
The ""key issue"" in the budget will be the quantum of ""surplus"" that the RBI will transfer, it said, adding the most optimistic of the figures in this is  ₹3 trillion and this can open up space for expansionary fiscal policy.
However, the economists said their baseline scenario is for a staggered payout of any money ""given the clear lack of consensus"" in the Bimal Jalan panel that has been formed to decide this amount and the signal of erosion of the RBI's independence.

247,2019-07-06,HDFC,"This exclusive excerpt from a new book tells the story of HDFC Bank’s digital journey Author Tamal Bandyopadhyay recounts how the bank disrupted itself to protect its turf

After an 18-hour flight back, Aditya Puri (the managing director of HDFC Bank) went straight to his office to hold a meeting as he wanted to “kick everyone’s ass"" and prepare them for disruption.
Around 20 people—senior management and business heads—were in the boardroom on the sixth floor of HDFC Bank’s headquarters in central Mumbai, Bank House. A bleary-eyed, jet-lagged Aditya said there were four kinds of fintech companies responsible for disruptions in the financial services space—loan dotcom companies processing loan approvals at the speed of light; payment companies such as Alipay and ApplePay; wealth advisories using mathematical algorithms to advise customers based on their risk profiles; and finally, the payment wallets.
Aditya said that all the hype over fintech or tech companies taking over the business could be true but they would still have to ride on top of a banking network. If a bank owned the network, how could a third party viably sell OTT products on that network? The network, merchant and customer belonged to the bank. Could somebody take away their business by merely promising a good payment experience? He also believed that HDFC Bank had all the elements and the right technology in place and should rapidly transform itself into a digital bank....
Aditya’s message was clear: Why don’t we disrupt ourselves, instead of allowing a third party to do that? He told the group heads that they would have to look at changes, absorb them and strategize on their businesses.
He was clinical in his approach, asking everyone to set a date for conceptualization and implementation of action plans. No one should be living in a cocoon, he said, with typical Punjabi bluntness....
Missed Call Banking
The focus was to understand customer behaviour and come up with innovative ideas. By November 2013, the team came up with their first product—‘missed call banking’.
The focus of the bank at that time was on the rural markets where customers were not using internet banking, mobile banking or apps. Analysing their behaviour, it was found that much like people around the world, rural customers want to just reassure themselves that their money is safe in the bank; for this purpose, the customers keep on checking their balance every now and then.
Checking the balance is a global phenomenon. Bankers across the world try to simplify the process. This was the first item on the team’s agenda.
They introduced a series of services that could be invoked by calling a toll-free number. 1800 270 3333: Checking the balance. A text message would be sent with the balance. There were other numbers for the rest of the services.
The service, initially meant for the rural population, was soon offered to all. Though it was not new or technologically advanced (it required a simple interface for the registered number to connect to the bank and retrieve the balance) and had already been introduced by a few government-owned banks, HDFC Bank was the first to implement it at such a scale.
It was an effective marketing tool for inducing customers to open accounts. Branch staff prepared stickers and pasted them on the back of customers’ handsets so they could remember the number. Almost one million people started using it within three months of introduction.
The team initially didn’t want to call it ‘missed call banking’. After much research, they had come up with ‘toll free mobile banking’ but found it too long. It was never officially named but the informal name stuck. About 4 million people use ‘missed call banking’ every month.
Bank Aapki Mutthi Mein
Aditya wanted a digital strategy rather than just introducing digital products and services. Being a life cycle bank, it wanted to start early with customers through a careful onboarding process, get them to start using products and services, build capabilities around intelligent marketing analytics and then, over a period of time, do much of their banking with it.
The meeting after Aditya’s Silicon Valley trip was a turning point, which Nitin (Chugh, Country Head, Digital Banking) calls the ‘Muhurtam’. Once he and Corporate Communications Chief, Neeraj Jha, were in Aditya’s cabin discussing a possible tagline for the digital bank. While they all agreed that digital banking would empower the customers, Aditya liked a line in the press release, ‘Bank Aapki Mutthi Mein’. One of Nitin’s team members had used the term ‘Go Digital’ as the subject of an email. They combined the two and found the tagline—‘Go Digital: Bank Aapki Mutthi Mein’.
The campaign was launched in Varanasi. Perhaps, because it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s constituency. Nitin said it has been an old market for the bank and also a melting pot for all segments of customers, including traders and weavers. There were six branches in Varanasi and all of them had high transaction volumes. At the annual dinner in December at his Lonavala bungalow, Aditya announced that Nitin would go to Varanasi on 16 December 2014, to launch the digital bank.
Nitin bought an iPhone 6 to display the applications at the first-ever press conference that he would address on a boat on the Ganges. It was to be followed by another meet with the media at the Gateway Hotel Ganges.
He was nervous but Aditya, who was in Delhi at that time, sought to put him at ease over the phone. Nitin, the Corporate Communications team, a local branch manager and the media boarded the boat, which was decked up with helium balloons that were to be released at the time of the launch. There were also a few customers, representing different segments of business and trade.
Nitin was supposed to hold the placard with the tagline and then the balloons were to be released. Everything went as per the schedule and he started speaking in a mix of Hindi and English, when one of the housekeeping staff on the boat used a lighter to free a bunch of helium balloons that hadn’t got released along with the others. There was a minor explosion, leading to mild panic when it seemed that the boat was on fire.
Back at the hotel, Nitin made his presentation and demonstrated the services on his new iPhone. The launch received some attention from the national media but, for the local papers, it was a big hit.
In retrospect, Nitin feels the minor explosion at the launch was a good omen. From 44% of overall transactions in March 2013, digital transactions grew to 55% in March 2014, 63% in March 2015, 71% in March 2016, 80% in March 2017 and 85% in March 2018. HDFC Bank has successfully transformed itself into a digital bank—transactions via phone banking have been reduced to 1%, while the share of branch banking is at 8% and Automated Teller Machine (ATM) transactions are at 6%.

MUMBAI :
Noted banker Aditya Puri has advised his peers to clearly separate personal friendships from banking and cited how his bank turned down a loan request from the now-fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya.
Explaining how HDFC Bank had refused loans to the ex- liquor barren Mallya, Puri said, ""a banker can have a coffee with any person and then do what he wants,"" stressing that it was his long time colleague Paresh Sukthankar who actually declined the loan to Mallya.
""If you are a bad risk, you are a bad risk. You can be my good friend, I can give you coffee and send you away. Just for your information, they (Mallya's officials) came to me for a loan and I gave them coffee and told them that I will consider the loan. And then Paresh turned it down,"" the HDFC Bank chief said, at function of launching a book on the bank by journalist writer Tamal Bandopadyay here this evening.
Every time the call came, Mallya used to abuse and his blood pressure would go up. So, friendship and banking is not co-related, he stressed.
Such clear thinking about lending and risk management has never disappointed the lender, whose stock command one the highest premia across global banks and has been known for having one of the lowest NPA ratios in the industry and consistently clocking over 20%  profit growth in the past 10 years and more.
For March 2019 quarter, the bank reported a 23% spike net income, while its gross NPAs came down to a paltry 1.36%, while the industry average is close 10 percent.
Launching the book--HDFC Bank 2.0--which speaks how the largest private sector lender embraced digital changes, State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar said opening of the banking sector after the 1991 reforms to the private sector was a ""defining moment"" which changed the entire landscape.
On the decision of the bankers led by SBI to send Jet Airways for bankruptcy, he said the airline company in ""more able hands"" of the resolution professionals now.
""We have left Jet in more able hands than us, which is the resolution professional,"" Kumar said. He also said banking is undergoing a ""transformational change"" and urged lenders to play the game without getting unnerved.
In an apparent reference to ongoing issues, he said banks will have to undergo the pan for a cleaner and efficient system which will help in the future.
Speaking on the bonhomie between bankers, Kumar said he had his rival Uday Kotak address SBI's top management last year and also the head of HDFC Bank's data analytics.
In a barb aimed at payment companies, he wondered how valuations of companies are going up with the surge in losses.
Puri said HDFC Bank is done 90% with its aim to be a lifestyle bank and in the next three months, certain clunky things will be done away with.
He also said there is no need for a fully digital bank, stressing that someone may be willing to go in physically as well, to which the SBI head chipped in saying a bank's physical presence is the strength on which digital products can grow."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

245,2019-07-10,HDFC,"HDFC had moved the NCLT to recover an amount of  ₹41 crore﻿To recover the remaining amount, HDFC filed an insolvency plea against RHC Holding before the NCLT

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday dismissed a petition by HDFC to initiate insolvency proceedings against RHC Holding, an entity promoted by billionaire brothers Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh.
A two-member bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya upheld the order of the principal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) which had rejected HDFC's plea.
The appellate tribunal said it found ""no merits"" in HDFC's petition and said that non-bank financial lenders come under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and should seek remedies from the central bank, not the bankruptcy court.
Passing an order on 6 December 2018, the NCLT had observed that RHC Holding was a non-banking financial company and does not come under the purview of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
HDFC had then approached the appellate tribunal to challenge the NCLT's ruling.
The mortgage lender had moved the NCLT to recover an amount of  ₹41 crore.
RHC Holding, promoted by the Singh brothers, had taken a loan of  ₹200 crore from HDFC in April 2016. RHC Holding had paid the interest for the first quarter on time but later started defaulting on its dues.
According to HDFC, even after adjusting the proceeds from the sale of pledged shares, an amount of  ₹41.09 crore remained due.
To recover the remaining amount, HDFC filed an insolvency plea against RHC Holding before the NCLT.
The NCLAT had in January this year issued notices to RHC Holding and other parties and directed them to file their replies.

NEW DELHI :
Noted banker Aditya Puri has advised his peers to clearly separate personal friendships from banking and cited how his bank turned down a loan request from the now-fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya.
Explaining how HDFC Bank had refused loans to the ex- liquor barren Mallya, Puri said, ""a banker can have a coffee with any person and then do what he wants,"" stressing that it was his long time colleague Paresh Sukthankar who actually declined the loan to Mallya.
""If you are a bad risk, you are a bad risk. You can be my good friend, I can give you coffee and send you away. Just for your information, they (Mallya's officials) came to me for a loan and I gave them coffee and told them that I will consider the loan. And then Paresh turned it down,"" the HDFC Bank chief said, at function of launching a book on the bank by journalist writer Tamal Bandopadyay here this evening.
Every time the call came, Mallya used to abuse and his blood pressure would go up. So, friendship and banking is not co-related, he stressed.
Such clear thinking about lending and risk management has never disappointed the lender, whose stock command one the highest premia across global banks and has been known for having one of the lowest NPA ratios in the industry and consistently clocking over 20 percent profit growth in the past 10 years and more.
For March 2019 quarter, the bank reported a 23 percent spike net income, while its gross NPAs came down to a paltry 1.36 percent, while the industry average is close 10 percent.
Launching the book--HDFC Bank 2.0--which speaks how the largest private sector lender embraced digital changes, State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar said opening of the banking sector after the 1991 reforms to the private sector was a ""defining moment"" which changed the entire landscape.
On the decision of the bankers led by SBI to send Jet Airways for bankruptcy, he said the airline company in ""more able hands"" of the resolution professionals now.
""We have left Jet in more able hands than us, which is the resolution professional,"" Kumar said. He also said banking is undergoing a ""transformational change"" and urged lenders to play the game without getting unnerved.
In an apparent reference to ongoing issues, he said banks will have to undergo the pan for a cleaner and efficient system which will help in the future.
Speaking on the bonhomie between bankers, Kumar said he had his rival Uday Kotak address SBI's top management last year and also the head of HDFC Bank's data analytics.
In a barb aimed at payment companies, he wondered how valuations of companies are going up with the surge in losses.
Puri said HDFC Bank is done 90 percent with its aim to be a lifestyle bank and in the next three months, certain clunky things will be done away with.
He also said there is no need for a fully digital bank, stressing that someone may be willing to go in physically as well, to which the SBI head chipped in saying a bank's physical presence is the strength on which digital products can grow.

240,2019-07-12,HDFC,"Of DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt,  ₹38,000 crore has been raised from banks. The rest was raised by selling debt securitiesDHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July

Mumbai: Lenders to Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) are planning to ask the company’s 86,000 non-convertible debenture holders to be part of the inter-creditor agreement to pre-empt likely litigation over dues, three bankers aware of the matter said.
Seven state-run lenders to DHFL, including State Bank of India and Union Bank of India, met 300 institutional bondholders comprising mutual funds, provident funds and pension funds on Thursday to explore options of working together to restructure DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt. DHFL’s chairman Kapil Wadhawan was also part of the meeting.
“We are looking at restructuring the company as a going concern. Lenders will work with NCD holders, shoulder-to-shoulder, to realize the maximum value,"" said a senior banker, one of the three cited above, on the condition of anonymity. “It’s not mandatory on the part of NCD holders to sign the ICA.""
Of DHFL’s total  ₹1 trillion debt as of February,  ₹38,000 crore has been borrowed from banks. The remaining amount was raised by selling debt securities. On 5 July, close to 30 banks signed the ICA to restructure the debt of the home financier.
The decision to include these investors as part of ICA is mainly to prevent NCD holders from moving the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover outstanding dues, stalling the restructuring process. Currently, financial institutions cannot be referred to the National Company’s Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings.
The Indian Banks’ Association, on behalf of lenders, has already written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to permit investors to participate in the ICA. Under the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines on resolution of stressed assets released on 7 June, only banks and non-banking financial companies are allowed to be part of the ICA.
However, in the case of DHFL, as the number of debenture holders is large, lenders say that the debenture trustees can seek permission from these holders before signing the ICA. This involves going through a voting process and giving the holders 21 days’ time to exercise their vote.
Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd and IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd act as the debenture trustees for the NCDs issued by the housing company.
“This is the first time that NCD holders could be part of a restructuring process. There are not too many cases where such a large portion of debt is being held by NCD holders,"" said the second banker, also requesting anonymity. “DRT is equipped to handle these cases. Hence it’s necessary that it goes through restructuring,"" he added.
Meanwhile, DHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July.
The restructuring plan, which is being prepared under RBI’s 7 June circular, could include extension of the tenure of loans, conversion of debt into equity, infusion of fresh working capital and induction of a new management team and financial investors.
Currently, DHFL is a “special mention account-zero"", indicating an asset where interest and principal is not overdue for more than 30 days and the account exhibits signs of incipient stress. Lenders have to ensure the restructuring is completed by end-September in order to avoid the account being classified as non-performing.
Under RBI’s new framework, lenders have 30 days to decide on a resolution plan. The decision of lenders who constitute 75% by value of total outstanding facilities (fund-based as well non-fund based) and 60% by number shall be binding on all other lenders.
DHFL’s consortium of lenders also includes Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. SBI has the largest exposure of around  ₹10,000 crore.
Over the past few months, DHFL has sold retail loans worth ₹30,000 crore. It has also sold several of its strategic assets, including affordable housing arm Aadhar Housing Finance Ltd, educational loan business Avanse and DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers. In January, DHFL sold wholesale loans worth  ₹1,375 crore to alternative investment management fund Oaktree Capital, which buys distressed loan portfolios at a discount."

Mumbai: Indian equities are likely to rise on global support. Asian shares inched up on Tuesday as traders awaited US retail sales data and more corporate earnings to gauge the health of the world’s biggest economy, with markets remaining focused on a likely US rate cut by the end of the month.
Investors were relieved by encouraging Chinese economic data on the previous day, though broad pressure across global business and investment from Sino-US trade frictions and slowing world growth reinforced expectations of policy easing by major central banks.
The US data on Tuesday is expected to show that retail sales gained 0.1% in June, according to the median estimate of economists polled by Reuters. But a decline in net interest margin reported by Citigroup in its mixed quarterly report underlined risks for financial firms in a lower interest rate environment.
Signs of trade tensions weighing on corporate profits and the fading impact of tax cuts would underscore the US Federal Reserve’s concerns over slowing business investment, he said. Markets are fully priced for a 25-basis point cut by the Fed at its meeting at the end of this month.
Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.04%. That followed small gains on Wall Street overnight, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.1%, the S&P 500 gaining 0.02% and the Nasdaq Composite adding 0.17%. Australian shares were up 0.1% and Japan’s Nikkei stock index dipped 0.36%.
Back home, India’s imports declined to their lowest level in four months in June to $40.29 billion, down 9% from a year ago, indicating weakening consumption in Asia’s third largest economy, economists said. The Indian economy grew at 5.8% in the January-March period, a five-year low, hurt by weak consumption and tepid private investment. The latest data added to fears that the economy may have slowed further in April-June.
Meanwhile, mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) needs between  ₹2,500 crore and  ₹3,000 crore of fresh equity investments to sustain lending operations, according to a Mint report.
Key companies that will release June quarter earnings on Tuesday are HDFC Asset Management Company, DCB and Federal Bank among others.
Ahead of the release of US retail sales figures, signs of an improving economic situation in the United States have led to a steepening of the US yield curve, led by higher longer-dated yields. On Tuesday, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes turned down slightly to 2.087% compared with its US close of 2.092% on Monday.
The two-year yield, closely watched as a gauge of traders’ expectations for Fed fund rates, extended its falls to 1.829% compared with a US close of 1.833%.
In the currency market, the dollar was up 0.12% against the yen at 108.03, and the euro was flat, buying $1.1255. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was largely unchanged at 96.957.
Oil prices, which had risen amid concerns over the impact of a tropical storm on US Gulf Coast production, eased on signs any impact would be short lived, and as slowing Chinese growth drove a reassessment of the outlook for crude demand. US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, fell 0.18% to $59.36 a barrel and Brent crude, the global benchmark, dipped to $66.36 per barrel.
Gold was slightly higher, with spot gold trading at $1,414.32 per ounce.

HDFC AMC reported a 42% increase in net profit, driven by an increase in assets under management. Its net profit for the June quarter rose to  ₹291.79 crore, as compared to  ₹205.26 in the same quarter of the previous year. Its total income increased to  ₹552.75 crore as compared by  ₹501.19 crore in the year-earlier quarter. The AMC is the largest actively managed equity-oriented mutual fund manager in the country.
AUM or assets under management rose 18% to  ₹3,56,700 crore, a year on year increase of 18%. AUM in actively managed equity oriented funds i.e. equity oriented total AUM excluding arbitrage funds and index funds grew to  ₹1,68,900 crore as on June 30, 2019 with a market share of 16.2%.
During the quarter, HDFC AMC decided to provide liquidity arrangement to certain Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) of HDFC Mutual Fund, to deal with the illiquidity faced by such FMPs due to their exposure to certain Non Convertible Debentures (NCDs). The liquidity arrangement entailed acquisition of such NCDs by the company from these FMPs. Consequently, during the quarter, the company has purchased such NCDs amounting to  ₹426.45 crore at the prevailing valuation yields/prices provided by independent rating agencies.
These NCDs are secured by a pledge of certain listed equity shares. These NCDs are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit and loss and have been appropriately valued at quarter end.

233,2019-07-17,HDFC,"While HDFC AMC has performed well on several of its schemes, a slump in market could impact AUM growthHDFC AMC posted a 42% year-on-year rise in net profits in the first quarter of FY20, beating Street estimates

Cuts in total expense ratios were supposed to impact the asset growth of asset management companies. But instead some asset management companies such as HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd seem to be coming out unscathed.
HDFC AMC posted a 42% year-on-year rise in net profits in the first quarter of FY20, beating Street estimates.
Phasing out of upfront commissions paid by asset management companies has seen a reduction in commission costs. This was down 86% year on year in the June quarter.
Besides, due to its larger proportion of sticky retail assets, the impact of cuts in total expense ratio (TER) has been negligible. HDFC AMC has managed to pass on a large proportion of the TER cuts to distributors. As a result, growth impact on the topline has been minimal. Revenues increased 7% year on year to  ₹504.4 crore.
“In line with management expectations, the blended net impact on the topline was around 3 basis points of equity AUM (around 1.5 bps on overall AUM), with the distributors absorbing the impact of the rest,"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a client note.
Besides, the cut in commissions due to total expense ratio reductions has not impacted asset growth. HDFC AMC’s total assets under management increased by 18% year-on-year to  ₹3.56 trillion. Actively managed AUMs, where profit margins are higher, increased 15% year on year.
A good thing is that new flows have become more profitable after upfront commissions to distributors were banned. Earlier, new inflows were only marginally profitable at best for AMCs. Additionally, HDFC AMC also increased fees on liquid funds, cushioning the impact of TER cuts to an extent.
But margin growth from here on could be impacted, if trail commissions on these new inflows are increased to compensate for the lower upfront commissions.
Another worry for the fund house is the impact of the bonds of the Essel Group the fund has taken on its books. As HDFC AMC has already paid out the bondholders, a shortfall in repayment from the Essel Group could impact profits. Though this is one-time event, analysts say the fund house could need to provide for the same, thus impairing profit growth next quarter.
Another thing to watch for is churn in assets. While HDFC AMC has performed on several of its schemes, a slump in the market or scheme performance could impact AUM growth.
Shareholders, though, are not complaining. The stock has zoomed 7.2% since its results were announced and 29.6% in the past two months. Investors should note that the stock looks pricey at about 43 times trailing 12-month earnings."

MUMBAI :
Ajay Piramal-controlled Piramal Enterprises Ltd has raised  ₹1,500 crore from Standard Chartered Bank through non-convertible debentures (NCD), said two people aware of the development.
The money will be used to meet working capital requirements of the group, including for the lending business Piramal Capital and Housing Finance and for upcoming debt-related payment obligations, said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak with the media.
“The financing from Standard Chartered will go towards meeting near-term needs and has a repayment date in January 2020,"" he said.
According to Piramal Enterprises’ regulatory filings, in the past week, the company has made principal and coupon payments on outstanding debt worth around  ₹1,700 crore. These comprised large loans from HDFC Bank and Deutsche Bank, which had subscribed to NCDs worth  ₹1,000 crore and  ₹590 crore respectively in 2016, the filings showed.
An email sent to Piramal Group on 19 June did not elicit any response. A spokesperson for Standard Chartered declined to comment.
The financing from Standard Chartered is part of the group’s plans to raise more debt financing from long-term sources of funds, said the second person cited above.
“They (Piramal Enterprises) have significantly improved their borrowing mix towards long-term sources of funds. The company has raised nearly  ₹16,500 crore of bank loans and NCDs during the second half of fiscal 2019 and has reduced its exposure of commercial paper to  ₹8,900 crore from  ₹18,000 crore, in the same period,"" he said.
The company’s latest investor presentation says banks contributed 71% of its total borrowing mix as of 31 March, up from 49% at September end.
The group is also planning to tap foreign currency borrowings and further increase borrowing from banks, the presentation said.
On 9 July, rating agency Crisil reaffirmed a rating of A1+ on the commercial paper programme of Piramal Enterprises, followed by a reaffirmation of Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd’s A1+ rating for its commercial paper programme worth  ₹10,500 crore."
228,2019-07-22,HDFC,"Aditya Puri’s shoes are too big to fill, considering that he has steered HDFC Bank since the beginningAnalysts believe that in the next few quarters too, loan growth could be moderate compared with the bank’s historic performance

Silver jubilee years could bring a sense of satisfaction or even a quarter-life crisis.
For HDFC Bank investors, it brings both.
The private lender reported stellar profitability metrics yet again and decided to distribute an interim dividend to mark its 25th year of operations. Net profit grew 21% and toxic levels for the loan book remained at one of the lowest in the industry.
HDFC Bank’s secret sauce for its pristine balance sheet is no secret at all. The bank has been a retail lender for long, with corporate loans accounting for less than half of its portfolio, unlike its peers where these loans dominate.
That and the fact that loan growth has been over 20% consistently have helped keep bad loan ratios at low levels.
But there is more to it than meets the eye.
As the chart above shows, HDFC Bank’s bad loan stockpile has been volatile and so have been its provisions in recent years.
This shows that even the strongest player is not immune to the headwinds of a slowing economy and overleveraged industry.
For the June quarter, it had to increase provisions by 60% as stress from agriculture loans rose as also stress emerged on its exposure to non-bank lenders. Given the consumption slowdown, HDFC Bank doesn’t want to take a chance on its unsecured loans either. The management, in a conference call with analysts, said that it is cautious about lending to non-banks and has ramped up provisioning for unsecured loans.
Moreover, its loan growth has decelerated sharply to 17.1%, led by a slowdown in vehicle loans. This was expected as Indians haven’t been buying cars and bikes at a rate their makers wanted in the last two years at least. “HDFC Bank is most dominant in two-wheeler financing within the private banks, two-wheeler book constituting 8% of its vehicle finance book,"" analysts at brokerage firm Jefferies had noted in April.
For the June quarter, vehicle loans grew just 8% compared with 12% in the previous quarter.
Analysts believe that in the next few quarters too, loan growth could be moderate compared with the bank’s historic performance. That said, analysts are hopeful the bank will continue growing its core income at historic trend. “We expect company to grow its NII (net interest income) at a CAGR of 20% over the next two financial years. Healthy advances growth and cross sell opportunities in the existing high quality deposit franchise will help in delivering strong NII going forward,"" brokerage firm Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Ltd said in a note.
Even so, the slowdown in loan growth comes at a time when the bank is staring at a top management change. This is a key overhang for the stock.
Managing director Aditya Puri will exit halfway through FY21, given that service age for bank executives is capped at 70 years. Puri’s shoes are too big to fill, considering he steered the bank since the beginning. It is searching for a successor, a task that got tougher after deputy Paresh Sukthankar left last year.
HDFC Bank’s 25 years have been marked with a balance sheet built out by avoiding loans to infrastructure and other dodgy borrowers. Investors have a year and a half to find out whether the successor will take decisions similar to Puri’s.
Meanwhile, the stock trades at a multiple of 3.3 times its estimated book value for FY21, cheaper than that of Kotak Mahindra Bank, another lender with enviable asset quality."
227,2019-07-22,HDFC,"Good Host Spaces aims for a fourfold expansion from the current 14,000 beds to 65,000 beds in the next 18 monthsThe firm, which is co-owned by HDFC, plans to expand to tier-I and II cities

BENGALURU :
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.-backed student housing startup Good Host Spaces Pvt. Ltd is aiming for a fourfold expansion, from the current 14,000 beds to 65,000 beds in the next 18 months, at a time when India’s student housing space is seeing strong demand with robust growth potential.
The 18-month-old company, co-owned by Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), currently operates in Jaipur, Bengaluru, Manipal and Punjab, and plans to be present in more tier-I and II cities, across all price points.
The current demand for Purpose Built Student Accommodation (PBSA) in India totals more than 8 million bed spaces, which is expected to grow at 8% annually to 13 million beds by 2025, according to the Global Student Property 2019 Report by Knight Frank. Around $100 million was invested into India’s PBSA market in 2018.
Good Home Spaces partners with colleges to provide specialized, custom-built student housing services. The partnership provides an opportunity for educational institutions to monetize their non-core student housing to pour back into their core business of offering education. The startup takes a long-term view to upgrade, invest in and run the on-campus student housing.
“...Many are trying to build a real track record around the opportunity of student housing, including off campus models combined with living with non-students and temporary stay, single adults. Our approach is a differentiated ‘on campus student housing’ model that partners closely with the university to maintain, not just quality protocols, but also safety, cultural and disciplinary standards in educating children,"" Nimesh Grover, chief executive officer, Good Host Spaces, said in a telephonic interview.
The annual rentals per bed vary from  ₹60,000-250,000, offering flexible price points.
Just like co-working and co-living, institutional investors are backing student housing startups that have mainly come up in the last two years. Stanza Living, funded by investors like Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and others, has reached a pan-India inventory of 22,000 beds. In 2018, Warburg Pincus and Lemon Tree Hotels set up a joint venture, Hamstede Living Pvt. Ltd, to invest  ₹3,000 crore to build full-service accommodation for students and young working professionals.
“The bulk of the student housing demand is serviced by the unorganized sector comprising of rented accommodations and private hostels. The demand-supply gap coupled with strong fundamentals of the sector have led to an increase in investor interest to develop and operate well-located, high-quality purpose-built accommodation,"" said Saurabh Mehrotra, national director of advisory services at Knight Frank India."
226,2019-07-22,HDFC,"Asia stocks eased on Monday as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by FedKotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, DHFL, ICICI Securities and others to declare their Q1 results today

Mumbai: The Indian equity markets are expected to be wobbly amidst weak global peers. Asia stocks eased on Monday as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, while heightened Middle East tensions following an Iranian seizure of a British tanker lifted crude oil prices.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1%. South Korea's KOSPI shed 0.3%, Australian stocks lost 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5%.
Global equity markets had risen briefly towards the end of last week after dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams boosted the prospect of the central bank lowering rates by 50 basis points at its 30-31 July meeting.
But the stock markets gave back those gains on Friday, with Wall Street shares ending in negative territory, after the New York Fed walked back Williams’ comments by saying his speech was not about potential policy action at the upcoming Fed meeting.
Expectations for a 50 basis points cut were scaled back further after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was likely to cut rates by 25 bps when it meets later this month, and may make further cuts in the future given global growth and trade uncertainties.
Back home, key companies which will announce their June quarter results on Monday are Kotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor Company, ICICI Securities, Just Dial, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Mastek.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL)and HDFC Bank are likely to be in focus on Monday after they announced their June quarter earnings after markets closed for trading last week. Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday reported a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net profit for the June quarter, beating Street estimates on the back of strong performances by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail. RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to $8.1 a barrel—an 18-quarter-low for the company.
HDFC Bank Ltd on Saturday said its first quarter net profit rose 21% on account of higher provisions and other income. Asset quality deteriorated marginally as gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, rose to 1.4% in the June quarter compared to 1.33% in the year-ago period.
Meanwhile, the dollar and US Treasury yields rose on the greater likelihood of a shallower 25 bps rate cut.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 97.152 after rising 0.4% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stretched Friday’s rise and climbed to 2.058%.
The greenback was nearly flat at 107.830 yen after adding 0.4% on Friday thanks to the rise in US yields. The euro was little changed at $1.1218 after shedding 0.5% on Friday.
In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 1.26% at $63.26 per barrel following a gain of about 0.9% on Friday. Crude was buoyant after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Friday captured a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf after Britain seized an Iranian vessel earlier this month, further raising tensions along a vital international oil shipping route.
Gold slipped from a six-year high as the dollar firmed and as expectations for a deep rate cut by the Fed were dialed back.
Spot gold traded at $1,425.82 an ounce after going as high as $1,452.60 on Friday, its strongest since May 2013.

Mumbai: Investors of HDFC twins -- HDFC Bank Ltd and HDFC Ltd, on Monday lost nearly $6.40 billion of its market value tracking a fall in the local equity markets.
HDFC Bank slipped 3.5% to  ₹2,294 with erasing over  ₹25,000 crore market value while HDFC Ltd slumped 5.01% to  ₹2,188.50 with eroding  ₹20,000 crore of its market capitalisation.

Local equity markets fell for third sessions with dropping nearly 3.3% or erased 1,300 points after the government refused any respite to foreign investors registered as trusts from proposed super rich tax.
On Saturday, HDFC Bank Ltd reported 20% year on year its June quarter earnings on the back of robust net interest income of 23% driven by 15% loan growth and 10 basis points improvement in margin to 4.3%.
Provisions grew 23% quarter on quarter to  ₹2,610 crore. Provision numbers were higher on account of Contingent provision of  ₹165 crore, bank has stepped up its provisioning rate for unsecured book, higher provisions in Agri portfolio and general provision of  ₹85 crore for HFC/NBFC sector.
Kotak Institutional Equities in a 21 July note believe that there are a few risks emerging – a few risks that we have highlighted in the past: Revenue growth could be slower from here as NIM, which is at peak levels, could decline on slower unsecured loan growth as well as slower than loan growth of CASA deposits and fee income has a high share coming from the cards business, which is slowing down, management is guiding for an improvement in cost-income ratio but a rising deterioration, if any from unsecured loans, could result in higher investments for collection efforts and gross NPL in retail is growing steadily, which implies that we are already past the best in the retail cycle. Credit costs have risen in recent years to 100 bps from 60 bps a few years earlier and a pullback in credit costs, looks a bit challenging.
""The balance sheet has started to slow and we need to see if there is any impact on earnings and asset quality. Despite a slowdown in the balance sheet, the share of unsecured loans continues to increase and is relatively high at 18% of loans. Any sharp slowdown in the high-yielding segment can impact operating profits while provisions could rise reflecting this change. Early warning NPL indicators are still stable,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities."

Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd reported a 32.7% jump in its first-quarter profit on Monday, but its results fell marginally shy of estimates and it became the third private-sector Indian bank in a row to sound a cautionary note about the slowing pace of domestic growth.
The lender, helmed by billionaire Uday Kotak who is one of Asia's richest bankers, said its advances in the June quarter rose 18%, compared with a rise of 24% a year ago.
""The corporate loan book grew slowly in the June quarter,"" said Jaimin Bhatt, chief financial officer of Kotak Mahindra Bank, at a press briefing following the bank's results. ""And on the retail front, we've seen negative growth in auto loans both on a year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter basis.""
A series of factors from distress in the rural economy due to a run of droughts in key agricultural belts, to a liquidity crunch in the shadow banking sector following the collapse of infrastructure lender IL&FS, has led to a rapid cooling in the domestic economy, presenting a challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government as it begins its second term.
Dipak Gupta, joint managing director at Kotak Mahindra Bank, warned the small and medium enterprises segment continued to be a pain point.
""We've been cautious about the slowdown for some six to nine months and will continue to remain cautious,"" said Gupta, adding that the bank was seeing some stress in its unsecured loan book, but this was ""not at alarming levels"".
HDFC Bank, the largest private bank in the country, also warned of slower retail loan growth, in an analyst call on Saturday after announcing its results. The bank stated that the slowdown in the auto sector and stress in the agricultural space were hurting growth.
Following the warning, HDFC Bank's stock on Monday closed at an over two-month low. Its warning came close of the heels of one from smaller rival RBL Bank, which also saw its stock plunge after it flagged risks to its asset quality and warned of a rise in bad loans.
Meanwhile, Kotak's gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans came in slightly higher at 2.19% by the end of June, versus 2.14% at the end of the March quarter and 2.17% in the same period a year ago. The bank said it expected its credit cost to remain in the range of 50-60 basis points, as guided earlier.
The banks in Asia's third largest economy have been dealing with a huge pile of stressed loans worth over $150 billion, with the state-run banks holding the vast majority of the bad debt.
The warnings from the private sector lenders like HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, which have been investor darlings, have amplified concerns around slowing growth and spooked investors.

The non participatory product that HDFC Life had launched was the force behind this margin spike. Sale of non-participatory policies surged which nearly halved the share of market linked products to 26% in overall portfolio.
Unit linked insurance products or ULIPs are low margin business and also carry market risk. But they bring immediate growth during bull market times.
Non participatory products on the other hand carry balance sheet risks unless the life insurer is adequately hedged.
Therefore, it is obvious that the outlook on margins depend on the sustained success of this product. “Key to watch out for, is thus, how does this segment scale and effectiveness of relying on flows from shorter duration products to hedge re-investment risk,"" said Jefferies in a note.
The management said that ULIPs share will be far lower than it was in previous quarters. However, there is no guarantee that the overall product mix would change.
Ergo, analysts believe that margins have peaked. “HDFCL’s margins have peaked out for now, given a skewed product mix toward non-par savings (largely due to Sanchay plus sale) and should normalize to c. 27% in FY20E from 29.8% in Q1FY20,"" said analysts at Emkay Global in a note.
Business growth continued to be strong for the insurer with total annualised premium equivalent (APE) growing at a brisk pace of 67%.
Larger rival SBI Life Insurance Co also released its results which showed growth has surprised on the upside. The insurer’s APE grew at a robust 41% and given the size of the company, the double digit growth is impressive.
SBI Life’s portfolio continues to have a large share of ULIPs but its protection business has grown by leaps and bounds. The margin friendly protection business formed 14% of new business premium but is still just 4.4% of the total product mix.
Perhaps this explains why HDFC Life’s valuations are higher than the larger SBI Life.
While SBI Life’s strength lies in its access to the largest branch network of its parent State Bank of India, HDFC Life too has ramped up its distribution. In fact, online sales that typically result in better persistency ratios have been higher for HDFC Life.
Indians not only buy insurance online but also stick with their purchases.
Shares of both the life insurers have gained today but the key question is sustainability of these growth rates and margins."

Mumbai: Extending losses for the fifth consecutive session, equity benchmark BSE Sensex lost 135 points while the NSE Nifty fell below the 11,300 mark on Wednesday after the IMF cut India's growth outlook.
After swinging 394 points, the 30-share Sensex ended 135.09 points or 0.36% lower at 37,847.65. It hit an intra-day low of 37,708.41 and a high of 38,102.84.

Last Saturday, the lenders in renewed bid to sell the remaining assets invited expression of interest from interested parties with a deadline of August 3.
Financial creditors, who also include banks, have made 37 claims worth  ₹10,231 crore as of July 4, he said. The list of financial creditors, whose claims have been admitted include 14 domestic banks and financial institutions, 12 foreign banks and eight lessors, the RP said.

KKR in a statement Tuesday said it had invested in the popular coffee chain nine years ago and part-exited the investment last year.

""We are deeply saddened by the developments and our thoughts are with his family at this time. We believe in VG Siddhartha and had invested in the company about nine years ago,"" KKR said in a statement.
It can be noted that generally, private equity funds have a shorter investment horizon of say one to seven years wherein they help an invested company grow and exit.
The 57-year-old Siddhartha, the son-in-law of former Union minister SM Krishna, has also blamed pressure from lenders and the tax department in the letter and has even named a director-level income tax officer in his apparent suicide note.
Meanwhile, mortgage major HDFC denied it has any exposure to any of the companies associated with Siddhartha.

MUMBAI :
HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh exuded optimism that the slowdown, driven by lower consumption, is ""temporary"" in nature as there is adequate demand for assets across the country.
There has been a distinct slowdown in the economy which was reflected in the lower GDP growth of 6.8% in FY19, he said.
""While there has been an across-the-board slowdown in consumption, given the inherent demand and low penetration levels, I believe this is temporary in nature,"" he told the shareholders at the 42nd AGM here Friday.
There remains adequate demand for affordable housing across the country, which is supported by the government flagship credit-linked subsidy scheme and incentives provided to developers to increase the supply of affordable homes.
The demand for commercial real estate has been buoyant, especially across the top eight cities, he added. ""One is seeing increased demand for commercial real estate, particularly from the IT sector, e-commerce and professional and services sector,"" Parekh said, adding even the demand for retail space has picked up in certain pockets.
In recent times, several investors such as pension funds, sovereign funds and private equity players with deep pockets have evinced interest in the country's commercial real estate sector, he said.
He said the challenge in the housing sector has been with the upper middle segment and high end luxury housing.
""It is this segment where unsold inventory levels are high. This is where the price of the apartments are typically upwards of  ₹2 crore,"" he said, adding ""I would like to reiterate that the demand for smaller sized homes at affordable price points is still strong"".
Parekh said the problem got compounded with the tight liquidity situation that prevailed since last September. This particularly impacted the non-banking finance companies and housing financiers and blamed it on banks' risk averseness.
""Banks are reluctant to lend and there has been a flight to safety where a select, few, high rated NBFCs and HFCs have access to funding, while for several others, access to credit has been chocked,"" he said.
Due to this a number of NBFCs and HFCs have curtailed disbursements. This in turn has had spillover effects into a number of other sectors.
""One is hopeful that normalcy will be restored soon and by the time the festive season sets in, some of the risk averseness should taper off. To my mind, what is critical is re-instilling confidence in lenders to support growth in the economy,"" he added."

207,2019-08-05,HDFC,"June quarter net interest margin remained flat at 3.3% due to a greater focus on the individual loans categoryThe markets have rewarded HDFC’s cautious and steady approach, too

The highlight of mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd’s (HDFC’s) June quarter earnings was its loan book growth, which has now fallen to 13%, compared to 18% growth in the year-ago period. Analysts, however, said the results were good, seen in light of the poor state of the economy and relative to the rest of the industry. Indeed, even HDFC’s growth has remained in double digits only because of its strong individual loans franchisee. Here, growth has stayed rock solid at 17%, marginally down from the 18% growth in the year-ago quarter.
But its non-individual loan book, that is corporate loans, posted an all-time low growth of a mere 2%. In the past one year, HDFC’s exposure to this category has declined. And it looks like it has deliberately adopted a cautious stance here. In the backdrop of the recent liquidity-related concerns and slowdown in the real estate sector, HDFC’s vigilance isn’t surprising.
“Given the uncertainty and risk averseness in the lending environment for non-individual loans, the corporation opted to be prudent by curtailing some of its lending to non-individual loans,"" HDFC said in a release.
Addressing the company’s annual general meeting, chairman Deepak Parekh said: “Banks are reluctant to lend and there has been a flight to safety where a select few, high rated NBFCs and HFCs have access to funding, while for several others, access to credit has been chocked. As a result, a number of NBFCs and HFCs have curtailed disbursements. One is hopeful that normalcy will be restored soon and, by the time the festive season sets in, some of the risk averseness should taper off.""
For now, HDFC continues to focus on lending to the affordable housing segment. “The challenge in the housing sector has been with the upper-middle segment and high-end luxury housing. I would like to reiterate that the demand for smaller sized homes at affordable price points is still strong,"" Parekh added. In FY19, 37% of the home loans approved in volume terms and 18% in value terms have been to customers from the economically weaker section and lower-income group segment.
Even though the mortgage lender is trying to compensate by focusing more on the individual loans category, some repercussions could be felt on its overall margin growth, going ahead. In the June quarter, net interest margin remained flat at 3.3% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. It should be noted that between the two, the non-individual loans segment is a higher-margin business. But as they say, better safe than sorry.
The markets have rewarded HDFC’s cautious and steady approach, too. Its stock trades at a rich one-year forward price-to-book multiple of four times."
206,2019-08-05,HDFC,"Most credit cards that charge a fee come with extra benefits, but do you need them?This (no-fee card) can help build your credit score and history, and your pathway to more premium and specialized cards

If you are in the market looking for a credit card, you are probably prepared to shell out an annual fee for the same. But why should you pay a fee when the market has zero-fee credit cards too? While paying a fee may entitle you to extra benefits, a zero-fee credit card may suffice if you do not use it a lot or are a new user. We explain why but first let’s start with the basics.
Types of credit cards
Credit cards give you free credit for 45-55 days after which it charges a monthly interest. Apart from this, there is an annual fee to pay, regardless of your usage pattern. Zero-fee credit cards, on the other hand, don’t levy any annual fee.
Then there are credit cards that are sandwiched between an annual fee and no-fee cards. These cards charge an annual fee initially but waive it off eventually after the user crosses a certain threshold of spends. For instance, State Bank of India’s (SBI) SimplyClick card charges an annual fee of  ₹499, which is reversed if you spend  ₹1 lakh through the card in a year. HDFC Freedom Credit Card charges  ₹500 as annual fee but waives it off after you cross the  ₹60,000 spending threshold in a year.
Click here to see the enlarged version of the graphic
“Even in case of premium credit cards that involve a relatively higher annual fee, card issuers usually offer annual fee waiver if you spend beyond the minimum threshold amount in the previous year,"" said Naveen Kukreja, chief executive officer and co-founder, Paisabazaar.com, an online marketplace for financial products.
Some banks also waive the annual fee against a security deposit. For instance, Axis Insta Easy Credit Card is issued against a minimum fixed deposit of  ₹20,000, and SBI Card Unnati against a minimum FD of  ₹25,000.
I like plain vanilla
Mrin Agarwal, financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pvt. Ltd and co-founder of Womantra, said, “A cashback, no-fee credit card which offers decent benefits is a good choice. Many fail to even redeem rewards and benefits of credit cards, so it makes sense to go for no-fee cards and get a cashback that reduces your amount due. Those who want to go for an annual fee card must see if the rewards they get in return are worth a high annual fee and whether they are actually using the rewards and benefits.""
Go for zero-fee cards if you are using a credit card for the first time and figuring out how it works, how often you need to use it and the like. “This can be the stepping stone to building your credit score and history, and your pathway to more premium and specialized cards. It would also be an inexpensive way to increase your credit limit,"" said Navin Chandani, chief business development officer, BankBazaar, a loan aggregator.
Also, if you use your credit card sparingly, you should pick a plain-vanilla, zero-fee credit card. “No-fee credit cards are best for users who seldom use credit cards for making big-ticket expenditures,"" said Gaurav Chopra, founder and chief executive officer, IndiaLends, a financial technology startup.
If you have a bad credit score and are trying to repair it, go for a no-fee card and use the card for nominal expenditures.
I am ready for more
If you are a savvy credit card user, who knows how to use the rewards and benefits that cards offer, you could look beyond zero-fee cards. Cards that charge an annual fee, initially or otherwise, usually come with better reward features.
However, that will be suitable only if you have the financial discipline to not let your credit spiral into a debt trap. “The benefits of annual fee cards are endless as compared to zero-fee cards, especially for those who can afford them or are eligible for premium cards. The typical individual seeks travel, entertainment, dining, retail, and curated experiences. Premium cards may help them access these in a rewarding manner,"" said Chandani. While the annual fee may range from  ₹1,000 to  ₹10,000, the customer usually gets benefits in the form of vouchers, discounts and so on, added Chandani. “People looking for specific benefits may seek these cards.""
Comparing flavours
We compared two credit cards from the same bank, one that charges no annual fee and another that charges a fee of  ₹3,500. The zero-fee credit card gives regular benefits such as rewards points, cashback offers, discount offers, fuel surcharge waiver, complementary lounge access at select airports, and so on. The other card, however, has several other features besides the regular ones, including a chance to earn unlimited miles which never expire, award miles, priority pass membership and complimentary lounge access to a number of airports across the world, miles redemption in the form of free flights, upgrades, hotel accommodations, car rentals, 24X7 concierge services and the like. You even get insurance covers for baggage delay, checked-in baggage loss and personal accident cover, to name a few.
Clearly, you can’t expect no-fee cards to compete with annual fee cards in terms of reward points, but you need to evaluate if you really need these benefits. “A number of additional benefits, rewards and offers are directly linked to the annual fee. If a credit card provider is not charging any annual fee, then the number of benefits a user can avail on such a card will be way less when compared to a credit card that charges an annual fee,"" said Chopra.
Mint Money take
While standard no-fee cards too offer a wide range of benefits, annual fee cards work well for heavy spenders and those who want high-value rewards in return.
“Most of the top-rewards credit cards waive off the annual fee in the first year. In this period, one can identify one’s consumption pattern and dependency on credit cards. If consumption is less, one can opt for no-annual fee credit cards and if the consumption is higher one should opt for a credit card with an annual fee, as one can enjoy additional rewards associated with it,"" said Chopra.
A plain-vanilla credit card works for most, but if you want to upgrade, be ready to spend some time analyzing the trade-off."

The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd (NIIF) Tuesday said it has received commitments of about $2 billion from AustralianSuper, Australia’s largest superannuation and pension fund, and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (Ontario Teachers’), one of Canada’s largest single-profession pension plans.
These include commitments of $250 million each into NIIF’s master fund, and co-investment rights of up to $750 million each in future opportunities alongside the master fund.
The investment also makes AustralianSuper and Ontario Teachers’ shareholders in NIIF.
The fund also received additional commitments worth  ₹60 crore from HDFC Life and Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance in the third round.
“We are delighted to welcome two of the world’s leading pension funds as investors in the NIIF master fund and as shareholders of National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd, alongside other eminent investors. AustralianSuper and Ontario Teachers’ are among the most respected infrastructure investors in the world and bring considerable global perspective and value to NIIF,"" said Sujoy Bose, managing director and chief executive officer, NIIF.
“Their significant investments demonstrate the international interest in Indian infrastructure and reconfirms the many strengths of NIIF, which positions it as one of the primary Indian pooling vehicles for global capital,"" he added.
NIIF, which was set up in 2015 along the lines of a sovereign wealth fund with 49% equity held by the Union government, looks to boost infrastructure financing in the country. The latest investment pegs the NIIF master fund as the largest infrastructure fund in India with assets of over $1.8 billion under management and a co-investment pool of $2.5 billion.
Master fund had earlier raised capital from UAE’s sovereign wealth fund, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), Singapore’s state investment arm Temasek, HDFC Group, ICICI Bank, Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance and Axis Bank.
While Temasek had agreed to invest $400 million into NIIF’s master fund in 2018, ADIA had committed $1 billion in 2017 along with other domestic private sector investors, which together invested  ₹500 crore in the fund.
The fund, with a 15-year tenure, is denominated in Indian rupees and invests in equity capital in core infrastructure sectors in India with a focus on transportation, energy and urban infrastructure. It made its first investment last year by partnering with Dubai-based DP World to buy Continental Warehousing Corp., one of the largest logistics companies in India. Hindustan Infralog, the $3-billion ports and logistics platform created by NIIF and DP World, seeks to invest in ports, terminals, transportation and logistics.
With over $3 billion of capital commitments across three funds—‘master fund’, ‘fund of funds’ and ‘strategic fund’, NIIF looks to invest in operating assets, greenfield projects and anchor third-party managed funds in core infrastructure and related segments.
“India’s burgeoning infrastructure market is among the largest in Asia, which presents many opportunities for investment. We are pleased to have entered into this agreement with the NIIF master fund and to be shareholders of NIIF and look forward to participating in a strong pipeline of projects across a range of sectors,"" said Mark Delaney, chief investment officer, AustralianSuper."

MUMBAI :
The resolution professional (RP) overlooking the bankruptcy proceedings of grounded Jet Airways (India) Ltd on Thursday told the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that a request has been placed before the committee of creditors (CoC) to liquidate some assets to pay a part of the pending salaries to the airline’s employees.
According to resolution professional Ashish Chhawchharia, Jet Airways currently has about 7,400 employees on its payroll. During its peak, the airline had over 16,000 employees, including about 1,300 pilots.
“We have requested CoC’s permission to liquidate some assets to pay the salaries,"" Chhawchharia said, adding that Jet Airways currently has no revenue from operations and, hence, paying employee salaries remains a concern.
Jet Airways, which had grounded its operations on 18 April, due to an acute fund crunch, is yet to pay salaries since January to a section of its staff, including pilots, engineers and general managers. The airline hasn’t paid salaries to the rest of its staff since March.
Employee associations of Jet Airways had earlier sought the court’s permission to release their salaries.
The NCLT bench on Thursday also heard the claims of Luckystar Pvt. Ltd, which owns Siroya Centre, the former headquarters of Jet Airways. Luckystar had earlier stated that the airline owes them dues since the airline’s rental lease for the building ended in April.
Chhawchharia informed the bench that Siroya Centre’s premises are not required anymore and the staff will be shifted to another property owned by the airline.
He also sought return of a portion of the deposit—with the deposit standing at about  ₹10 crore—which was taken by Luckystar to rent out Siroya Centre to Jet Airways.
Chhawchharia said that Luckystar could deduct a part of its dues from the deposit and file claim for the remaining.
He added that this proposal will be put before the committee of creditors.
In case of a rejection from the committee of creditors, the matter will be heard in the court.
The tribunal, consisting of judges V.P. Singh and Rajesh Sharma, will hear the case again on 28 August.
On 20 June, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal admitted Jet Airways under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
A consortium of 26 banks led by the State Bank of India had approached the tribunal to recover dues of more than  ₹8,500 crore.
Lenders have been trying to sell the beleaguered airline as a going concern for the past five months."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

189,2019-08-26,HDFC,"Growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio more stable and increased marginsThe growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio of life insurers more stable and increased margins

Selling life insurance has never been easy, but getting investors to buy their stocks is becoming all too easy for life insurers. A booming business and a growing market share have led to big gains for the three listed life insurance companies in India.
Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd have surged 33.59% and 37.37%, respectively, so far this year. Even ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd hasn’t fared badly, with returns of 19.14%, although its growth in the past two quarters has been wanting. In comparison, the Nifty Financial Services index has risen about 4.27% in 2019.
There are several factors that seem to have worked for life insurance companies. But, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd highlighted the main reason.
“Private insurers (excluding ICICI Prudential Life) continue to deliver robust growth in spite of volatile markets; this, coupled with increasing protection share in the business mix, justifies the re-rating in the last four months, in our view,"" it said in a note to clients.
In the first four months of FY20, private sector insurers saw 23% new business growth in retail, in terms of annualized premium equivalent, even as the overall industry growth was 15%, primarily due to Life Insurance Corporation of India’s (LIC’s) 5.5% growth.
This growth was led by non-participatory and annuity products.
Aggressive marketing of term plans in the past two years has helped HDFC Life and even its peers corner market share from the country’s largest life insurer, LIC.
“Shrinking profitability of linked business has made it a mere revenue driver, edging players to move towards non-linked products (protection, annuities and return-guarantee) for profitability,"" said Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note.
The growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio of life insurers more stable and increased margins.
Life insurance stocks are likely to continue to enjoy investor attention over the next few quarters, too, though analysts warned that the profitability metrics may have peaked for some firms."

187,2019-08-27,HDFC,"Realty firms are in the process of submitting bids for debt-ridden developerIn November, NCLT admitted insolvency proceedings against Ariisto Developers, which owed around  ₹2,500 crore to lenders, including HDFC and IIFL Trustee

Mumbai: Prominent Mumbai-based real estate firms, including Rustomjee Group, Wadhwa and Runwal Group, are in the process of submitting bids for debt-ridden Ariisto Developers, two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
This is the second time the bankruptcy resolution professional for Ariisto Developers has invited expressions of interest from prospective buyers to revive the Mumbai-based company. In the first round, Rustomjee was the sole bidder. However, the builder’s committee of creditors (CoC) rejected its resolution plan, said the first person.
In November, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) had admitted insolvency proceedings against Ariisto Developers, which owed around  ₹2,500 crore to lenders, including HDFC Ltd, IIFL Trustee Ltd and Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd.
“Fresh expression of interest (EoI) has been invited...We have received response from prospective resolution applicants and the list will be finalized by 10 September,"" said Jayesh Sangkhrajka, the resolution professional appointed by the NCLT to manage the company. He declined to comment further on the matter. The last date for submitting the bids is 1 September.
Ariisto’s housing project, spread across 32 acres in suburban Mulund, is yet to take off. The development potential of the land could be as much as 4-6 million sq. ft, the first person added.
Large developers, including L&T Realty Ltd and Godrej Properties Ltd, have entered Mulund’s housing market in the last few years. Other big developers in the micro-market include Oberoi Realty and Wadhwa Group. According to local brokers, Ariisto’s Mulund land could be worth  ₹1,000 crore as per the current market rate. “Unlike last time, there could be at least three-four bidders,"" said the first person.
Boman R. Irani, chairman and managing director, Rustomjee Group, said the company will be making a revised offer.
“Our earlier offer was market-based. It was a little conservative as it was based on the current market situation. Obviously, their (Ariisto’s) outstandings are a lot more. I guess there are many secured and unsecured credit. Maybe they (creditors) thought if they called for fresh bids, they would get a better offer,"" Irani added.
A few other developers, including Wadhwa Group, have already submitted their EOIs. “We are keenly looking at stressed opportunities through IBC where we will be partnering with a few stressed assets funds. We are also working directly with lenders to operationally turn around their stuck projects,"" said Vrushank Mehta, vice-president, corporate strategy and investment, Wadhwa Group.
A spokesperson of Sandeep Runwal-led Runwal Group said the company has already submitted its EoI, but is yet to make a final bid. He, however, did not divulge further details. Last week, Mumbai-based Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) was admitted for insolvency proceedings.
The insolvency plea was filed by public sector lender Bank of India to recover its outstanding due of around  ₹520 crore. Several other large realty firms, including Jaypee Infratech Ltd and Lavasa Corp. Ltd, are facing insolvency proceedings."
185,2019-08-29,HDFC,"AMCs have been successful in passing the cuts in total expense ratio to distributors to a large extentWhile the broader market seems to be drifting downwards, AMC stocks have been hitting new 52-week highs in recent times

Equity markets are subject to market risks, but that adage does not seem to apply to stocks of asset management companies (AMCs). While the broader market seems to be drifting downwards, AMC stocks have been hitting new 52-week highs in recent times.
Much of this optimism stems from the fact that there has been a continuous flow of funds into mutual fund schemes. A ban on upfront commissions to agents last October by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), and changes in total expense ratio, were expected to impact the growth of assets under management. But that has not happened.
Total assets under management in June 2019 were higher by 9% since October, when the ban came into effect. Importantly, total net inflows into equity schemes have summed up to about  ₹63,000 crore since October 2018. One reason is systematic investment plans, which are considered to be sticky.
The ban on commissions, however, has not dented the performance of AMCs, but instead, has helped improve their operating metrics.
Commissions paid to distributors formed a large expense in the profit and loss accounts. Additionally, AMCs have been successful in passing the cuts in total expense ratio to distributors to a large extent, which cushioned the impact at the net level.
This has played out in the first-quarter numbers. AMCs reported decent profit growth, despite muted revenue growth. HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd’s revenues were up 7% in the June quarter, while net profit grew 42% over the year-ago period. Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd’s revenues were lower by 5.3%, while the net profit was up 13% over the year-ago quarter.
“1QFY20 was a transition quarter for mutual funds to lower fee norms and Reliance AMC (and the sector) have done well in managing it with limited earnings impact by lower distributors’ commissions and controlling discretionary costs,"" said a CLSA India (Pvt.) Ltd note to clients.
While all this is good, AMC stocks have turned pricey lately. A change in the ownership of Reliance Nippon AM has seen its stock run up about 19% in the past month, while HDFC AMC’s premier position has seen its stock rise by 11%.
Much of the optimism now depends on flows remaining steady. With the markets wobbly, lump-sum investments are likely to remain lumpy. Besides, growth in assets under management that seems to have stagnated in the last few months, should be closely watched."

179,2019-09-03,HDFC,"The PSU banking index on NSE fell 5%, with PNB shares slumping 9%Both BSE midcap and smallcap indices also fell sharply

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty fell sharply today while the rupee also suffered a big loss against the US dollar. At the day’s low, the Sensex fell over 850 points to 36,466 after data released last week showed GDP grew at its weakest pace in over six years as consumption demand weakened. A separate private sector survey indicated that expansion in the country's manufacturing sector hit its slowest in 15 months in August. The Sensex finished 2% lower at 36,562 - its biggest one-day fall since October last year - while Nifty settled 2% lower at 10,797.
Here are 10 updates from today’s stock markets:
1) The decline was led by banking stocks with the Nifty bank index falling 2.2%. Among financials, PNB fell 9%, ICICI Bank 4%, HDFC 4%, RBL 4% and Axis Bank 3%.
2) The PSU banking index on the NSE fell 5% after the government announced a series of mergers involving 10 such banks to boost the struggling sector and revive economic growth. Indian Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank and Oriental Bank slumped between 10% and 12%.
""Market slid as deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. The consolidation of PSU banks is a step in right direction however, they may take more time before earning benefits from synergy. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflow from foreign investors added volatility to rupee,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.
3) Among auto stocks, Tata Motors, Bosch, Motherson Sumi and Eicher Motors fell between 3% and 4% after top automakers reported a slump in August sales over the weekend. Another market heavyweight Reliance Industries fell over 3%.
4) Many analysts have revised lower their growth estimates for the year after GDP growth decelerated sharply to 5% on the back of weakness in private consumption and investment. “With a deeper-than-estimated trough and lack of significant impetus to the growth drivers in the near term, we further revise down our FY20 GDP growth estimate by 50 bps to 5.8%,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.
The Nifty is down about 10% from its June highs. And market analysts remain cautious. Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking, said: ""In the near term, weak domestic sentiments and uncertain global cues may continue to have negative impact on the Indian markets. Hence, we continue to remain cautious until there are meaningful signs of revival in the economy. Further, falling rupee (vs US dollar) is a key concern which could negatively impact the sentiments. On global front, trade tension between US-China is likely to induce volatility across markets.""
5) The broader markets were also weak today with the BSE midcap and smallcap indices falling 1.6% and 1.3% respectively.
6) Shares of ONGC fell 3% today after a fire broke out in a storm water drainage network at the company's oil and gas processing plant in Uran, Navi Mumbai.
7) ONGC said there has been no impact on oil processing and gas from Bombay High has been diverted to its Hazira plant. Reliance Securities does not see a major impact of the fire incident at the Uran plant on ONGC gas sales in the second quarter of FY19. ""A fall in oil prices can impact earnings in FY20 while the target for disinvestment receipts has increased to  ₹1.05 lakh crore for FY20 from  ₹90,000 crore in the interim Budget. This is a key overhang on the stock as the government holds a 64.25% stake in ONGC,"" said Reliance Securities, which maintains a positive view on the stock.
8) The rupee slumped 100 paise to 72.40 against the US dollar today, as compared to the previous close of 71.40.
9) Indian markets continue to be hurt by selling pressure from foreign investors, which sold a net $2.3 billion worth of Indian stocks last month.
10) Asian markets ended mixed today while European equity markets struggled as investors waited to see if Chinese and American officials can schedule a planned meeting this month to continue trade talks."

According to Bloomberg data, the Nifty CPSE index lost 13.35% in 2019, while the Nifty is down just 0.6%. In August alone, the Nifty CPSE index fell 8.49%, while the Nifty is marginally down by 0.85%. Similarly, for the one year ended 3 September, Nifty CPSE index was down 24.68%, while the benchmark Nifty was down 6.77%.
A key reason is the ETF’s concentration of energy stocks, said analysts. According to HDFC Securities, currently, the scheme is concentrated around energy and oil sectors and, hence, risks arising from government-related actions, as well as company-specific risks, may affect its performance.
“Together with the advantages, investors should also keep in mind that it is not a diversified index and is skewed towards the energy sector. Any untoward global or domestic event impacting this sector will act as a negative trigger for the entire portfolio,"" said HDFC Securities Ltd in a note on 17 July.
The broking firm had also said that returns from the securities comprising Nifty CPSE may underperform returns from the general securities markets, or different asset classes, as different types of securities tend to go through cycles of out-performance and under-performance in comparison to the securities markets. The CPSE ETF is an open-ended, semi-diversified, thematic and passively managed ETF, which tracks and provide returns corresponding to the Nifty CPSE Index.
The Nifty CPSE ETF index is loaded with energy stocks, which make up 65.83% of its total composition, followed by metals (18.90%), financial services (7.37%), industrial manufacturing (6.37%) and construction (1.53%). Out of the 10 stocks on the CPSE ETF, energy stocks, such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), are down 14.5%, 21.9% and 18.2%, respectively, so far this year. IOC and ONGC have 20.77% and 19.57% weightage on the index, respectively, while OIL has 3.11% weightage. NTPC Ltd, which has the highest weightage of 20.97% in the Nifty CPSE ETF index, is down 5.3% so far this year. NBCC India Ltd, which has fallen 41.65%—the most out of the 10 stocks—have 1.53% weightage on the index.
Dhaval Kapadia, director, portfolio specialist, Morningstar Investment Adviser India Pvt. Ltd, said that the last one to one-and-a-half years have been tough for actively managed funds particularly in the large-cap space, with most of them underperforming benchmarks. “On analysis of the performance of large-cap indices, such as the Nifty or Sensex, one can see that a limited number of stocks have been the main drivers of this outperformance, while other stocks have lagged. Funds that were underweight such stocks due to valuation or other concerns have underperformed these benchmarks. For calendar years prior to 2018, large-cap funds on an average have outperformed benchmark indices,"" he said.
Another reason for the decline in the Nifty CPSE ETF index is redemptions. “There was a redemption pressure seen in the fund as one-month lock-in period for anchor institutional investors in the fifth FFO (further fund offer) of the CPSE ETF last month expired on 24 August. This could be one reason for the weakness in the fund performance,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

175,2019-09-07,HDFC,"The campaign introduces real survivor stories of Amrita Raichand (Chef) and Boria Majumdar (Sports Journalist)The objective of the campaign is to create awareness about insurance which is under penetrated in India

Near death experiences tend to push people to reevaluate life decisions including finance. Highlighting the same HDFC Life, private life insurance firm, has launched a new ad film ‘Bounce back to life’ that features real-life survivor stories to showcase the need for term insurance to financially protect ones family and loved ones when faced with unforeseen circumstances.
The route for the campaign is 'Bounce Back to Life', based on the insight that 'in a near death experience, the first thoughts that flash are always about family/loved ones' and thus, it's important to secure their future. The theme strengthens the HDFC Life’s ‘Sar utha ke jiyo’ brand promise.
The campaign introduces real survivor stories of Amrita Raichand (Chef) and Boria Majumdar (Sports Journalist). Amrita survived the Mumbai terror attack and Boria is a survivor of a mid-air engine failure. They campaign features both of them talking about living through these difficult experiences and learning how to cope in its aftermath. An important part of bouncing back from these incidents was realising the importance of spending time with their loved ones and protecting their future to ensure that they lead their lives with pride.
Pankaj Gupta, senior executive vice-president (sales) and chief marketing officer, Pankaj Gupta, said, ""I’m happy to share that our latest ad film addresses the need for protection and brings out one of the strongest essence of life – hope. We at HDFC Life, believe that real-life stories relate and connect to every human and helps driving a sense of urgency to evaluate financial decisions that can secure our future and enable a life of pride.""
The objective of the campaign is to create awareness about insurance which is under penetrated in India. The company said that while buying an insurance policy, people do not consider its core benefit – life cover/protection, rather they look for returns. This campaign thus brings out the need for taking action now and not postponing the plans into an indefinite future.
Rajdeepak Das, managing director India and chief creative officer Leo Burnett South Asia said, “This campaign brings very touching; powerful, human stories told with an impactful narrative, that I am sure will strike a chord with the audience. More so because; although these individuals have lived through a tragedy, our chronicle focuses on the positive way they have survived their individual ordeals and come out of it stronger and more optimistic."""

173,2019-09-08,HDFC,"Sebi's board in March approved a proposal to allow mutual funds and portfolio managers to trade in this segmentMany custodians have been sceptical about managing the physical delivery of commodities

New Delhi: Markets regulator Sebi is likely to give approval to Deutsche Bank by next month to operate as a custodian in the commodities space, a move which will enable participation from institutional investors, including mutual funds and portfolio management service providers, in such segment.
To help broaden the commodity derivatives market, Sebi's board in March this year approved a proposal to allow mutual funds and portfolio managers to trade in this segment. Moreover, the regulator made necessary amendments in the custodian regulations so as to provide for requisite custodial services.
The regulator in May came out with guidelines allowing mutual funds and portfolio managers to invest in commodity derivatives.
However, institutional investors have been staying away from the segment and experts believe lack of custodial services has been a key deterrent to institutional participation in the commodity derivatives markets.
Many custodians have been sceptical about managing the physical delivery of commodities as they lack domain expertise with regard to agricultural commodities and warehousing.
Now, sources privy to the development expect some participation from institutional investors in the commodities derivatives market from this year which will deepen the market.
""Deutsche Bank is expected to get a green signal from Sebi by October to provide custodial services and once the custodian thing will happen, we will see some participation from institutional investors in the commodities derivatives market this year,"" a source close to the development said.
Besides, HDFC Bank and Stock Holding Corporation of India among others have approached the capital markets regulator to provide custodial services, he added.
Under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines, mutual funds need to appoint a registered custodian for underlying goods, in view of the physical settlement of contracts.
The issue of lack of participation from mutual funds in the commodity derivatives segment was discussed in the Sebi's commodity derivatives advisory committee late August, sources said.
Apart from this, issues including Options offered by stock exchanges and gold spot exchange were also discussed, they added.
A committee, under the leadership of NITI Aayog member Ramesh Chand, had pointed out the importance of regulation in the spot market after  ₹5,600-crore National Spot Exchange Ltd (NSEL) fraud was revealed 2013.
The committee appointed by the Finance Ministry submitted its report in February 2018 suggesting that Sebi should regulate the new gold spot exchange.
Earlier Sebi was believed to have told the government that it did not have the skill set to regulate a spot market. Instead, it had suggested that regulation of commodity spot exchanges should be vested in a separate sectoral regulator.

314,2019-09-16,HDFC,"Last week, Bajaj Finance had reported better-than-expected Q4 numbersHDFC is India's biggest non-banking finance company in terms of market capitalisation

Bajaj Finance Ltd on Tuesday became India's second non-banking finance company (NBFC) to cross  ₹2 trillion in market capitalisation after its shares hit an all-time high, having rallied nearly 30% so far this year.
Shares of the company hit a record high of  ₹3,474.20 on the BSE, up 2% from its previous close, pushing its market cap to  ₹2.01 trillion. The stock was up for the fifth straight session today and has risen 20.6% during the period.
Housing Development Finance Ltd is India's biggest non-banking finance company with a market capitalisation of  ₹3.70 trillion.
Investors have continued to buy in shares of Bajaj Finance after it reported strong earnings for the March quarter on 16 May. The company reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹1,176.06 crore for the quarter ended March 2019, an increase of 57% year-on-year.
The consolidated results of Bajaj Finance include its wholly-owned subsidiaries – Bajaj Housing Finance and Bajaj Financial Securities.
The NBFC posted a net interest income (NII) of  ₹3,395 crore in Q4FY19, up 50% on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis. The lender booked 5.83 million new loans during the quarter under review, up 53% from 3.8 million in the same period last year and, on an annual basis, its assets under management (AUM) grew 41% to  ₹1.15 trillion in Q4FY19.
""Bajaj Finance has maintained its robust growth trajectory, with deepening geographical penetration and increasing repeat business. Over the past two years, it has also enhanced its capabilities on two fronts – generating higher fee income and improving the deposit franchise. The latter would be a key driver for incremental liabilities over the next few years,"" Motilal Oswal said in a 16 May report.
Asset quality remained stable, with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) and net NPAs at 1.54% and 0.63%, respectively, at the end of March 2019.
""Management has once again demonstrated its execution skill during challenging times and its ability to grow the balance sheet while maintaining asset quality. A well-diversified loan book allows BAF to shift gears and deliver above-industry growth rates during challenging times. These strong execution capabilities should allow BAF to remain ahead of its competition and retain its dominant position among the major retail lenders,"" said HSBC Global research in a 17 May note.
HSBC Global has forecast a 35% CAGR in consolidated earnings over fiscal 2019-21, with healthy return ratios.

165,2019-09-17,HDFC,"Altico’s unraveling shows that an end to credit woes is not yet in sightAt more than $200 billion, India’s world-beating pile of bad loans is bigger than Italy’s

India’s fragile financial system is swinging between despair and hope. Two separate incidents — both featuring the lender Yes Bank Ltd. — recently underscored the drag of past underwriting follies as well as the lift from a digital reset. It will take time, but good things will come to Indian banking as a result of the present crisis.
Start with the sudden default by financier Altico Capital India Ltd. on a  ₹1,997 crore ($2.8-million) interest payment to Abu Dhabi-based Mashreqbank PSC. Clearwater Capital Partners-backed Altico, which borrows money from banks and mutual funds to make loans to property developers, called the situation a “liquidity crisis."" And that made Yes Bank investors gloomy.
Based on January data, the midsize Indian bank had a  ₹450 crore exposure to Altico, the third-highest after Mashreq and HDFC Bank Ltd. While HDFC Bank, the country’s most valuable lender, has the capital — and current profit — to take the occasional credit hit, Yes’s capital cushion is already frayed by dodgy loans to beleaguered shadow banks and troubled tycoons. Both these borrower groups have found it hard to refinance debt since the collapse last year of IL&FS Group, a large Indian infrastructure financier and operator. Altico’s unraveling shows that an end to credit woes is not yet in sight.
A Darkening Shadow
At more than $200 billion, India’s world-beating pile of bad loans is bigger than Italy’s. State-run Indian banks are carrying the bulk of the burden, but at least they’re getting dollops of taxpayers’ money and being merged into fewer banking groups. A private-sector lender like Yes doesn’t have a formal public backstop. If it can’t fend for itself, the central bank could step in and force an arranged match with a better-run bank. The terms won’t be favorable to Yes shareholders.
To avoid such a fate, Yes needs to raise growth capital by convincing new investors that the worst is over. And that brings us to the week’s other big incident. Yes shares jumped 13.5% after reports that One97 Communications Ltd., which owns the Indian digital payments network Paytm, may buy out a 9.6% stake in Yes from Rana Kapoor, the lender’s co-founder. Kapoor was forced to step down as CEO early this year by the Reserve Bank of India amid a controversy over bad-debt accounting. New CEO Ravneet Gill, brought in to clean up the mess, told Reuters last week that Yes was looking to sell a minority stake to “one of the world’s top three technology companies that had not previously invested in a bank.""
Investors pushed the stock higher despite their many misgivings. Only two years ago, Yes had a high price-to-book multiple and an even bigger price-to-truth ratio, a term I’d coined to describe shareholders’ refusal to question the subterfuge at India’s private-sector banks. Although the banking regulator had found bad loans to be four times what Yes had disclosed in audited results, very few analysts believed something could go seriously wrong given Kapoor’s substantial stake — his skin in the game.
Stuck in a Rut
That was then. Now, Yes is a battered lender gasping for capital. Despite the many regulatory hurdles on the way to a possible alignment with Paytm, which the latter hasn’t confirmed, a deal could help the bank break free of its checkered past — and reemerge as a digital lender.
If Paytm can monetize the data of its 350 million mobile wallet users by giving them point-of-sale loans using the balance sheet of a bank — whether Yes or someone else — the payment firm will get a second wind. Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma had an early advantage as India’s mobile payments pioneer, but Walmart Inc.-owned PhonePe as well as Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pay are giving him stiff competition. Paytm’s losses are ballooning and it’s becoming evident that without old-fashioned lending, there may be no other path to profitability for a pure payments business. Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest tycoon, plans to use his rapidly growing Jio telecom network to offer customers discounts and vouchers that would be honored even by neighborhood stores. But for extending point-of-sale credit, Ambani would also need to borrow the balance sheet of a bank.
For Yes, point-of-sale financing could be a growth avenue at a time when the turmoil in India’s formal and shadow banking sectors refuses to end. It’s put the brakes on what authorities were until recently claiming to be the world’s fastest-growing major economy.
But alongside the despair, hope is building for a new model led by supply-chain credit, asset securitization, digital lending, and joint underwriting by finance companies (which know their borrowers) and banks (which have stable deposits). The tug of war between the past and the future of banking in India is getting interesting. What happens to Yes could be a gauge of which way the balance of power is shifting."
164,2019-09-18,HDFC,"Rashi Investments and Vivek Mehrotra, along with other entities acted as a group to front-run HDFC AMC and defrauded investorsSebi had issued show cause notices in March 2014 to the two entities for alleged violations of regulatory norms

New Delhi: In a 12-year old case of front-running at HDFC AMC, markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday settled probe with two entities after they paid around  ₹10 crore towards settlement charges.
It was alleged that the two entities -- Rashi Investments and Vivek Mehrotra -- along with other entities acted as a group to front-run HDFC Asset Management Company (AMC) and defrauded investors.
In two separate settlement orders, the regulator said that adjudication proceedings initiated against the two entities are settled and disposed of.
Sebi had issued show cause notices in March 2014 to the two entities for alleged violations of regulatory norms in the front-running of HDFC AMC.
The matter relates to trades conducted in 2007 and Sebi had begun its probe after receiving two separate references from the BSE and NSE on suspected instances of front-running of the orders of HDFC MF.
Front-running refers to an unethical practice of someone trading in shares on the basis of advance information given by a broker, analyst or other executive at a market intermediary before the trades are conducted by that entity.
Pursuant to the investigation into the front-running of HDFC AMC Trades-II, Sebi observed that the two entities -- Rashi Investments and Vivek Mehrotra -- along with other entities ""acted as a group to front run HDFC AMC and defrauded HDFC AMC investors.""
The regulator further noted that by executing such trades, Rashi Investments made a profit of  ₹38.55 lakh while Vivek Mehrotra gained  ₹2.10 crore. Therefore, it was alleged that the entities have violated provisions of Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices norms.
Pending the adjudication proceedings, Rashi Investments and Vivek Mehrotra filed settlement applicants with the regulator and proposed to pay over  ₹3.21 crore and  ₹6.76 crore respectively towards settlement charges.
Thereafter, Sebi's High Powered Advisory Committee recommended the case for settlement on the payment of the amount. This was also approved by Sebi's panel of whole-time members, following which the the entities remitted the amount in September.
Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has disposed of the adjudication proceedings initiated against the entities.
It said that enforcement actions, including commencing or reopening of the proceedings, could be initiated if any representation made by it is found to be untrue.

162,2019-09-18,HDFC,"The central bank is not likely to enforce external benchmarks on NBFCs and HFCsThe matter came up at an internal RBI discussion on external benchmarks, which are binding on all banks beginning 1 October

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is studying how non-bank lenders and home financiers price their loans, close on the heels of directing commercial banks to link their loan rates to external benchmarks.
The matter came up at an internal RBI discussion on external benchmarks, which are binding on all banks beginning 1 October, a person aware of the development said.
The central bank is keen on greater transparency and order in the rate-setting process at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs), which are not bound by RBI regulations, the person said on condition of anonymity.
“When we were looking at external benchmarks, there was this issue as to what to do with the NBFC and HFC sector. We decided that since they are not even on the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) regime, we must first graduate them to some level and then think of external benchmarks,"" the person said.
However, the person added that while the central bank is examining the rate-setting mechanism, it is in no way going to implement external benchmarks for these entities anytime soon.
The central bank has mandated various anchor rates—benchmarks based on which lending rates are set—for bank loans since 1994, before which interest rates used to be set by RBI. The way banks set interest rates is critical for the smooth transmission of policy rates. To make this process transparent, RBI has over the years directed banks to price their loans against their benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR), base rate and then MCLR. However, this is the first time banks have been asked to link their lending rates to an external benchmark.
The official said the primary advantage of an external benchmark over an internal rate is transparency. While certain costs such as business strategy and operating costs were part of the anchor rate under the MCLR regime, the external benchmark ensures all those are part of the spread and not built into the anchor.
“At present, there is no mandate from the central bank to non-banks and housing finance companies to determine their rates based on an anchor, nor are there instructions on what the anchor should be or even how it should be calculated,"" the person said, adding RBI intends to bring some order to this process before graduating to the next step.
Some HFCs use prime lending rate as their benchmark for loans and offer loans at a discount to this rate. For instance, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) has a retail prime lending rate (RPLR) of 16.75%, while it offers floating rate home loans at rates of 8.35-9.25%.
“We need to graduate them and we are examining the issue of transparency in NBFC rates and will have to take it forward. We also have to be clear that they are not in the same market as banks and have to therefore take that into consideration,"" the person said.
While NBFCs have always been under RBI’s supervision, this regulatory jurisdiction was extended to HFCs only recently. Following the crisis at non-banks last year, the Union budget in July expanded RBI’s regulatory span to include HFCs. Following this, RBI said in August that HFCs will be treated as a category of non-banks, adding it will release a revised regulatory framework for these entities.

159,2019-09-19,HDFC,"IIFL Wealth Management Ltd made its debut on the bourses, listing at  ₹1,210 and hitting the upper circuit of 5%At the current price, its shares are valued at price-earnings multiple of 28 times its FY19 earnings

IIFL Wealth Management Ltd made its debut on the bourses, listing at  ₹1,210 and hitting the upper circuit of 5%. Investors seem to be focusing on the potential of growth for wealth management firms in the country.
As it is among the first wealth management firms to be listed, investors seem to be comparing it with the two listed asset management firms -- HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd and Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Company Ltd.
On that count, the valuation seems lower. At the current price, its shares are valued at price-earnings multiple of 28 times its FY19 earnings. This compares well to HDFC AMC’s 59 times and RNAM’s 30 times.
However, business models of asset management firms are not strictly comparable with IIFL Wealth. The company has its advisory platform, and also lends to high net worth individuals through an in-house NBFC.
IIFL Wealth, which has been formed by hiving off India Infoline Ltd’s wealth management business, now manages about  ₹1.37 lakh crore in AUMs, including assets of ultra-high net worth individuals and high-net worth individuals, and family offices. Total assets under management have been rising, thanks to an improvement in financial savings in mutual funds, and alternative assets, and investment advisory.
A key to watch would be the impact of the regulatory changes on distributor-led business modes changing advisor-led trail fee models. This could impact earnings in the near term. Analysts expect 15% year on year decline in revenue and 26% decline in earnings in FY2020.
Besides, market conditions have become volatile lately and tend to have a direct bearing on the growth of wealth management business. “We find three key challenges for IIFL Wealth at the current juncture (1) sustaining inflows in the backdrop of volatility in capital markets (2) improving commissions in the new advisory model and (3) alignment of employee incentives to lower but more stable levels,"" said analysts at Kotak Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
A good thing is that its annuity business is expanding. Its share of annuity business that comprised 22% of its revenues in FY15 now comprises about 47% of its revenues, which brings more predictability to its revenues."

While exits have been the Achilles’ heel of the investment industry in India, Norwest India is among the few using various modes—acquisitions of its portfolio firms, secondaries and even IPOs— for exits. Five of its investee companies—RBL Bank, Sadbhav Engineering Ltd, Thyrocare Technologies Ltd, Persistent Systems Ltd and Snowman Logistics Ltd—have gone public.

Ola lands  ₹35.9 crore in fresh funding
Ride-hailing firm Ola has raised  ₹35.9 crore in fresh funding from an investment fund named ‘ARK Ola Pre-IPO Private Investment Trust’, indicating that the company might have started preparing to go public in the not-so-distant future, The Economic Times reported. The Seoul-based private trust fund invested in Ola’s ongoing Series-J round, according to documents filed with the Registrar of Companies, and at a valuation of $6.3 billion as of today’s US dollar exchange rate. Online platform Entrackr was the first to report of the Pre-IPO Trust Fund’s investment in Ola on Monday. While details of fund composition are lacking from the regulatory filings, it could possibly be an investment vehicle to shore up on late-stage capital, as companies often do ahead of their IPO. ARK Impact, an asset management company, seems to be behind the fund. In July last year, Ola’s cofounder Bhavish Aggarwal had said that the company was making a profit on every ride and would become cash-flow positive soon.

Home loan major Housing Development Finance Corp is in talks with the co-promoters to buy out remaining around 10% stake in student loan company Credila as it looks to grow quickly and prepare it for listing in a couple of years, The Economic Times reported citing sources.

Foxconn Supplier, Others May Invest $5 billion
Component suppliers of Taiwan's Foxconn are among the major ecosystem players likely to set up shop in India and contribute to the more than $5 billion ( ₹35,500 crore) investment expected in the country over the next two years in high-end electronics manufacturing, The Economic Times reported citing Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of handset industry body Indian Cellular and Electronic Association (ICEA). The news comes as the government brought down effective tax rate for companies by about 10 percentage points to 25.17% and offered a reduced rate of 17.01%, including surcharges, for new manufacturing firms, as part of efforts to resuscitate the economy. Rates were lowered from nearly 35% and over 29%, respectively. A high-powered committee has been set up to suggest measures to boost exports of locally-made electronic products. Foxconn is the biggest manufacturer of iPhones in the world and its India unit is already testing local production of Apple's devices such as the XR for local supplies as well as exports."

Banking and financial stocks were under severe selling pressure on Wednesday. The BSE Bankex has declined 1.7% so far today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put curbs on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. The central bank’s restrictions include limits on cash withdrawals amid a probe into accounting lapses, sparking speculation that the regulator may force a management change at the cooperative bank through a merger, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) fell 4% on news report that the RBI’s action on the PMC Bank was the result of a loan of  ₹2,500 crore to the now bankrupt real estate firm.
Among banking stocks, shares of State Bank of India fell the most--down over 4%--following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan Stanley. Other banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each.
India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

149,2019-09-25,HDFC,"The finding is part of a report titled 'BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands of 2019'This is the sixth consecutive year in which HDFC Bank continued to dominate the ranking

New Delhi: India's largest private sector lender, HDFC Bank, topped the list of the country’s top 70 most valuable brands, according to a report released by marketing and advertising conglomerate WPP Plc and Kantar.
This is the sixth consecutive year in which HDFC Bank continued to dominate the ranking owing to its forward-thinking outlook, new financial products, an ongoing drive towards digital banking and new branches set-up throughout the country. The bank grew 5% in brand value to $22.7 billion, which is a positive contrast to the 8% decline in value of the top 20 global banks.
The 2019 edition of the ranking revealed a 6% rise in overall brand value to $228.2 billion, a moderate pace compared to previous years, given India’s recent macroeconomic challenges. Despite that, such growth is still in line with that of the BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands, as India steadily rises in global economic rankings. The BrandZ study combine companies’ financial data with consumer insight and opinion shows that trust is a key to develop the stability required for long-term success; highly trusted brands in the Top 75 are worth 129% more than less trusted ones.
""For the last five to six quarters our growth rates have been tanking. We are perhaps at our lowest point in the last two decades and these are the reasons why growth has been a challenge this year. Having said that, brands have grown because they had the right conversation with the consumer and offered them the right kind of products/services,"" said Vishikh Talwar, chief client officer, Kantar Insights Division.
Trusted brands include many of the consumer-facing technology platforms and service providers. With a 30% increase in value, this sector was the fastest growing group of brands in the ranking. Some of the notable brands include e-commerce site Flipkart (which occupied 12th spot), which increased its brand value 14% to $4.7 billion, while unicorn brands hotel booking site Oyo ($2 billion), online food ordering service Swiggy ($1.6 billion) and online restaurant marketplace Zomato ($1 billion) are newcomers to the ranking at 30, 39 and 61 ranks respectively.
The fastest riser in the 2019 ranking is telecom provider, Jio, which climbed one place to number ninth spot with a 34% increase in brand value to $5.5 billion. Its disruptive business model has made internet access available to many Indians who were previously unable to afford it, thereby opening up access to digital platforms and services. Vodafone ($2.5 billion) was the top-ranked newcomer at 24th spot.
Both digital and offline brands such as D-Mart (No. 25, $2.4 billion) have found success as a result of the rise of ‘middle India’; the growing number of people in the country’s second, third and fourth-tier cities and towns that are changing India’s traditional urban-rural divide. These previously poorly-served segments increasingly have access to a variety of online services, with Swiggy and Zomato building much of their growth on this shift.
With an expanding choice of offerings to buy, Indian consumers increasingly care more about the quality of service than whether a brand originates in India, as long as it demonstrates that it understands what it means to be Indian. That insight is reflected in the decision by Amazon to launch itself a year ago as India’s ‘neighbourhood shop’.
""Brands should stick to the fundamentals of marketing in the tough times. They should continue to invest, drive innovation, stay connected with the consumer, be authentic and earn their trust. For a corporate firm good brands, built over a period of time, become an insurance against bad times,"" said Preeti Reddy, chief executive, South Asia, Insights Division, Kantar.
Some of the key trends highlighted in the report include increased mobile internet penetration because of Jio phenomenon and renewed competition, retail being the second fastest growing category, with online and offline both growing strongly. New entrant Reliance Retail (No. 55, $1.1 billion) opened nearly 500 new stores and used Jio’s service to connect retail shops with grocery deliveries, while D-Mart ($2.4 billion) focused predominantly on offline, rising two places to No. 25.
Amazon and Flipkart compete with many Indian brands across several sectors, with Amazon also opening its largest campus yet in India. The success of unicorn brands such as Swiggy, Zomato and Oyo is fostering a new-found confidence in India as they look to expand their operations globally."
148,2019-09-25,HDFC,"The QIP money will increase its Tier-I capital by over two percentage points, which should bring some cheerThe stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, lower than rivals such as HDFC Bank and even ICICI Bank

Axis Bank raised a massive  ₹12,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) without breaking a sweat and investors who made that happen deserve good news.
To make them happy, the third largest private lender will have to show an improvement in asset quality and convince the market that its balance sheet growth will trump that of rivals.
Improving asset quality won’t be easy and that could make balance sheet growth a challenge, too. “The QIP is a positive for the bank and the funds will be obviously used for more provisioning and even growth,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, analyst, Macquarie Capital Securities. “But asset quality is still unresolved and fresh stress has emerged,"" he added.
Moreover, since it is de-risking its portfolio, margins are going to be under pressure. So, there isn’t much earnings upside for the stock to price in.
Axis Bank has exposure to a handful of stressed companies that have of late shown deeper troubles. Some of these, such as companies belonging to Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Essel Group, are yet to see some resolution.
Axis Bank also has exposure to real estate developers that were downgraded by rating agencies due to stress. Its exposure to small and medium enterprises (SME) stands at 12% and the increased stress on small businesses due to the economic slowdown has increased risk on this portfolio.
To be sure, the bank showed improvement on asset quality in the June quarter with a 10% year-on-year drop in its bad loan stock. That said, the lender also reported an increase in fresh slippages.
Analysts said some of the newer stressed exposures are not included in the watch list and so could throw a negative surprise for the lender.
To be fair, the bank has made it clear that it will have enough insurance against fresh risk. It has beefed up provisions and is likely to continue doing so.
That brings us back to the fact that if more money is set aside for provisions, less is available for growth.
Even so, the QIP money will increase its Tier-I capital by over two percentage points, which should bring some cheer.
Also, much of the negatives seem to be priced into the stock, given that it is down 3.4% over the past two months despite the 10% rise post the corporate tax cut announcement by the government on Friday.
“Our analysis shows the potential stress at Axis Bank is only marginally higher on corporate assets than at ICICI Bank, and given its underperformance, we believe it presents a good buying opportunity,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
The stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, lower than rivals such as HDFC Bank and even ICICI Bank."

CHANDIGARH :
HDFC Bank in partnership with Indian Oil on Wednesday launched a co-branded fuel card for users from non-metro cities and towns, which will be available on both RuPay and Visa platforms.
The card was launched at an event here by IOCL's Executive Director (Retail Sales) Vigyan Kumar and HDFC Bank's Country Head, Payments Business and Marketing, Parag Rao.
The card offers customers highest rewards and benefits on fuel consumption and will be available on both RuPay and Visa platforms, it was informed on the occasion by the bank and IOC officials.
Customers earn reward points known as 'fuel points' at over 27,000 IOCL outlets. They also earn 'fuel points' on all other spends such as groceries, bill payments, utilities and other shopping. These points can be redeemed for up to 50 litres of fuel annually.
To apply for the card, the customers can visit the bank website or walk into the nearest bank branch, Rao said.
The card was also simultaneously launched across 135 Indian oil outlets in Bhopal, Lucknow, Indore, Ranchi, Kochi, Vishakapatnam, Guwahati, Nagpur, Shillong, Varanasi, Jalandhar and Panjim, among others.
Speaking on the occasion, Vigyan Kumar said that Indian Oil has been a pioneer in promoting digital cashless and digital transactions with more than 98 per cent of the company's network of 27,000 plus retail outlets capable of accepting credit/debit card payments.
""In fact, more than 27% of all transactions at our petrol stations are through various digital modes. We are confident that this collaboration with HDFC Bank today shall give a boost to digital payments and cashless transactions in the country, in line with the Digital India vision of the prime minister,"" he said.
Rao said it is their endeavour to take digital forms of payments to the smaller towns and cities.
He said fuel consumption in India is rising and smaller cities and towns are major drivers of this growth.
""With more than 75% of our total branch network in such non-metro cities, we want to empower our customers in these locations by providing a product that is specifically designed for their changing needs and aspirations,"" he said.
Rao, who is the brain behind this card, said, ""Our philosophy in terms of offering products across HDFC Bank is very simple. We try to see the primary top two needs of an individual and try to design a product which is focused on these needs of the customer.""
""Also, one of our and IOC's objectives in launching this card is to assist in this whole digital mission of saying how do you reduce cash. We have lot of other initiatives with IOC in terms of digitisation.
""Simultaneously, as a bank, we are also expanding our merchant network everywhere so that a merchant in the rural area, either through a POS (a point of sale machine, which is an electronic device used to process card payments) machine or an app, we have a merchant app, could start accepting digital payments, which could be a card, other wallets etc"".
""In India, the penetration of electronic spends at customer level, I am not talking of institutions and businesses, is only about 10-12%, rest is still cash and cheque, so we have got a lot of space to grow...,"" Rao said."

Real estate-focused lender Altico Capital India Ltd, which defaulted on interest payments, is in talks with private equity funds, including Apollo Global Management and Cerberus Capital, for a stake sale, according to two people aware of the development.
The non-bank lender has approached several funds to invest in the company, said one of the two people cited above. “While a portion of the investment will be used to pay back lenders, the rest of the fund is likely to be deployed for project completion,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.
Altico’s troubles started when it missed an interest payment to Dubai-based Mashreq Bank on 12 September. On 20 September, Mint reported that Altico has told its lenders that as part of a resolution plan, it is in talks to sell some assets and infuse fresh funds from new shareholders. For this, Altico said it is working alongside turnaround advisory firm Alvarez and Marsal and legal advisory firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. It also sought a moratorium on further repayments from its lenders.
Apollo Global and Cerberus are among the few private equity firms which Altico is in a serious conversation with, the second person said, adding the investors have proposed a 30-40% haircut on the debt owed to the lenders, as part of the deal to infuse fresh capital into the lender.
Mint could not ascertain the quantum of the stake or capital that Altico is looking to raise from these investors. At present, Altico’s total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.55 crore, from 27 lenders including Yes Bank, State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, among others.
Email queries sent to a spokesperson of Cerberus Capital remained unanswered till the time of going to press. Nipun Sahni, head of Apollo Global’s real estate arm in India, did not respond to calls and text messages seeking comment on the development. Altico Capital’s chief operating officer (COO) Sanjeev Agrawal too did not respond to calls and email queries.
Altico is one of the many shadow banks affected by the souring of market sentiment, following defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).
“A significant strain in short-term financing markets precipitated by the September 2018 default by IL&FS created a knock-on impact on other NBFCs and the real estate sector in general,"" Altico Capital said in a statement earlier this month.
Mint reported on 23 September that Altico’s three shareholders—private equity firms Varde Partners, Clearwater Capital Partners and Abu Dhabi Investment Council—had initiated negotiations with its lenders for a debt restructuring while also planning to either offload their stakes or sell a large portion of the portfolio.
On 22 September, the lender asked its chief operating officer Agrawal to take charge of the company following the sudden resignation of its CEO Sanjay Grewal."
141,2019-09-30,HDFC,"The discounts will be available on both debit and credit cards of HDFC BankThe bank will aggregate offers from across merchants and present its users with the best offers on its website

NEW DELHI :
Private sector lender HDFC Bank on Monday took the battle on consumption straight to e-commerce majors with a three-month long campaign offering best deals on transactions through its platform.
The bank also listed out targets for merchant acquisitions and said it is aiming for a 5 percentage points reduction in its cost-to-income ratio as a result of the digital push.
The aggressive posturing comes at a time when the massive slump in consumption is being blamed for the overall economic gloom pulling down GDP to a six-year low in the June quarter at a 5 percent.
The bank announced major discounts tying up with more than 1,000 major brands such as Reliance Digital, Samsung, Apple etc and also featuring offers on all banking products. The discounts will be available on both its debit and credit cards, the bank said.
""You get mega offers on Flipkart and Amazon for three-four days alone. We are launching this campaign for three months,"" managing director and chief executive Aditya Puri said.
Puri said the bank is going through a major transformation to re-define it altogether and will compete to garner as wide a share of a customer's wallet as possible.
He said the bank will aggregate offers from across merchants and present its users with the best offers on its website. It is targeting to have a complete omnichannel presence which will help a user do banking transactions, loans and shopping across channels like net banking and mobile app by March, he said.
The bank is also adding 1 million merchant touch points this fiscal and aiming for a similar number next fiscal to have up to 5 million merchant touch points by 2021.
This is possible largely through digital solutions like QR codes and smartphone-based apps, he said, adding using this also helps drive down the costs compared to the expensive card swipe machines.
Through a variety of initiatives pivoted around digitisation, the bank is targeting to decrease its cost to income ratio by 5 percentage points to the 35 percent in the next five years, Puri said, adding however, that the bank will continue to hire people and also open branches, which will be smaller in size and will act primarily like a sales and service outlet for customers.

140,2019-10-01,HDFC,"The bank had reported a 1.40% gross non- performing assets ratio in June quarterGrowth slipping to six-year low primarily on a slip in consumption has raised concerns on the way forward for banking

MUMBAI :
HDFC Bank on Monday asserted there is no stress on its credit portfolio because of the slowdown and it sees the current phase as an opportunity to grow its book.
Its managing director and chief executive Aditya Puri also informed that a search panel of the board announced earlier will be formed by January, to ensure the chosen successor to lead the bank can work with him for 1-2 months.
The bank had reported a 1.40 per cent gross non- performing assets ratio in June quarter. Growth slipping to six-year low primarily on a slip in consumption has raised concerns on the way forward for banking.
""We will grow, our assets will grow, our liabilities will grow, our swipes will grow, our number of customers will grow and we are very confident,"" Puri told reporters here, replying to questions around the economic slowdown.
He said that there have not been retrenchments in the industry which should make a lender wary and employment is growing overall, and added that auto majors may have retrenched some temporary workers.
Listing out positives which will work in the economy's favour like the good monsoon, expectations of more divestments and the sentiment turning positive with the tax cuts, he said the bank sees this as a ""major opportunity"" to grow.
""We see this as a major opportunity as a bank and we see no strain on our credit portfolio,"" he said, adding it has not compromised on its credit standards and is not lending to over-leveraged persons.
Puri said the bank is looking at semi-urban and rural areas as a major opportunity to grow from here on and underlined that one will be amazed to see the kind of inherent demand that exists.
When asked about his successors, amid a media report saying that the RBI is unlikely to relent on the 70 years retirement age for bank CXOs, Puri said a search panel of the board will be formed by January.
The panel will hire a search agency and a successor will be chosen in such a way that he or she gets to spend at least one or two months with him, Puri, who turns 70 in October next year, said.
The bank is not looking at any acquisition at present and may only look at it in the future if something gets available at the right price, Puri said.
The veteran banker said there is a need for better corporate governance at the co-operative banks, in comments that comes in the wake of issues at PMC Bank, among the largest such lenders.
HDFC Bank regularly has dealings with cooperative banks but did not have any dealing with PMC Bank, he said.
Seeking to assuage concerns, Puri said there is no scope to have system-wide concerns on banking at present."

138,2019-10-03,HDFC,"Bond purchases under OMOs was the tool RBI used for two years to keep the government borrowing from disrupting yields in the marketIn the past, the bond market has looked at the Centre’s market borrowing plan with suspicion

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seems to be back as the godfather to the bond market, this time invisibly.
On Monday, the government announced it would borrow  ₹2.68 trillion from the bond market in the second half, in line with expectations. This means full-year gross borrowing remains unchanged at  ₹7.1 trillion.
In the past, the bond market has looked at the Centre’s market borrowing plan with suspicion.
The reasons to suspect the government’s borrowing numbers are more this time around than in previous years. Just two weeks ago, the finance minister announced a big cut in corporate tax rate and said that the revenue forgone would be  ₹1.45 trillion. The loss of future revenue would be felt even as growth in indirect tax collections have disappointed. Analysts have indicated that the fiscal deficit of the government would widen to 3.5-3.8% of gross domestic product from the budgeted 3.3%, owing to the revenue shortfall.
Surely if the deficit rises, the government will have to borrow more from the bond market. But this time, investors have taken the Centre on its word and the 10-year benchmark sovereign bond yield fell marginally on Tuesday. There is reason for this faith.
The government has got a one-time bonanza of  ₹1.76 trillion from RBI through a surplus transfer and it may get an interim dividend transfer as well. In August, the central bank’s board had approved transferring the surplus in FY20. Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, estimates the interim dividend to be  ₹28,000 crore. This windfall will go a long way in filling the enlarged hole of fiscal deficit. Otherwise, the government risks increasing its borrowing cost and by extension, making it costly for the private sector to borrow as well. After all, risk-free yield is the basis on which lenders add a credit risk premium in giving private companies loans.
This is the invisible hand of RBI that could make it easy for the government to avoid dumping extra bonds on investors. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts have gone a step ahead and suggested that RBI continue with its open market operations (OMOs) to take some load off the market and keep yields in check. “We thus suggest that a large part of this additional borrowing (by the Centre) can be absorbed through higher OMO purchases by the RBI, or using the additional dividend transferred by the RBI, or through drawing down the surplus balances the centre has with the RBI,"" the bank said in a note last week.
Bond purchases under OMOs was the tool RBI used for two years to keep the government borrowing from disrupting yields in the market. It absorbed nearly 70% of the government borrowing in FY19 by buying close to  ₹3 trillion worth of bonds from the market during that year.
One way or the other, RBI has come to the aid of the bond market. In the past, it was to keep liquidity tightness from choking banks. This time, it has come indirectly and perhaps not entirely out of free will."
136,2019-10-04,HDFC,"Bank stocks came under pressure in the past 10 days owing to renewed concerns over asset qualityMarket cap of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra now tops that of other 10 banks in Nifty Bank by 10%

Indian banks have faced rough weather in the past two weeks and investors are rediscovering stocks that act as lifeboats in choppy waters.
HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have emerged as these lifeboats over the last 10 days. Ergo, while the Nifty Bank index lost over 6% since 23 September, these stocks have weathered the selling pressure.
As the adjoining chart shows, the market capitalization of the two private sector lenders now exceeds that of the other 10 banks in the Nifty banking sector index by about 10%. Just three months ago, the combined value of the two banks was about 10% lower than the other 10 lenders, which include State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and seven of the remaining largest lenders in the country.
So what transpired in the last 10 days to drive investors away from other banks and towards HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank?
The collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd, which had an absurdly high exposure to real estate developers, brought to the fore the vulnerabilities of Indian banks in general.
Investors realized that Indian banks have an uncomfortable exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFC) that finance real estate developers (HFCs). “Negative news flow around HFCs/NBFCs and banks has overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The result was a massive fall in stock prices, and banks such as Yes Bank Ltd and RBL Bank Ltd saw their valuation erode sharply. According to Jefferies India, Yes Bank has an exposure of more than  ₹10,000 crore to troubled companies it terms as “high risk"".
Even the more stronger and larger balance sheets such as SBI and ICICI Bank weren’t spared by investors.
In addition to the resurgence of stress, concerns that the current slowdown would affect the loan growth of banks also weighed in. Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said banks are not likely to grow their loans as most companies would use savings from tax cuts to boost profits.
Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in note, “We expect overall system credit to see 10-12% growth, but near-term growth trajectory depends on pick-up in consumer sentiment in this festive season.""
Investors flocked to HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank as they showed a track record of pristine asset quality. Moreover, both lenders have negligible exposure to troubled NBFCs. Lower stressed assets would mean lower provisioning for the two lenders and, therefore, the banks would have more free capital to lend. Ergo, their loan growth is likely to be superior to others.
Even so, the consumption slowdown is likely to affect all lenders. Investors know this. While HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may have been spared in the recent rout in bank shares, investors await the quarterly performance for clarity."

132,2019-10-09,HDFC,"NHAI’s maiden investor meet held about a fortnight ago reiterated the targeted 6,000km of orders in FY20Developers cite high land cost, slow acquisition of land because of legal hurdles and funding constraints as reasons for the delay

The slow pace of ordering in the first six months of FY20 has raised doubts over National Highways Authority of India’s (NHAI’s) ability to achieve its target for the full year.
NHAI’s maiden investor meet held about a fortnight ago reiterated the targeted 6,000km of orders in FY20. To be sure, this looks to be a tall order given that until end-September, only about 600km of orders were awarded. A report by HDFC Securities Ltd estimates ordering of only 4,500km in FY20. Others, such as Antique Stock Broking Ltd and BOB Capital Markets Ltd have also scaled down estimates to 4,500-5,000km.
Developers cite high land cost, slow acquisition of land because of legal hurdles and funding constraints as reasons for the delay. In fact, after a lull in government activity due to the general election, the road sector failed to shift into the fast track as was expected. After FY18, when NHAI’s orders peaked at about 7,400km, the pace has slipped.
What gives? The much-touted hybrid annuity model (HAM), where the government provides the comfort of equity support upfront, is now on shaky ground. Reasons vary from delayed financial closures to liquidity issues that have constrained bank funding, and even last mile land acquisition hurdles.
Meanwhile, a firm directive from the Prime Minister’s Office asking NHAI to stop government funded HAM projects due to fiscal constraints could further delay project awards.
A switch to the BOT (build-operate-transfer) model of awards may not find takers. According to Rajeshwar Burla, vice president and associate head (corporate ratings) at Icra Ltd, “The equity requirements of private road developers are higher in BOT compared to HAM. Given the current financial health of many developers, equity mobilisation is challenging."" Further, macroeconomic issues would make it hard for firms to raise project debt.
That apart, equity markets are volatile with lack of investor appetite for the infrastructure sector. Shares of leading road construction firms such as Sadbhav Engineering Ltd and Dilip Buildcon Ltd are down 20-30% since January.
Meanwhile, traffic flow forecast is another risk to BOT projects, wherein cash flows hinge on toll collections, unlike a HAM project that offers steady annuity income for the developer.
Analysts are of the view that a new BOT model concession agreement is being reworked to make it more attractive for developers as well as lenders. But this may take time.
So, FY20 is likely to see hiccups in orders for road projects. Thereafter, analysts reckon that if land acquisition is in place and economic activity picks up, NHAI’s orders too will gain momentum. Analysts are therefore in sync with NHAI order targets set for FY21 and FY22, though the fact remains that it would be lower than the peak level scaled in FY18."
131,2019-10-09,HDFC,"This action follows the earlier intimation received· from US FDA in August 2019, wherein the agency had classified its inspection as 'Official Action Indicated'The regulator had also said that the company did not have written procedures for production of medicines

NEW DELHI :
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning letter to Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd’s Indrad plant in Gujarat on Tuesday following an inspection of the facility in April, the company said in an exchange filing today.
This action follows the earlier intimation received· from US FDA in August 2019, wherein the agency had classified its inspection as ""Official Action Indicated"" (OAI).
“We will be engaging with the agency and are fully committed in resolving this issue at the earliest. The Company is also committed to maintaining the highest standards of compliances and quality manufacturing across all its facilities,"" the company said in the filing.
The US regulator classifies its observations as OAI when it believes that violations of current good manufacturing practices are severe and require urgent remedial measures. If the company fails to assure the regulator of undertaking remedial measures, the US FDA issues a warning letter to the plant. New product approvals are usually not given to a plant under warning letter.
After the regulator inspected the Indrad facility in April, it had issued a Form 483 with four observations, three for the finished drug product unit and one for active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) unit.
One of the observations for the finished drug unit was that the company failed to thoroughly review any unexplained discrepancy and failure of a batch, according to the Form 483, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint.
US FDA also cited that the company did not carry out investigations when APIs were found to be out of specification.
Torrent Pharma also did not calibrate its electronic and automatic equipment to a written programme designed to assure proper performance, US FDA said in the Form 483.
The regulator had also said that the company did not have written procedures for production of medicines at the plant so as to assure quality of the product.
“The fact that they will get a warning letter was already factored in when their observations were classified as OAI. With their Dahej plant also under OAI and under risk for a warning letter, it is unlikely they will be getting any product approvals this year,"" Amey Chalke, analyst for HDFC Securities said.
The US FDA had inspected the company’s other facility in Dahej in March, after which it had issued certain observations which were later categorized as OAI.
Both the plants manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as medicine formulations.
Out of the  ₹7,673 crore that Torrent Pharmaceuticals generated in revenue in 2018-19 (Apr-Mar),  ₹1,589 crore or 21% came from sale of medicines in the US, according to the company's annual report. The country is Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ second largest market after India."
130,2019-10-09,HDFC,"After a bumper rally triggered by corp tax cuts on 20 September, markets had turned volatile ahead of Q2 earningsThe Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%

Mumbai: Investors on Wednesday cheered the government’s decision to raise dearness allowance (DA) in the middle of the festival season, driving Indian markets up nearly 2% in a rally led by financial sector stocks.
The benchmark 30-share BSE Sensex closed 1.72% or 645.97 points higher at 38,177.95, while the 50-share Nifty closed at 11,313.30, up 186.90 points or 1.68%.
The five percentage point increase in DA to 17% will put more money in the hands of at least 5 million government employees and 6.5 million pensioners. The hike, which will cost the exchequer  ₹16,000 crore, will be effective from July.
Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, attributed Wednesday’s rebound to bargain hunting as well, coming after six straight days of losses. “Sentiments also turned positive after the government hiked dearness allowance. Most emerging market stocks were headed lower for a third day on Wednesday as the US and China showed little signs of backing off from their trade dispute ahead of a crucial round of negotiations. However, later, European shares moved sharply higher and the Chinese currency in the offshore market jumped on Wednesday after a Bloomberg report said China was still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%.
According to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, banking stocks rallied on hopes of greater liquidity and consumption, as the plunge in bond yields indicates further room for rate cuts. “Further, the hike in DA will add impetus to festival demand. Going forward, the results season will dictate the market direction and investors are expecting some green shoots on account of festival demand and good monsoon,"" he said. The 10-year bond yield jumped 22 basis points to 6.45% on Wednesday.
After a bumper rally triggered by corporate tax cuts on 20 September, the markets had turned volatile ahead of second quarter earnings. Analysts said the tax cuts are a pro-investment stimulus, but will take time to show results, given the nature of the ongoing economic slowdown.
Rahul Singh, chief investment officer-equities at Tata Mutual Fund, said the 8-9% lift in Nifty earnings per share after the corporate tax cuts will provide support to stock valuations, in addition to the fact that India’s valuation premium to other emerging markets is at a more acceptable level now. “The recent privatization initiative indicates the government’s seriousness in tackling the economic slowdown and we believe that there is more to come in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.
Indian companies are set to report a drop in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including tax cuts for companies.
“It has been a year since the IL&FS crisis erupted and the repercussions of the same are still being felt, especially in financials. Besides NBFCs, banks too have started facing asset quality concerns now,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.
The brokerage firm said the earnings season will be more of the same—tepid and uneventful. The underlying demand slowdown in the domestic economy and weak global commodities prices are expected to take a toll on earnings with very few bright spots, if any, it said."
129,2019-10-10,HDFC,"Growth in overall loan book for the Sep quarter was 19%, higher than 17% of Jun quarter but lower than 22% a year agoInvestors have to realize that HDFC Bank is not immune to the broad-based slowdown, especially when a consumption slowdown is under way

There is no doubt that investors love HDFC Bank Ltd. The island of safety the stock offered during the past three volatile weeks is a reflection of the private sector lender’s strong balance sheet.
Its exposures to major troubled assets are a shadow of its peers and it seems HDFC Bank made all the right decisions in lending. After all, its gross bad loans totalled just  ₹11,769 crore as of June quarter. Its closest competitor in size, ICICI Bank Ltd has a bad loan stock nearly four times that of HDFC Bank even though its balance sheet is smaller.
Public sector banks of similar size fare worse on their asset quality metrics. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, HDFC Bank’s exposure to high-risk stressed loans was just 0.9% of its FY19 net worth, the lowest among banks. To the several defaulting companies that have cropped up in the last three months, HDFC Bank has the lowest exposure among peer banks.
Ergo, the bank’s valuations have only soared even after its stock is trading at a multiple of more than three times its estimated FY21 book value, deemed expensive by some analysts.
In all this, investors have to realize that HDFC Bank is not immune to the broad-based slowdown, especially when a consumption slowdown is under way. Indeed, the private sector lender’s large retail portfolio is making it run countercyclical to the rest of the banking system.
The deep slowdown in the automobile sector is weighing down HDFC Bank’s commercial vehicle loan growth. Even growth in unsecured personal loans have decelerated for the lender as of the June quarter. That said, the bank told the exchanges that its overall loan book grew a healthy 19% in the September quarter. That is higher than the 17% growth in the previous quarter but lower than the 22% growth a year ago.
But a bank can be profitable despite lack of growth if its operations are cost-efficient.
Hemindra Hazari, an independent research analyst, pointed out that the private sector bank has managed to give high return on assets to investors simply because it runs its shop efficiently and is able to keep a lid on operating costs.
“In the current faltering economy, the bank is unlikely to increase its net interest margin and its fees to compensate for the expected higher credit costs and if it is unable to continue with its earlier strategy, shareholders should expect a decline in its profitability,"" Hazari wrote in a note on research website Smartkarma.
Notwithstanding the pressure on its profitability, HDFC Bank in all likelihood may look better than its peers, which are still saddled with dud loans. But it sure is a duller version of its illustrious past."

125,2019-10-13,HDFC,"Investors pile into HDFC Bank’s stock, convinced it will emerge winner from India’s financial woesAmong the 25 biggest lenders globally, no other stock commands a higher price relative to earnings or net assets

All around HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s biggest lender by market value, the news seems to be bad and getting worse: economic growth is slowing, loan losses are rising and shadow banks are mired in crisis.
And yet investors keep piling into HDFC Bank’s stock, convinced it will emerge a winner from India’s financial woes. The lender's market value has surged by $21 billion over the past year, more than any other bank worldwide. Among the 25 biggest lenders globally, no other stock commands a higher price relative to earnings or net assets.
Bulls say they have good reasons to be optimistic: HDFC Bank will grab market share from embattled shadow lenders and benefit from a flight to quality by investors who’ve grown wary of smaller competitors. While skeptics argue that the bank is vulnerable to India’s economic challenges -- pointing to its large consumer loan exposure and the looming retirement of its longtime leader -- even they say betting against HDFC Bank is risky. Among 54 analysts who cover the stock, only one has the equivalent of a sell rating.
“The business continues to perform very well,"" said Nick Payne, the London-based head of global emerging markets at Merian Global Investors (U.K.) Ltd., which oversees about $33 billion and has been adding to its holdings of HDFC Bank shares. “Strong banks and franchises tend to get stronger when times get tough, as the weak fall by the wayside.""
India’s shadow banks, until recently a growing competitive threat to HDFC Bank and its peers, have been reeling since the latter half of 2018, when a group company of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. defaulted on its debt and triggered an industrywide credit squeeze. Mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd. has missed debt payments since June, while firms including Reliance Capital Ltd. and Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd. have had their credit ratings cut on liquidity concerns.
The turmoil has come against a backdrop of five straight quarters of slowing economic growth, the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, and predictions that bad loans at Indian banks will jump to a record 12% by early next year.
All the while, HDFC Bank’s stock price has marched higher. Now valued at about $92 billion, the company trades for 24 times projected earnings over the next 12 months. That’s almost three times more expensive than the Bloomberg World Banks Index, within a hair’s breadth of the biggest valuation premium on record. The company’s price-to-book ratio of 4.3 compares with 1.5 at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest U.S. lender by market capitalization.
Not everyone is convinced the outsized gains will continue. Gautam Chhugani, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., downgraded HDFC Bank to market perform from outperform on Sept. 9. He cited succession risks around next year’s planned departure of Aditya Puri, who has led the company since 1994, as well as the potential for deteriorating asset quality in the bank’s  ₹4.43-trillion ($62.5 billion) retail lending portfolio.
While HDFC Bank has said loan losses in its retail business have been stable and within expectations, that could change if India’s economic growth and employment trends continue to worsen.
Retail credit costs “are unlikely to remain benign over the medium term,"" Chhugani said.
HDFC Bank didn’t respond to a request for comment.
Optimists draw comfort from the firm’s nearly unmatched track record of keeping loan losses in check throughout multiple economic cycles. HDFC Bank’s per-share book value has grown at a compound annual rate of more than 20% over the past decade, while its gross nonperforming loan ratio of 1.4% at the end of June was the lowest among Indian peers.
HDFC Bank is likely to report “strong’"" profit growth and stable asset quality for the quarter ended September, Diksha Gera, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, wrote in a report on Friday. As shadow lenders retrench, the bank will pick up market share, said Ross Cameron, the head of Northcape Capital Ltd.’s Japan office. It should also get a boost from a recently announced cut to India’s corporate tax rate.
“HDFC Bank’s share price is underpinned by its strong earnings growth, which has proven thus far to be fairly resilient"" to India’s economic headwinds, said Will Malcolm, a fund manager for emerging market equities at Aviva Investors Asia Pte. He called the stock a “core holding.""
“Nothing is forever and we expect volatility in the market,"" said Kristy Fong, an Asian equities investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Singapore. “HDFC Bank, however, should continue to be a long-term compounder.""

124,2019-10-13,HDFC,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

123,2019-10-14,HDFC,"Before IRCTC, Avenue Supermarts Ltd more than doubled on listing in March 2017 after the company’s IPO got bids for 106 times the quantity offered

IRCTC more than doubled on the first day of listing, the best debut for a local company since 2017, after its public float emerged as the most sought after for the nation’s state-run firms. Lured by IRCTC’s monopoly status, investor demand exceeded shares on offer by 112 times, eclipsing the government-owned Housing & Urban Development Corp. and Cochin Shipyard Ltd., whose maiden offerings were oversubscribed more than 75 times in 2017, a record year for Indian IPOs.
The company garnered  ₹643 crore ($91 million) for the government, which sold 20.1 million shares, or a 12.5% stake, in a price band of  ₹315-320 apiece. IRCTC’s IPO is also the biggest and the most successful among the four companies from the Indian Railways stable that have gone public.
Key Insights
The company’s core business is spread across four verticals -- railway catering, tourism services, online ticketing and packaged drinking water. It is the only authorized firm by the Indian Railways to provide these services in trains.
Catering service is the largest contributor to IRCTC’s top line and the company controls about half the bottled water sold on stations.
Even so, it is internet ticketing that adds the most to its bottomline. About three-quarters of 1.4 million people who traveled by train daily in the April-to-August period booked tickets online.
“It is a unique IPO as most of IRCTC’s businesses are a monopoly,"" said Abhimanyu Sofat, head of research at Mumbai-based IIFL Securities Ltd. “There are future levers of growth in terms of the fee charged on the ticket booking and packaged drinking water.""
Starting Sept. 1, the company has resumed charging a fee on tickets booked online, which is expected to add 4.5 billion rupees to revenue annually, said Arafat Saiyed, analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage Reliance Securities Ltd.
Market Reaction
IRCTC’s shares surged as high as  ₹698 versus the sale price of  ₹320, the best performance by a debutante since 2017. The premium valued the company at $1.5 billion at 10:52 a.m. in Mumbai
Before IRCTC, Avenue Supermarts Ltd., owned by Indian billionaire Radhakishan Damani, more than doubled on listing in March 2017 after the company’s IPO got bids for 106 times the quantity offered.
Some of the top gainers among mainboard IPOs since January 2017 are:
Company	Offer Price (Rs.) Debut Gains (%)
Avenue Supermarts	Rs 299 114%
Central Depository	Rs 149 75%
HDFC AMC	Rs 1,100 65%
Dixon Technologies	Rs 1,766 64%
AU Small Finance Bank	Rs 358 51%
The stellar response may help bolster the government’s drive to raise a record  ₹1.1 trillion ($14.8 billion) selling state firms this financial year, though not all share sales will elicit a resounding response.
“IRCTC is an exception because of the quality of businesses it offers,"" IIFL’s Sofat said. “This can’t be said for every government company.""
IRCTC’s debut is a bright spot in India’s IPO market that has seen 11 issuers raise a little over 100 billion rupees in the first nine months of the year, the fewest issuers since 2014, according to PRIME Database. That compares with about 310 billion rupees raised via 24 public floats in 2018.
More than 20 companies shelved IPO plans this year, thanks to the general election in May and as the lingering crisis in the nation’s credit market damped risk appetite.

The buyers included Birla Long Term Advantage Fund - Series -1, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, and Steinberg India Emerging Opportunities Fund Ltd, which bought at  ₹195 per share.

The proceeds from the share sale will be used by the promoters to repay debt, a person close to the development told Mint, requesting anonymity. Earlier in March, the company’s promoters had sold a 6.85% stake for around  ₹320 crore.
The shares were sold via the promoter entity, Bajaj Resources Ltd. which holds 59.9% stake in the company, of which nearly 63%, or 5.56 crore shares, are pledged, as per regulatory filings on the exchanges.
""The promoter pledge would effectively come down to zero after the trade, which would give fillip to the stock as promoter leverage would go,"" the person said.

Indian markets edged higher today in early trade, lifted by gains in banking stocks and Reliance Industries. The Sensex was up around 100 points while the Nifty edged above 11,600.
Among financials, Yes Bank surged 6% while both SBI, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance logged gains over 1% each.
Market heavyweight RIL was up 0.7% ahead of its Q2 earnings announcement. The sequential recovery in refining margins should help RIL’s earnings.

""Nifty has multiple hurdles at every 50 points higher from current levels. In case the market manages to cross 11,700 in 3 to 4 days, it would result in re-knocking 12100 levels in coming days.

Current deposit insurance scheme:
The  ₹1 lakh limit covers both principal and interest amount.
All deposits maintained by the depositor across all branches of the failed bank are clubbed. Or in other words, if a person keeps deposits in different branches of a bank, they are paid a maximum of up to Rs. 1 lakh only on the aggregate amount.
However, deposits maintained with different banks are not clubbed.
The deposit insurance scheme covers all banks operating in India including private sector, co-operative and even branches of foreign banks in India. There are some exemptions like deposits of foreign governments, deposits of central/state governments and inter-bank deposits."

MUMBAI :
Housing finance major HDFC Ltd on Sunday said it has localised its website in six Indian languages, in addition to English, to help homebuyers get home loan related information more effectively.
The website content is now also available in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam and Kannada, even as English continues to be a widely used language on digital platforms in India, HDFC said.
HDFC Ltd is the only corporate in the financial sector to offer content on its website in six Indian languages, it added.
The growing use of internet and smartphones and rising base of regional language users, particularly in smaller towns, has made it important to focus on building digital properties and content where relevant information is available in local language as well, it said.
Speaking on this initiative, HDFC Ltd Managing Director Renu Sud Karnad said, ""We are happy to share that we are among the few brands in the BFSI space to implement the 'language localisation technology'.
""This is in line with Government's Digital India initiative to let customers access the digital content in the language they are comfortable with. HDFC's website in regional languages will help us tremendously to reach deeper across India to the untapped audience,"" she said.
HDFC was awarded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the best performing primary lending institution in the EWS (economically weaker section) and LIG (low income group) and second best in the MIG (middle income group) category in June 2018.
Besides, in March 2019, HDFC was awarded as the 'Best Private Sector Financial Institution' for PMAY-CLSS at PMAY Empowering India Awards 2019.
Karnad said the new language localisation initiative will further facilitate HDFC to promote the government's flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) to the EWS and LIG customers, particularly in the tier-II, tier-III cities and smaller towns with a vast non-English speaking segment.
""While we are live with our website in six regional languages, we also intend to incorporate many more languages going forward to cater to as many regional users as possible, since consumers prefer to consume content in their preferred language,"" she added.
HDFC as of May 2019 has disbursed subsidy of over  ₹2,345 crore to over 1.1 lakh first-time homebuyers under PMAY-Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), becoming the first housing finance player to achieve this feat.
Also, during the quarter ended 30 June last year, 35% of home loans approved in volume terms and 17% in value terms have been to customers from EWS and LIG categories.
HDFC, on an average, has been approving about 8,700 loans on a monthly basis to the EWS and LIG segment, with monthly average approvals at  ₹1,415 crore.
As per a Nasscom and KPMG report, currently there are approximately 52.1 crore Hindi language speakers and 50 crore other Indian language speakers in India. In contrast, English language speakers stand at just 12.5 crore.
Further, internet adoption rate of Indian language users is higher than English speaker users. Indian language internet user base is set to see a healthy growth, registering a CAGR of 18% to reach 53.6 crore by 2021.
This growth is likely to be faster compared to English internet user base, which is growing at 3% to 19.9 crore.
Indian language internet users are expected to account for nearly three-fourths of India's internet user base by 2021.
It has been observed that there is a high preference for regional languages over English content among Indians as 70% literacy rate in India is for non-English languages.
Rapid adoption of mobile internet, affordable data plans and growing digital connectivity have improved internet subscribers base in India. This trend has opened up multiple avenues to improve consumer touch points, mainly offering services in regional languages.
HDFC Ltd is India's leading mortgage lender and a well-established financial conglomerate, with a network of 557 offices across the country.

112,2019-10-21,HDFC,"Budget 2019 increased the tax-free component of the NPS maturity corpus from 40% to 60%. This has made it a compelling alternative to superannuation fundsHDFC Pension Fund CEO Sumit Shukla, a pension fund manager in NPS, talks about the challenges and opportunities before National Pension System

Budget 2019 increased the tax-free component of the National Pension System (NPS) maturity corpus from 40% to 60%. This has made NPS a compelling alternative to superannuation funds, which only have a 33% tax-free component. Sumit Shukla, CEO, HDFC Pension Fund, a pension fund manager in NPS, talks about this difference and the challenges and opportunities before NPS.
Why should anyone invest in NPS?
If you have a retirement goal, NPS should be in your basket. One big benefit is the tax benefit—whether you are salaried or self-employed. Also, the charges in NPS are very low. The tax benefit, the structure of the product, the government monitoring of the product, and investment quality given the cost, are a few reasons why you should be a part of NPS. I believe that it should be made mandatory for citizens of India—that’s how we can protect future generations from a hard retirement.
The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) has reportedly agreed to allow EPF members to switch to NPS in return for a reverse option. What are your thoughts on this?
It is a very good idea. We have a track record of five to seven years and our returns are 10.5-11%, while EPF’s return is 8.5-9%. There is an extra return you can make by being invested in NPS. EPF largely makes debt investments. In NPS, you get the opportunity of an equity allocation of 50-75%. The cost of running EPF, although paid by corporates, is 3.5-4%. If you merge it into NPS, all that cost will go away. It’s a reform that has to be done. Employees, especially younger ones, don’t consider EPF a part of their investment. Instead, in the first five years of the job, if they see a sizeable NPS corpus, they will get excited about saving for retirement. Put retirement savings in one place and let the customer be the king.
A number of fintech firms such as Paytm have got points of presence (PoP) licence. Has this caused an uptick in the flows?
It is a good initiative. NPS is a good product and they should be selling a good product. I don’t think Paytm has launched their PoP yet. The problem with NPS today is that nobody sells it—banks or non-banks. Anyone who sells it will have a free run. We are welcoming it in a big way.
Pension fund manager fees are capped at 0.01% of the corpus in NPS. Does this make managing a pension fund viable?
No, it doesn’t make it viable. We are all loss-making. In perpetuity, we will be loss making. The regulator is also seized of the matter. They understand that if the franchisees do not make money, they will not survive. Sooner or later, they will have to do something about making an NPS franchisee a profitable entity. At this juncture, we make 0.01%. Half of that goes as a fee to the regulator. So we actually make 0.005%. Our brokerage alone is much higher than the fees we make. Even government pension managers, which have large corpuses, are all into debt. The regulator has to fix this. If the franchisees does not make money, they will not put the right people in research or the right kind of people in investment and subscribers will suffer. We have already seen that one entity has moved out of the business.
Some NPS equity funds have underperformed the index. Should NPS have index funds as well?
I think NPS should be actively managed. Some NPS funds have underperformed but they will catch up. Some fund managers have not put the right kind of infrastructure into place. If they had done so, they would’ve beaten the index. Yes, there are subscribers who want index funds. So if some innovation can be made, index funds should be allowed. You need to have both active and index funds.
The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) allowed government subscribers to switch pension fund managers and asset allocation several months ago. How have these reforms worked out?
They have not taken off at all because the regulator has to come back on the legacy funds (existing corpus of subscribers). Switching is only open to new employees of the government. We have got a few subscribers who have opted for us but it’s not substantial in our overall assets under management (AUM). The regulator also has to actively do marketing and canvassing with government offices to tell people that this facility is available. Otherwise no one will ever come to know that such a change has happened. People don’t know how to change pension fund managers.
What difference are superannuation funds making to NPS enrolment? Are there any advantages of switching from superannuation funds to NPS?
It’s a huge advantage. People are using and should use it. In superannuation funds, you get a 33% tax-free amount on retirement; in NPS, you get 60% tax-free amount. If you buy annuity from a superannuation fund, you have to pay 1.8% GST; in NPS, the GST is zero. Also, in NPS, you manage the fund. It’s a little cumbersome to move from a superannuation fund to NPS but we are seeing corporates do it. A guy who is retiring should necessarily shift from superannuation to NPS.
PFRDA hiked the cap on equity investment in NPS to 75% in 2018. Has there been an impact?
Our equity percentage of AUM has started moving up. It will take time. The enhanced cap is only available to people younger than 50. However, the process is simple and people are taking it up."

Considering the state of the Indian economy, HDFC Bank Ltd’s performance in the second quarter of FY20 was decent. The bank’s provisional figures had indicated that it expected the results to be stable. Its September quarter earnings were largely in line with expectations.
Net profit growth was driven by lower taxation, loan growth and higher profit on sale of investments. The private sector lender’s net profit in the September quarter grew around 27% year-on-year to  ₹6,345 crore. Asset quality, too, was stable, with gross non-performing assets at 1.38%. This stood at 1.33% in the year-ago quarter.
Overall year-on-year loan growth at 25% was driven by home, agricultural and corporate loans. However, the ongoing slump in the automobile sector weighed on its retail loan book, which grew around 15% year-on-year.
In a post-earnings conference call, the management said that vehicle finance disbursal in the second quarter had been better than in the first, and the bank expects a boost around Diwali.
Though a widespread slowdown is evident, the lender has not seen any asset quality deterioration in its retail pool of vehicle finance, said the management.
Analysts say that excluding the vehicle category, the HDFC Bank’s retail loan book grew 19% year-on-year. While the management sounded hopeful, investors in this stock should closely watch for any further deterioration.
Subdued growth in retail loans led to weakness in net interest income growth; the slow balance-sheet growth was also one of the key disappointments. So, improvements there will be looked at.
Other than these, a transition in leadership could also weigh on the stock’s performance. HDFC Bank’s chief Aditya Puri could retire mid-way in FY21 due to a rule that sets 70 years as the maximum age for top banking executives to hold office.
This calendar year, the HDFC Bank stock has gained twice as much as the Nifty Bank Index at 16%, outpacing peers. The Nifty Bank index climbed just 7.22%.
Rewarded for its steady earnings performance, it is one of the most expensive stocks in the banking space. The HDFC Bank stock trades at a one-year-forward price-to-book multiple of 4 times, much higher than ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd."

""Our analysis suggests that some of the aforementioned claims are not justified by the publicly available data. Nonetheless we expect the stock to be volatile till the company clarifies on these complaints. More importantly as happened in the past with such issues, this could arrest the re-rating that had started recently post solid operational performance in trailing 12 months and could potentially lead to lower target multiples in the interim,"" Motilal Oswal Research said in a 21 October report.

107,2019-10-28,HDFC,"A merger between two mutual funds may also mean a merger of schemes as both may have similar schemesIn case of a merger of a scheme, one scheme (transferor scheme) will cease to exist once the merger is over

Baroda Mutual Fund and BNP Paribas Mutual Fund recently announced a merger of their mutual fund businesses. The proposal awaits the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). But does a merger of mutual funds impact investors?
It does since there will be a change of management once the merger is complete. A merger between two mutual funds may also mean a merger of schemes as both may have similar schemes. Post Sebi’s scheme categorization rules, mutual funds can have only one open-ended scheme in each category, and the merged entity will have to take steps to merge schemes that fall in the same category.
Whenever there is a change in the fundamental attributes of a scheme, investors have to be given notice of the proposed change and the option to exit the scheme at the prevailing net asset value (NAV) without paying exit loads if they do not approve of the change. The approval of the investors is not required to give effect to the change. Once the board of the AMC and the trustees approve it, the proposal is forwarded to Sebi. Once the proposal is approved by Sebi, the mutual fund is required to send notices to unit holders. The notice contains all the information such as the rationale for the merger and its consequences so that the investor is able to make an informed decision on whether to stay on in the scheme or not.
Should you stay?
In case of a merger or acquisition, it is important to assess the strengths of the merged entity. In the case of the merger of Baroda MF and BNP Paribas MF, the intent is to leverage the retail reach of Baroda MF with the management strengths of BNP Paribas. If a mutual fund is being acquired by another, then it is important to consider the performance of the acquirer’s schemes and its strategy and investment philosophy.
In case of a merger of a scheme, one scheme (transferor scheme) will cease to exist once the merger is over. The investors in the transferor scheme will be issued units in the scheme into which it is being merged (transferee scheme). There is no tax implication when new units are issued in lieu of existing units. The option to exit will be available only to investors in the transferor scheme unless there is a change in the fundamental attributes of the transferee scheme as well. Investors in the transferor scheme should consider the change in the mandate, and the performance and investment objective of the transferee scheme.
Investors are given a notice period of 30 days to consider their options. If they decide to exit, then can do so without paying an exit load. However, if there are any capital gains on exit, the tax incidence will have to be borne by the investor. If they decide to stay on and are issued units in the transferee scheme, it will not affect their period of holding for the calculation of capital gains for any subsequent sale. The original date of acquisition of units will still be valid."
106,2019-10-29,HDFC,"The asset management company managed to maintain market share in the actively-managed AUMs at about 15.8%HDFC AMC has increased its actively managed equity AUM by about 11% y-o-y to  ₹1.64 trillion

Mumbai: Lower inflows into equity funds notwithstanding, shares of asset management companies have been on investors’ radars.
HDFC Asset Management Company Ltd’s stock surged 7.7% in the last month. On Friday, the company reported a strong 79% year-on-year surge in its net profit to  ₹368.3 crore for the September quarter (Q2FY20), which has piqued investor interest.
One of the key reasons for this surge in profitability was the reduction in commissions and fees paid to distributors. Net fee expenses were lower by 44% and was almost negligible in Q2. As operating expenses were considerably lower, it boosted operating margin. However, once these expenses normalise in the coming quarters, gains will stop accruing from lower fee expenses.
Nevertheless, this has given a fillip to Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins as one of the major expense of fees and commissions is now being charged to individual scheme accounts. Ebitda margins stood at 91% in Q2 compared with 89% in the year-ago quarter.
However, growth in revenue has been lower as asset management fees have been reduced, even as inflows slowed marginally. Revenue rose just about 3.5% y-o-y in Q2.
HDFC AMC has increased its actively managed equity assets under management (AUM) by about 11% y-o-y to  ₹1.64 trillion, thanks to strong inflows through systematic investment plans. HDFC AMC also managed to maintain market share during the period in the actively-managed AUMs at about 15.8%. 
One thing to watch out for would be equity inflows into mutual funds. Inflows into equity funds dipped to about  ₹3,860 crore in September from about  ₹8,500 crore in August. Mutual funds have seen lump sum redemptions to the tune of  ₹4,370 crore, which if it continues could hamper the growth of AUMs.
Besides, HDFC AMC is quite a pricey stock. For now, it trades at a stiff price-earnings multiple of 55 times trailing 12-month earnings."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

99,2019-11-04,HDFC,"Cards targeting millennials are often enticing due to attractive offers and cashbacks they provide but evaluate carefully if they make sense for youEvaluate how much you’d have to spend in order to avail the offers; stay away if it pushes you into spending more

In August this year, HDFC Bank launched the Millennia cards targeting the country’s millennials. The bank offers a prepaid card, a debit card, a credit card and an EMI card as part of its Millennia range. “I am confident that this unique range of cards will allow us to meet the youth’s evolving needs,"" said Parag Rao, country head-payments business and marketing, HDFC Bank.
At close to 450 million, India has the world’s largest millennial population, making them the top consumers of goods and services. While HDFC Bank and others are trying to leverage this fact, does it really make sense to get these Millennia cards? We help you understand.
Credit card
While the bank claims to offer additional benefits tailored for the millennial spending habit, there’s little distinction between this and other cards available in the market. But, what stands out is the higher cashbacks on online transactions. “As millennials are more comfortable using digital wallets, this card allows cashback on reloading digital wallets which most other cards don’t,"" said Naveen Kukreja, CEO and co-founder, Paisabazaar.com, an online financial services marketplace. The card gives a 2.5% cashback for every online transaction above  ₹2,000 and a 1% cashback on all offline spends and wallet reloads on a minimum transaction size of  ₹100. Note that this is not applicable on fuel spends and there’s a cap on the maximum cashback. “The biggest benefit of this card is that it accrues cashbacks instead of reward points. The cashback is accrued in the form of CashPoints, which can be redeemed against the statement balance or flight and hotel bookings or making purchases from the bank’s SmartBuy rewards portal,"" said Kukreja.
However, these CashPoints come with a short expiry period. The co-founder of an online marketplace who didn’t want to be named said, “While the reward points of most credit cards have an expiry period of 2-3 years, the CashPoints on this credit card expires within one year."" The conversion rate for one CashPoint is  ₹0.30. The renewal fee on this card is waived off only on spending above  ₹1 lakh in the first year and joining fee is waived off on spending more than  ₹30,000 in the first 90 days.
Lovaii Navlakhi, CEO and MD, International Money Matters said, the objective of such products is to get the youth to spend more.“Having a credit card is a plus if you are smart and can take advantage of the credit card billing cycles to avail maximum credit. But if you are unorganized, it can result in overdue charges, which then becomes a vicious cycle,"" said Navlakhi. He said one shouldn’t get tempted looking at the reward points and cashback because no great wealth is created out of them.
Easy EMI card
The feature of this card is nearly the same as the credit card except for the fact that all transactions above  ₹10,000 automatically get converted into EMIs for nine months at an interest rate of 20% per annum. The cardholder also earns cashback on transactions converted into EMI. “The interest rate charged on the EMI is pretty high compared to other options including personal loan and EMI conversion available on regular credit cards. While the rate of interest (ROI) in case of this card is 20% , it starts from 13% in case of EMI conversion on other cards,"" said the co-founder quoted above. Also, this card gives a single choice of a nine-month tenure whereas tenures range anywhere from three to 48 months in other cards.
A processing fee at  ₹99 plus GST is also levied. “The  ₹99 on  ₹10,000 increases the interest rate to 24.90% per annum; even if the amount spent is  ₹40,000, the interest rate is 22.70%. You should just repay it by the due date. Living beyond your means is a habit that is difficult to shake off,"" said Navlakhi. In response to why one should still go for the card, Rao said, customers get up to 5% cashback within the same month on the transaction amount, thereby reducing the ROI impact.
Prepaid and debit cards
Prepaid cards are payment cards with the monetary value stored on the card and not an external bank account. “There are not many comparable products to HDFC Millennia prepaid card in the market. The Axis Bank Gift Card has a loadable limit of  ₹50,000, while the ICICI Bank prepaid card variant offers limit of up to  ₹10,000. On the other hand, the HDFC card comes with a loadable limit of up to  ₹1 lakh, along with insurance cover and exclusive cashback offers,"" said Raj Khosla, founder and MD, MyMoneyMantra, an online financial services marketplace.
The Millennia prepaid card offers a personal accident cover of  ₹1 lakh, which can be availed only if the card is used for shopping at least once in the last 30 days, excluding ATM withdrawals.
For individuals who are just learning to be financially independent, going for a prepaid card is a better option as it allows you to spend only what you have. Khosla said, he recommends a prepaid card for millennials who want to spend on the go. Since you are not obligated to maintain any minimum balance, there are no restrictions on number of transactions.
“Students are one key segment as they may not have a bank account to avail a debit card or credit history to avail a credit card. For regular customers, prepaid cards can be used as a gift for friends and family,"" said Rao. The Millennia debit card comes with features such as daily domestic shopping limit of  ₹3.5 lakh and daily cash withdrawal limit of  ₹50,000, annual cashback up to  ₹4,800 and 1% cashback on reloading wallets. Cardholders can earn 5% cashback on shopping via PayZapp and SmartBuy. Khosla said the annual access to airport lounge is limited to only four on this card whereas there are cards that offer six to eight lounge access each quarter.
Mint take
Though the bank has tried to cater to various spending patterns through the four cards, it’s advisable to compare and understand all the terms and conditions before taking the plunge. The rewards and cashback may seem attractive at first but it’s important to evaluate how much you’d have to spend in order to avail them. If it pushes you into spending more than what you can, it’s best to stay away."
98,2019-11-04,HDFC,"HDFC booked a gain of  ₹1627 crore through its stake sale in erstwhile subsidiary Gruh FinanceInvestors need to watch how long the lender can keep its margins from eroding especially when its developer book is hardly growing

What is the best place to find out the intimately linked story of a troubled real estate sector and the liquidity crunch non-bank finance companies have found themselves in since last year?
The answer is the balance sheet of the largest non-bank lender to housing. The adjoining chart shows how cautious HDFC Ltd has turned on non-individual housing loans. In other words, HDFC has been going slow in lending to real estate developers over the last several quarters. For housing finance companies such as HDFC, it was a question of prudence but for many others it was simply a question of having no money to lend because of funding channels being choked.
Nevertheless, for HDFC the strategy seems to have worked in protecting its balance sheet. HDFC’s asset quality stayed pristine compared with other industry players even though it did not impress compared with its own historic performance. Gross bad loans rose marginally to form 1.33% of total loan book predominantly due to slippages in the non-individual book. Vice chairman and chief executive Keki Mistry said that loan disbursals growth was led by individual borrowers with non-individual book growing by a measly 3%. “97% of incremental growth in loan book was due to individual loans,"" Mistry said.
Of course, the stellar 60% jump in net profit for the September quarter was mainly due to one-time gains and increase in dividends from subsidiaries including the most valued HDFC Bank. HDFC booked a gain of  ₹1627 crore through its stake sale in erstwhile subsidiary Gruh Finance.
But surely there is a flipside to the focus on affordable loans and retail lending. That flipside is the deceleration in its loan book and the contraction in margins. HDFC’s loan book growth was 13%, a far cry from the average of 17% seen in previous years. Indeed, the deceleration is driven by its non-individual loan book. Another factor in turning your back to developers is the sacrifice on margins. But HDFC has managed to keep the margin erosion to the minimum. Spread on loans was 2.26% for the September quarter, marginal erosion from 2.28% a year ago.
Investors need to watch how long the lender can keep its margins from eroding especially when its developer book is hardly growing. HDFC has been able to maintain margins perhaps partly due to the edge it has in borrowing costs. Compared with its peers, HDFC has enjoyed lower cost of borrowing as its bonds are priced aggressively in the market.
Times may be tough but mortgage lender HDFC Ltd has showed it is tougher, at least so far. That said, HDFC needs to pull through a slowing economy the pain point of which is the real estate sector. Success in this will ensure investors maintain the premium on its stock."

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Monday:
Yes Bank: The private lender announced its September quarter earnings on Friday after market hours. The bank reported a net loss of  ₹600 crore for July-September due to adjustment of  ₹709 crore in one-time deferred tax asset. It had posted a net profit of  ₹965 crore in the same period last year. The bank also aims to raise $1.2 billion equity capital by the end of December.
Maruti Suzuki: The country's largest car maker remains ‘cautiously optimistic' over sales prospect as many challenges that had led to a slowdown in the industry still exist. According to a PTI report, the company, whose domestic passenger vehicle sales grew after seven months in October, said it would take at least few more months to get clarity on the industry’s revival.
RIL: The company’s telecom arm Reliance Jio said any relief package offered by the government to incumbent telecom operators will go against the Supreme Court verdict on adjusted gross revenue, which requires payment of dues to the department of telecommunications. It also alleged that Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have enough funds to pay dues.
HDFC: The housing finance company will announce its September quarter earnings today. The company had last week acquired 9.89% stake in Bandhan Bank Ltd as part of the merger of the bank with HDFC Ltd’s subsidiary Gruh Finance Ltd. Separately, state-owned lender Indian Overseas Bank will also report its numbers for July-September today.
Vodafone Idea: India Ratings and Research downgraded non-convertible debentures of the telecom operator and placed them under negative watch citing adverse impact of the SC ruling on the definition of adjusted gross revenue. The ratings agency also noted increasing risk in bank loan payment defaults and delay in asset monetisation by the firm.
Zee Entertainment: Shares jumped over 30% in the past two sessions even as the firm faces growth challenges and is surrounded by concerns over financial stress. Essel Group's company Dish TV India Ltd also shot up nearly 50% in the last two trading sessions on the back of higher volumes.
Thomas Cook: The travel services provider on Sunday clarified that the sale of the UK-based company to China’s Fosun does not include regions in India, Sri Lanka and Mauritius. The British travel group Thomas Cook PLC, which declared bankruptcy in September under piling debt, had sold its stake in Thomas Cook (India) Ltd in 2012 and is not related to the Indian firm.
Central Bank: The public-sector bank released its September quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. The bank posted a net profit of  ₹138.6 crore for the second quarter due to improvement in asset quality. The lender had reported a loss of  ₹935.5 crore in the year-ago period. Separately, it also started taking approvals for raising equity capital by allotting preferential shares to the government.
Lemon Tree Hotels: The company plans to open three more properties under its upscale Aurika Hotels and Resorts brand across the country by the end of 2021. According to a PTI report, the mainly mid-market segment hotels firm has recently entered Udaipur, with its first hotel under the Aurika Hotels and Resorts brand.
Pharma Stocks: The US Food and Drug Administration late on Friday downplayed the risk associated with popular antacid medicine ranitidine, saying that the carcinogen N-nitrosodimethylamine is not formed after ingestion of the drug and that levels of the contaminant in most samples were similar to those found in common food."

Indian markets ended moderately lower today, snapping a seven-day winning run. The Sensex ended 53 points lower at 40,248 while Nifty settled 0.2% lower at 11,917. Yes Bank settled 3.5% higher at  ₹68.35 to be the top gainer among the Sensex stocks.  
Ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala on Monday bought nearly 1.3 crore shares of Yes Bank, amounting to 0.5% stake of the private lender, for around  ₹87 crore through open market transactions. 
Some market participants expect Indian markets to consolidate in the near term after the record-setting rally that has seen Sensex hitting new highs. 
""Nifty again took resistance near 12,000 zone for third consecutive session. Now index has good support near 11850-11800 zone any break below 11850 zone can see some more cuts in index and immediate resistance is coming near 11,950-12.000 mark. Bulls will get active again if index manages to breach 12,000 zone,"" says Rohit Singre, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities.
Shrikant Chouhan, senior vice-president at equity technical research at Kotak Securities, said:  ""The market has taken a breather. Excitement is missing in the market as majority of the index participants have already declared their Q2 numbers and now traders will wait for either domestic developments or global development on the trade tariff front.

94,2019-11-05,HDFC,"CDSL has a well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed, cushioning it from volatilityShares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor NSE

The market value of Asia’s oldest stock exchange BSE Ltd slipped below that of its depository subsidiary Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) for the first time on Tuesday, as its stock fell nearly 8% so far this year.
On Tuesday, the market capitalization of CDSL stood at  ₹2,431 crore, against BSE’s  ₹2,430.31 crore. At the end of September, BSE held 24% stake in CDSL.
Typically, the parent company’s market value should be more than that of its subsidiary, considering the parent may have its own core business in addition to the subsidiary units. However, there are some exceptions where the units are valued higher. For instance, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Bajaj Finance Ltd have higher market value than their parent Suzuki Motor Corp., Housing Development Corp Ltd, and Bajaj Finserv Ltd, respectively.
Shares of BSE have declined 7.8% this year with the exchange continuing to lose market share to its competitor National Stock Exchange. BSE went public in February 2017 and its shares have since fallen 31.7% from its issue price of  ₹806 a share.
BSE’s financial performance has been muted over the past several quarters, and this has reflected in its stock price, according to Ajit Mishra, vice president of Religare Broking.
“Despite BSE’s duopoly position, the stock has been on a continuous downtrend ever since its IPO in early 2017. It has been losing market share and the network effect is playing against it, which is why it is a dying business model with no visibility for growth and weak durability and sustainability of earnings,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research, Samco Securities.
Shares of CDSL, which was listed in June 2017, have surged more than 59% from the issue price of  ₹149 a share. So far this year, they have gained 6%.
CDSL has an asset-light and well-diversified business model in which 35% of the revenue is fixed (annuity-based), which cushions it from market volatility. “CDSL has a more secular business working in a duopoly position where there is high visibility of earnings sustainability and durability. The triggers of the government’s new rule that even unlisted companies will have to dematerialise their shares and the huge untapped potential of investors in India around 10%, which is currently just 2%, have laid the foundation for a rally,"" Mehta said."
93,2019-11-06,HDFC,"HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has sought for a one-time restructuring to kick-start lending to the sectorParekh said that such a regulatory concession was given by the Reserve bank of India in 2008 which helped revive sentiment

MUMBAI :
A day after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman spoke about reforms in the real estate sector, lenders call for government intervention for the ailing sector and sought approval for restructuring of real estate projects without being tagged as non-performing assets. Speaking at the Indian Mortgage Leadership Conclave organised by India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation, HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh has sought for a one-time restructuring to kick-start lending to the sector.
“I do believe that we can overcome this crisis of confidence if lenders are allowed a one-time restructuring of certain real estate loans – particularly for stuck projects where building approvals have been delayed. If these restructured accounts are considered as standard assets for a period of say, 12 months, lenders will stop being so diffident,"" Parekh said.
Parekh said that such a regulatory concession was given by the Reserve bank of India in 2008 which helped revive sentiment. According to him, restructuring will enable last mile funding even to assets that have slipped owing to tight funding conditions and ensure that these projects are completed.
Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry too felt that there is a need to help those projects which are stuck in 60% plus construction progress and are not able to carry forward. In such cases, lenders are neither not able to invest more funds nor are the developers able to construct and finish the project without further investments.
“We need to have a mechanism where lenders can look to restructure these assets, lend more with stronger governance, end use monitoring and look to complete the projects. The fine print of the govt schemes on this is awaited, we should be able to see the industry making progress on it once the same gets rolled out,"" said Chaudhry.
According to a Fitch Ratings report in October, around $10 billion of development loans are coming up for repayment in the first half of 2020 and this may impact mainstream banks that have lent money to shadow lenders or invested in their bonds. Sitharaman said the government wants to ensure that the crisis in the real estate sector does not spill over to other industries.
Defaults by Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd and Altico Capital have aggravated the issue, making banks excessively cautious in extending loans to housing finance companies (HFCs) and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
A study jointly conducted by industry body Ficci, National Real Estate Development Council and consultant Knight Frank has stated that the outlook for the country’s real estate sector in the September quarter has fallen to the level that was recorded during the uncertain times before general elections in 2014.
The number of property developers reporting bankruptcy has doubled during the past nine months, which has added to the woes of NBFCs, according to a 14 October Reuters report.
As of 30 June, 421 developers are under the corporate insolvency resolution process, up from 209 as of September-end of last year, according to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India."

India’s housing sector may finally witness a silver lining as the government makes concerted efforts, along with financial institutions, to ease distress.
The  ₹25,000 crore package that the government approved on Wednesday, addresses the key pain point of stalled residential projects, in a sector that has now witnessed a five-year long slowdown. Besides, the Supreme Court setting a finite timeline of 90 days to complete the resolution process of Noida-based developer Jaypee Infratech Ltd also brings relief to buyers of over 20,000 flats that are yet to be built.
Keki Mistry, vice-chairman and chief executive, HDFC Ltd, the largest non-bank lender to housing, said given that a huge number of projects are stuck, there could be two ways to revive them. The government’s plan to set up an alternate investment fund (AIF) to revive projects that are 60% completed, would be one.
“...But the second way is to encourage banks, NBFCs and housing finance companies to provide incremental funding to projects, by not classifying them as non-performing loans. No one will finance a project that will be classified on their books as a NPL. Otherwise, these projects will remain stuck forever,"" Mistry said.
The dearth of last mile financing has been a critical issue in projects getting stalled, aggravated by slow sales and low customer payments, because homebuyers today don’t want to buy under-construction projects due to the risks involved.
However, the current revival package for 1600 projects across major cities, is a good starting point, said developers and analysts.
By including projects that are non-performing assets and even if they are admitted in national company law tribunal (NCLT), the government has now expanded the scope and eligibility of more projects that can be included under the scheme.
So far, the government’s main focus has been on low-income housing, in the  ₹45 lakh and below category. But by including homes priced upto  ₹1.5-2 crore in Mumbai and National Capital Region (NCR), the two largest property markets, the largest section of mid-income homes will stand to benefit.
“The finance minister has been extensively consulting with all sections of the industry since the Budget, which is a rarity because most discussions usually happen before it. These measures for real estate are the best possible solutions for the sector but we have proposed additional incentives like promotion of rental housing and modifying the GST rates,"" said Rajeev Talwar, CEO, DLF.
The move by the finance minister is likely to become a game changer as it now includes projects, which are NPA or are under NCLT, a major pain point that was left unaddressed in the September announcement, said analysts.
""...It has come at an opportune moment when the residential market is tackling the headwinds from the trickle down impact of the series of reforms and economic slowdown. While it will boost consumer sentiment and enhance confidence, it will act as a strong catalyst in pushing the sales velocity,"" said Samantak Das, chief economist and head of research and REIS at property advisory JLL.
Chintan Patel, partner and leader-building, construction and real estate, KPMG in India said while the government has taken a step in the right direction, it would be interesting to understand specifics in terms of tenure of investment, costs of funds to the developer, security package etc."

87,2019-11-08,HDFC,"The revision may impact the overseas borrowing programmes of the affected banksMoody’s on Friday revised outlook for 6 financial institutions, including SBI, HDFC Bank and Hudco

NEW DELHI :
Moody’s Investors Service’s revision of the outlook for key Indian banks and financial institutions from stable to negative on Friday could make it dearer for them to borrow on international markets in the short term, three analysts said. This could have implications for their lending rates, too.
Moody’s on Friday affirmed the ratings, but revised the outlook for six banks and financial institutions—State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, EXIM India, Housing and Urban Development Corp. (Hudco) and Indian Railway Finance Corp. (IRFC)—following a similar revision in outlook for India’s Baa2 sovereign rating in light of increasing risks that economic growth will remain lower than in the past.
The outlook revision could impact overseas borrowing programmes of the affected banks, said an analyst with a rating agency in India, adding that the actual quantum of impact may be hard to predict.
“Any rating action will have an impact based on the direction, positive or negative. These are international ratings. Logically, the revision in outlook would have an impact but this depends on whether these institutions are looking at borrowing abroad at this point in time,"" said the analyst, requesting anonymity.
Moody’s said it will downgrade the ratings of SBI, HDFC Bank, EXIM India, Hudco and IRFC if it downgrades India’s sovereign rating. “The close links between the companies and the government of India is the key reason why Moody’s has changed the outlooks for these companies to negative from stable, after doing the same for the sovereign rating,"" said the rating agency statement.
It added that if India’s Baa2 sovereign rating were to be downgraded, HDFC Bank’s rating will also be downgraded in view of the strong linkages between the bank’s business and the sovereign credit profile.“Many financial institutions do raise capital from overseas markets and the outlook revision will obviously have a bearing on cost of borrowing per se in the short term. The government has been taking steps to improve the macroeconomic conditions and once those steps start showing results, the rating outlook will also return to stable,"" said a partner at a consultancy service, who also requested anonymity.
A third analyst, who also asked not to be named, said the outlook revision can have a bearing on borrowing costs, but not as sharply as a ratings downgrade.
Friday’s sovereign rating outlook revision, which financial institutions are also linked with, reflects lower policy effectiveness in addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses, than Moody’s had previously estimated, the rating agency said.
Moody’s has also revised down the outlook of state-run energy companies such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd, which could have an adverse effect on their overseas borrowing costs.
External commercial borrowing (ECB) has been a popular source of capital for Indian businesses. Care Ratings had said on Thursday that there has been a resurgence in ECBs in the past one year, following a decline in the preceding three years, in light of underlying conditions in the domestic economy and financial markets, coupled with the liberalisation of ECB rules.
India has eased ECB rules only when a pressing need is noticed by the government and the Reserve Bank of India, so that cheaper foreign funds do not flood the local economy and create asset bubbles."

88,2019-11-08,HDFC,"The rating actions follow the affirmation of India's Baa2 sovereign rating, and the change in the outlook to negative from stableThe outlook was revised down for EXIM India, HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI

Mumbai: Moody's Investor Services on Friday downgraded financial institutions closely linked to the Indian government's sovereign rating from 'stable' to 'negative' after a similar rating action on India's sovereign outlook which elicited a quick response from the government.
Moody's on Friday revised the outlook of six systemically financial institutions including the State Bank of India and HDFC Bank to negative from stable. 
The rating actions follow the affirmation of India's Baa2 sovereign rating, and the change in the outlook to negative from stable a day earlier.
The outlook was revised down for EXIM India, HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI but was maintained at stable for Bank of India (BOI), Canara Bank (CAN), Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Syndicate Bank (Syndicate) and Union Bank of India (UBI).
Explaining the rational for the downgrade of EXIM India, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI, Moody's said that their final ratings are at the same level as the sovereign rating because of the uplift to their ratings, based on Moody's assumption that these companies will receive government support in times of need.
""Consequently, if Moody's downgrades the sovereign rating, it will also downgrade these companies' final ratings. The close links between the four companies and the government is the key reason why Moody's has changed the outlooks for these companies to negative from stable, after doing the same for the sovereign rating,"" Moody's said in a statement.
Moody's justified its rating action on the country's largest private bank, HDFC Bank by saying that the bank has large direct exposure to government debt and also as the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of a bank is capped at the sovereign rating of the country that it operates in.
Moody's said it expects that BOI, CAN, OBC, Syndicate and UBI to continue to enjoy a very high level of support from the government. Under these support assumptions, even if the sovereign rating is downgraded by one notch to Baa3, the support uplift should be sufficient to keep the final ratings unchanged at Baa3, it said.
""This situation is the key driver of Moody's affirmation of the five banks' ratings.
Moody's does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's rating action,"" it added.
Separately, Moody's downgraded the long-term counterparty risk assessment and long-term local currency counterparty risk rating of HDFC Bank's Bahrain branch and ICICI Bank's Bahrain Branch to Ba2(cr) from Ba1(cr) and Ba2 from Ba1 to align these ratings with Bahrain's local currency ceilings.
Also for ICICI Bank Bahrain Branch, Moody's downgraded the long-term foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note programme rating and subordinate medium-term note programme rating to (P)Ba3 from (P)Ba2 to align these ratings with Bahrain's foreign currency bond ceiling.
There are currently no outstanding bonds issued out of the Bahrain branch, Moody's said in a statement.

85,2019-11-10,HDFC,"Fund houses have not tinkered with their portfolio as Sebi has assured them that their concerns would be looked intoAt present, the Sebi Act exempts mutual funds from investment vehicle provisions

Mumbai: The markets regulator has written to the finance ministry over its recent circular tagging foreign-controlled mutual funds as investment vehicles, two people familiar with the matter said. The regulator’s intervention comes amid fears that the new rules could force several equity asset managers to freeze investment activity and even sell their holdings.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) made its representation after mutual funds made their case to the regulator. The anomaly arising from the circular is that retail domestic money invested in the schemes of foreign-owned mutual funds will be counted as foreign money.
“As per the Sebi Act, under all rules and regulations, mutual funds are exempted from all money pooling or investment vehicle provisions. So, the ministry’s view that foreign majority-owned funds are investment or pooling vehicles is in direct contradiction,"" the first of the two people cited earlier said on condition of anonymity. “This will create unnecessary hurdles for the fund houses if they were to increase their stake in any scrip, which already has foreign investment close to maximum permissible limit under Reserve Bank of India- prescribed threshold.""
The 17 October circular under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) defined mutual funds with more than 50% foreign shareholding as investment vehicles. This will force them to comply with investment caps under foreign direct investment (FDI) rules. For example, if a company is allowed 74% foreign shareholding under FDI rules, any investment in it by an Indian mutual fund with more than 50% foreign shareholding will be considered part of the 74% cap. Many funds may have to sell their holdings in companies where the overall “foreign holding"" has crossed the prescribed cap. So far, only category-III alternative investment funds, real estate investment trusts and infrastructure investment trusts were categorized as investment vehicles.
Some of the fund houses that could be directly impacted by the move are HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. Ltd and Mirae Asset Mutual Fund, all of which have over 50% foreign ownership.
“We have taken cognizance of the issue and are in dialogue with the finance ministry to resolve the issue at the earliest. The ministry has also understood our concern and may issue a clarification soon,"" a regulatory official, the second person cited earlier, said on condition of anonymity.
An email sent to Sebi seeking comment on Friday was not answered till press time.
“The recent changes in the law have resulted in investments by some Indian mutual funds in Indian companies being now treated as indirect foreign investment, as against the earlier position of it being treated as Indian domestic investment,"" said Gautam Mehra, tax and regulatory services leader at PwC India. “Accordingly, additional investments by these mutual funds or other foreign investment would be restricted in investee companies where the permissible level of FDI has been exhausted. Reporting obligations and adherence to pricing norms also follow as a result. It would be useful for stakeholders to fully understand the implications of this change.""
Sebi’s communication to the ministry follows multiple representations from asset management companies, which are likely to be impacted by the move. The Association of Mutual Funds in India had also sent a consolidated representation to the markets regulator, said the first person cited earlier.
A senior executive at a foreign-owned fund house said the move unnecessarily favours domestic fund houses.
“Imagine a situation where I decide to invest in a banking stock, but it has already close to 74% foreign investment. So if I do invest in that scrip, I would potentially end up locking out the entire market (foreign investment),"" he added.
Despite the concerns, fund houses have so far not tinkered with their portfolio as the regulator has assured them that their concerns would be looked into.
“We, as well as some of the other fund houses potentially impacted by the move, have not changed or altered our portfolios,"" said the chief executive of a foreign-owned fund. “If this is the law of the land, though highly unfair and may defy logic, we will have to do a major rehaul of our portfolios. The industry is also in talks with consulting firms to guide us in understanding the implications and getting those addressed by the government."""

HDFC Bank on Wednesday said it will increase its headcount by 50 per cent to 6,000 employees in the north-east (NE) region in the next 2-3 years to cater its network expansion plans.
Out of this, the lender will hire around 1,500 people in the next one year in Assam as the bank plans to increase the number of its branches from 72 to 100 in the state, HDFC Bank Executive Vice President Sandeep Kumar said.
""North-east is very important for our business. We currently have 136 branches spread across the region. Our plan is to take this number to 200 in the next 2-3 years,"" Kumar said at a press conference here.

MUMBAI :
Indian equity market ended higher on Thursday led by gains in financial services and IT sectors. However, positive investor sentiment was marred by headline inflation rate based on consumer price index (CPI) that breached Reserve Bank of India’s medium-term target of 4% for the first time since July 2018.
The government released CPI inflation data after market hours on Wednesday. Retail Inflation jumped to 4.62% in October from 3.99% in September due to a surge in food inflation.
Contrary to the rise in CPI inflation, wholesale prices based inflation, or WPI, eased further to 0.16% in October from 0.33% in September due to subdued prices of non-food articles and fall in prices of manufactured items, according to the government data released today.
BSE Sensex gained 170.42 points or 0.42% to close at 40,286.48, while the Nifty 50 index climbed up 31.65 points or 0.27% ending at 11,872.10 in today’s trade.

77,2019-11-19,HDFC,"Difference between profit before tax and profit after tax is exaggerated on deferred tax paymentsLacklustre revenue growth reveals lower demand both at biz and consumer levels

Earnings for the latest quarter have ushered mixed news for the corporate sector. While the recent cut in corporate tax rates led to better-than-expected profit and restrained the pace of earnings downgrades, businesses continued to reel under pressure in the three months ended September.
Lower commodity prices and cost cutting initiatives by companies aided in aggregate net profit growth, but lower revenue in the second quarter underscored continued sluggish demand.
A Mint analysis of 1,462 firms showed net sales in the September quarter was the lowest in at least 27 quarters. Net sales decelerated 2.23% year-on-year, much lower than the 5.15% growth in the preceding three months, according to data provider Capitaline. This compares to net sales growth of 21.61% in Q2 FY19. In Q2, profit before tax (PBT) was also lowest in three quarters, with companies surveyed reporting a fall of 7.92% y-o-y compared with a 1.58% drop in Q1 FY20.
In the second quarter of FY19, profit before tax had grown by 16.92%. As reduction in corporate tax rate cuts resulted in several adjustments in last quarter’s tax numbers, we have assumed PBT for our assessment.
Including telecom firms Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, PBT of these companies fell 62% (y-o-y) in Q2FY20, while it had reported growth of 10.79% in Q2FY19. The two telcos incurred a record  ₹50,922 crore loss and  ₹23,045 crore loss, respectively, in the September quarter.
The difference between PBT and profit after tax (PAT) is exaggerated due to the deferred tax adjustments for the quarter. Tax reversals pertaining to higher taxes paid in Q1FY20 has also inflated Q2FY20 net profit. Adjusted net profit of these companies rose 8.76% y-o-y in Q2 compared with growth of 0.87% in Q1 FY20. The review excludes banks, financial services and oil and gas companies, which follow a different revenue model.
“The quarterly results show resilient double-digit growth in aggregate net profit aided by the recent corporate tax cut, lower commodity prices and cost-cutting initiatives. However, lacklustre revenue growth reveals lower demand both at the business and consumer levels. Destocking across the board also contributed to sluggish topline growth. Lower commodity prices resulted in lower topline growth for a whole host of firms , including metals,"" said Deepak Jasani, head, retail research, HDFC Securities Ltd.
Prices of commodities, such as crude oil and metals, underwent a steep correction in the September quarter. Crude prices were down 8.67%, aluminium 4.40% and copper 4.79% lower on the London Metal Exchange in Q2.
Jasani said while some companies gained from providing lower amounts towards tax, some others had to write off the accumulated deferred tax asset to opt for the lower tax regime resulting in higher effective tax provision. He expected the effective tax rate to have fallen on an overall basis and which could decline further in the next fiscal.
Data showed that taxes paid by these companies fell 57% in Q2 to the lowest in at least 27 quarters. In the same quarter last fiscal, tax outgo was 32.84% higher.
Shibani Kurian, head, equity research, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, said there was no major disappointment in Q2 earnings overall.
“Earnings were mostly in line with expectations. Management commentaries indicate that they are not confident of the continuation of the minor revival growth seen due to festival demand,"" she said. “Number of companies saw good net profit growth due to cut in corporate taxes leading to no further earnings downgrade, which was earlier expected. Companies were able to maintain margins due to low commodity prices, but we will watch how it pans out going forward."""

Vodafone Idea shares gained nearly 35% today.
The government is considering requests for financial relief from mobile carriers Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Friday.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are due to pay the bulk of  ₹92,000 crore in overdue levies and interest owed by telecoms firms to the government, after Supreme Court last month upheld a demand by the telecoms department.
Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said: ""Market turned positive due to buoyancy from telecom stocks supported by tariff hike plans. Fear of downgrade in FY20 earnings due to slow pace in consumption demand and industrial growth may consolidate the market in the near term.""

73,2019-11-20,HDFC,"Vehicles crossing toll plazas without FASTags will be charged double the toll feesYou can buy FASTags online and through branches of several banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank

NEW DELHI :
From December 1, expect less traffic at toll plazas across highways in India but also get ready to pay double the toll tax if FASTag is missing from your vehicle. To promote seamless movement of vehicles and minimise traffic congestion at toll plazas, the ministry of road transport and highways has made it mandatory for all vehicles to have FASTags.
What is FASTag
Based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, FASTag is affixed on windscreen of vehicles. FASTag-affixed vehicles do not have to stop at toll gates as charges are deducted from the prepaid or bank account when the vehicle is moving. Drivers do not have to stop their vehicle to make transactions as the toll collection will be done electronically under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme.
The new FASTag rule
From December 1, all lanes in all toll fee plazas on national highways across the country will turn into dedicated FASTag lanes. According to the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, a FASTag lane in a toll plaza is reserved exclusively for the movement of FASTag users. If you are passing without FASTag, you will be charged double the fee.
One lane has been kept as hybrid where FASTags as well as other modes of payment will be accepted.
How to buy FASTags and recharge it
Besides select bank branches and point-of-sale at toll plazas of national highways, selected bank branches, FASTags can be bought online through e-commerce portal Amazon.

71,2019-11-22,HDFC,"He is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India IndexHis top picks include HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank Ltd

India’s banking sector may witness a turnaround, after recent rule changes put banks in a better position to get their money back from insolvent companies, according to Ridham Desai, managing director at Morgan Stanley India Co.
A Supreme Court ruling last week not only paved the way for ArcelorMittal’s purchase of Essar Steel India Ltd., an Indian steel mill, but also allowed banks to set the terms of the distribution of sale proceeds among creditors. The move to empower banks “has settled several disputes"" around India’s bankruptcy law introduced in 2016, Desai said at a conference in Singapore on Thursday.
“Last week’s judgment may well prove to be an inflection point for the sector,"" Desai said, adding that banks previously were not well-placed to recover loans. “I would be fairly optimistic of the banking sector in India.""
Indian lenders, which are saddled with some of the world’s worst bad-loan ratios, are expected to get a boost from increased regulatory oversight of the shadow banking sector as well, he added. The government last week introduced rules to help creditors recover loans due from large shadow lenders.
Meanwhile, authorities have also stepped up surveillance of non-banking financial companies of late, seizing control of another institution, Dewan Housing Finance Corp., which has total debt of about $12.5 billion.
The Mumbai-based analyst is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India Index, with a preference for seven financial firms including HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. The NSE Nifty Bank Index, a gauge of the most liquid and large-cap banking stocks in the country, has risen 15% this year and is near a record high.
Furthermore, the government’s planned capital injection into public sector banks, which account for 65% of the industry, is “the biggest cyclical fix"" that will support the sector, according to Desai. In August, the Indian government announced a series of state-bank mergers and a capital injection of  ₹55,250 ($7.7 billion) -- its most sweeping bank overhaul in decades -- in a bid to revive the economy.
“You should see signs of a new credit cycle in the next 12 months,"" Desai said.

69,2019-11-24,HDFC,"Compare the rates before you apply for a personal loanAllahabad bank offers the most affordable interest rates at 8.40-12.90% and also charges a processing fee of 1.06% of the loan amount

Personal loans are one of the most expensive categories of loans you can avail of. These are unsecured loans that can be easily availed of and banks are eager to offer them. In fact, you might have received a few calls offering instant personal loan because you have been a loyal customer to your bank. However, if you opt for a personal loan, expect to pay an interest rate of anywhere between 9% and 20% per annum. The reason is simple: an unsecured loan means that the lender will not ask for a collateral. This is only feasible for the lender if they have a sense of what your credit history is like and whether you have the capability to repay the loan. But that isn’t enough of a safety net. Hence the high interest rate.
Given that they are expensive, but easily available, personal loans seem like a good option to fund an emergency expense, if you don’t have a contingency fund in place, or if the fund was depleted for some reason. Of course in the absence of emergency money, falling back on taking a personal loan may seem like a feasible solution if say a family member needs to be hospitalized suddenly. But funding lifestyle expenses using debt is a strict no no.
But that doesn’t stop most from borrowing for all the wrong reasons. According to RBI data, personal loans constituted 96 % of new bank loans taken in financial year 2018, according to RBI data. And according to a report by CASHe, a digital lending company, in 2018, 23% salaried millennials took short-term personal loans to refinance individual EMIs and 14% borrowed to pay off their loans.
While it’s not advisable to take a personal loan unless you have an emergency or immediate requirement for funds that can’t be serviced otherwise, if you do want to opt for one, it’s wise to analyse which bank can offer you the lowest interest rates. Allahabad bank offers the most affordable interest rates at 8.40-12.90% and also charges a processing fee of 1.06% of the loan amount. But even among the top 15 banks we have listed, the highest interest rates goes up to 11.25-13.65% offered by Syndicate Bank, with an additional processing charge of 0.50%. Take a look at the list of personal loans available at the best rates before you make your decision.

I am 28 years old. I am an aggressive long-term investor (15-20 years). I have been investing  ₹2,500 each via systematic investment plans (SIPs) in SBI Blue Chip fund, L&T Emerging Businesses fund, HDFC Small Cap fund, Motilal Oswal Multi Cap 35 fund and ABSL Pure Value fund for the last one year. I finalized these funds based on my own research. All funds are direct growth plans. Please review these funds and let me know if my selection is okay.

If you invest  ₹12,500 a month for 20 years, you can expect to have more than  ₹1.2 crore in your portfolio by the end of your tenure (assuming 12% CAGR portfolio returns over the period). You have an aggressive, all-equity portfolio with one large-cap fund, one value-oriented diversified fund, one multi-cap fund, and two small- and mid-cap funds. The fund choices are a mixed bag in terms of quality and track record. I would recommend a shuffle of funds in this manner—you can replace the L&T fund with the L&T Midcap fund from the same fund house. Instead of SBI Bluechip fund and HDFC Small Cap fund, you can go with HDFC Top 100 fund and SBI Small Cap fund respectively. The ABSL fund can be replaced with a multi-cap fund from the same fund house—the ABSL Equity fund. Once you do these changes, you will have a similarly aggressive portfolio as you do presently, but in a set of funds that have had better track records of performance and consistency.
I started investing in Reliance ELSS (equity-linked savings scheme) in 2016. It has run into loss throughout this three-year period and now has been taken over by Nippon Insurance. Should I continue investing in this mutual fund or consider shifting to another ELSS? If yes, which fund should I choose?
—Deblina Kar
It is time to switch out of this fund and move to a better fund for your tax-saving needs. This fund ranks near last in its category in terms of returns over one-, three-, and five-year terms, as of current date. In the period that you mention, while the funds in this category on average returned 11.31% (in three years, annualized), this fund returned 3.96% annualized.
You should move your investment out of this scheme as and when the lock-in period expires and invest in funds from the Mint50 list of schemes. As for your future tax-saving requirements, you can consider Invesco India Tax Plan or Aditya Birla Sun life Tax Relief 96.

Puri shall act as an advisor to the committee, the company said in an exchange filing. The committee, over the next few months, shall evaluate internal and external candidates to ensure a smooth transition.
The board of directors also approved the appointment of Sashidhar Jagdishan and Bhavesh Zaver as additional and executive directors both. Their appointments, effectively immediately for three years, are subject to the approval of Reserve Bank of India.
In October 2018, the Reserve Bank of India had approved the re-appointment of Puri as managing director of the bank for another two years.
Puri has been instrumental in making HDFC Bank one of the most valued lenders banks globally.
The HDFC Bank stock has been popular among investors because of strong growth in profitability, stable bad loan ratio and superior deposit franchise credit underwriting and structurally better net interest margin. The recent liquidity crisis has had little impact on its portfolio. The bank informally carries the tag of ‘25% growth engine’ in the stock market for consistently growth its profit by at least that much for several years.

MUMBAI :
Private sector lender HDFC Bank Ltd on Thursday kick-started the much-awaited process of finding a successor to its longest-serving chief Aditya Puri, whose tenure ends on 26 October 2020.
In a notice to stock exchanges, the bank said that it has set up a six-member committee comprising board members—HDFC Bank chairman Shyamala Gopinath, Sanjiv Sachar, M.D. Ranganathan, Sandeep Parekh, Srikanth Nadhamuni and Keki Mistry—to find the new chief executive officer. Puri will act as an advisor to the search committee.
Over the next few months, the committee will evaluate internal and external candidates to ensure smooth transition, the notice added.
The bank also announced the elevation of Sashidhar Jagdishan and Bhavesh Zaveri as executive directors for a period of three years.
Jagdishan, who was elevated from chief financial officer to the position of a change agent with added responsibilities in August, was being seen as the likely candidate to succeed Puri.
The bank’s number two position fell vacant after Paresh Sukthankar, the deputy managing director who was considered as a front-runner to succeed Puri, put in his papers last year.
In May 2018, Puri had told analysts that the bank will start the process of identifying his successor.
At the annual general meeting this year, Puri had said that his replacement should be better than him and should not require 18 months handholding for the job.
Puri, who turns 70 next year, has been credited with building India’s most valuable bank since its inception in 1994. As on 28 November, the private sector bank’s market capitalization stands at  ₹6.9 trillion.
HDFC Bank reported profit of  ₹6,345 crore for the September quarter, up 26.7% year-on-year on the back of higher interest income and other income.
This, despite witnessing a 48% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in total provisions to  ₹2,700 crore. Of the total provisions,  ₹2,038 crore was for loan loss, the bank said in a regulatory filing.
Its asset quality saw a slight deterioration in the September quarter with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of gross advances rising 5 basis points (bps) year-on-year to 1.38%.
However, on a sequential basis, the bad loan ratio was down 2bps."
61,2019-11-29,HDFC,"India’s biggest retail lender, HDFC Bank Ltd saw its retail loan book grow by 15% in the September quarter, lower than previous quartersNon-bank retail lender Bajaj Finance Ltd also witnessed a slowdown

Bank credit growth may be at a five-year low, but still hasn’t reached the bottom. It won’t be the corporate loan book, but retail loans that could pull down growth in the coming months.
Indian banks have been chasing the retail customer over a decade now, since businessmen were busy deleveraging their balance sheets. Also, the retail customer turned out to be more disciplined in repayments with delinquencies being low. In the 10 years since 2008, retail loans on an average grew at a breakneck pace of about 20%, in some months even faster.
In fiscal year 2018-19, this fast-paced engine began to slow a bit. As of September, the growth came to about 17%. Part of this is due to banks’ own caution after economic growth data began to show a slowdown in consumption. As the sentiment around future employment and earnings soured, lenders realized that the retail customer could come under stress.
Indeed, delinquency rates have inched up in the unsecured personal loan space, although they are far from raising serious worry. Even so, bankers seem to have taken of note of this. If one pieces together the commentary from big banks during the September quarter, there seems to be a cautionary note setting in.
India’s biggest retail lender, HDFC Bank Ltd saw its retail loan book grow by 15% in the September quarter, lower than previous quarters.
Non-bank retail lender Bajaj Finance Ltd also witnessed a slowdown. In a conversation with Mint post quarterly results, the lender’s managing director Rajeev Jain said that festive season demand was not as good as expected.
Both lenders have tightened their risk filters on retail loans. HDFC Bank in an earnings conference call told analysts that it has tightened its filters and policies to chase better customers and to keep delinquencies in check.
Ergo, the sobering effect on loan growth cannot be ruled out.
“We believe the near-term growth will continue to taper down further and could pull headline banking system loan growth towards demonetization lows,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
During demonetization, credit offtake had halted, as banks were occupied with handling the demonetized currency notes. Recall that during the demonetization quarter, loan growth crashed to 4%.
As of 8 November, credit growth was 8.1%. The drivers of loan growth for banks have been retail and small business loans so far. The corporate loan book has been growing in low single digits.
Given the concerns over consumption demand and employment prospects, banks cannot be faulted for their growing caution on consumer loans. The worst of credit growth deceleration is yet to come."

HDFC Bank Ltd., India’s most valuable lender by market capitalization, sees tentative signs of a revival in rural areas at a time when the wider economy is sputtering.
“The recent loan outreach programs underway in rural areas have given us the sense that the consumption in rural and semi-urban areas is turning more positive,"" HDFC Bank Executive Director Kaizad Bharucha said in an interview last week. The rural and semi-urban sector, which accounts for at least half of India’s output, got 48% of the bank’s total loans as of end-September.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has unveiled several steps to boost the economy, which is growing at its weakest pace in more than six years, including a surprise $20 billion corporate tax cut. The Reserve Bank of India is expected to cut interest rates again this week, after Friday’s report that gross domestic product growth slowed to 4.5% in the September quarter.
For HDFC Bank, the weaker economy had led to a slowdown in loan growth, which eased to 15% in the September quarter from 23% a year earlier. But it remained healthy compared with the overall banking system which saw credit growth slowing to a two-year low just above 8%.
“As a bank we are well positioned to offset a slowdown in either the consumption or investment side as we are present across the spectrum,"" Bharucha said. “The demand for credit is not going away. It may just be subdued for a period of time,"" he added.
He’s also cautiously optimistic about the outlook for corporate investment, based on the bank’s soundings with Indian executives.
Muted loan growth has hardly dented the upward march in HDFC Bank’s shares, which are about 20% higher so far this year. Now valued at about $96 billion, the company trades around 26 times projected 12 month earnings. That’s almost three times more expensive than the Bloomberg World Banks Index and is the biggest valuation premium on record.
Meanwhile, non-bank lenders from Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd. to Reliance Capital Ltd. have been reeling under a 17-month credit crisis after Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. defaulted on its debt last year. In a further blow to confidence, the Securities and Exchange Board of India placed curbs on operations of Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. after finding evidence it misused client funds.
But Bharucha doesn’t see a wider industry problem.
“There is enough control over stockbrokers and depositories and a default in the segment will not have a systemic impact,"" he said. The central bank “has ensured that there is adequate liquidity in the system and availability of credit is not a problem.""

50,2019-12-03,HDFC,"Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 croreBajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares

Mumbai: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Tuesday gave Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) time till 10 December to pass an order in the plea filed by Bajaj Finance Ltd against the capital market regulator’s move to transfer pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 crore, of which Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore as per a copy of the petition reviewed by Mint.
Bajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares. The firm claimed that it has the right to its pledged securities and that Sebi was wrong in returning the securities to the accounts of Karvy’s clients.
HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd and some other lenders also joined Bajaj Finance on Tuesday in its plea against the Sebi move. An order in their pleas will be passed later. SAT asked Sebi to hear Bajaj Finance’s plea by Wednesday.
Early on Monday, the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) and the BSE suspended Karvy’s trading licence for all segments due to non-compliance with the exchange’s and Sebi norms. Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and MSEI also suspended the licence of the brokerage firm.\
This action follows the 22 November order by Sebi which had said the brokerage firm misused client securities and used it for other purposes. Karvy had sold clients securities and the proceeds were transferred to related party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd.
Sebi’s prompt action against Karvy has resulted in nearly 83,000 investors getting back their securities, which were illegally transferred by the brokerage firm to its own account and were even pledged without any authorisation.
With the latest transfer by National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), nearly 90% investors have got back their securities and the remaining ones will get after clearing their dues.
Karvy took loans to the tune of  ₹600 crore by pledging securities worth more than  ₹2,300 crore of 95,000 clients with lenders. Of these, 95,000 clients, nearly 83,000 of them have got their securities.
On 20 November, Bajaj Finance issued a loan recall notice to Karvy and the pledges against the loan would have been invoked on 23 November. Sebi had on 22 November barred depositories from transferring securities from Karvy’s account except to beneficial owners or clients who had paid in full. The petition also says Karvy had given a false undertaking to Bajaj Finance that these securities belonged to the brokerage."
49,2019-12-03,HDFC,"Lenders move tribunal to recover over  ₹1,000 cr loans from the brokerageSebi’s 22 November order said Karvy had misused client securities, pledging them to raise money

Mumbai: India’s top two private banks, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, on Tuesday fought to lay their hands on client shares that Karvy Stock Broking Ltd had pledged with them, seeking to recover  ₹1,000 crore they had lent to the brokerage.
The case will require the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to address a core dilemma: who owns these shares — the client who bought the shares, or the lender who advanced money against them without verifying their actual ownership?
At Tuesday’s hearing, the lenders sought to quash a 22 November order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which prevented them from accessing these shares. They also wanted SAT to set aside the National Securities Depository Ltd’s (NSDL) transfer of these securities to client accounts on Monday. Consequently, they have also made NSDL and the National Stock Exchange parties to the case.
The lenders said in their petitions that following the Sebi order, they had requested the regulator not to initiate any action on transferring these shares to clients as they had bona fide rights to them. The two banks told the tribunal that it was common industry practice to lend against pledged shares (LAS) and there was no reason to suspect Karvy’s claim that it owned these shares.
Sebi’s 22 November order said Karvy had misused client securities, pledging them to raise money, some of which was transferred to related-party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd. SAT will rule on the banks’ petition on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, while ruling on a Bajaj Finance Ltd plea of a similar nature, SAT asked Sebi to hear the lender’s representation and pass appropriate orders by 10 December and put a stop to any more transfer of securities to clients’ accounts. A petition by IndusInd Bank was also merged with the petitions by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. The brokerage firm owes the lender  ₹132.50 crore against pledged shares.
Mint reported on 3 December that NSDL had transferred securities worth  ₹2,013.77 crore to the accounts of 83,306 clients. Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore.
In its petition, HDFC Bank claimed that following the Sebi direction, the loan which was earlier secured by pledged shares had suddenly become unsecured as it cannot access those shares.
During the course of arguments, the lenders said LAS facilities are a common market practice and are routinely used by brokers for working capital and margin requirements. The lenders said their loan sanction letters specifically stated that pledged shares belonged to Karvy, its group companies or its promoters.
The Sebi counsel, however, said banks should have ascertained the ownership of these shares and conducted better due diligence. Counsel Rafique Dada said banks remained ignorant despite the Sebi circular of June 2019, which ruled that brokers cannot pledge clients’ securities and starting 1 October, brokers had to unwind such pledges.
HDFC Bank, however, countered that since the shares were from Karvy’s account, it believed that the broker was the owner of the securities and “there was no reason to enquire or ascertain whether these securities belonged to Karvy or any of its clients"".
ICICI Bank said in its petition that such an order without hearing the bankers is detrimental to its 800,000 public shareholders and banking customers. On 5 November, ICICI Bank had issued a notice to Karvy to return all the loans, failing which it would invoke the pledges for recovery.
The lenders also alleged that Sebi and NSDL did not respond to their requests on transfer of securities to clients’ accounts, which would leave them with almost no shares.
NSDL said that it complied with Sebi’s 22 November directions and transferred securities to the beneficial owners, which are the clients. In fact, the depository conducted a board meeting before taking a call as this was not a routine case, but one of alleged fraud."

MUMBAI :
The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Wednesday set 12 December as the deadline for markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to pass the final order in the pleas by ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank against its move transferring pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
The appellate body also ruled that it is “untenable"" for the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) to reverse the transfer of securities from clients’ accounts.
“After a due diligence by NSE and NSDL, securities have been transferred to the account of the clients. Therefore, further rights have been created/restored involving more than 80,000 investors. In this context, a prayer to recall the same or to retain the same as frozen accounts of those clients becomes untenable,"" SAT member C.K.G. Nair said in an order on Wednesday.
India’s top two private banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, on Tuesday fought to lay their hands on client shares that Karvy Stock Broking had pledged with them, seeking to recover  ₹1,000 crore they had lent the brokerage. IndusInd Bank had also joined the plea, claiming dues of  ₹132.50 crore.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore, Sebi’s lawyer told Mint. The total misuse of client securities in Karvy’s case is about  ₹2,800 crore.
The case had required SAT to address a core dilemma around who owns these shares—the client who bought the shares, or the lender who advanced money against a third-party pledge of these shares without verifying their actual ownership. At Tuesday’s hearing, the lenders sought the quashing of Sebi’s 22 November order preventing them from accessing these shares. They also wanted SAT to set aside NSDL’s transfer of securities worth  ₹2,013.77 crore. As per the SAT order, NSDL has transferred securities back into the accounts of 83,862 clients.
Consequently, the lenders had also made NSDL and the National Stock Exchange parties to the case. The lenders had argued in their petitions that following the Sebi order, they had requested the regulator not to initiate any action on transferring these shares to clients as they had bona fide rights to them.
The banks told the tribunal that it was common industry practice to lend against pledged shares and there was no reason to disbelieve Karvy’s claim that it owned these shares. The banks also argued that Sebi’s 22 November order had asked NSDL to maintain status quo.
Sebi, on the other hand, argued that its circular dated 20 June was very clear in asking brokers not to pledge client securities for funding purposes and to unwind such pledges by the end of September. In such a scenario, the lenders should have enhanced their due diligence."

NEW DELHI :
After being affected for three days due to a technical glitch, HDFC Bank's netbanking and app services have now been restored.
""We would like to state that the technical glitch has been rectified. Our NetBanking and MobileBanking App platforms have now stabilized. Once again, we would like to sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience caused,"" HDFC Bank said.
Online services of India's largest private sector lender was affected for three working days from Monday morning till Wednesday night. The tech team of the bank worked round the clock to resolve the issue after which it had said yesterday that while some customers were able to transact using netbanking and mobile banking app, a few were still facing intermittent issues.
The downtime affected scores of HDFC Bank's customers who complained that they were unable to pay their loan EMIs or settle credit card bills on time. Almost 90% of transactions at HDFC Bank, which was awarded the best digital bank in India in 2019 by Asiamoney, are digital.
The salaried class were among the worst affected by the glitch as several employers could not transfer salaries into the accounts of their employees while those who got salaries could not make online transactions.
“HDFC Bank management should address these glitches in minutes rather than hours as banking is now technology-dependent and a huge client base gets impacted,"" said Kranthi Bathini, an analyst at Wealthmills Securities.
HDFC Bank had faced a similar technical glitch with its app last year also after launching a new version of the mobile banking app.

A Reserve Bank team is analysing the reasons behind the crash of online banking facility of HDFC Bank for two consecutive days this week, deputy governor MK Jain said on Thursday.
The customers of the largest private sector lender faced problems to access their accounts online on Monday and Tuesday. The bank attributed the problems to a technical glitch, but timing of the problem--at a time when salaries were credited--made the going difficult for many.
""Our team has gone to really identify the reasons and find out what we can give them (HDFC Bank) as a direction,"" Jain told reporters at the customary post-policy presser.
Jain, while replying to a question on whether RBI is considering a framework for penalising such banks, did not name HDFC Bank, though.
He said RBI is cognizant of the problem and explained that technical glitches had resulted in online banking getting impacted on Monday.
He also said there were media reports again on Tuesday that the glitches were continuing, and made it clear that the services have now been ""restored fully"".
The city-headquartered lender has the highest number of salary accounts and its clientele includes 2.9 crore debit cardholders and 1.3 crore credit card customers.
The bank has in the past claimed that a majority of its customers use online banking and other digital means for banking. After the services went down, irate customers took to social media platforms to vent their ire at the bank.
It can be noted that HDFC Bank customers had also faced difficulties in accessing accounts a year ago when it introduced a new version of its mobile app."

38,2019-12-09,HDFC,"Lenders have asked brokers to verify the ownership of securitiesSebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representation on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order

Mumbai: The Karvy Stock Broking debacle and the ensuing loss of securities underlying their secured credit have forced lenders, especially banks, to review their exposure to brokerage firms, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Fearing that more secured loans could turn unsecured if the loans are backed by client securities, these lenders have sent out letters to brokers to verify whether these securities belonged to them or to clients, these people said on condition of anonymity.
“We are taking a relook at the documentation and other risk management measures required to ensure that the loan against pledged shares is not misused, like in the case of Karvy,"" said the chief risk management officer of a private sector bank, one of the three people cited above.
Some banks have also begun a review of their exposure to smaller brokers and are considering reducing it by 10%, said the proprietor of a mid-sized brokerage and the second person cited above.
This follows a 22 November notification by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which barred Karvy Stock Broking Ltd from adding new clients or acting on behalf of clients, and ordered depositories to transfer securities only to their beneficial owners.
Karvy is accused of misusing client securities worth  ₹2,800 crore to secure loan facilities from lenders towards working capital. The brokerage also sold off client securities and transferred the proceeds to its real estate group company.
Following the Sebi directive to transfer securities only to beneficial owners, the National Securities Depository Ltd on 2 December transferred  ₹2,013 crore into the accounts of 83,862 Karvy clients, which is almost 90% of the affected clients.
Four lenders then approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) saying the shares were pledged with them and therefore they had the right over these shares.
On 4 December, SAT ruled that reversing these transfers was untenable, leaving the lenders with no securities to invoke the pledge.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. IndusInd Bank has an exposure of  ₹132 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance Ltd, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore.
The banks were required to file representations with Sebi for redressal of their lost shares. “At least three of the lenders sought that Sebi allow them more time to file representations,"" said a lawyer representing the lenders.
Sebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representations on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order.
“We have received letters this week from bankers trying to verify that the securities belong to us and not to the clients,"" the second person said. “In the Karvy issue, Bajaj Finance had, in fact, relied on the brokerage firm’s assertion that securities belonged to it and not clients.""
While the banks have increased their due diligence on broker exposures, a Sebi official, the third person cited earlier, said this should have happened earlier.
The official said: “Sebi had issued a circular on 20 June this year, asking brokers to segregate their securities from client securities, and prohibited them from using client securities for funding purposes. Considering the changes in rules, the banks should have increased their due diligence earlier. Brokers were also required to unwind the pledges which used client securities, by the end of September, and many of them are yet to affect the same."""

MUMBAI :
Investors are starting to weigh the merits of rotating into small- and mid-sized Indian stocks after a few large companies drove a record-breaking rally in the main equity index.
“Leadership in India’s rally has been very narrow,"" Tim Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said last week in Mumbai. “Valuations are at the high end of the range, both in historical terms and relative valuation compared with the region as a whole.""
The S&P BSE Sensex has risen about 12% from a low in September, with three members — Reliance Industries Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. — accounting for 61% of all the gains. The broader market has lagged behind, leaving the valuation gap between smaller firms and the gauge at close to its widest in a decade.
“Many of India’s large caps are overvalued,"" said Sunil Singhania, founder of Mumbai-based Abakkus Asset Manager LLP. “Most of them are unlikely to grow at the rate expected of them."" Abakkus has about 75% of its $300 million in assets invested in small and medium-sized stocks. The firm earlier this year said some quality stocks are likely in a “bubble zone.""
Investors have taken shelter in some of the South Asian nation’s biggest companies amid a credit crunch and the slowest economic growth in six years. That’s added to an extended underperformance by small stocks that goes back to 2017.
Still, Chandresh Nigam, who oversees $14 billion of assets at Axis Asset Management Co. isn’t convinced there’s value in small caps. It is worth paying more for shares of high-quality businesses, he said in an interview last month.
Quality can be expensive, with the Sensex trading at 19 times 12-month blended forward earnings. That’s close to a level that’s proved the ceiling for gains in the past few years.
Yet, the bet has paid off for Axis, with the money manager’s largest equity fund beating 96% of peers in the last five years.
For market breadth to widen, economic outlook needs to improve. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the growth is set to return. High valuation has partly priced in the expected recovery, with the MSCI India Index trading at 1.2 standard deviations above its 10-year mean, they wrote in a note.
There are signs investors are warming up to mid-cap stocks. The Nifty Midcap 100 edged out the benchmark index since the start of October, rising 6.3% versus a 4.8% gain for the NSE Nifty 50 Index.

37,2019-12-09,HDFC,"Bank’s lack of communication adds to uncertainty and frustration customers have been facing for a weekThe bank has not notified the stock exchanges, or communicated with its retail customers

MUMBAI :
HDFC Bank Ltd’s credibility as a technology-led bank has taken a beating with its net banking and mobile banking app continuing to face disruptions over the weekend and customers finding it difficult to access their accounts. The bank’s lack of communication has added to the uncertainty and frustration customers have been facing for a week.
The bank assured customers that it had rectified the technical glitch in its online banking facility. “We would like to state that the technical glitch has been rectified. Our NetBanking and MobileBanking App platforms have now stabilized. Once again, we would like to sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience caused,"" HDFC Bank said on December 5.
However, many customers said that they continued to face problems with the bank’s digital banking services on Saturday, which were restored on Sunday.
India’s largest private lender has still to identify the reasons behind the disruption in the services provided by the mobile banking app and net banking. The bank has also failed to not only notify the stock exchanges but also communicate with its 45-million retail customers, barring a few Twitter messages assuring customers that it is working on fixing the outage.
On Thursday, Reserve Bank of India (RBI)) deputy governor M.K. Jain said that the regulator has taken into account the outage and has deployed a team of experts to investigate into the matter. The RBI team will investigate the reasons behind the outage and accordingly give directions to HDFC Bank, Jain said.
The outage has affected scores of HDFC Bank’s customers who complained that they were unable to pay their loan EMIs or settle credit card bills on time. The salaried class was among the worst affected by the glitch as several employers could not transfer salaries into the accounts of their employees, while those who received salaries could not make online transactions. The bank has not yet revealed whether the problem has been caused by a software bug or a systems glitch, or whether it is a case of cyber-security breach.
The outage comes at a time when HDFC Bank is in the process of transitioning from a pure play banking experience to a financial experience. HDFC 2.0, as it is fond of calling the endeavour, is focused on providing customers with a financial marketplace where everything can be done online or through various applications. The execution of digital transformation has resulted in the cost of revenue coming down by 10% over the past two to three years and, HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri said, in an interview to YourStory on 17 July, that he expected to bring this figure down by another 5%.
On 22 November, the bank had sent an SMS communication to some customers who were using the old app to download the new version. Last December, the bank faced a similar problem when it replaced its older version of the mobile app with a new one. Customers were unable to use the updated app for more than five days, following which the bank had to revert to the previous version.
HDFC Bank, which bagged the 2019 Best Digital Banking Award from Asiamoney, boasts of 45 million customers with almost 90% of transactions at the bank being digital. The bank does not have anyone heading its digital banking division as the position has been lying vacant since Nitin Chugh, who was driving the digital vision, stepped down early this year and was subsequently appointed as managing director and chief executive at Ujjivan Small Finance Bank."
31,2019-12-10,HDFC,"The board of Yes bank is scheduled to meet today to finalise its fundraising plansHero MotoCorp on Monday announced that it will increase prices of its motorcycles and scooters from 1 January 2020

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Tuesday:
Yes Bank: The board of the bank is scheduled to meet today to finalise its fundraising plans. The bank has indicated that it has so far received offers worth $3 billion from potential investors. Separately, a Bloomberg report said the bank is likely to reject an offer that made up more than half of its planned $2 billion capital raising and is talking to institutional investors about making up for the shortfall.
HDFC: The mortgaged lender, after market hours on Monday, said it proposes to acquire the remaining 9.12% stake in its higher education financing subsidiary HDFC Credila Financial Services Pvt Ltd (HDFC Credila) for up to  ₹395 crore. The acquisition of HDFC Credila will take place on a fully diluted basis from Ajay Bohora and Anil Bohora. Currently, HDFC Ltd holds 90.88% of the equity share capital in HDFC Credila.
Bharti Airtel: The steep tariff hikes, effected by the troubled telcos earlier this month after five years of after rock bottom prices, can help more than double their operating profit to  ₹60,570 crore in fiscal 2021 from  ₹29,450 crore in 2018-19, according to a report by ratings agency Crisil. Telecom operators hiked tariffs after an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict in the adjusted gross revenue case.
Hero MotoCorp: The company, after market hours on Monday, announced that it will increase prices of its motorcycles and scooters from 1 January 2020. In a regulatory filing, the company said prices of its products will be hiked up to  ₹2,000 across the portfolio. Last week, India’s largest carmaker Maruti Suzuki Ltd announced it will raise product prices starting 1 January 2020.
RIL: The company’s telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is likely to benefit from the tariff hike that it announced earlier this month, according to a report by ratings agency Crisil. It is a “structural positive"" for the telecom sector, which has been weighed down by weak cash flows, mounting debt levels and shrinking revenues due to bare minimum tariffs in the past five years.
Coffee Day Enterprises: The sale of the company’s technology park to Blackstone Group Inc. is stalled as one of its creditors has not approved the deal, according to a Bloomberg report. Yes Bank Ltd has not issued the so-called no objection certificate as seeks assurances on repayments of other loans taken by the company. All other creditors have approved the transaction.
Bank of India: After State Bank of India, public-sector lender Bank of India on Monday reduced its overnight MCLR by 20 basis points (bps) to 7.75%, effective today. The bank has also slashed its one-month MCLR to 8.10% from 8.20%. One year MCLR was reduced by 10 bps to 8.20%. Banks are reducing rates to pass on the benefits to their customers after the Reserve Bank India last week reiterated its concern over slow transmission of rate cuts.
PC Jeweller: Ratings agency Crisil downgraded the company’s long-term and short-term ratings to bank loan facilities to ‘Crisil D’. The agency said, “the downgrade in the rating factors in the instances of devolvement of letter of credits and overutilisation in working capital limits for more than 30 days. The same is reflective of the fact that the liquidity profile of the group has deteriorated in the past few months on account of cash flow mismatch"".
Quess Corp: The board of the company, in a meeting held on Monday, approved cancellation and reduction of 7.13 crore shares held by Thomas Cook (India) Ltd. After cancellation, the board approved allotment of 7.14 crore shares to eligible equity shareholders of Thomas Cook, as per entitlement ratio of the scheme.
Mphasis: The company, after market hours on Monday, clarified that $900 million minimum revenue commitment (MRC) with DXC from September 2016 was not a cumulative calculation and works on the basis of annual thresholds that run for the full tenure of the MRC. The company said DXC continues to remain a strategic partner."
30,2019-12-11,HDFC,"Its equity funds have delivered returns of 11% in the past one year. By comparison, the firm’s stock returned 93%Notwithstanding the sluggishness in the markets, investors have their hopes set high with HDFC AMC

HDFC Asset Management Co. (AMC) Ltd’s top-performing equity funds have delivered returns of just about 11% in the past one year. By comparison, the HDFC AMC’s stock returned about 93%, far higher than those of its equity schemes.
Notwithstanding the sluggishness in the markets, investors have their hopes set high with HDFC AMC. A reverse discounted-cash-flow analysis indicates that the AMC’s current valuations imply an enthusiastic 26% annual growth in assets for the next 10 years, notes JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Sure. HDFC AMC’s assets under management (AUM) grew 25% year-on-year in the July-September quarter, but it’s quite something to expect similar growth for the next 10 years.
Note inflows to equity mutual funds have been waning. In fact, in the second quarter, equity AUM increased by just about 0.5% sequentially. While HDFC AMC’s shares have dropped about 23% from their highs earlier in the year, valuations are still stretched.
HDFC AMC has been among the most consistent companies in attracting inflows to its funds; it is in the top quartile of inflows. One important factor that tends to drive AUM growth is the returns of equity funds, where HDFC AMC has fallen a bit short lately. But as one analyst notes on condition of anonymity: “HDFC AMC will continue to attract larger inflows due to the brand-pull the fund house enjoys among distributors and investors, even if the performance of its equity funds haven’t been top-notch.""
Note that profitability of AMCs gets a boost with higher equity AUMs. Nevertheless, an expansion in operating profits in these past quarters was largely due to savings in upfront commission expenses to distributors. This will likely be affected in the coming quarters once the effect of a lower base begins to kick in from Q4.
Note also that distributor incomes have been coming down, which could take a toll on equity inflows. “Distributor revenues are expected to compress further in FY20, as they bear the brunt of the TER cut. Lower distributor profitability may take its toll on equity MF inflows in the medium term, we feel,"" said the JM Financial report.
Another factor that could impact the growth of equity AUMs is the rise of passive exchange traded funds. For now, they constitute about 6% of AUM, but globally their share in overall AUM has been rising consistently, which could also play out in the home market.
Despite a stiff correction, the price-earnings multiple of 53 times trailing-12-month earnings of the HDFC AMC stock barely offers much comfort."

NEW DELHI :
With NTPC and ONGC leading gains, Sensex surged 172.69 points to end the day at 40,412.57. Nifty, too, managed to cross 11,900 levels to end at 11,910.15, up 53.35 points, or 0.45%.
Yes Bank was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack. It ended the day at  ₹42.80, a 15.33% loss amid uncertainty about the proposed $2 billion fund raising plan. Macquarie Research said if the bank is unable to raise money in the next 6 months, it poses a ""grave danger"" to the financial system.
Kotak Bank rose 1.56%, IndusInd Bank 1.39%, ICICI Bank 0.84% while HDFC Bank was flat.
Rohit Singre, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities, said Nifty managed to close the day above 11,900 zone after a super volatile session and formed bullish candle on daily chart.
""After a subdued trade during most part of the day, market witnessed a sharp turnaround due to short covering in index heavyweights. Upcoming macro indicators like CPI inflation & IIP data are unlikely to paint a rosy picture which may reduce upside potential in the near term. On global front, FOMC meeting, UK election and US tariff deadline remain key events,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has lowered India's economic growth forecast for FY2019 to 5.1 per cent on slowing job prospects, rural distress exacerbated by poor harvest and credit crunch.
India's CPI inflation data will be released tomorrow while the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision today.
Global stock markets rose Wednesday following reports President Donald Trump's advisers were preparing for a possible delay in a weekend tariff hike on Chinese goods.
London and Frankfurt rose in early trading while Shanghai and Hong Kong closed higher. Tokyo declined.
Investors are looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday on interest rates and a similar decision Thursday by the European Central Bank.
Both are expected to affirm a commitment to low rates to support economic growth."
28,2019-12-13,HDFC,"Granted that hooking millennials faster to insurance can be effective only when it is sold online or through mobile phonesAnother factor to monitor will be cost savings that digitization brings

In today’s times of ever-changing technology, going digital is hardly considered a differentiating factor. You may sell products online, but so does everyone else.
So, why are investors and analysts enamoured by HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s pitch for tech-based insurance? The stock gained nearly 2% on Thursday and has clocked an impressive 51% rise so far in 2019.
Earlier this week, the insurer drew up a presentation showing how its own digital platform and tie-ups with others are enabling it to woo more customers. “While we have invested significant management bandwidth and resources so far, we are acutely aware of the need to continue investing and treading this path of constant evolution, with technology as a key differentiator,"" it said in the presentation.
But unless the progress is seen in real profitability metrics, investors should avoid using this digital talk to add froth to an already pricey share. To be fair, HDFC Life’s profitability is far superior compared to the industry. That, and its strong record of growth, are enough to buttress valuations.
The insurer’s value of new business margin has improved from 24.3% in the first half of FY19 to 27.5% in H1 FY20. Growth in new business premium has only risen by leaps and bounds between FY17 and FY20. But the multiple of over four times its estimated embedded value for FY21 captures all this, and more. As analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said: “While we remain positive on the company, the robust 49% stock return over the past year implies limited upside to our target price.""
Granted that hooking millennials faster to insurance can be effective only when it is sold online or through mobile phones. Even so, the process is hardly a differentiator versus the competition.
For now, analysts are convinced that HDFC Life will have an edge over competition based on its tech-based servings. But as Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd pointed out, profitability will also require getting the pricing right. “Alongside this, the key to profitability will also require balancing risk pricing with the customer focus, and alignment of regulator to gradually move to digitally-enabled insurance.""
Another factor to monitor will be cost savings that digitization brings. So far, the operating expenses to total premium have only increased. For the first six months of FY20, the operating expense ratio was 19%, up from 18% in the corresponding period of last year. The salutary effects of going digital should also be visible on expenses. Until then, HDFC Life investors will be better off holding on to their exuberance on the stock."

24,2019-12-14,HDFC,"In case of unit-linked products, the revival period has been increased to three yearThe mandatory guarantee on pension Ulip segment will become optional from February 1

From allowing partial withdrawal to increasing revival period, life insurance products will witness a host of changes from next year. The new rules will be effective from February 1, 2020. To benefit customers, the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (Irdai) has relaxed regulations for pension plans, Ulips and traditional life insurance plans.
Let's take a look at the changes:
1) In case of unit-linked products, the revival period has been increased to three years. For non-linked products the revival period will be five years. Earlier the revival period was two years. Revival period means the period from the date of first unpaid premium during which period the policyholder is entitled to revive the policy which was discontinued due to the nonpayment of premium.
2) From February 1, withdrawal limit in pension plans is all set to increase. The maximum withdrawal allowed at maturity will be 60% instead of the existing one-third of the corpus. However, in pension plans, withdrawal of one-third corpus is tax-free, not the entire 60%.
""With this new amendment, the regulator has made pension plans as per with the NPS products. This change will be beneficial for the customers and the insurance industry,"" said Sanjay Tiwari, Director, Strategy, Exide Life Insurance.
3) Irdai has also tweaked the norms for prematurely partial withdrawals. Customers will be allowed to make partial withdrawal of up to 25% once the lock-in period of five years ends. Partial withdrawal will be allowed for higher education, children's wedding or critical illness or for buying or construction of a residential property.
""Earlier the withdrawal was not allowed by the regulator. This is a welcome move by Irdai,"" Tiwari added.
4) The minimum life cover in Ulips will come down to seven times instead of the existing 10 times for those under the age of 45. 'Sum Assured' is a guaranteed amount that is payable in case of the policy holders' death.
5) The mandatory guarantee on pension Ulip segment will become optional from February 1. Earlier, Irdai made it mandatory for insurers to offer guarantee on pension Ulip plans. Now, the policyholders will have more flexible option o choose whether they want a guarantee or not."

22,2019-12-15,HDFC,"Gautam Thapar owns just 8,574 shares in CG Power. Some of its large non-promoter shareholders are HDFC Mutual Fund and Aditya Birla Mutual FundMarkets regulator Sebi banned Thapar and entities associated with him for three years, following which he moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal

MUMBAI :
Citing regular board approvals for various inter-corporate loans, former CG Power Industrial Solutions' non-executive chairman Gautam Thapar has refuted allegations of fund misuse amid alleged governance lapses coming under the regulatory scanner, according to documents submitted by him to the government.
In a 36-page submission to the corporate affairs ministry early November, Thapar, who was sacked in a boardroom coup in the wee hours of August 30, has provided documents on various issues, including inter-corporate loans, minutes of board meetings and loans from lenders like Standard Chartered Singapore and Yes Bank.
CG Power board sacked Thapar after an audit report by Vaish Associates, which itself is based on as many as 23 disclaimers, claimed that Thapar swindled  ₹3,000 crore from CG Power.
Markets regulator Sebi banned Thapar and entities associated with him for three years, following which he moved the Securities Appellate Tribunal, which has asked the company to provide relevant documents to him.
The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has also started a probe against CG Power and 15 group entities. The ministry has moved NCLT Mumbai seeking to restate the books of accounts of CG Power from FY16. An order is expected on Monday.
The documents, seen by PTI, show how Standard Chartered Singapore extended a $44-million lifeline to CG Singapore in February 14, 2018. The entire money was then paid to CG International Netherlands through another group entity AIA and Avantha. The same amount was fully transferred back to CG International Netherlands on the very same day.
Later, the company in turn paid back the entire amount to StanC Singapore, thus making the account standard, show the documents.
While a major allegation revolves around funds moving in and out of CG Power and group entities, Thapar has claimed that such a route was taken following suggestions from lenders since CG Power was facing liquidity issues.
Similarly, Aditya Birla Finance and Yes Bank allowed CG Power to get funds between 2016 and 2019 in a similar manner as StanC did in 2018, showed the documents.
""All the above transactions were done according to the structure provided by StanC and other respective lenders and every time the entire money was paid back to the respective lender. That not a single penny of such funds remained in Avantha books clearly shows that there is no siphoning of funds,"" Thapar has claimed.
Going by the documents, the company's risk and audit committee at its meeting held on May 26, 2017 gave an ""omnibus approval for entering into transactions with related parties for throughout FY18"". Similar omnibus approvals were sought for and were granted for FY19 as well.
Further, Thapar has submitted that the board approved a proposal from CG India on September 28, 2018 for a fixed deposit of  ₹229 crore as part of a credit line from IndusInd Bank. This deposit was a surety for part payments owed to Avantha towards brand royalty which the board approved, according to the documents.
""This clearly shows that  ₹229 crore was not an additional advance to Avantha but a refund of a conditional deposit made by Avantha to CG which had to be refunded in the event of conditions not being met,"" the document said.
On the allegations that CG Power made out-of-turn advances to group entity Mirabelle Trading since 2013 when CG Power was entering Southeast Asia, Thapar has said the board approved an advance payment of USD 20.15 million to Mirabelle towards service charges.
Currently, Thapar owns just 8,574 shares in CG Power. Some of its large non-promoter shareholders are HDFC Mutual Fund and Aditya Birla Mutual Fund.
Private equity giant KKR India led by Sanjay Nayar owns nearly 10 per cent, as does L&T Finance. The family office of Sunil Bharati Mittal of Bharti Airtel has since September picked up 8.3% in CG Power.
The CG Power board began to feel the tremors this March, when an operations committee was formed under chairmanship Narayan Seshadri following the insistence of Nayar.
Incidentally, the documents also showed that Seshadri was not even present at the board meeting that appointed him as chairman of operations committee. Seshadri is also an independent director of CG Power.
Significantly, Seshadri's Tranzmute Capital is 50 per cent owned by Nayar-led KKR India but this was never disclosed to CG Power when he came onto the board, as per the the documents.
They are also directors in Epimoney and EPI Venture Partners as investors. Also, a non-disclosure agreement was signed between Tranzmute Capital & Management and CG Power in August 2018.
Going by the documents, Seshadri had a business relationship with Nayar and CG Power before he became a non-executive director on CG Power board.
It is also interesting to note that Anubhav -- son of Akhil Gupta, who is the vice chairman of Bharti Enterprises and a close confidante of group Chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal -- recently married Sanjay Nayar's daughter Adwaita.
In a detailed e-mail statement to queries from PTI, KKR India denied any involvement in Seshadri being appointed a director on CG Power board. ""We are a lender to Avantha Holdings and have no locus standi in any of its underlying group companies. KKR India has never been involved in the decision-making process of CG Power,"" it said.
The statement said that KKR is aware that SeshadrI was invited directly by Thapar himself to join the board.
""We confirm that Narayan’s partnership with KKR India was fully disclosed (on March 31, 2018). Tranzmute has working relationships with other PE funds, promoters and companies, including KKR India - there has never been exclusivity between KKR and Tranzmute in this regard,"" it said.
On relationship with Epimoney, the company said KKR has never been an investor in it but Nayar is one of its six investors."
18,2019-12-16,HDFC,"Last week, the govt decided to junk the proposed provision to allow switching from EPF to NPS because the two instruments serve different purposes in terms of the benefits they provide. Disha Sanghvi asked 4 experts if such portability could have benefitted investors in any way

Earlier in 2019, the labour ministry proposed certain changes to the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) Act, including an option that allowed members to switch from EPF to the National Pension System (NPS). However, last week, the government decided to junk this provision because the two instruments serve different purposes in terms of the benefits they provide. In withdrawing the option, has the government robbed investors of an opportunity to take more equity exposure for their retirement corpus? Disha Sanghvi asked four experts if such portability could have benefitted investors in any way
Such a shift could have facilitated better planning
Sumit Shukla, Chief Executive Officer, HDFC Pension Management
Retirement planning is a must for every individual and the kind of instruments you choose plays an important role. The proposal to have the choice to transfer your corpus from EPF to NPS was a progressive reform and could have helped investors plan their retirement better.
The transfer would have given more flexibility to EPF subscribers in terms of investment in equity, choice of asset class, portability, and others. Also, in NPS, the entire investment performance of fund managers is monitored and tracked, giving investors a choice to move between funds and managers.
The tax treatment in both products is EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) but the limitation of 40% mandatorily going from NPS to annuity products would have been a deal breaker. If 40% annuity taken from NPS is also made tax-free, then such a transfer would have been seamless.
The government should also bring all the pension products under the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.
Not allowing the switch is like taking a step back
Rituparna Chakraborty, Co-founder and executive vice-president, TeamLease Services
Large mandatory deductions from salary like EPF, EPS and ESI (Employees’ State Insurance) are perceived as poor products because they offer rotten service, entail high costs and have no competition.
As a recourse, we have been recommending providing employees three options: a) to contribute their share of PF (Social Security Code Bill 2019 has legitimised this) or not; b) to contribute to ESI or to an independent scheme approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India; c) to contribute to EPS or NPS.
We should end the sham of EPS; it has an estimated  ₹50,000 crore funding deficit and is unsustainable. We should revert to the pre-1995 situation where the 12% employer contribution went into a defined contribution account and allow employees to pay their 12% contribution to EPF or NPS.
The move to scrap the idea of allowing employees the choice between EPF and NPS is like taking a step back into the past and being held hostage by EPFO.
With NPS, you can opt for higher equity exposure
Lovaii Navlakhi, Managing director and chief executive officer, International Money Matters
We live in an age where portability is the norm, not an exception and where consumers are free to choose their service provider based on cost and convenience. Imagine telling a landline user that he can’t switch to a cellphone because he already has a communication device.
New products introduce new features and the latest technology. Why can’t users benefit from those? The cost of managing these come down with scale and NPS has the benefit of being set up with low costs.
But with life expectancy rising, beating inflation and making sure your money does not run out before you do, requires exposure to equity. Why should a 30-something not be allowed to have more than the 15% allocation to equity that EPF contributions are restricted to? For those with an eye on the future, accepting newer products and opening closed doors is natural. While the powers-that-be worry about protecting their turfs, they ignore the reality that the ground is being pulled from under their feet.
Low-income group prefers guaranteed, safe returns
Kuldip Kumar, Partner and leader, personal tax, PwC India
While presenting Budget 2015-16, then finance minister had announced that employees could choose between EPF and NPS. Subsequently, the labour ministry came up with a draft Social Security Code (SSC), 2019, which provided an option to EPF subscribers to switch to NPS. The detailed rules were to be notified later.
But after dissent from various quarters, the government dropped this proposal from SSC.
One may argue that by not providing such an option, the government is denying the opportunity to individuals to better their returns as NPS provides the option to allocate funds in various investment modes. In NPS, returns are based on performance and not guaranteed. However, EPFO has been consistently giving better returns on accumulated PF balances and benefits such as family pension, benefits on permanent and total disability, among others, especially to the lower-income group for whom safety of money and returns are important factors."
21,2019-12-16,HDFC,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans Personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

FASTag came into force from Sunday across the national highways. The government has mandated FASTag for toll payments from December 15 onwards.
At a toll plaza, 75% lanes will be accepting FASTag whereas 25% 'hybrid lanes' will continue operating till the government enforces mandatory usage of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based FASTag for all.
However, at every toll plaza pan India one hybrid lane will remain operative for the vehicles from both directions.
At Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza on National Highway 48, Sunil Agarwal, a commuter, said: ""Non-stop passing of cars at the toll plazas is helping us in saving our time and fuel. People should accept it positively.""
However, before plastic money comes into full force without exemption, the commuters queueing up in the cash lanes expressed concerns.
""We are facing trouble. The government has extended the deadline for another month. However, toll plazas are not opening enough gates for cash payment. Earlier we used to get daily passes but now money will be deducted each time we cross the toll. It's a trouble,"" said Rakesh Kashyap, a businessman who is yet to buy FASTag.
Hybrid lanes, which are yet to go cashless after the latest extended relaxation of FASTag for a month, are experiencing long queues resulting in a massive traffic jam at the Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza.
In addition, the government is offering incentives of 2.5 per cent cashback in FASTags till March 2020. However, cars without FASTag will be charged double the amount.
Standing in queues where people are buying FASTags, Rishab, 25, while waiting for his turn, said: ""It will take time for the people to accept and adjust to the usage of plastic money at toll plazas. It is hugely beneficial if the system works properly.""

Mumbai: Mumbai: Mortgage lender HDFC Ltd has lent $100 million (Rs700 crore) to the promoters of India's largest hospital chain Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Ltd, to help repay immediate debt obligations of the hospital chain's promoters, regulatory filings show.
The loan has been used by Apollo promoters to repay debt owed to Credit Suisse. Mint reported on 19 July, that the Apollo promoters had raised short term debt (maturity of three months) of Rs1,000 crore from Credit Suisse to repay debts that were coming up for maturity back then.
The promoter group intended to repay the Credit Suisse loan through proceeds of a 50.8% stake sale in Apollo Munich Health Insurance Co Ltd, to HDFC, which will fetch the promoters Rs1,036 crore.
However, with the Apollo Munich deal yet to materialize, the hospital chain promoters have had to lean on HDFC once again to help them manage their debt obligations.
“An amount of  ₹700 crore was borrowed by the Promoter Family from HDFC (on standard borrowing terms), to repay the short-term debt of Credit Suisse (which was originally intended to be repaid through the proceeds of the HDFC - Apollo Munich Health Insurance transaction). The Credit Suisse loan has now been repaid in full from the proceeds of the HDFC loan,"" a spokesperson for the group said in an emailed response to Mint’s queries.
The spokesperson added that the Apollo group expects the insurance stake sale to close soon.
“We are in the final stages of obtaining regulatory approvals for the Insurance transaction, and expect to complete all necessary steps to achieve transaction close in the next 30-45 days,"" the spokesperson said.
The proceeds from the transaction will be applied to repay the loan from HDFC, they added.
Emails sent to HDFC and Credit Suisse did not elicit a response.
The insurance stake sale is a crucial part of the Apollo promoters plans to reduce the quantum of pledged promoter sales.
According to Apollo Hospitals stock exchange filing, as of 13 December, around 66% of promoter shareholding in the company is pledged with lenders.
In September, Apollo Hospitals’ managing director, Suneeta Reddy, a member of the promoter family, sold a 3.6% stake in the company as part of the efforts to trim promoter-level debt.
Shares were sold to institutional investors, including a fund managed by Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and France’s Societe General, for  ₹1,482.50 per share, fetching the promoters  ₹741 crore.
Reddy highlighted that the promoters plan to bring down their pledged shares to 20% of total promoter shareholding. The promoter family currently holds a 30.8% stake in the company."

NEW DELHI :
After making National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system 24x7, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has now instructed banks to make all online payments done through NEFT and RTGS free of cost for savings account holders. Several banks have already made it free while others have been asked to do so from next month.
""In order to give further impetus to digital retail payments, it has now been decided that member banks shall not levy any charges from their savings bank account holders for funds transfers done through NEFT system which are initiated online (viz. internet banking and/or mobile apps of the banks),"" the RBI said in a notification issued this week.
The new rules will come into effect from 1 January, 2020.
NEFT charges:
Earlier in July, the apex bank had removed all charges it imposes on banks for processing of NEFT and RTGS transactions. The RBI had also asked banks to pass on the benefits to its customers as well after which some banks like SBI and ICICI Bank had made online NEFT transfers free.
India's largest bank the State Bank of India (SBI) has not levying any transaction charges through IMPC, RTGS and NEFT for YONO, internet banking and mobile banking customers. Similarly, HDFC Bank imposes no charges on NEFT transactions.
According to an earlier RBI order, banks were not allowed to charge more than  ₹2.50 for funds transfer upto  ₹10,000,  ₹5 for transfers between  ₹10,001 to  ₹1 lakh and  ₹15 for transfers between  ₹1 lakh and above and  ₹25 for for transfers beyond  ₹2 lakh.

MUMBAI :
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance Ltd on Thursday said that it has invoked shares of Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL), which were pledged by Karvy Stock Broking Ltd to raise funds from the lender.
In a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company.
KDMSL, incorporated in 2008, is a Hyderabad-based step-down subsidiary of Karvy Stock Broking and provides business and knowledge process services. The company started off with back-office services and has over the years added various other services to its portfolio to cater to the banking, telecom, and e-commerce sectors.
“The shares of KDMSL were pledged with the company for securing the outstanding dues of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, the borrower company. The company has invoked the pledged shares of KDMSL for recovery of its dues,"" the stock exchange filing said.
Bajaj Finance is amongst the group of lenders with the largest exposure to Karvy Stock Broking, which raised money from the lenders by pledging shares belonging to its clients.
On 22 November, Sebi barred Karvy from acquiring new clients and from using power of attorney, thereby barring it from trading on behalf of clients, after the broker allegedly transferred clients’ money for other purposes and indulged in trade not authorized by them.
The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorization.
These securities were used to raise funds from banks, some of the securities were sold off and the proceeds were transferred to its real estate arm – Karvy Realty Ltd.
Since then some of the lenders including Bajaj Finance have been engaged in a legal tussle over these pledged shares.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on 14 December declined to give any relief to the four lenders -Bajaj Finance Ltd, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Mint reported. The lenders had lost control over pledged shares after they were transferred by National Securities Depository Ltd into clients’ accounts.
The four lenders including Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank had extended  ₹345 crore,  ₹642 crore,  ₹208 crore and  ₹159 crore to the broking firm against pledge shares worth  ₹2873 crore as of 16 September 2019. These pledged shares came down to  ₹2319 crore in November 2019."
12,2019-12-20,HDFC,"The auto sector pain has indeed been the culprit behind the sharp slowdown in loan growthIt is clear that IndusInd Bank’s investors will allocate more brownie points for the stock once both growth and asset quality concerns reduce

IndusInd Bank Ltd has had a difficult first half in FY20. The bank’s shares have shed more than 15% since April, reflecting the deceleration in the bank’s balance-sheet growth.
The auto sector pain has indeed been the culprit behind the sharp slowdown in loan growth.
Will the lender bounce back to its heydays of high growth?
While the 30-35% growth rates seen in earlier years are unlikely soon, the bank is expected to arrest some of the slowdown. Analysts are confident that IndusInd Bank can salvage its loan growth considerably. This faith comes after the lender made a presentation detailing strategy for each vertical to analysts earlier this month.
IndusInd Bank is targeting 18-20% growth in vehicle finance, which forms more than a quarter of its loan book. But it also wants to grow its non-vehicle loan book at 24% over the next three years on a compound annual growth rate basis.
Here, the microfinance book will play a key role. The private sector lender’s merger with Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd took effect in July this year and it has had a mixed impact on IndusInd Bank’s balance sheet. Bad loans have gone up as a proportion of the loan book in contrast to the bank’s long-standing record of having low bad loan ratios. For the September quarter, gross bad loans made up 2.2% of its loan book.
But the microlender was swallowed with an intent to not just diversify but also grow the loan book. Analysts believe this segment would be a key growth fillip in the coming quarters.
Further, the bank wants to boost its fee income too by targeting selling to high net-worth individuals. All the above factors would contribute to an increase in the bank’s operating profit.
But analysts have not taken their eyes off asset quality. Here the picture is mixed. The corporate stress watch-list stands at about 1% of the lender’s loan book. This could reduce, said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.
“The resolution of two IL&FS-SPV exposures of  ₹800 crore could meaningfully cut NPAs by Q4. Vodafone exposure remains a concern, though it assigns a lower default probability as of now,"" the brokerage firm said in a note. IL&FS-SPV stands for special purpose vehicles of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd.
But some such as HDFC Securities Ltd are still concerned over slippages. “We are a bit wary of IndusInd Bank’s exposures to stressed groups and companies. We model slippages of 2.3% and (loan loss provisioning) LLPs of 1.4% over FY20-22,"" the brokerage firm said in a note.
It is clear that IndusInd Bank’s investors will allocate more brownie points for the stock once both growth and asset quality concerns reduce. Until then, the multiple of about twice its estimated book value for FY21 appears reasonable."

9,2019-12-23,HDFC,"A section of traders is betting on SALMAN to lead the next rallyThe asset quality of SBI improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19%

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."
8,2019-12-23,HDFC,"Sensex is up about 16% this yearHowever, only three companies have accounted for 65% of all of the advance: Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank

India’s largest stocks are likely to be winners again in 2020, after propelling the benchmark equity index to its fourth straight annual gain. Analysts expect gains in the S&P BSE Sensex in the new year to be led by just a handful of big names, similar to 2019, as uncertainty around a slowing economy is likely to continue driving investors to the safety of quality stocks.
“Investor focus is unlikely to shift soon from the few high-quality names which continue to steadily grow faster than the economy,"" said Dipen Sheth, Mumbai-based head of institutional research at HDFC Securities Ltd. “The foreign flows, too, favor top players.""
Economic growth slowed to a more than six-year low of 4.5% in the July-September quarter. That hasn’t stopped the Sensex from climbing nearly 16% this year, to a succession of record highs to cap a fourth straight annual gain.
However, only three companies have accounted for 65% of all of the advance: Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd.
“We expect narrow market performance to continue, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the ‘safe’ stocks, resulting in higher market concentration,"" said Neelkanth Mishra, a Mumbai-based analyst at Credit Suisse.
Global Flows
A gush of cash from global funds has helped drive the record-breaking stock rally, as overseas investors bet the worst of the economic slowdown may have passed. Foreigners have pumped $14 billion into India’s stocks this year, the highest inflow since 2014.
“Global flows are likely to be supportive as well,"" Mishra said “A significant part of foreign portfolio investment holdings in India appears to be longer term in nature or benchmarked.""
Earnings Recovery
Earnings growth for India Inc. is another factor seen support stocks in the new year. A possible economic recovery, lower corporate tax rate, clean up of bad assets at banks, above average monsoon and accommodative central bank stance support the outlook.
“Growth has likely bottomed out,"" Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in Mumbai this month. “We see it as one of the top three Asian markets for earnings growth next year.""
Moe said he expects profit growth to expand to 16% in 2020 from 12% this year. That’s his best earnings forecast for a country in the region next year, after South Korea. Among sectors that may drive this recovery are financials, consumer-oriented companies and industrials.
While earnings are improving, valuations have jumped. The Sensex is trading at 19 times 12-month forward earnings estimates, above its 10-year average of under 16 times.
Smaller stocks have lagged the overall market rally, with the NSE Midcap 100 Index down over 5% and the Nifty Smallcap 100 Index down nearly 12% year to date. Optimism around further government reforms and an economic recovery could help build a case for a catch-up by the broader market.
Valuations for mid-caps are reasonable and small-caps have bottomed out, said Jaideep Hansraj, chief executive officer at Kotak Securities Ltd.
""The small caps can show material outperformance, if the economy revives,"" he said.

6,2019-12-24,HDFC,"The move comes in the wake of the alleged misuse of the pooling system in the Karvy caseThe regulator has proposed direct credit and debit of investor bank accounts for mutual fund transactions

On 23rd December, the Securities and Exchange Board of India put out a discussion paper proposing a halt in purchases and sales of mutual funds through pool or escrow accounts of brokers and online platforms. The move comes in the wake of the alleged misuse of the pooling system in the Karvy case, The regulator has proposed direct credit and debit of investor bank accounts for mutual fund transactions.
What SEBI has proposed
An intermediary can first aggregate the money of customers and then pass it on to AMCs (and vice versa for mutual fund redemptions). Such transactions are called pooled transactions. An example of this is purchase of mutual funds through a stock broker where the money is first collected in the broker’s pool account. Platforms such as Mutual Fund Utility (MFU) also use an escrow account to collect investor money before remitting it to AMCs, which is a pooled transaction.
Alternatively, money can flow to the AMC through a clearing corporation on a stock exchange. These transactions are called non pool transactions. For instance distributors and investment advisors conducting transactions through the BSE Star MF platform use the non-pool method. Such transactions involve collection of money through the clearing corporation and not the intermediary. In FY 18-19 the share of pool transactions was 51.5% and the share of non-pool transactions was 48.5%.
SEBI has proposed an end to pooled transactions. According to the regulator, AMCs and Registrar and Transfer Agents (RTAs) do not have visibility of funds and investor details when pooling is done. Further in case of purchase of mutual funds in demat accounts, the liability of AMCs is discharged when payment is made to the broker. As a result, investors are forced to use the Exchange’s grievance redressal system in case of non-credit of units or funds. “In the recent past, instances have come to light where client’s funds/securities were diverted or mis-utilized by trading member/ clearing member toward margin obligations or settlement obligations of itself or for some third party or for raising loan against shares on its own account,"" the discussion paper said.
Experts have highlighted problems with the implementation of the SEBI proposals. ""Not all the exchanges currently have facilities for direct payment to customers from the exchange. Also brokers who charge fees for mutual fund purchases (mostly those offering direct plans) may face problems in the recovery of these charges. Finally, digital platforms that use pool accounts get some benefits because of the volume of money they handle. The new proposals can hit their business model in some way,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC securities.
The Payment Gateway Conundrum
Most online platforms such as Paytm Money, Scripbox and Mobikwik use payment gateways. Whether these platforms can continue with payment gateways is not clear. Some platforms such as Kuvera have clarified that they use BSE Star MF, an exchange platform and will not be affected by the Sebi proposals. Senior Executives at some online platforms have announced their intention to seek clarification from SEBI on this matter. Payment Gateways pool money from end investors and transmit it to AMCs. This cycle can take up to 48 hours to go through. It is unclear whether online platforms will be able to continue using payment gateways. “The new regulations are a result of SEBI’s desire to implement PMLA norms, apart from the Karvy case,"" said a senior executive at an online platform who did not wish to be named. “For example, online platforms no longer accept debit cards because the investor details cannot be ascertained by the AMC in case of such payments,"" he added. “The solution is not to bypass the escrow/nodal account but to make it transparent. We should highlight that there is no misuse of the nodal/escrow account with a payment gateway licensed by the RBI,"" said Kunal Bajaj, Business Head, Online Wealth Management, Mobikwik. “SEBI needs to create parity between clearing corporations and payment gateways,"" he added.
The SEBI proposals will make mutual fund transactions safer and reduce the risk of fraud or default by intermediaries. However the regulator should urgently clarify its stance on payment gateways regulated by RBI. Disruption in this area could hurt the growth of online investing and mutual fund penetration overall."
4,2019-12-25,HDFC,"Review your portfolio regularly to ensure that you are investing in funds that fit your profile and requirements

I have systematic investment plans (SIPs) in Mirae Asset Emerging Blue Chip Fund ( ₹4,000), Mirae Asset Tax Saver Fund ( ₹1,500), Axis Blue Chip Fund ( ₹1,500), Axis Midcap ( ₹1,000) and Franklin India Focused Equity fund ( ₹1,000). Are these funds good for an investment horizon of 25-30 years?
—Gaurav Sharma
The funds that you are investing in are all very good, with a solid track-record and consistent performance. You are investing close to 50% of your portfolio in a large-and-mid-cap fund (Mirae Asset Emerging Blue Chip fund) and the rest in a variety of large- and mid-cap funds. You can continue with this portfolio, but whether or not they will be good for the next 25-30 years is a tough thing to say. The world of mutual funds will keep evolving both from the fund management perspective as well as from the market perspective. So it’s important that you review your portfolio regularly to ensure that you are investing in funds that fit your profile and requirements.
I would like to know if my current portfolio is okay or I need make some changes. I have SIPs in the following funds: HDFC Small Cap ( ₹8,000), Kotak Emerging Equity ( ₹4,000), Axis Midcap ( ₹4,500), Axis Bluechip ( ₹8,000), Axis Multicap ( ₹4,500) and Axis Focused 25 ( ₹4,000). I have a moderate risk appetite. I have been investing in these schemes since 11 January 2019 each month. My short-term goals are accumulating up to  ₹7.5 lakh by June 2020 and up to  ₹2 crore by 2030.
—Mayank Gupta
You have over half your SIPs in high-risk funds, which is not appropriate given that you have a moderate risk profile. You also have over half your SIPs in funds from the same asset management company and, therefore, there are overlaps in portfolio and style. Axis Bluechip and Axis Focused 25, for instance, have very similar portfolios. None of these funds can be used for your short-term goal; markets can correct in a short-term period and you face the risk of capital erosion. Make separate investments in debt funds and fixed deposits; these are the best fits for time frames of less than three years. For your long-term goal, you will find it hard to reach  ₹2 crore even if we assume an aggressive return of 15%. A moderate-risk portfolio will give lower returns. Increase the SIP amounts whenever you can.
You can restructure your SIPs as follows: Invest  ₹6,000 each in Axis Bluechip and Kotak Standard Multicap,  ₹5,000 each in Kotak Emerging Equity and HDFC Smallcap,  ₹3,000 in Invesco India Contra and  ₹8,000 in ICICI Prudential Corporate Bond.
