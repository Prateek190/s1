New Delhi: Engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and its non-executive chairman A.M. Naik as well as director Shailendra Roy have settled with markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) a probe into late compliance with insider trading norms by paying over Rs10 lakh.  
New Delhi: Engineering major Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and its non-executive chairman A.M. Naik as well as director Shailendra Roy have settled with markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) a probe into late compliance with insider trading norms by paying over Rs10 lakh. 
However, Sebi did not disclose details of the case. The regulator agreed to settle proposed adjudication proceedings in the case, pertaining to the delayed compliance of insider trading norms after it was approached by these entities with a plea under the settlement regulations “without admitting or denying the findings of fact and conclusion of law"". 
“The proposed adjudication proceedings for the alleged defaults...are settled,"" Sebi said in a settlement order passed on Tuesday adding it would not initiate any enforcement action for the alleged defaults.
The company and its two officials had allegedly made “delayed compliance of Sebi (Prohibition of Insider Trading) regulations"". Pending adjudication proceedings, these entities had approached Sebi in 2015 to settle the case on payment settlement charges. The authorised representatives of the entities had meeting with the regulator’s internal committee in April 2017, wherein the settlement terms were deliberated. 
Thereafter, Sebi’s high powered advisory committee recommended the case for settlement on the payment of amount totalling Rs10.27 lakh. This included Rs2 lakh by Larsen & Toubro, Naik (over Rs4.72 lakh) and Roy (over Rs3.54 lakh). This was also approved by Sebi’s panel of whole-time members, following which they remitted the amount.
Accordingly, the regulator has disposed of the adjudication proceedings initiated against them. It further said that enforcement actions, including commencing or reopening of the proceedings, could be initiated if any representation made by them is found to be untrue."

Mumbai: Engineering firm Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) on Wednesday said its net profit for the December quarter rose 53% from a year ago, as revenues increased due to higher order inflow from infrastructure and hydrocarbons businesses.  
Mumbai: Engineering firm Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) on Wednesday said its net profit for the December quarter rose 53% from a year ago, as revenues increased due to higher order inflow from infrastructure and hydrocarbons businesses. 
The company reported a 38% year-on-year increase in fresh orders for the fiscal third quarter and reiterated its revenue growth guidance of 12% for the current fiscal.
’s consolidated net profit for the quarter ended 31 December rose to Rs1,490 crore from Rs972 crore a year earlier. Gross revenue rose 9.4% to Rs28,747 crore. 
A poll of 17 analysts on Bloomberg expected L&T to report a consolidated net profit of Rs1,393.70 crore while 18 analysts had expected net sales of Rs28,424.80 crore.
L&T won fresh orders worth Rs48,130 crore in the quarter, up 38%. 
International orders at Rs8,835 crore constituted 18% of the total order inflow. A significant portion of the increased order inflow was owing to a 70% rise in domestic orders. 
The growth in order inflows was driven by the infrastructure and hydrocarbon segments. 
The increase in order inflows was a “welcome relief"" for the company, said R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer at the Mumbai-based company. “If we don’t perform like this, we will be very disappointed.""
He stopped short of calling it a full-fledged recovery in capital investments. The Indian economy is facing the worst slowdown in at least half a decade as investment demand lags. 
The Economic Survey released on Monday too had pointed out that the country’s investment slowdown has lasted unusually long and that it may not be over yet.
“We seem to be on the right side of the table. Welcome relief is from the context of things moving on. Now whether that is sustainable, we will have to wait and watch,"" said L&T’s Raman. 
He also added that tax reforms in the US, the Middle East and elsewhere are resetting the global competitive landscape, presenting other challenges to the engineering company.
At the end of December, L&T’s order book stood at Rs2.7 trillion, up 4.7% from a year ago. The company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda jumped around 600 basis points to 31.4%.
On Wednesday, L&T shares closed 0.87% lower at Rs1,416.60 on BSE, while the exchange’s benchmark Sensex index fell 0.19%. The company’s earnings were released after market hours ."

New Delhi: The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has received a complaint against Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) alleging “thousands of crores"" of financial irregularities, including money laundering and tax evasion, a charge that the infrastructure giant called the allegations “baseless"". 
New Delhi: The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has received a complaint against Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) alleging “thousands of crores"" of financial irregularities, including money laundering and tax evasion, a charge that the infrastructure giant called the allegations “baseless"".
Acting on the complaint received, SFIO’s Mumbai regional office has written to the head-office here stating that it “is a fit case to be investigated"" as it will “help in unearthing wrong doings of L&T group, in terms of misappropriation of money, money laundering and tax evasion"".
In the complaint, Rajya Sabha MP Kahkashan Perween has alleged that loans worth Rs8,000 crore given to the group for road projects face serious threat of turning into non-performing assets (NPAs). It alleged irregularities in two projects—L&T Halol Shamlaji Tollway Ltd (L&T Halol) and L&T Chennai Tada Ltd.
L&T and its arms, which are engaged in highway projects have been termed as “habitual defaulters"" by the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI), which is likely to have a severe negative impact on loans worth Rs8,000 crore given by various banks to the group, as per the complaint by the MP.
L&T, however, dismissed the allegations as “baseless and without any merit"", and said it has no information about any investigation.
“Efforts by public sector banks to bail out L&T Halol Shamlaji Tollway Ltd (L&T Halol) under the guise of debt-restructuring schemes will only benefit unscrupulous promoters i e L&T at the cost of banks, financial institutions and public at large,"" the complaint alleged.
Besides, it added that loan accounts of Chennai Tada Ltd have already turned non performing assets since September 2015 and recovery of the same is under serious threat. “L&T and its group companies be black listed and the banks and public financial institutions be prohibited from granting any further loans to them considering their record of frittering away public money,"" the MP said in the letter written to the SFIO.
The complaint also sought to direct the L&T (being the holding company) to repay the loans due to banks and institutions.
When contacted, L&T said, “We are not aware of any so called investigation ... We strongly deny the allegations which are entirely baseless and without merit. L&T has always maintained high standards of corporate governance and compliance of statutory and regulatory requirements"".
The company said it is important to note that L&T Infrastructure Development Pvt Ltd (L&TIDPL), the promoter of L&T Chennai Tada Tollways and L&T Halol Shamlaji Tollway, “has neither received a return of nor a return on its investments made in these two companies.""
In spite of the specific commercial understanding that the projects are funded on a non-recourse basis, the promoter has infused into the two projects substantial amounts over and above its obligations and commitments under the loan documents to service the loans from the lenders, the letter said.
“Attributing any motives of mismanagement against the project company, promoters L&TIDPL (or the parent company L&T) is entirely baseless and totally uncalled for,"" the company said. L&T said, as far as L&T Chennai Tada Tollways Ltd was concerned, the NHAI despite fixing 1 October 2011 for completion, “was never in a position to hand over either 60 per cent of the total Right of Way on the Appointed Date (3 April 2009) or 100% of the Right of Way within 90 days from the Appointed Date.
“NHAI’s failure to honour its commitment even after 6 years from the Appointed Date under the Concession Agreement (CA) resulted in considerable losses for the Concessionaire. Failure of NHAI to hand over the land in time and pay damages had adversely impacted the construction schedule, both in terms of time and cost, and as a consequence, the SPV had to invoke Material Adverse Effect as defined in the CA"".
L&T said the company had requested NHAI to pay Rs453.4 crores on 18 March 2015 for losses suffered and an arbitration process is pending against the authority. “As NHAI refused to compensate the Concessionaire and as the continued breach by NHAI was causing irreparable financial burden on the Concessionaire, the Concessionaire was left with no option but to terminate the Concession Agreement,"" the company said, adding that the pact was terminated with effect from 24 June 2015.
It said an application was filed under the Arbitration Act before the Delhi High Court. The court in its Order dated May 2016 directed NHAI that the toll collected by it through the tolling contractor be deposited in the Escrow Account as large amount of debt is still owed to the lenders/banks.
About L&T Halol Shamlaji Tollway Ltd, it said the bid was awarded for a four lane state highway on BOT in Gujarat and despite various challenges the road was built within stipulated time. The bidding was based on estimates of base year traffic and growth projections linked to economic growth of Gujarat, but due to development of an alternate road by the state there was a significant change in traffic pattern.
“Despite the challenges, the promoter had infused into the Project Rs247 crore over and above the Rs524 crores required under the loan documents primarily to service lenders,"" L&T said, adding that HSTL served a notice of termination to GSRDC in April 2016 citing an Authority Event of Default.
It said since no termination action was forthcoming from the GSRDC, the Allahabad Bank-led consortium sought to revive the project under the SDR Scheme of RBI."

Mumbai/London: Larsen & Toubro Ltd., India’s largest engineering and construction company, has agreed to sell its electrical unit to a consortium led by Schneider Electric SE, people with knowledge of the matter said.

Schneider will own 74% of the unit when the deal is complete, while Temasek Holdings Pte will own the balance, the people said.

92,2018-05-03,Larsen,"The inflow from sale of electrical and automation business will help Larsen & Toubro reduce debt and fund strategic acquisitions that strengthen the core

Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) is getting rid of its electrical and automation (E&A) business, as part of its strategy to exit non-core businesses. It has agreed to sell the business to Schneider Electric at an enterprise valuation of Rs14,000 crore. As the chart alongside shows, non-core businesses have been a drag, and the sale of the E&A business can well be seen as a tacit admission that the company had spread itself too thin in the past.  
Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) is getting rid of its electrical and automation (E&A) business, as part of its strategy to exit non-core businesses. It has agreed to sell the business to Schneider Electric at an enterprise valuation of Rs14,000 crore. As the chart alongside shows, non-core businesses have been a drag, and the sale of the E&A business can well be seen as a tacit admission that the company had spread itself too thin in the past. 
Of course, this division has been on the block for almost five years, even under the previous leadership. But it so happens that the final decision to sell it has only been taken now. Under S.N. Subrahmanyan, who took over as chief executive and managing director less than a year ago, the mantra is to steer the ship back to its core, which would largely include infrastructure, power, heavy engineering and hydrocarbons.
To be sure, there have been successful attempts in the past to sell stakes in non-core businesses such as financial services and information technology as part of the overall strategy to raise cash. But the company remains a majority owner in these businesses, which are now listed, and the decision to sell the E&A business lock, stock and barrel appears to be a first.
While the funds from this all-cash deal will come into L&T’s coffers only 18 months from now, it would unlock shareholder value by improving return ratios. 
L&T’s return on capital employed (ROCE) had peaked at 26% in fiscal year 2007 (FY07), after which it started steadily running downhill after the global recession impacted domestic economic growth. Both private and public sector capex took a hit and orders from its core business of engineering and construction, dwindled. The conglomerate looked to soften the blow by growing other businesses such as financial services, realty, information technology and other miscellaneous activities. 
No doubt, the decision helped keep the ship afloat during the stormy weather. But then, return ratios have not been able to scale the FY07 peak in a decade. On the other hand, slow movement of existing infrastructure projects, delayed payments and hefty working capital requirements led to ballooning of debt on its books. The net debt-to-equity ratio doubled to 2 in FY17. Interest costs as a percentage of sales also rose over the years. In other words, the many diversification attempts worsened balance-sheet health. 
In that backdrop, the inflow from the E&A sale will help reduce debt and fund strategic acquisitions that strengthen the core. The sale also makes sense because the E&A division is largely a products business, quite different from L&T’s intent to stay mainly in the projects business. Besides, electrical automation is rife with competition.
For investors, the sale is a big positive and lifts confidence in the company’s intent and ability to monetize assets. While the net debt-to-equity ratio is likely to come down to 0.7-0.9 by FY20, ROCE will also rise as a result of the smaller balance- sheet size and on the back of strong operating cash flows. A report from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd says that apart from macro recovery, a gradual balance-sheet strengthening will lead to a rerating of the stock.
Yet, investors must note that the conglomerate’s diversification had sheltered it to some extent from risks in capex cycles—something that it may again be exposed to."
91,2018-07-26,Larsen,"While the infrastructure sector is seeing growth, it is still wait-and-watch on the private sector capex cycle

Infrastructure and engineering conglomerate Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) June quarter (Q1) results ticked all the right boxes. The key takeaway is that while the infrastructure sector is seeing growth, it is still wait-and-watch on the private sector capex cycle. 
Infrastructure and engineering conglomerate Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) June quarter (Q1) results ticked all the right boxes. The key takeaway is that while the infrastructure sector is seeing growth, it is still wait-and-watch on the private sector capex cycle.
Given that infrastructure accounts for the largest part of the company’s business and hinges on government ordering, the order flows increased by a robust 37% year-on-year to  ₹ 36,142 crore. Domestic orders rose by 45%, mainly from the infrastructure and hydrocarbons segment. 
The management’s optimism stems from buoyant tendering activity, with sponsors willing to put money behind projects. Although domestic banks are still sorting out their internal mess, international financial institutions such as the Asian Development Bank and the New Development Bank are active. 
International orders too did well, growing by 19% year-on-year, geopolitical tensions notwithstanding.
Meanwhile, L&T’s execution capabilities are mirrored in its 19% year-on-year jump in net revenue. However, the quarter marked a regrouping of business segments, with metallurgical and material handling brought under infrastructure. 
This could be a reason for the slight dip in the infrastructure segment’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins to 6.8% from 7.1% a year ago. Besides, the first quarter’s margins are not necessarily the best, given the advances provided to vendors and suppliers for projects.
However, other businesses bolstered margins for the company and the only sore thumb remains the power segment.
On the whole, the June quarter was impressive with government-backed projects supporting growth. Consolidated Ebitda margin jumped by 160 basis points year-on-year to 10.3%, surpassing Bloomberg’s average forecast. A basis point is 0.01% Consequently, Ebitda grew by 40%, again beating Bloomberg’s estimates. 
The moot question is whether the performance beat will fire the L&T stock. Note that the spate of orders announced through the quarter had little impact on the stock, which continues to be range-bound. At  ₹ 1,320 per share, it trades at about 21 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2019 (FY19). 
What is needed is a few quarters of sustainable margins and earnings growth, the key for investor confidence. This does not look daunting given the company’s healthy order book of  ₹ 2.7 trillion, of which the infrastructure segment comprises  ₹ 2.1 trillion.
Another trigger could be an upward revision in order flow guidance that the management has retained at 10-12% growth for FY19."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday reserved its judgment on the Bhushan Steel matter, as it concluded hearing appeals against the acquisition filed by Bhushan Steel’s founding Singal family and the firm’s operational creditor Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay also directed all parties concerned, including Tata Steel and L&T to submit its written responses by Friday. 
New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday reserved its judgment on the Bhushan Steel matter, as it concluded hearing appeals against the acquisition filed by Bhushan Steel’s founding Singal family and the firm’s operational creditor Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay also directed all parties concerned, including Tata Steel and L&T to submit its written responses by Friday.
The appellate tribunal was also hearing Bhushan Energy promoters’ appeal challenging Tata Steel’s intention to terminate the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between it and its parent, Bhushan Steel. 
The PPA relates to buying of power generated by Bhushan Energy by Bhushan Steel. On 15 May, the NCLT’s principal bench had approved Tata Steel’s resolution plan, which promises an upfront payment of Rs35,200 crore to Bhushan Steel’s lenders, besides picking up a 12.27% stake in the steel maker.
Tata Steel’s resolution plan had proposed to pay Bhushan Steel’s operational creditors Rs1,000 crore, and another Rs200 crore on a pro-rata basis over one year, depending on the “vitality to running the business"".
Bhushan Energy is also undergoing insolvency resolution in NCLT. The liquidation value of Bhushan Energy is expected to go down if the PPA is terminated.
Singal had moved NCLAT questioning Tata Steel’s eligibility to bid for the company under section 29(A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), while L&T had moved the appellate tribunal seeking to be declared a secured creditor so that it gets higher priority in repayment of dues.
Bhushan Power and Steel, which owes over  ₹ 48,500 crore to a consortium of lenders led by Punjab National Bank, is one of the 12 large companies identified by the Reserve Bank of India for early insolvency resolution. A recent report by credit rating agency Crisil pegged Bhushan Steel’s flat steel capacity at 5 million tonnes (mt) a year, about 9% of the Indian market."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Friday ruled that Tata Steel Ltd and Vedanta Ltd were eligible to bid for Bhushan Steel Ltd and Electrosteel Steels Ltd, respectively. 
The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay rejected pleas by Bhushan Steel founder Neeraj Singal and the firm’s operational creditor Larsen & Toubro Ltd, and ruled that Tata Steel was eligible to bid for the debt-ridden company.
“On hearing the counsel for the parties and taking into consideration the submissions made by the counsel for the appellant ‘operational creditor’ and the respondents, we hold that the ‘resolution plan’ submitted by ‘Tata Steel Limited’ is fair and equitable to all the creditors, including the ‘operational creditors’. Therefore, no interference is called for,"" the tribunal said.
The NCLAT order comes a day after the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) arrested Singal on charges of siphoning off more than  ₹ 2,000 crore from Bhushan Steel’s bank loans using 80 different companies.
Singal had moved NCLAT questioning Tata Steel’s eligibility to bid for the company under Section 29(A) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), while L&T had moved the appellate tribunal seeking to be declared a secured creditor so that it received higher priority in repayment of dues.
Tata Steel’s resolution plan had proposed to pay Bhushan Steel’s operational creditors  ₹ 1,000 crore and another  ₹ 200 crore on a pro-rata basis over one year, depending on the “vitality to running the business"".
The appellate tribunal also rejected appeals against Electrosteel Steels sale to Vedanta. “We hold that ‘Vedanta Limited’ is eligible and clause (d) of Section 29(A) of the ‘I&B Code’ is not attracted in its case,"" it said in its judgment to various appeals by Renaissance Steel India Pvt Ltd, one of the unsuccessful bidders for Electrosteel, against a 17 April order of the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT’s) Kolkata bench approving Vedanta Ltd’s  ₹ 5,320 crore resolution plan for Electrosteel.
Renaissance Steel had contended that Vedanta was ineligible to bid under Section 29(A) of IBC as one of Vedanta’s affiliates in Zambia—a unit of its UK-based parent Vedanta Resources Plc—had been found guilty of violating certain environmental laws, punishable with two or more years in jail.
Electrosteel owes lenders more than  ₹ 13,000 crore, of which about  ₹ 5,000 crore is to State Bank of India alone.
Both Bhushan Power and Steel and Electrosteel are among the 12 initial accounts identified by the Reserve Bank for resolution.

Ready in a record 33 months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today inaugurated Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue, known as the Statue of Unity, in the Narmada district of Gujarat. Against the picturesque backdrop of Vindhyachal and Satpura mountain ranges and the Narmada river, the giant memorial is the world’s tallest statue at 600 feet and is expected to be a major tourist destination in Gujarat. 
Ready in a record 33 months, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today inaugurated Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s statue, known as the Statue of Unity, in the Narmada district of Gujarat. Against the picturesque backdrop of Vindhyachal and Satpura mountain ranges and the Narmada river, the giant memorial is the world’s tallest statue at 600 feet and is expected to be a major tourist destination in Gujarat.
Conceptualised as Sardar Patel walking on the Narmada river towards the Sardar Sarovar dam, the design of the statue took a lot of brainstorming among experts due to various challenges related to its location, height and pose. The bronze statue now is nothing less than an engineering marvel.
It was on this day, five years ago, when Narendra Modi, then chief minister of Gujarat, had laid down the foundation stone for the project. Now once again, on the occasion of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s birthday, Modi was there at the spot, but this time to inaugurate the Statue of Unity as prime minister.
The Statue of Unity is so towering that even if you are 6 feet tall, the statue will still be 100 times than you. On the outside, the Sardar Patel statue is plated with 1,700 tonnes of bronze and 1,850 tonnes of bronze cladding made up of 565 macro and 6,000 micro panels. The core of the statue is made up of 210,000 cubic metres of cement concrete, 18,500 tonnes of reinforced steel and 6,500 tonnes of structural steel.
ALSO READ | Statue of Unity open now. This is how much a ticket costs
5 engineering feats that make the Statue of Unity special:
1. Larsen & Toubro Ltd, which designed and executed the project after winning a tender, deployed a team of over 3,000 workers and 250 engineers. Although the statue was designed and made in India, the bronze panels had to be cast in a foundry in China, since no such facility to handle such a huge project is available in India.
2. One of the biggest challenges for L&T was to ensure that the statue looks as similar as possible to Sardar Patel. For this purpose, they hired well-known sculptor Ram V. Sutar from Noida, who went through over 2,000 archival photographs of the “Iron Man"" and spoke to several historians and those had seen him to come up with the design matching Patel’s bodily and facial features.
3. For the construction of the statue, the engineers had to be extra cautious in ensuring that the monument had the capability to withstand heavy winds of up to 130km/hour and earthquakes measuring up to 6.5 on Richter scale. They also used two tuned mass dampers of 250 tonnes each to ensure that in any given situation the base of the structure always remains rooted.
4. Another headache for engineers was the walking pose of Sardar Patel, which meant that the statue is the most weakest at its base as there is a gap of 21 feet between the two legs. Keeping the legs of a statue together helps balance its weight.
5. The engineers adopted sophisticated state of the art technologies like light detection and ranging technology and telescopic logging to assess rock joints. The development of the Statue of Unity went through several stages of mock-up, 3D scanning and computer numerical control production to ensure accurate reproduction of minute details."

Revenue during the September quarter (Q2) rose by 21%, beating analysts’ estimates. Importantly, the company’s efficiency improvement measures have begun to yield benefits. Expenses as a percentage of revenue moderated, aiding profitability.
As a consequence, operating earnings (up 27%) and net profit (up 21%) grew at a faster pace. The numbers include an exceptional or non-recurring gain. Even adjusted for this, profits have grown, says L&T.
Order inflows jumped 46%, indicating a healthy outlook. Encouragingly, the order inflows were driven by the domestic market. According to L&T, tendering activity in India was strong, with the public sector driving momentum.
Segment-wise, the company’s mainstay infrastructure division drove growth, both on order inflows and revenues. Power remains a laggard. Heavy engineering and hydrocarbon segments clocked strong growth, helped by renewed buoyancy in the oil and gas business, and focus on clean fuels.
As the chart above shows, the performance comfortably places L&T to meet its full-year order inflow growth guidance of 10-12% and 12-15% growth in revenues (growth in first half is much higher). Even so, the management remains cautious pointing to lumpiness in order inflows and volatility in the market.
The caution underscores the uncertain times. Investments by the private sector are yet to take off in a major way. While the government’s thrust on infrastructure development is driving the momentum in the domestic market, sustainability remains a question mark.
The fear is clearances and fund allocations may take a back seat in an election year (towards the end of the fourth quarter), slowing the business momentum. These concerns have weighed on the L&T stock. 
Despite the company announcing a share buyback, and a strategy rethink to exit non-core businesses and focus on returns improvement, the stock hasn’t been a very strong outperformer. Sustainability of the momentum in execution and government-led investment remain key."
82,2019-01-22,Larsen,"The talks are also focused on L&T’s plan to buy an additional 5% stake from the promoters of MindtreeOver the past six months, NEC and buyout PE funds KKR and Co. and Baring PE Asia too have evinced interest

Engineering and construction conglomerate Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) has initiated talks to acquire a stake in Mindtree Ltd, joining two private equity (PE) firms and Japan’s NEC Ltd which have also shown interest in the software services company.
L&T is discussing with Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder V.G. Siddhartha the possibility of buying the 20.4% stake held by Siddhartha and two CCD affiliate firms in Mindtree, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The talks are also focused on L&T’s plan to buy an additional 5% stake either through an open offer or directly from the promoters of Mindtree, the people said, requesting anonymity.
They said L&T’s plans for Mindtree were devised a week ago, primarily with the objective of creating an IT consulting and services giant through a merger of Mindtree, L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Engineering Services Ltd.
“The discussions between L&T and Siddhartha are at an early stage but things are moving fast,"" said the first person cited above.
After acquiring a controlling stake in Mindtree, L&T will most likely merge the company with Mindtree’s current and larger rivals L&T Infotech and L&T Engineering to create a company large enough to compete with Infosys, TCS, Wipro and HCL, the person said.
“As part of business strategy, the company does explore various opportunities towards growth. Having said that, your query is entirely based on market rumours. As a policy, we do not comment on speculation,"" said a spokesperson for L&T.
L&T is not the only suitor for Mindtree. Over the past six months, NEC and buyout PE funds KKR and Co. and Baring PE Asia too have evinced interest, but the talks have not fructified yet because the Mindtree promoters have been reluctant to pare their stake.
Mindtree’s promoters hold a total of 13.32%, with chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan holding 3.72%, co-founder Subroto Bagchi holding 3.1%, N.S. Parthasarathy holding 1.43% and the CEO Rostow Ravanan holding 0.71%.
“L&T has two options. L&T can just buy Siddhartha and his two firms’ stake and wait for the promoters to agree to sell their stake to L&T at a later stage to enable the latter to make an open offer for gaining control. Or, L&T can buy the 20.4% holding from Siddhartha and if the promoters continue to be reluctant, L&T can buy more shares of Mindtree from the public in the open market whenever the shares correct and increase their holding beyond 25% to get the open offer triggered so that L&T is able to buy at least 26% more to be able to force a takeover of Mindtree,"" said the second person.
On 15 January, Mint reported that the promoters of Mindtree are now faced with stay-or-sell dilemma as the company’s largest investor nears a decision to sell his stake. They can either accept buyout offers and cede control, or decide against selling and see their net worth potentially erode, said the report."
81,2019-01-22,Larsen,"Sebi recently rejected Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) proposal to buy back shares worth  ₹9,000 croreSebi said the company’s consolidated debt-equity ratio will exceed 2:1 post the buyback, which flouts the regulator’s buyback rules

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has rejected Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) proposal to buy back shares worth  ₹9,000 crore. The reason cited is that the company’s consolidated debt-equity ratio will exceed 2:1 post the buy-back, which flouts the regulator’s buy-back rules.
Sebi’s ruling gives the impression that it is worried the buyback may result in overleverage, and the company may not have sufficient funds in the case of an exigency.
But one of the workarounds L&T can consider to return cash to shareholders is a special dividend, say analysts. If it ends up choosing that mode, all Sebi would have achieved is push the company away from a more tax-efficient way to return cash. After all, dividend distribution is taxed at multiple levels, which has made buybacks a far more popular means for distributing cash to shareholders.
The other niggling aspect about Sebi’s ruling is that it has considered L&T’s consolidated accounts, whereas its buyback rules state that “the ratio of the aggregate of secured and unsecured debts owed by the company after buy-back shall not be more than twice the paid-up capital and free reserves"". There is no reference in the rules to consolidated accounts, and the accounts of a company are generally understood to be stand-alone accounts.
This is not to say that consolidated accounts do not matter—especially after the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd fiasco. Even so, to consider consolidated accounts, when the stated rules don’t expressly say so, is poor form.
A moot question here is if Sebi or the government, which also has its own set of buy-back rules, should micromanage buybacks. If L&T is bent on overleveraging itself, isn’t it best left to the markets to penalize it and demand a higher cost of funding? In any case, who’s to say 2:1 is a safe boundary as far as leverage goes? In L&T’s case, the ratio is bloated to an extent because of its financial services subsidiary which, like other firms in its sector, operates on far higher leverage than non-financial companies.
Last, but not the least, Sebi took as many as 102 days to inform L&T’s bankers about its decision, with the sole reason given being the flouting of the debt-equity ratio. How long does it take to calculate the debt-equity ratio of a company? Even if we give some allowance for the self-inflicted confusion on whether consolidated or stand-alone results should be considered, a period of three-and-a-half months is clearly taking things too far.
It’s worth recalling the Supreme Court’s rap on the knuckles to Sebi in its case against Akshya Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd, where the regulator delayed giving comments on the latter’s open offer letter by 13 months: “Such kind of delay is wholly inexcusable and needs to be avoided. It can lead to avoidable controversy with regard to whether such belated action is bona fide exercise of statutory power by Sebi. By adopting such a lackadaisical, if not callous attitude, the very object for which the regulations have been framed is diluted, if not frustrated."""
80,2019-01-28,Larsen,"L&T has retained guidance in spite of the 12% year-on-year decline in order flows during the quarterAnother factor that lifted investor confidence is the 24% year-on-year revenue expansion to  ₹35,700 crore in Q3

Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) December quarter results were reassuring for investors. Concerns that the conglomerate may cut guidance were doused as L&T committed to achieve the higher end of the 12-15% revenue forecast and order flow growth by 10-12% in FY19. This augurs well given the election-linked uncertainty for government orders and the fact that the company had cut guidance in four of the last six years.
Strangely, it has retained guidance in spite of the 12% year-on-year decline in order flows during the quarter. The management seems confident as the decline was largely from the infrastructure segment, due to bid delays and deferrals in the transportation and civil infrastructure sectors that are bound to see fruition in the forthcoming quarters.
A report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd says that the sharp increase in Metro and water spends by the states and the company’s conscious focus on new areas would reduce direct dependence on the country’s central budget. Lavina Quadross, an analyst at the brokerage firm, estimates double-digit growth in overall infrastructure plus capex spends for the next three years.

Lavina Quadross, an analyst at the brokerage firm, estimates double-digit growth in overall infrastructure plus capex spends for the next three years.
Another factor that lifted investor confidence is the 24% year-on-year revenue expansion to  ₹35,700 crore in Q3, far higher than the Street’s forecasts. Double-digit growth accrued across sub-segments within engineering and construction (E&C), with hydrocarbons and infrastructure leading the way.
In its results analysis, a report by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd says that the government thrust to complete projects before the elections is evident in L&T’s 42% year-on-year jump in domestic infrastructure revenue. Even the 22% jump in hydrocarbon revenue and 50% growth in heavy engineering were impressive. Only the beleaguered power segment continued to play spoilsport with a revenue drop.
Further, L&T maintained its overall Ebitda margin of 11.3% compared to the year-ago period. Ebitda is earnings before income, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Note that the E&C segment’s provisions towards cost overruns and delays on infrastructure projects, dragged margins down by about 160 basis points. Fortunately, the services sectors, namely financial services and information technology, offset the same through robust profitability.
Strong execution and revenue accretion along with stable profit margins translated into a 27% year-on-year growth in Ebitda that beat poll estimates of 13 brokers on Bloomberg.
The 9% drop in L&T’s shares over the last 12 months underscores the concerns on the Street of low order flows in 2019. However, the consolidated order book of  ₹2.8 trillion assures revenue growth for the next two-three years.
Strong order book combined with timely execution has improved working capital outflows. This is why the stock has been range bound even through challenging times.
The recent dampener was the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s rejection of a proposed buy-back, which works against the company’s plan to improve return on equity. Analysts are sure L&T will find some way to return cash to shareholders. This will perhaps be the next trigger for stock appreciation."
79,2019-02-18,Larsen,"Cognizant routed $3.64 million through L&T for bribes to officials in Maharashtra and Tamil NaduCoburn resigned after the firm told US officials that some payments made in India could have breached the law

New Delhi: Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) facilitated the payment of $3.64 million in bribes to Indian government officials on behalf of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. to secure permits, ranging from environmental clearance to power, at the US company’s campuses in Chennai and Pune, a person familiar with the development said.
On Friday, Cognizant agreed to pay $25 million to settle a 2016 case under Foreign Corruption Prevention Act with US authorities. The Nasdaq-listed company routed the bribes through L&T to government officials in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu in the three years to 2015, the person cited above said on condition of anonymity.
Although the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) did not name L&T in the complaint that was made public, the person cited above said the construction arm of India’s largest engineering company made illicit payments and Cognizant reimbursed the money by disguising it as compensation for cost overruns.
The development also shines the spotlight on the dark underbelly of doing business in India, despite the country’s much publicized progress in the World Bank’s Doing Business 2019 report, where it jumped 23 places to the 77th rank.
“One can view these payments as cost of doing business in India,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research. “The larger question that begs to be asked is what is the government doing and how successful it has been as India looks to make it easy for companies to do business in the country.""
The details about the illegal payments emerged when the US Department of Justice (DoJ) and the US Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey charged former Cognizant president Gordon Coburn and former chief legal officer Steven Schwartz on Friday with approving these illicit payments to Indian officials when it was getting its corporate offices built.
Cognizant India asked L&T in 2014 to pay $2 million in bribes to a senior government official for the issuance of a planning permit for its campus in Knowledge Industry Township in Chennai, according to the SEC probe.
A year before, in 2013, Cognizant India instructed L&T to pay $770,000 in bribes to a Maharashtra government official for seeking environmental clearance for a campus in Pune. Finally, L&T again paid $870,000 in bribes to government officials for construction-related permits in Siruseri, Chennai in 2015, again on behalf of Cognizant.
Mint could not ascertain the names of the government officials in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu who received these payments.
Embarrassingly for Cognizant, SEC found that Coburn asked company executives to “withhold future payments to Contracting Firm-1 if it resisted paying the bribe on Cognizant’s behalf"".
“Contracting Firm-1, which had been urging Cognizant to make the payment itself, ultimately yielded to Senior Executive-1’s pressure and made the payment in late May or early June 2014. Cognizant received the planning permit in November of that year,"" said a statement in SEC’s complaint filed in a court in the District of New Jersey, seeking a trial by a jury.
For now, it is unclear what made L&T relent and agree to Cognizant’s demand for making these payments.
An email sent to L&T seeking comment went unanswered.
L&T’s infrastructure segment, which includes its construction business, is the company’s largest division, accounting for 72% of its  ₹76,496.5 crore revenue in the year ended March 2018.
L&T’s managing director and chief executive S.N. Subrahmanyan headed the infrastructure business during the years when the company is alleged to have made these bribes to government officials.
Both Coburn and Schwartz deny any wrongdoing.
“We are disappointed that DoJ and SEC chose to pursue these allegations,"" said Hank Walther, a partner with Jones Day, the law firm, and who is representing Coburn. “Mr. Coburn intends to vigorously fight all charges.""
Coburn resigned from Cognizant in October 2016 when the company told US authorities that some payments made in India could have breached the law.
Coburn subsequently joined Carlyle Group but resigned from the private equity firm last year, according to a second executive.
“History has shown that sometimes the government gets its facts wrong, and this is one of those times. Mr. Schwartz is totally innocent and did nothing wrong. He will fight these false and unfair charges,"" said Roberto Finzi, partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison Llp, and attorney for Schwartz."

It added that Cognizant has been a ""long-time customer"" of L&T.
Cognizant, which has majority of its workforce based in India, last week said it would pay $25 million to the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) to settle its India bribery charges. The US Department of Justice, on the other hand, has filed criminal cases against two of its former top executives.
The two former executives have been charged for their roles in facilitating the payment of millions of dollars in bribe to an Indian government official, , the SEC had said last week.
This settlement appears to arise from an internal investigation by CTS that it first announced on 30 September, 2016, L&T said.
Cognizant had agreed to pay$ 25 million to settle charges that it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the SEC said.
The complaint alleges that in 2014, a senior Tamil Nadu official demanded a $2 million bribe from the construction firm responsible for building Cognizant's 2.7 million square foot campus in Chennai.
As alleged in the complaint, Cognizant's President Gordon Coburn and Chief Legal Officer Steven E Schwartz authorised the contractor to pay the bribe and directed their subordinates to conceal the bribe by doctoring the contractor's change orders.
The SEC also alleged that Cognizant authorised the construction firm to make two additional bribes totalling more than $1.6 million.
Cognizant allegedly used sham change order requests to conceal the payments it made to reimburse the firm, SEC had said.
The SEC charged Coburn and Schwartz with violating anti-bribery, books and records, and internal accounting controls provisions of the federal securities laws. The SEC is seeking permanent injunctions, monetary penalties, and officer-and-director bars against Coburn and Schwartz.

76,2019-02-26,Larsen,"Cognizant used a construction firm to pay bribes to secure building permits, says SECAccording to SEC, the work completion certificate to the construction company was issued by CMDA on or about 5 Nov 2014

NEW DELHI :
Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) records show Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) was contracted to build the Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. campus in Chennai, one of the three buildings at the centre of a bribery investigation in the US.
As part of the probe, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also named an Indian construction company executive as co-conspirator in the 2016 Cognizant bribery case, which the US company settled on 15 February 2019 by agreeing to pay $25 million. New Jersey-based Cognizant used the construction company in India to pay $3.64 million in bribes to secure permits to build the US firm’s three campuses in Chennai and Pune, according to the US probe.
According to CMDA records, the town planning body received an application from L&T on behalf of Cognizant for approval on 2 February 2013. Records shared by SEC’s probe show the “construction company"" submitted an application and fee on or about 7 February 2013 for the planning permit (from CMDA).
Although SEC didn’t name the construction company, new evidence from SEC’s probe bolsters the claim that India’s largest engineering company facilitated payments to local government officials at the behest of Cognizant.
“(In April 2014), the construction company advised CC# 1 (Cognizant co-conspirator 1) that it would take the necessary steps to secure and obtain the planning permit, and that it had hired a special third-party consultant to make the bribe payment,"" said the SEC document.
Over a two-year investigation, SEC found that the department head for commercial buildings at the construction company, one of the co-conspirators, worked with two Chennai-based employees of Cognizant and paid $2 million in bribes to a government official at CMDA for getting the requisite building permits for a campus, according to evidence submitted by SEC in a New Jersey district court on 18 February.
SEC did not disclose the identity of the Indian employee of the construction firm or the two former Cognizant employees, who were based in India. Mint could not immediately identify the Indian resident, who has been named as one of the co-conspirators in the case.
SEC’s attorney, Michael B. Hibbel, declined to comment. However, a person familiar with the case said SEC had not disclosed the name of the construction company in the report because the firm was not being probed, it being outside SEC’s jurisdiction.
Spokespeople for SEC and Cognizant also declined to comment.
Mint’s queries to L&T on 19 February went unanswered. However, in an earlier email to Mint, the company referred to its statement to stock exchanges. The stock exchange filing, while acknowledging that Cognizant is a long-time customer of L&T, said the company was not aware of “any evidence"" that supported L&T’s involvement in making the alleged improper payments.
“We confirm that neither we nor any of our employees are a party to the proceedings brought in the United States. We have no further comments to make on this issue,"" L&T added.
SEC’s exhibits also detail how the construction company’s work progressed while it was building Cognizant’s campus in the Knowledge Industry Township (KIT) in Chennai. That roughly corroborates evidence that L&T was involved in the project.
For example, SEC claims that Cognizant hired the construction company to develop the KIT campus in November 2011. That is the same time when L&T was hired to build the Chennai campus, a Cognizant executive said on condition of anonymity.
According to SEC, the department head for commercial buildings at the construction company, in an email to Cognizant, said L&T would not inform anyone except Cognizant’s senior management about approvals from CMDA on or about 17 May 2014. This implies L&T had got approvals by May of that year. CMDA records show that it gave the go-ahead to L&T in a letter dated 11 March 2014.
According to SEC, the work completion certificate to the construction company was issued by CMDA on or about 5 November 2014. According to CMDA records, it gave a completion certificate in a letter dated 19 February 2015 to L&T.
SEC claims its two-year investigation is based on internal Cognizant documents, including emails of former president Gordon Coburn and former chief legal officer Steven Schwartz, as well as the accounts of multiple cooperating co-conspirators.
“When SEC in its investigation believes a bribe was paid, then someone—be it regulatory authorities, the SFIO (Serious Fraud Investigation Office) or the company’s board—needs to find out who Cognizant paid a bribe to, and the full chain needs to be investigated,"" said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director at Institutional Investor Advisory Services, a proxy advisory firm."

New Delhi: Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) will ask an external expert to investigate if any illegal payments were made by any of its employees at the behest of US-based  Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Mumbai-based L&T’s decision comes 10 days after Mint reported that India’s largest engineering and construction company facilitated the payment of $3.64 million ( ₹25.7 crore today) in bribes to Indian government officials on behalf of Cognizant to secure permits, ranging from environmental clearance to power, at the US company’s campuses in Chennai and Pune between 2013 and 2015.
L&T has till now maintained that it did not have any proof of wrongdoing by any of its employees.
“During the audit committee meeting held on 27 February 2019, the management presented all details of the company’s construction contracts with CTS (Cognizant), including particulars of development relating to the recent settlement between CTS and SEC (the US Securities and Exchange Commission) and the ongoing proceedings before the department of justice, US,"" Larsen and Toubro told BSE on Thursday.
“In this connection, the company also briefed the audit committee of the management-initiated investigation conducted by leading law firms in US and India with the help of forensic experts from Hong Kong in 2017,"" read the statement.

MUMBAI :
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday flagged off the much-delayed 11.28 kilometre second phase of the Chembur-Wadala-Jacob Circle monorail network.
With this, the entire 19.54 kilometre route of the country's first monorail system, being implemented by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA), is now functional.
The 8.26 kilometre first phase, built and operated by a consortium of Larsen & Toubro and Malaysian firm Scomi Engineering, was commissioned in February, 2014.
Speaking at the event, Fadnavis said the country's first ever monorail had faced many hurdles and delays in the past but was now finally seeing the light of day.
""The first 8 km route which got commissioned in 2014 was used as a mere joyride because there was no last mile connectivity. But now, with the commissioning of the second phase, it will no longer remain a joyride but passengers can now use it for a hassle free commute,"" he said.
The CM said the monorail's annual ridership will now increase from the current 4.5 lakh to 30 lakh.
""In the process of urbanisation, the most important element that needs to be addressed is mobility. It is necessary to develop an efficient and sustainable public transport system. In Mumbai we have a strong suburban railway system, and with the projects like monorail and metro network, we will be able to develop sustainable mobility,"" he said.
The chief minister further said there was a need to integrate transport systems including railways, monorail, metro, BEST and the proposed waterways.
He said the civic-run Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport undertaking should get more electric buses in its fleet to reduce pollution.
Earlier in the day, Fadnavis inaugurated a new suburban terminus at Central Railway's Parel station.
At that event, the chief minister said expeditious work has been done by the Railways in Prime minister Narendra Modi's government.
""The  ₹750-crore Kalyan Murbad railway line has also been sanctioned. Fast development is the motto of Modi's new India. Earlier, after budget announcement, it would take 20 years for work to start, but in 4 years we have done a lot of work,"" he said.
He also said tenders for Dharavi redevelopment have got a good response.
""It is not feasible to shift 50,000 families at one go. If done in phases it will take several years. Now with railway land being made available, the redevelopment will happen in seven years,"" Fadnavis claimed.
Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, who was present at the monorail inauguration event, said his ministry has given in-principle approval for connecting all monorail stations to ones on the suburban railway network.
""We have taken this decision to connect monorail to all railway stations, subways, skywalks, to ensure end to end connectivity,"" Goyal added.
Speaking at the event, MMRDA Commissioner RA Rajeev said, ""At almost 20 kilometres, Mumbai monorail is the third largest route in the world after China with 98 kilometres and Japan with 28 kilometres. Despite several hurdles, we have managed to now finally commission the entire route.""
In December last year, MMRDA terminated the L&T-Scomi Engineering consortium's contract over non-performance and other lapses including frequent equipment breakdowns.
Further, a fire in an empty monorail coach in November, 2017 had led to the network being shut till August last year.
Since taking over the monorail's operations, MMRDA has said it has reduced daily losses from  ₹1.8 crore to  ₹1 crore.
It plans to operate 120 services with a fleet of seven 4-coach trains between 6am and 10pm daily.
The fare for the entire 17-station route, which has been built at a cost of  ₹3000 crore, has been fixed at  ₹10,  ₹20,  ₹30 and  ₹40.

Mumbai: Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), which has been in talks to buy Cafe Coffee Day founder V.G. Siddhartha’s stake in Mindtree Ltd, is set to sign a binding agreement to close the deal, two people directly aware of the development said. The deal, which is likely to be announced in the weeks ahead, could trigger a hostile takeover bid, leading to an open offer by L&T, India’s largest engineering company, to increase its stake to 51%.
The move, if successful, could see Mindtree’s current management losing control of the company. Siddhartha was one of Mindtree’s early investors and bought a 6% stake in 1999, the year it was founded. Over the years, he has increased his holding, giving an exit to existing shareholders, including Mindtree’s former chairman, Ashok Soota, who left in 2011.
While Siddhartha did not respond to an emailed query from Mint on the reasons for his Mindtree stake sale, both the people cited earlier said that Siddhartha had in several tranches pledged almost the entire holding held by him and his two affiliate firms in Mindtree to several domestic and foreign lenders to borrow close to  ₹3,000 crore—equivalent to the current value of his 20.4% stake in Mindtree.
“He (Siddhartha) is, however, behind schedule on repayments for several of these loan facilities taken by pledging shares,"" one of the two people cited earlier said, requesting anonymity. “If he is unable to regularize the accounts, it could lead to invocation of the share pledge by the lenders.""
“L&T is closely working with the lenders and Siddhartha to work out a solution and has offered a letter of comfort for a two-month moratorium on invocation of share pledges by the lenders,"" the second person cited earlier said, also requesting anonymity. “L&T is seeking a moratorium because it hopes to obtain antitrust approvals in key markets such as India, Europe and the US, where both Mindtree and L&T Infotech (a unit of L&T) are currently present.""

“Invocation of the share pledge by lenders would dampen L&T’s chances of taking control of Mindtree,"" the second person added.
On 25 February, Mint reported that private equity firm KKR and Co. was also in talks to buy Siddhartha’s stake and was backing a competing bid by Mindtree promoters, who own 13.32% in the firm and are reluctant to relinquish control.

71,2019-03-16,Larsen,"Mindtree board to consider a share buyback amid L&T’s plans to buy the 20.4% stake held by CCD founder V.G. SiddharthaThe promoters have a two-pronged plan with a singular objective: purchase Mindtree shares from Siddhartha to prevent a hostile takeover by an outsider

Mumbai: Mindtree Ltd’s board will meet on 20 March to consider a proposal to buy back its fully paid-up equity shares from the market, the information technology (IT) company said in an exchange filing on Friday. The move comes at a time when engineering conglomerate Larsen and Toubro Ltd is in advanced talks to buy out a 20.4% stake held by Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder V.G. Siddhartha, the group’s flagship Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd and its step-down subsidiary Coffee Day Trading Ltd.
If approved by the board, the move could act as a poison pill against a hostile takeover bid. It could push the potential buyer to offer a higher price to the public shareholders than that offered by Mindtree promoters for the buyback.
Mindtree promoters are in a race to retain control of the company as potential buyers eye the big chunk of shares put on the block by Siddhartha.
The promoters, who together own around 13%, have a two-pronged action plan: one, pledge their shares in exchange for money; two, raise money from a wealthy family office, according to a Mint report in January.
In both cases, the ultimate objective would be the same: purchase Mindtree shares from Siddhartha to prevent a hostile takeover by an outsider.
A purchase of more than 5% by promoters or a 25% stake by any other buyer in a listed firm triggers an open offer according to existing norms. As such, the buyer is required to make a public offer to buy at least another 26% stake.
Mindtree shares closed at  ₹946 apiece on the BSE on Friday, which means Siddhartha’s stake will cost a buyer at least  ₹3,200 crore. A purchase of an additional 26% from other shareholders in an open offer will cost more than  ₹4,200 crore.
“The pledge of promoters’ 13% stake could fetch around  ₹1,000 crore and the rest  ₹3,000-3,200 crore will come from the family office,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the plans of Mindtree.
Mindtree’s move has been prompted by Siddhartha’s decision to sell off the stake held by him and the two CCD affiliate firms. As Siddhartha is the largest shareholder in Mindtree, his decision to exit the firm has motivated several large buyout funds and other companies to make a takeover bid through an open offer by buying Siddhartha’s stake and 5% more from other shareholders.
L&T’s plan is to buy an additional 5% stake either through an open offer or directly from the promoters of Mindtree, primarily with the objective of creating an IT consulting and services giant through a merger of Mindtree, L&T Infotech Ltd, and L&T Engineering Services Ltd."

MUMBAI :
Mumbai: Larsen and Toubro Ltd. (L&T) is likely to buy the 20.4% stake held by Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder V.G. Siddhartha along with his two Café Coffee Day affiliate firms in Mindtree Ltd, followed by an open offer to buy an additional 31% stake in the company as early as Monday evening, according to people familiar with the development.
L&T has agreed to pay  ₹981 per share to buy the entire stake held by Siddhartha and two of his CCD firms, thereby valuing Mindtree at  ₹16,250 crore, a person directly aware of the development said.
“L&T will buy the 20.4% stake and will announce an open offer to buy up to 51% in Mindtree on Monday evening,"" said the first executive, on the condition of anonymity.
Typically, an acquirer company is required to make an open offer to gain control of a listed firm only after acquiring 25% in the latter. However, in this case, L&T is set to use a section of the takeover code stipulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), rarely employed to take over a listed firm, thereby making it the first hostile takeover ever in the information technology (IT) outsourcing space.
“Using section 3, clause 1 of the takeover code, along with section 4 of the code, L&T is entitled to announce an open offer to acquire control of Mindtree,"" said the executive cited above.
According to Sebi’s takeover rules, an acquirer can launch an open offer to gain control of a listed firm only it makes a public announcement to acquire more than 25% stake and voting rights in the listed firm eventually.
This section of the takeover law is rarely used. Typically, an acquirer first buys 25% in the listed company to trigger a mandatory open offer to take control of a listed firm.
KPMG’s corporate finance team is handling the mandate for the entire deal and Axis Capital and Citigroup Global Markets are running the mandate for the open offer as bankers.
Late on Sunday night, Mindtree co-founder and board member Subroto Bagchi said he had quit as chairman of the Odisha Skill Development Agency to help Mindtree steer through the current takeover threat. ""An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the Government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall,"" Bagchi tweeted.
L&T’s decision to take over Mindtree comes close on the heels of the Mindtree board's announcement that it will meet on 20 March to consider a proposal to buy back its fully paid-up equity shares from the market to fend off a hostile takeover.
According to current norms, the promoters can buy back 10% of the company’s (Mindtree) reserves for a buyback.
Mindtree has around  ₹2,800 crore in reserves, implying the company can use around  ₹280 crore for the buyback of the company’s shares and then use a further  ₹700 crore from the reserves for another 25% stake to retain control. But, if another entity makes an offer, the promoters cannot even use 10% of the reserves for the buyback to regain control.
They need to find an investor offering a higher price to counter the offer and in this case there is no one offering a price higher than L&T. ""So the promoters do not have any option but to leave it to shareholders to decide on change of control,"" said the executive quoted above. L&T could be a better controller of Mindtree than the existing promoters in terms of corporate governance since L&T is not driven by a single founder-promoter group unlike Mindtree, he added.
On Saturday, Mint reported that the announcement of a buyback could push the potential buyer to offer a higher price to public shareholders than that offered by Mindtree promoters for the buyback.
“L&T will first buy the 20.4% stake and make an announcement for an open offer to take control of Mindtree eventually, using section 3 and section 4 of Sebi’s takeover rules. Eventually, L&T will have at least 51% in Mindtree. There is no moratorium involved in the deal. It is straight and within takeover norms,"" said the executive cited above.
Mindtree shares closed at  ₹946 apiece on the BSE on Friday, which means Siddhartha’s stake will cost a buyer at least  ₹3,200 crore.

Mumbai: Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) on Monday agreed to buy Cafe Coffee Day founder V.G. Siddhartha’s stake in Mindtree Ltd for  ₹3,269 crore, setting the stage for a showdown with the Bengaluru-based company’s controlling shareholders, who are preparing a defence against the hostile takeover.
L&T has agreed to pay  ₹980 per share for the 20.32% stake held by Siddhartha and his two affiliate companies, the Mumbai-based engineering company said in a filing to stock exchanges. The purchase price is a 1.8% premium to Mindtree’s closing share price on Monday.
L&T said it would buy an additional 15% in Mindtree from the open market at  ₹980 per share, adding it had already placed an order with its broker. If L&T is successful in purchasing the stake, it will trigger an open offer, since takeover norms mandate that the acquirer should offer to purchase shares from the public once its stake crosses 25% in a listed firm.
“The aforementioned market order for share purchase and with the intent to acquire majority stake in Mindtree, L&T has announced an open offer as per Sebi takeover regulations to the public shareholders of Mindtree to purchase up to an additional 31% of the outstanding shares of Mindtree at a price of  ₹980 per share in cash,"" L&T said in the exchange filing, adding that Mindtree would continue to remain an independent listed entity following the acquisition.
On Monday, Mint first reported that L&T was set to buy Siddhartha’s entire stake and would attempt to buy an additional 31% to take over Mindtree.
Developments around the Mindtree acquisition occurred in quick progression since last Tuesday when the board of L&T cleared a proposal to acquire Siddhartha’s stake and take over Mindtree. In response, the Mindtree board said on Friday that it would meet on 20 March to consider a buyback of all paid-up equity shares of the company to fend off a hostile takeover by L&T.
On Sunday, Mindtree co-founder and board member Subroto Bagchi rushed back to “save"" his company from a hostile bid. He said he had quit his government job as chairman of Odisha Skill Development Agency to help counter the takeover threat.
“An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me resign from the government to be able to go, save the company,"" Bagchi tweeted. “I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers and saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall.""
Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return
L&T is about to take advantage of a rarely used clause of Sebi's takeover code in order to acquire Mindtree. Even without buying 25% in Mindtree, L&T will launch an open offer to acquire control of the information technology firm. “Using Section 3, Clause 1 of the takeover code, along with Section 4 of the code, L&T is entitled to announce an open offer to acquire control of Mindtree,"" a person directly aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
KPMG’s corporate finance team handled the mandate for L&T’s purchase of Siddhartha’s stake.
Axis Capital and Citigroup Global Markets will manage L&T’s open offer.
Rajesh Begur, founder and managing partner at ARA LAW said that given the actions of the promoters of Mindtree for initiating a buyback of shares, it is a forgone conclusion that a friendly takeover may not happen at this stage.
“If all parties are intending to a friendly takeover, then the promoters can agree to the same, whereby the promoters continue to hold their stake in the company and the promoters agree on a divestment plan on a better valuation with L&T. Further, the executive promoters can continue to be in their role for the next 2-5 years and thereafter have an orderly transition of the company. If L&T can achieve this and ensure that the cultural line of Mindtree is kept distinct from L&T’s culture, then it is a win-win situation for all and this can become a friendly takeover,"" said Begur."

New Delhi: Mindtree promoters said they would unconditionally oppose the attempted hostile takeover bid by Larsen and Toubro (L&T), and dubbed it a grave threat to the organisation.
""A hostile takeover by Larsen and Toubro, unprecedented in our industry, could undo all of the progress we’ve made and immensely set our organisation back,"" the promoters said in a statement on Tuesday.

""We have not thought about integrating Mindtree with us (L&T Infotech). For the time being, it will be run as an independent entity,"" L&T managing director and chief executive S.N. Subrahmanyan said on Tuesday.
Subrahmanyan invoked parallels with Bollywood dramas, saying with 'dil and pyaar' (heart and love) it will be able to win over everybody.
Describing the deal as a meeting of two like-minded people, Subrahmanyan said V.G. Siddharth, whose 20.3% stake the company bought out at  ₹980 a share, had approached them three months back for buying him out.
""It was a meeting of minds between us and Siddharth,"" Subrahmanyan said, adding, the Cafe Coffee Day owner wanted to house his shareholding with a group where he saw the same governance values and ethics.
""The senior management at Mindtree are good friends with us and are people of repute and we see a lot of positivity in going ahead with the deal,"" he said.
He also reassured employees that L&T is a 80-year-old company with strong governance values.
""Mindtree will be run as an independent company, L&T will provide board oversight. We hope better sense and rationality will prevail,"" Subrahmanyan said.
L&T group chief financial officer R. Shanker Raman said there was a relative upside to Mindtree and that's what made them buy the company. Both companies (L&T Infotech and Mindtree) were $1 billion each and had enough opportunity to grow respectively, he added.

65,2019-03-19,Larsen,"Aggressive bids to acquire Indian companies have been few and far between. L&T’s attempt to take Mindtree over, however, could shake things up in Corporate India for the better

It is a bit unfortunate that Larsen & Toubro Ltd’s bid for a relatively well-run company like Mindtree Ltd, a software firm that has rewarded its shareholders well over the past 10 years, has come to revive lost interest in the business of hostile takeovers in India. Given the poor track record of many Indian promoters and the consistently poor returns they have been giving their shareholders, India needs more such buyouts, though it obviously helps if they are congenial. Over the last 20 years, the compound annual growth rate of the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty has been only 13.4%. Lurking in the list of companies that compose this index are laggards that have made lousy use of scarce capital, not to speak of other publicly listed duds. The threat posed by a barbarian at the gates is often well deserved; it serves lazy bosses a warning to either shape up or ship out. What holds good for acquisitions in general applies to hostile ones as well. Successful takeovers result in better use of an acquired company’s resources, higher profitability and enhanced returns for shareholders. To the extent that a shift in command infuses a firm with new ideas, generates dynamism and ups efficiency, it is to be welcomed.
The West woke up to the excitement of hostile takeovers in the 1980s, after the leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by investment bank KKR. In India, however, the idea has taken a long time gaining approval. In the pre-liberalization era, government policy rendered hostile takeovers well nigh impossible. The government’s role has since been reduced to ensuring adherence to India’s Takeover Code, but unsolicited buyout bids remain few and far between. This is partly because most Indian companies are closely held by promoters, so acquiring control is difficult and minority shareholders stay largely passive. In most family-run Indian companies (and that’s over two-thirds of all businesses), for example, the family retains a controlling stake. Moreover, many provisions of the Takeover Code work in support of existing owners. This being so, would-be acquirers prefer to negotiate win-win deals with those in charge of their target companies rather than threaten them by going directly to their shareholders. With ownership dispersal, however, that could change.
The dim view taken by some citizens of corporate aggression has also gone against forced shifts . They got off to a bad start in the 1980s, when Rajan Nanda of Escorts Ltd and Bharat Ram of DCM appealed to nationalistic sentiment to ward off the London-based businessman Swraj Paul’s designs on their respective companies. While Paul was thwarted with a little help from the government of the day, the affair seemed to have cast a voodoo spell on hostile takeovers in the country, with only half a dozen such instances in the last 25 years. In most of these cases, notably the 1998 acquisition of Raasi Cements by India Cements or the failed takeover of IVRCL by the Essel Group in 2012, the absence of a dreaded “outsider"" made matters easier. A true test, however, would be upon us if and when a large multi-national or a non-resident Indian were to make a predatory advance on a big homegrown company with wide ownership that’s considered almost genetically swadesi(several examples come to mind). For now, if L&T does get to acquire Mindtree, it might kickstart an activity that could shake Corporate India up—for the better."
63,2019-03-20,Larsen,"L&T CEO S.N. Subrahmanyan and CFO R. Shankar Raman on the rationale behind buying V.G. Siddhartha's stake in MindtreeThe L&T-Mindtree deal is not a hostile takeover, they say, but one done with heart and love

Mumbai: A day after revealing their plans to pick up a significant stake in Mindtree Ltd, Larsen and Toubro’s (L&T's) managing director and chief executive officer S.N. Subrahmanyan and wholetime director and chief financial officer R. Shankar Raman, in an interview with Mint, explained their rationale behind buying V.G. Siddhartha’s stake in Mindtree, and why it was not a hostile takeover. Edited excerpts:
You say the Mindtree deal is not a hostile takeover. Why so?
Subrahmanyan: A mutual friend introduced me to Mr Siddhartha (of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd). He wanted to meet me, I said most welcome, and we had a cup of tea. During the course of our conversation, he told me he owns 20% of Mindtree. I wasn’t even aware of this at the time. I said, great, but so what. And, he said, he would like us to buy it.
Of course, we wanted to grow our services business, but we had not been thinking about it (proactively). (But), he kept meeting me to persuade me. He used to fly in from Bengaluru to meet me in Mumbai and Chennai. I was not very sure about our ability to take such a decision. We haven’t done this before, of taking this to the board and the chairman. But the fundamentals looked good. We did not have any other plans in mind because the recent (share) buyback offer did not go through Sebi. We did our strategic planning, ideas came, but there was no major investment. This was a good idea and looked value accretive to me.
Siddhartha told me that for 19 years, he was involved in the company, (and) he was emotional about it. He wanted it housed in a company with good governance, in a safe place with good ethics and values and good management. “And therefore I would like to give it to you. You tell me the price."" We analysed it, then convinced the chairman and the board, and we decided to go forward.
We met with the management of Mindtree, and told them that we were not on this deal, but it was their shareholder who had come to us. If we don’t buy it, some third party will come and you have no background on them. 
Siddhartha seemed keen to sell. If I said no, I don’t know what is going to happen. If I said yes, you know who the friendly party is. We have no intention to destabilize (Mindtree), we told them please continue with the same chairman and management. You can continue running Mindtree independently; that is how all L&T companies are run. We will give some oversight in the board with our experience, we have huge client connects and leverage, and we will bring it to Mindtree. If we are there, nobody will touch you.
We tried to convince them (Mindtree promoters), they were convinced at the meeting. Then we hear in the media what you have written about. At the meetings, they were positive with us, (we had a) good Chinese dinner, the meeting went up to 3-4 hours, we parted as friends. Krishnakumar (Natarajan, executive chairman, Mindtree) came for my son’s wedding. I spoke to him today morning to tell them that we had signed the agreement with Siddhartha. Whatever we do, hum dil aur pyaar se karte hain (we do it with heart and love).
Which part of the process are you at?
Subrahmanyan: There is a regulatory process, wherein we have to get approvals from agencies in Germany and the US, and from the Competition Commission of India. In our opinion, this should not be a problem. Having said that, let’s wait for the CCI approval. As the rules require, we have to make an open offer and buy from the market. Our intention is to acquire a reasonable shareholding. The way L&T runs, we are passionate and involved, and committed to the business. We don’t do it with just a 20% shareholding. We want to create value for shareholders. We will be a very positive force for them.
Is it true that the Mindtree management wrote to you and asked you not to go ahead with this transaction?
Subrahmanyan: No. They didn’t say that. They said: “You’re making this investment. Please think through it and do it."" We thought through it, and we have done it.
What could be the reason for them to have come out so strongly against you?
Subrahmanyan: You will have to ask them. We had 2-3 dinners with them and they went very well. We had a very cordial relationship. Mujhe kissi ke saath dushmani ya hostility nahi hain (I do not have animosity or hostility towards anyone).
Do you foresee problems in getting to the 67% shareholding that you are aiming for through the open offer?
Raman: The construct we have laid out leads to 67%. We’re not saying that it will be 67%. It could be anywhere between 20.32%, which is sealed and done, and 67%. We have to wait and see what the response is. (All) we’re saying is that through the open offer, we are looking to acquire 31%, and the response can be anywhere from 0-31%. It is not that if we don’t reach 67% we have lost the game.
We don’t think 20% enables us to effectively contribute. We should at least have 26% to effectively contribute, then we become a significant influencer in the event.
What sort of board representation will you seek?
Raman: This is hypothetical. With a 13% promoter holding, they have four directors on the board. If I go by the arithmetic, I should have six, but that’s not practical.
Consistently, we've been saying that in our group companies, we believe in empowered leadership and the quality of board representation is more important than quantity. We need to wait first for the dust to settle.
We signed the agreement last night and not even 24 hours have passed. It’s not the appropriate time to start thinking of this.
We want to stay and contribute to the growth of the enterprise.
Are you speaking to institutional investors of Mindtree to get their backing?
Raman: They will be speaking to us. They will have to make a call on whether they will participate in the open offer, in which case they have to reach out and say what are your plans. And based on those plans they will decide if they will stay on board, exit or participate in the open offer. In this case, very strangely, the equity holder approached us. So, the rest of the financial sector will also approach us. Our job is to maintain cool and calm and be focused on what we need to do for the well-being of the institutions.
Do L&T shareholders believe you have overpaid for Mindtree in this transaction?
Raman: We haven’t overpaid. If you take the last one year of volume-adjusted weighted average price, it comes to  ₹934. According to Sebi rules, it’s either that or the negotiated price. We think it’s appropriate to pay a 4-5% premium to this. 
Nobody has come back to me since the (L&T-Mindtree) deal was announced saying that you have overpaid. All our investors were interested in how do you want to take this forward. They went back feeling assured that we won’t joining this cacophony in the market, we will stay calm. They wanted to know how the value accretion will happen.
If Mindtree’s net profit to revenue is 15%, and that’s demonstrated in our other IT businesses, then the value pays for itself.
Are you talking to Mindtree’s independent directors?
Subrahmanyan: Courtesy demands that we speak to them.
Raman: And under regulations, independent directors have to recommend to shareholders, and my guess is, that obligation will also force them to talk to us. How do they decide, on what basis, how will they recommend. They can’t duck the issue, unless they resign and it will be even more embarrassing if they resign.
How long do you plan to keep Mindtree separate from L&T Infotech?
Subrahmanyan: I can’t speculate on that. It is an active management. We have to do what is good for the business from a shareholder’s point of view. As we see it, running independently Mindtree has done tremendously well. And that’s the formula also within L&T. There is no reason to change it this now.
Once both of them acquire scale and joining together makes sense, we will look at it that time. L&T is not dictatorial. We have to bring in consensus. If there is no consensus, then we won’t do it.
Is the  ₹980 price for the open offer fixed?
Raman: That is the contract we have signed (with Siddhartha), that is the price we have given for the open offer and the price we have given to our brokers. That’s frozen. Now, the only way it will change is if there is a competing offer and there is pressure on us. But it is not so easy to cut a cheque for this size of a commitment.
Did you get time to do due diligence on the asset?
Raman: This is a process that does not involve due diligence. If we merge two companies and there is shareholder approval, then we appoint a legal firm and accounting firm and do detailed due diligence. Here we are buying from the exiting shareholder. But since we play in the arena, we have a fair understanding (of the company) and sufficient amount of data is publicly available. We have also engaged professionals to ensure there are no apparent skeletons.
Mindtree said there are concerns with clients in a hostile takeover. Are you speaking to their clients?
Subrahmanyan: Microsoft (Mindtree’s biggest client) knows us well; they have been with L&T for the last 20-25 years. The entire management of Microsoft is well known to me."
62,2019-03-20,Larsen,"Larsen and Toubro's (L&T's) hostile takeover provides a nice exit window for Mindtree investors at  ₹980/shareThe worry is for L&T investors, since the engineering conglomerate is increasing exposure to non-core businesses

""Be assured that the Barbarians are out there just beyond the gate, licking their wounds, biding their time, waiting for their next chance to storm the gates,"" wrote Bryan Burrough and John Helyar in their classic book Barbarians at the Gate. 
It is well over 30 years since the events in the book took place, when private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) acquired RJR Nabisco for $25 billion. But for company boards, especially those with low promoter shareholding, the lurking danger of a hostile takeover remains.
Mindtree Ltd’s founders and management had thought they had fended off Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), when the latter tried talking them into a friendly merger and acquisition deal. But L&T is back and how. It has set aside  ₹10,700 crore to buy up to 67% in Mindtree in a hostile takeover. At  ₹980 per share, it is also paying top dollar for the acquisition.
In fact, L&T’s entry provides a nice exit opportunity for Mindtree shareholders, with valuations at the top end among Midcap IT stocks (see chart). If anything, the worry is for L&T shareholders, since the engineering and construction (E&C) conglomerate is increasing exposure to non-core businesses. A conglomerate with multiple arms is typically valued at a discount by investors. It is also taking a fair amount of risk related to integration of Mindtree, without the support of the latter’s founders.
The company’s decision to use its cash for an acquisition in a non-core business raises pertinent questions about capital allocation as well, say analysts. “We believe it will not be in line with L&T’s core focus of listing (cashing on) non-core businesses and enhancing shareholder value,"" says a report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.
Indeed, just a few months ago, L&T had plans to return cash to shareholders through a  ₹9,000-crore share buyback. The plan was oddly blocked by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), on the grounds that L&T’s debt-equity position doesn’t allow a reduction in its equity. But high leverage isn’t really L&T’s problem. Its net debt-equity ratio could rise marginally from 1.3 times to 1.5 times after the Mindtree deal, adds the Jefferies report.
As pointed out earlier, the larger worry is that of capital allocation. Shareholders would rather have the company return cash in some form, than be adventurous with its use. The Mindtree acquisition is fraught with risks.
According to analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, some of Mindtree’s top clients have had long-standing relationships with the company and its founding leaders have been the face of these. “The top 10 clients contribute about 44% to revenues. The risk to growth and/or relationships in one or multiple accounts cannot be completely ruled out,"" they said in a note. Also, as pointed out earlier in this column, integration risks are high in businesses where people are the biggest assets.
If L&T can pull it off, it stands to gain from higher scale in some key verticals, which will give access to some clients and projects, which subsidiary, L&T Infotech Ltd, couldn’t target on its own.
“We think the combined entity will be in a sweet spot with scale in almost all major verticals, barring healthcare,"" analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients.
L&T is also banking on the de-risking narrative to soothe its shareholders’ nerves.
According to R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer at L&T, “A strong presence in IT will de-risk the E&C business, where margins are low and projects are long-drawn. While financial services business is counter-cyclical to E&C, the IT services business brings in relatively stable cash flows.""
The 1.5% drop in L&T shares on Tuesday shows investors are not particularly worried about the acquisition, but aren’t very convinced with Raman’s reasoning either. They would have clearly preferred an outcome where their company didn’t storm the gates, but waited to be asked in."
70,2019-03-20,Larsen,"Larsen & Toubro Ltd’s (L&T's) reported plan to buy a large stake in Mindtree has led to a fall in the value of its software services armL&T Infotech investors’ worries aren’t limited to those of a typical M&A transaction

A mergers and acquisitions (M&A) transaction typically boosts the shares of the target company and weighs down the shares of the acquirer. It’s no different in the case of mid-sized IT company Mindtree Ltd, and one of its potential acquirers.
Larsen & Toubro Ltd’s (L&T) reported plan to buy a large stake in Mindtree has led to a fall in the value of its software services arm, Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd. The IT subsidiary’s valuation has fallen nearly 11% since mid-January, on fears that a possible combination can be a drag on its performance. Reports of L&T’s interest had emerged first in mid-January. Mindtree shares, meanwhile, have risen about 7% in the same period, adding to the gains since October last year.
L&T Infotech  investors’ worries aren’t limited to those of a typical M&A transaction. Reports suggest L&T is attempting a hostile takeover, since Mindtree’s promoters are trying their best to stall the deal. On Friday, Mindtree said its board will consider a buyback of shares, a move that is known to be used to thwart hostile takeover attempts.
A hostile takeover in an industry such as software services, where people are the biggest assets, can backfire. “We are not aware of any precedent where there has been a hostile takeover in the IT services business. This is primarily because this is a business of relationships and execution by people,"" analysts at Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients.
Moreover, the success rates in the case of acquisitions that are greater than 50% of the acquirer’s size is likely very low, they add. Mindtree’s annualised Q3FY19 revenues stood at a little over a billion dollars, or 72.5% the size of L&T Infotech.
Even if Mindtree’s promoters somehow agree to strike a deal, the cultural differences between the two companies can create hurdles going ahead, warn some analysts. “L&T Infotech comes from a group that is predominantly in the manufacturing business, while Mindtree is a services firm from the ground up; shall the twain ever meet?"" said an analyst who preferred anonymity.
If, however, they do find a meeting point, there will be benefits of scale. The combined entity’s annual revenues will be nearly $2.4 billion. Dependence on large clients will reduce and services offerings will expand. And as the chart alongside shows, the combine’s banking, financial services and insurance vertical will reach a size of $870 million, not far from the crucial $1 billion mark that helps open doors to large customers. What’s more, cost synergies from sales and general administration can result in meaningful savings as well, say analysts at Investec Capital.
But none of this counts for much if Mindtree isn’t going to play the game. The best bet will be a deal that has a buy-in from the target company as well."
64,2019-03-20,Larsen,"Mindtree founders in Bengaluru claim support of large investors, implying stiff opposition to L&T's hostile takeover bidMeanwhile in Mumbai, Larsen and Toubro has two immediate goals: raise its stake to 26% and get a representative on Mindtree’s board

New Delhi/Mumbai/Bengaluru: India’s first hostile takeover in the IT industry may yet see a few more twists and turns, with Mindtree Ltd’s founders claiming the support of large institutional investors, which between them hold 20.25%, implying that shareholders with 33.52% of voting rights are opposed to Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T's) hostile takeover bid.
The embattled founders of the Bengaluru-based software company, who together own 13.32% in Mindtree, have the support of Singapore-based Arohi Asset Management Pte Ltd, Nalanda Capital and UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd, one of the 10 co-founders of Mindtree said, requesting anonymity.
Meanwhile in Mumbai, L&T has two immediate goals: raise its stake to 26% and get a representative on Mindtree’s board.
Mindtree promoters are engaged in a battle to retain control over their company after L&T on Monday night agreed to buy V.G. Siddhartha's and his two affiliate companies’ 20.32% stake for  ₹3,269 crore at  ₹980 a share.
“We are in touch with all our large investors. Many of them have given unequivocal support and said we can count on them,"" Rostow Ravanan, chief executive officer of Mindtree, told investors in a conference call on Tuesday.
“There could be some false rumours like Nalanda or Arohi exiting. They have categorically said they have got great returns under the current management and they will back us to the core,"" executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan told analysts.
The L&T management, which seemed to hold all the aces, also appeared more circumspect on Tuesday. “We don’t think 20% shareholding enables us to effectively contribute to Mindtree,"" R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer of L&T, said in an interview on Tuesday. “We should at least have 26% to effectively contribute and then we become a significant influencer in the event.""
A 26% shareholding gives L&T the ability to block special resolutions and triggers a mandatory open offer.
With that objective, L&T will also make open market purchases of up to 15% of Mindtree’s share capital. Once they reach 26% shareholding, L&T will make an open offer, triggered by the Sebi takeover code, to acquire another 31% shareholding at  ₹980 a share. At this share price, the cost of the hostile takeover is  ₹10,733 crore. The acquisition will be fully funded from L&T’s internal resources.
“Mindtree will be run as an independent company and will be given headroom to reach its full potential, while L&T will provide board oversight and they can benefit from L&T connects,"" said S.N. Subrahmanyan, MD and CEO of L&T.
On Wednesday, Mindtree’s board is scheduled to consider a share buyback, a move that could push up the acquisition cost for L&T.
The Mindtree co-founder cited earlier said 39% of existing shareholders had rebuffed the current offer of  ₹980 a share, but he did not have the permission to name some of them. This includes support from Akash Prakash-led Amansa Holdings, which owns 2.77% and UTI Mutual Fund, which holds 2.9%.
The strong opposition by the founders might make L&T’s aim to acquire Mindtree tougher, analysts said.
“We believe the transaction initiated by Larsen and Toubro to acquire a majority stake in Mindtree is unlikely to conclude quickly given the strong opposition of incumbent promoter/management group,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a 19 March note to investors.

Emails sent to Arohi, Nalanda, UTI Mutual Fund and Amansa went unanswered.
“My support is completely with the founders,"" said S. Janakiraman, one of the co-founders, and whose 1.51% stake is not classified as part of promoter shareholding.
On the possibility of L&T raising the current offer price to entice institutional investors, Natarajan said: “We have thought through various options…we are well prepared. Nothing is going to catch us by surprise.""
On Tuesday, L&T and Mindtree shares fell 1.6% and 2.03% to  ₹1356.75 and  ₹943.00 apiece, respectively, on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.70% to end the day at 38,363.47 points."
60,2019-03-21,Larsen,"Mindtree has an informal work culture: many of its employees call members of the founding team by their first namesIn contrast, Larsen and Toubro's (L&T) work culture is based on command-and-control and top-down management

New Delhi: As engineering conglomerate Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) courses on with its hostile takeover bid for Mindtree Ltd, the first and biggest fear expressed by many analysts and industry executives isn’t about fact sheets—it’s about the fitment between two culturally diverse companies. The success of any merger or acquisition (M&A deal) depends on a diverse range of synergies. And cultural fitment is especially true of people-led businesses such as IT outsourcing.
It’s a bit like horse-power versus brain-power, in the words of one industry observer.
Mindtree has an informal culture: many of its employees call members of the founding team, led by chief executive officer Rostow Ravanan, by their first names.
In contrast, L&T, India’s largest engineering and construction company’s culture is based on command-and-control and top-down management.
Mindtree’s 20,000 employees face an uncertain future—it’s not known how long L&T will let Mindtree run as an independent entity. Further, it is not clear if Mindtree will be merged completely with L&T Infotech Ltd or whether some of Mindtree’s business will be carved and farmed off to Larsen and Toubro Technology Services Ltd, L&T’s second listed IT firm.
“Managing people aspects and cultural integration is critical in any acquisition. It is common in acquisitions to meet the key leaders of the acquisition candidate to get an understanding of the leadership depth, critical resources and strategies of talent retention. We are not sure if this is possible in this case,"" Kawaljeet Saluja and Jaykumar Doshi, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities, wrote in an 18 March note to investors.
“Mindtree has possibly the highest exposure to discretionary spending. Project cycles have relatively short durations, requiring high touch with clients to back-fill completed projects and win new ones for overall growth. Hence, people continuity becomes even more important.""
Two decades after Infosys Ltd put India on the global IT outsourcing map, no Indian conglomerate or manufacturing firm has been able to build a strong software services business—save for Tata Sons Ltd which has Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
RPG Group, CK Birla Group and ITC Ltd have struggled to scale their IT businesses—Zensar Ltd, Birlasoft Ltd and ITC Infotech, respectively—although all of them were set up back in the 1990s. Tech Mahindra Ltd, which started in 1986, acquired Satyam Computers in 2009, to become a $2.5 billion company. A decade later, the company’s annual revenue is still less than $5 billion, underscoring its struggles. In comparison, TCS reported more than $5 billion revenue in the December quarter alone.
In common with manufacturing companies, L&T too faced this challenge, until its current non-executive chairman A.M. Naik hired former Infosys executive Sanjay Jalona in 2015 to run L&T Infotech. An executive at L&T Infotech said this was arguably Naik’s best contribution to the conglomerate's IT firm that was set up in 1997.
Jalona, who is based out of New Jersey, has put together a senior management team that has helped the company significantly scale up business: L&T Infotech’s revenue increased from $209 million in the June 2017 quarter to $346.9 million during October-December 2018.
“Sanjay can certainly lead this integration well. But he is not even on the board of L&T, and it remains to be seen if L&T will let him oversee this integration,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, requesting anonymity.
The second risk is the nature of the acquisition: hostile.
This forced acquisition will certainly see the four founders of Mindtree leave. This could lead to a churn among senior management ranks and may even lead to a few exits of executives overseeing large client accounts, according to two Mindtree employees.
This could eventually hurt Mindtree’s clients, many of which contrast with customers of L&T Infotech. Mindtree’s largest clients include Microsoft Corp., Southwest Airlines Co., Marriott Hotels Ltd, and Procter and Gamble Co.
Much of the work is consultation-led and involves offering solutions in technology areas like data analytics and cloud computing. Companies in the hi-tech space accounted for a fourth of Mindtree’s revenue in the December quarter. L&T could possibly be tempted to split some of this business and put it with L&T Technology Services, which ended last year with $580.4 million revenue.
L&T Infotech gets about a fourth of its total business from four clients comprising three banks—Citibank Inc., Barclays Inc. and Nordea AB—and oil giant Chevron Corp. L&T Infotech also counts General Electric Co., the embattled conglomerate, as one of its larger customers. Nearly a third of business is handled by engineers who roll out business software such as SAP and Oracle. Mindtree’s dependence on Microsoft, which made up a fifth of company’s revenue in the third quarter, has also been cited as a concern.
L&T Infotech too gets more than 13% of its business from Citi, and ten of its largest customers accounted for half of its revenue in the last quarter. At Mindtree, the ten largest clients accounted for 44% of total business."
61,2019-03-21,Larsen,"Mindtree says its board considered a share buyback proposal but decided to discuss it at a future dateLarsen and Toubro (L&T) made a hostile takeover bid to buy up to 66% stake in Mindtree for around  ₹10,800 crore

New Delhi: Mindtree Ltd’s board meeting on Wednesday ended with the company’s eight directors failing to decide on whether to buy back the company’s shares to fend off a hostile takeover bid by Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). A share buyback by the software services company could potentially push up the acquisition cost for L&T, which had earlier this week bought 20.32% stake in Mindtree from V.G. Siddhartha and two of his affiliate companies for  ₹3,269 crore. L&T is looking to acquire more shares with the aim of gaining control of Mindtree.
“The board considered the proposed buyback of equity shares of the company at its meeting held on 20 March… Following detailed discussions, the meeting has been adjourned to a future date. No decision has been taken in relation to the proposed buyback of equity shares,"" Mindtree said in a statement sent to stock exchanges on Wednesday.
Proxy advisers InGovern Research and Institutional Investor Advisory Services have questioned the Mindtree share buyback proposal. “Under Section 26 of Sebi takeover code, subsequent to a public announcement of an open offer, a company cannot undertake any capital structure change, including buyback of shares,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research.

On Monday, L&T said it would make open market purchases of up to 15% of Mindtree’s share capital and later offer to buy an additional 31% stake at  ₹980 apiece through an open offer.
For now, Mindtree’s founders claim that they have the support of large institutional investors, which hold a combined 20.2%, implying that shareholders with 33.52% of voting rights, including the promoters’ 13.32% stake, are opposed to L&T’s takeover bid at the current price."
59,2019-03-24,Larsen,"Coffee Day shares have fallen 7% despite the Mindtree stake sale to L&T coming at a better-than-expected valuationA good outcome of the deal with L&T will be if the Mindtree stake sale is a stepping stone towards Coffee Day's restructuring

Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd’s shares should have got a boost after the company said it will sell its stake in Mindtree Ltd. But that hasn’t been the case. The stock has fallen 7% since the deal was announced on 18 March after market hours. This is despite the fact that the deal has come in at a better-than-expected valuation.
Coffee Day will receive a consideration of up to  ₹2,749 crore for selling its stake in Mindtree to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). It’s not clear what the tax implications of the stake sale will be, although it’s clear that realized valuations are far higher than what analysts were factoring in Coffee Day's sum-of-the-parts valuation (see chart above).
“The stock’s lukewarm response to the deal announced could also be because people want to understand the strategy CDEL will adopt to split the business into coffee and non-coffee segments,"" said Jigar Shah, CEO of Maybank Kim Eng Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
From an investor’s perspective, a good outcome will be if the Mindtree stake sale is one of the stepping stones that will assist Coffee Day's restructuring plan, which includes separating the coffee business. The company can also use these funds to pare down its debt. In its December quarter earnings conference call, Coffee Day said consolidated net debt stood at  ₹3,750 crore and holding firm debt was  ₹975 crore. The company had also said it will use the Mindtree stake sale proceeds to bring the holding firm debt to zero.
Accordingly, Coffee Day investors can expect some relief on the interest costs front. On a consolidated basis, for the nine months ended December (9MFY19), finance costs as a percentage of Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) was a whopping 69%.
The company can be expected to use the remaining funds for expansion, especially in the coffee retailing business. As on December, Coffee Day had 1,751 outlets, spread across 243 cities in India. The coffee retailing business is on a good wicket with same-store sales growth for 9MFY19 at about 11%. During this time, average sales per day increased by 3%. But investors aren’t giving it brownie points yet. The stock has underperformed the Nifty 500 index so far in FY19.
“We believe Coffee Day’s sharp valuation differential with other listed quick service restaurant companies will narrow once it removes the conglomerate structure,"" pointed out a note from Maybank on 25 February. Needless to say, developments on restructuring will be crucial from an investor’s point of view."

New Delhi: Mindtree Ltd’s chief executive officer, Rostow Ravanan, denied that some of the company’s independent directors had asked the board to consider Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T) hostile takeover bid. The current leadership, Ravanan said, had the complete backing of the board.
“The board as a whole has unequivocally and in an emphatic way endorsed the vision and strategy of the leadership for Mindtree,"" Ravanan said in an interview on Friday. “Independent directors do not have to assess the competency or readiness of the founders. Independent directors have a legal responsibility to comment on the open offer price. That they will do at the appropriate time.""
With Mindtree’s founders, who together own just 13.32% of the company, opposed to L&T’s takeover bid, some proxy advisers, including Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), said the company’s independent directors could give a dispassionate opinion on the transaction.
“Investors may not be in a position to understand all the nuances of the decision. Therefore, IiAS believes the independent directors of Mindtree must provide guidance to the company’s shareholders on whether shareholders should take up L&T’s open offer. It is not necessary that Mindtree’s independent directors toe the line of the company’s promoters: they may have a different view,"" IiAS said in a note to investors on 19 March.
Ravanan said MindTree’s independent directors would do whatever the law required of them.

“What I’m given to understand is that the acquirer (L&T) has to make additional information available to the general public, which is called detailed public statement. When the open offer opens is when the independent directors need to make their determination to shareholders on whether in their opinion the open offer price is fair or not as per the legal requirements. So the timing is quite a long way away,"" he said.

Mindtree’s eight-member board has four independent directors—Akshaya Bhargava, Bijou Kurien, Milind Sarwate and Apurva Purohit. Executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan, chief operating officer N.S. Parthasarathy and CEO Ravanan are the three executive members, while the fourth co-founder, Subroto Bagchi, is a non-executive and non-independent director.
Mint could not immediately reach the four independent directors.
Mindtree’s board is scheduled to meet again on 26 March to consider a share buyback, a move that could push up the acquisition cost for L&T, which last week bought a 20.32% stake in Mindtree from V.G. Siddhartha and two of his affiliate companies for  ₹3,269 crore.

For now, L&T wants to boost its holding in Mindtree to 26%, which will trigger an open offer and get its representative on Mindtree’s board. A board seat will allow L&T to block special resolutions and strengthen its efforts to gain control of Mindtree.
Mindtree’s founders claim they have the support of large institutional investors, which hold a combined 20.2% in the company, implying that shareholders with 33.52% of voting rights, including the promoters, are opposed to L&T’s takeover bid at  ₹80 a share.
On Friday, Mindtree shares fell 1.16% to  ₹939.00 apiece on the BSE while L&T shares gained 1.54% to  ₹1,394.00. The benchmark Sensex shed 0.58% to end the day at 38,164.61 points."
57,2019-03-26,Larsen,"Mindtree directors’ panel to advise board on share buyback proposal at a board meeting todayFollowing L&T’s open offer proposal, Mindtree can't buy back any shares without a 75% shareholder approval

Mumbai: Mindtree Ltd’s independent directors will meet ahead of the company’s scheduled board meeting on Tuesday to advise its board on whether to proceed with the share buyback proposal. The independent directors will also consider Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) offer to buy shares from public shareholders of the Bengaluru-based software services company.
The founders of Mindtree, who together own 13.32% in the company, are trying to fend off a hostile takeover bid by L&T, India’s largest engineering company, by buying back shares from public shareholders. L&T, which agreed to buy Café Coffee Day founder V.G. Siddhartha’s 20.32% stake for  ₹3,269 crore on 18 March, has announced plans to buy a total of 67% in Mindtree for about  ₹10,700 crore.
Apurva Purohit, Mindtree’s lead independent director and chairperson of company’s nomination and remuneration committee, said the independent directors’ committee would deliberate on the basis of independent advice and come out with recommendations, following due process.
Mindtree’s board meeting on 19 March, which was supposed to consider the share buyback proposal, remained inconclusive.
“No decision has been taken in the board meeting (on 19 March) and everything is speculative and baseless,"" added Purohit.
Mindtree’s board is scheduled to meet again today to consider the buyback proposal and the company’s quarterly financial results.
Mindtree shares closed at  ₹940.25 apiece on the BSE on Monday.
As of December-end, Mindtree had total paid-up capital plus free reserves worth  ₹3,165 crore. A company can buy back shares worth only 10% of this capital without shareholders’ approval. It can purchase up to 25% of the capital with 75% shareholder approval. This means that Mindtree can buy shares worth only around  ₹317 crore without any shareholder nod, or shares worth up to  ₹791 crore with shareholder approval.
But following L&T’s open offer proposal, Mindtree cannot buy back any shares without a 75% shareholder approval, according to the Companies Act, 2013.
“Even if Mindtree promoters offer  ₹1,000 apiece and get a majority shareholder approval to buy shares worth 25% of the company’s total capital, they will be able to buy back a maximum of 7.9 million shares, or 0.68% of Mindtree vis-à-vis the 31% shares L&T has proposed to buy in the open offer,"" a person directly aware of the recent developments at Mindtree said on condition of anonymity.
Also, under Section 77 of the Companies Act, 2013, if any entity (in this case L&T) announces an open offer to acquire control in a company (in this case Mindtree), the company cannot conduct a share buyback, or alter the company’s capital structure in any manner unless it secures 75% shareholder approval.
“The company does not have enough money in its balance sheet to fund the buyback and, even if the promoters pledge their entire 13.32% holding, which is rare, they may be able to raise around  ₹1,000 crore (which is 50% of the market value of their holding as per the standard loan-to-equity valuation practice),"" a second person aware of the developments at Mindtree said on condition of anonymity. The person added that, therefore, it was unlikely that Mindtree would go ahead with its share buyback plan.
ALSO READ | The Mindtree stake sale is not the caffeine kick Coffee Day needs
“If Mindtree really wants to counter L&T’s hostile takeover bid, the promoters will need to rope in a large financier, who will not only have to offer a higher share price to buy Siddhartha’s 20.32% stake, but also have to agree to not change the existing board and management control at Mindtree, unlike L&T,"" added the first person cited earlier.
The Indian investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase and Co. said in a report that there were synergies in a combination of L&T Infotech Ltd, a unit of L&T, and Mindtree, as the two business models are non-overlapping.

55,2019-03-27,Larsen,"Mindtree constitutes committee of independent directors to evaluate L&T's offerLarsen & Toubro launches open offer to buy 31% in Mindtree

Mumbai: Mindtree Ltd’s board on Tuesday scrapped a share buyback proposal that was aimed at preventing a hostile takeover by the country’s largest engineering company, Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). The move may make it easier for L&T to gain control of Mindtree, controlling shareholders of which have been resisting a takeover by the engineering behemoth.
L&T announced on 18 March that it would launch an open offer to buy an additional 31% of Mindtree after agreeing to buy a 20.32% stake from the company’s largest shareholder group that includes Café Coffee Day founder V.G. Siddhartha and two of his affiliate firms for  ₹3,269 crore. L&T also said it would buy a 15% stake in Mindtree from the open market.
Following a board meeting on Tuesday, Mindtree said it would not proceed with a plan to buy back its shares and the company’s newly formed independent directors’ committee would start working on recommendations for Mindtree shareholders with regard to the L&T open offer. Mint first reported on Tuesday that Mindtree was unlikely to proceed with its buyback plan.
“… the board invited views from the company’s directors on the unsolicited offer (open offer) made by L&T and after a deliberation, the board has decided to immediately constitute the committee of independent directors (IDC) in the interest of all stakeholders to provide their reasoned recommendation in respect of the unsolicited offer by L&T,"" Mindtree said in an exchange filing. “All the independent directors will be members of the IDC, and the IDC has elected Apurva Purohit, lead independent director, as the chairperson of the IDC.""
In an emailed response to a query, Purohit said “the committee will deliberate on the open offer using the advice of an independent legal counsel and financial advisors who will be appointed shortly to assist the IDC"".
In a separate exchange filing, L&T said the purpose of acquiring control of Mindtree is mainly to grow the revenue and profit of its asset-light services business portfolio, thereby increasing its consolidated return on equity.
“The acquisition is expected to be value accreting for both the acquirer’s (L&T) shareholders and the target company’s (Mindtree) shareholders in the medium to long term,"" L&T said.
The market has been abuzz with talk of a potential stake sale by Siddhartha and an eventual takeover of Mindtree since May last year. The race for Mindtree gathered momentum in November, when Siddhartha officially announced his intention to exit Mindtree.
However, the real battle for Mindtree started last week when L&T announced its decision to buy Siddhartha’s stake and acquire control of Mindtree.
Mindtree’s co-founders have been maintaining that the company’s top management under chief executive Rostow Ravanan is being fully backed by the entire board and several large shareholders.
Nalanda Capital, Mindtree’s largest institutional shareholder, has said that L&T’s bid for the IT company will be damaging for stakeholders, The Times of India reported on Tuesday, citing a statement issued by the investor.
Still, some analysts say it will be tough for Mindtree’s founders to retain control of the company.
“The writing is on the wall,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage. “Two things can play out from here. First, the shareholders reject the open offer at this price. Then, L&T can revise upwards its open offer price to win support from shareholders. This means that the takeover may take some time. Second, the board comes to a dispassionate conclusion, that they find L&T’s price in the interest of minority shareholders. In both scenarios, the end result appears to be stacked against the founders.""
For now, L&T wants Mindtree to remain listed and function independently. But, on 19 March, in an investor presentation, L&T mentioned that it might consider a possible merger of Mindtree with L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services, once the combined revenues from the three entities cross the $5 billion threshold.
On Tuesday, L&T said if it intended to alienate any material asset of Mindtree within a period of two years from the date of completion of the open offer, a special resolution of the shareholders of Mindtree would be taken.
Also, as per the share purchase agreement between Siddhartha and L&T, Siddhartha and his affiliates have undertaken that till the date of closure of the takeover deal, they will vote against any resolution or transaction by Mindtree that impedes the L&T deal.
L&T said it will file its draft letter of offer with the Securities and Exchange Board of India for the Mindtree takeover on 2 April, while Mindtree’s IDC could send its recommendations to the shareholders by 10 May. L&T has the option to raise the open offer price or the offer size till 13 May.
“I expect L&T to settle with 35-40% of shareholder support post the closure of the open offer,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research."
54,2019-03-28,Larsen,"Just two weeks prior to L&T, a PE firm was very close to finalizing the deal with Siddhartha, one that was acceptable to MindtreeV.G. Siddhartha's Mindtree stake sale to L&T fetched him only  ₹16.7 crore more than the second highest offer by a PE firm

New Delhi: When V.G. Siddhartha agreed to sell the 20.32% stake owned by him and his two affiliates in Mindtree Ltd to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) at  ₹980 a share, the founder of Cafe Coffee Day earned only  ₹16.7 crore more than the second-highest price of  ₹975 a share offered by a global private equity (PE) firm.
Even more surprising is that the four promoters of Mindtree Ltd, led by chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan and chief executive Rostow Ravanan, repeatedly expressed their reservations to Siddhartha about him selling the shares to India’s largest engineering and construction company.
Siddhartha was forced to sell his stake because of a liquidity squeeze that was triggered by defaults in payments by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) in August. It led to his lenders calling in their loans against which his almost entire holding in Mindtree had been pledged. The promoters of Mindtree now run the risk of losing control of the company they founded.
Siddhartha, who first invested about $8 million when Mindtree was founded in 1999, and, in the ensuing two decades, went along happily with the decisions made by the other promoters, found the lenders unwilling to roll over his considerable debt of about  ₹3,000 crore.
With repayment deadlines fast approaching, he needed to monetize his holding in Mindtree at the earliest. At least a dozen PE players (read about them here and here), sovereign funds and long-term funds were only too happy to buy his stake worth  ₹3,000 crore, a senior executive of Mindtree said on condition of anonymity.
The catch was that Siddhartha’s shares had already been pledged to the banks, and, for any sale to take place, the potential buyer needed to pay for the unpledging of the shares before buying them or at least agreeing to an arrangement wherein the shares stayed with the banks even while the transaction to sell them was underway.
Also read: L&T storms Mindtree gates, but its own investors feel the heat
In an emailed reply to specific queries on the issue, Siddhartha said: “I would like to state clearly that the shares that are held by me and my companies in Mindtree have been pledged with a single lender for ease of selling the same post all prerequisite approvals are obtained. As a matter of policy we have not and do not intend to sell fully or partly any shares in the subject company or seek a loan against such security from the interested purchaser till all regulatory approvals are obtained.""
Thus, beginning December, while almost a dozen storied firms met with him and the management of Mindtree to understand the contours of the asset they were buying into, a deal just couldn’t happen as none of them was willing to pay unless the shares were transferred.

As most of them were large multinational firms, their charter itself would have prevented them from doing so.
To be sure, Mint has learnt that just two weeks before the announcement by L&T—the last week of February—a global PE firm was very close to finalizing the deal with Siddhartha, following a series of meetings. Mindtree’s other promoters had even agreed to its terms, including a position on the board.
Also read: The Mindtree stake sale is not the caffeine kick Coffee Day needs
While L&T finally agreed to buy Siddhartha’s stake at a declared price of  ₹980 per share, the earlier offer, which was clearly preferred by the Mindtree promoters, was  ₹975.
Only 10 months back, in May last year, Siddhartha told Mint that he remained committed to Mindtree, as he expected the company to more than double its revenue to $2 billion by 2023. Natarajan, in a separate interview then, went a step further and said Siddhartha’s 20% in Mindtree and the promoters’ 13.2% equity should be seen as “one"" or “33.8%"" because “Siddhartha won’t do anything that even marginally puts Mindtree at risk"". “That we are very, very comfortable with,"" said Natarajan.
Also read: Mindtree battle enters final decisive phase
However, four months later, in August, the IL&FS crisis came to the fore when one of its group companies failed on its debt payments.
Siddhartha, facing huge financial pressure, decided to sell his stake to L&T, leaving Mindtree vulnerable to a hostile takeover.
The deal with the PE firm likely fell through because it wasn’t willing to get into the complicated mechanics of the transaction. Enter L&T, and while the details of the pre-deal transactions between L&T and Siddhartha are not known, it is safe to assume that the latter was agreeable to the more complex transaction.
An email sent to L&T seeking comment went unanswered."

New Delhi: Mindtree board is evaluating ""several options"" to find way out of the L&T's hostile takeover bid, the IT firm's executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan said on Thursday as he made it clear the conglomerate is yet to come up with any proposal to address the concerns. 
Asserting that the ""independence"" of Mindtree is important, Natarajan, one of the company's promoters who had opposed Larsen and Toubro Ltd's offer, said there is nothing about individuals.
""As a company we don't bother about what has gone in the past. We will be optimistic and practical, and hopefully we will arrive at a middle ground. Right now there is nothing on offer,"" Natarajan told PTI in an interview. He also noted that they have not sought any meeting with L&T officials regarding the offer.
L&T has acquired Cafe Coffee Day owner V.G. Siddhartha's 20.32% stake in Mindtree and has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15% stake from the open market. Besides, an open offer has been made to buy over 5.13 crore shares, amounting to about 31% stake, for  ₹5,030 crore.
The total deal value is estimated to be around  ₹10,800 crore.
Mindtree has formed a panel under lead independent director and Jagran Prakashan President Apurva Purohit to look into the ""unsolicited open offer"" by L&T. The panel is expected to submit its recommendations for consideration of shareholders by 11 May.
Without elaborating, Natarajan said the board still has several options to find a way out from the L&T hostile takeover bid and is constantly evaluating.
When asked if Mindtree promoters are looking to secure a place for themselves as part of negotiation with L&T, Natarajan said ""it is not about individuals. It is about the organisation"".
""It is about Mindtree retaining its independence, protecting the value of mindtree shareholders, customers and Mindtree minds (employees). The core issue is not whether Krishnakumar (Natarajan) is allowed as chairman or not,"" he said.
According to him, the Mindtree open offer is now in place and shareholders have to decide on it. ""At the end of the day what has happened has happened. They will be a shareholder, we will try and find a middle ground. That is what is the future. There is a process which has been initiated which is the open offer. Shareholders have to decide...,"" he noted.
On whether Mindtree investors' didn't back the management in buying stake from Siddhartha, Natarajan said there was enormous interest to buy his stake but as a commercial deal it did not fructify.
""We got an offer which was very close. I don't think it was a commercial thing that did not let deal happen,"" Natarajan said."

New Delhi: Infrastructure giant Larsen & Toubro is eyeing more than USD 1 billion revenue from its newly launched new-age technology platform L&T Nxt in the next five to seven years, a top company official has said.
The L&T Nxt initiative, which was launched last week, will focus on the areas of artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), virtual reality, augmented reality, geospatial solutions as well as cybersecurity.
The announcement came at a time when L&T has made an offer to buy up to 66 per cent stake in IT firm Mindtree for around  ₹10,800 crore. It has entered into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha's 20.32 per cent share in Mindtree and has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15 per cent of the company shares from the open market.

We will be looking at beyond a billion dollars in five years to seven years span,"" Larsen & Toubro's Senior Executive Vice-President (Defence Business) and member of the board J D Patil told PTI.
Patil said L&T Nxt is being taken to the market after pursuing the initiative in-house for quite some time with an idea to help its clientele and customers, and the hope of some of the kind of unthinkable success stories.
""As of today, we can look at a couple of 100 million dollars to start with and then one would want to keep on honing it when one moves upward,"" the official said.
""We are committing significant investments and talent into this strategic effort and are confident that this will be an enabler for business,"" S N Subrahmanyan, CEO and MD, L&T, had said at the launch of L&T Nxt.

49,2019-04-01,Larsen,"With Project Insight, tax authorities can now track social media activity for signs of evasion. In response, we need a law on privacy as much as self-restraint on fake immodesty

Who doesn’t love flaunting what they’ve got on social media these days? After all, a holiday in a fancy resort overseas may not be quite as exciting without online bragging rights, just as the snob appeal of a new and expensive set of wheels would suffer a loss without all those “likes"" piled up from far and near. However, these seemingly harmless boasts could now land you in trouble with India’s tax authorities. With a view to improving tax compliance, they have reportedly set the ball rolling on Project Insight, an online surveillance system that uses Artificial Intelligence and data analytics to generate a 360-degree profile of taxpayers. Activated on Monday, it has reportedly been built at a cost of  ₹1,000 crore by L&T Infotech and is expected to keep tabs on people’s social media activity for clues and signs of lifestyles disproportionate to their declared sources of income. Be warned: living a life more lavish than what your tax filings justify could be flagged for scrutiny by a piece of software. 
India isn’t the only country with people’s financial status under watch. Australia, Belgium and Canada are at the forefront of using data analytics to check tax evasion. However, concerns over this appear to be greater here. This could be because many consider online snooping of any sort a cause for anxiety, given the fear of troll attacks and the like. This scare is compounded by the fact that India has no explicit legal framework to protect the data and privacy of citizens. In Europe, regulators are working on laws that would assure every individual the right to—and control over—his or her data. Users of social media there would thus be able to do whatever they wish with whatever they have put online, even if it’s stored in a database on the other side of the globe. They would have the freedom to wipe their data off memory chips completely, if they so choose; or they could opt to share it with companies strictly on their own terms—in lieu of a fee or shared profits, for example. The right of people to own their information, be it posts, pictures or preferences, could serve as the guiding principle for Indian legislative action along similar lines. 
Indeed, it’s creepy to know that somebody is prying on our private lives, but as almost nobody wants to give up the convenience and connectivity of the internet, staying offline is not an option. So long as the state accords itself this privilege in the nation’s interest, citizens will likely have to grin and bear it. Aadhaar as a unique identity marker also evokes worries that it could link every database and serve up an instant e-dossier on anyone packed with every little personal detail in existence on the web, but the argument that it allows the delivery of state services to the truly deserving has kept protests low-key. The hope is that no data leaks into the wrong hands. The same could hold for Project Insight. What’s online is available to the taxman and that’s just the way it is. For now, the most sensible response would be to restrain all exaggeration. Don’t pass off your local beach as Hawaii and don’t portray that bottle of bubbly as something of a rare vintage whisked out of a French castle’s wine cellar. That said, it’s about time the country demanded a proper privacy law."

NEW DELHI :
Mumbai: Mindtree Ltd’s independent directors’ committee has appointed Khaitan and Co. as the legal adviser and ICICI Securities Ltd as financial adviser for guiding the company’s directors in providing recommendations to Mindtree shareholders on the open offer to be launched by Larsen and Toubro Ltd.
Following a meeting of the independent directors on Tuesday, Mindtree’s lead independent director Apurva Purohit said: “This (independent directors’) committee will discharge the legal obligations placed on the independent directors under the prevailing regulations with respect to providing reasoned recommendations on the offer.""
“The written reasoned recommendations on the open offer shall be provided within the timeline and as per the guidelines laid down by Sebi. Since the entire matter is under evaluation at this stage, no opinion has been formed by the independent directors thus far. Any reports suggesting otherwise are incorrect and baseless,"" Purohit added in a statement. On 26 March, the Bengaluru-based IT company’s board scrapped its plan for a share buyback that was aimed at preventing a hostile takeover by L&T.
L&T had on 18 March announced that it would launch an open offer to buy additional 31% of Mindtree after agreeing to buy a 20.32% stake from V.G. Siddhartha and his firms, the company’s largest shareholder group.
L&T will launch its open offer on 14 May.
L&T also said it would buy a 15% stake in Mindtree from the open market. L&T aims to buy a total of 66.32% in Mindtree, which will cost it around  ₹10,700 crore at  ₹980 per share.
For now, L&T wants Mindtree to remain listed and function independently. But, on 19 March, in an investor presentation, L&T mentioned that it might consider a possible merger of Mindtree with L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services, once the combined revenues from the three entities cross the $5 billion threshold.
L&T said it will file its draft letter of offer with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the Mindtree takeover on 2 April, while Mindtree’s IDC could send its recommendations to the shareholders by 10 May. L&T has the option to raise the open offer price or the offer size till 13 May.
On Tuesday, L&T shares fell 0.19% to  ₹1409.70 apiece while Mindtree's gained 0.08% to 945.25 apiece on the BSE. The benchmark Sensex rose 0.48% to end the day at a record high of 39,056.65 points.

47,2019-04-05,Larsen,"How a bunch of entrepreneurs built Mindtree over two decades but forgot to fence it against a hostile takeover by L&T

New Delhi: Late one Sunday evening in March this year, V.G. Siddhartha, who was in Mumbai, texted Mindtree Ltd’s executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan in Bengaluru about his decision to sell 20.3% shares the founder of the Café Coffee Day had held for close to two decades in the information technology (IT) outsourcing company to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). An agitated Natarajan, who knew that the company risked an ownership change, spoke to his friend and another co-founder Subroto Bagchi, who was in Bhubaneswar, more than 1,700km from Mumbai.
Three years ago, Bagchi had relinquished his role as executive chairman of the firm to devote time to his new calling as chairman of Odisha Skill Development Authority.
Though immersed in his new role, Bagchi hadn’t forgotten Mindtree. After all he, along with nine other friends, had set up the company on 18 August 1999.
“An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall,"" Bagchi tweeted at 8.37pm on 17 March.
An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the Government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall.
Seven minutes later, he tweeted again.
“Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset"" to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return.""
Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return
Over the next 48 hours, the three co-founders, including Natarajan, Bagchi and chief executive Rostow Ravanan, played the emotive card to express their unhappiness over what was India’s first hostile takeover bid in the IT services sector.
Not everyone was impressed. “Quite clearly, the bulldozer tweet and the decision to cast L&T as a villain is something the founders could have avoided. This is not how business leaders run,"" said an executive at a large IT firm, requesting anonymity.
But Natarajan, Bagchi and Co. aren’t cast in the same mould as other business leaders. To understand their present woes, one needs to go back to the beginning.
A brief history of the Tree
Fifteen years before the country was witness to the startup frenzy of 2014, Mindtree was set up by 10 friends, who came from Wipro Ltd, Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. and Lucent Technologies in 1999. Ashok Soota, who was then the vice-chairman of Wipro’s IT services business, had started discussions with Siddhartha, the firm’s first investor. After another two rounds of meetings, Soota was convinced, and told Azim Premji, Wipro’s charismatic chairman, about his decision to leave the company in February that year.
Over the next five-and-a-half months, a period which also witnessed the first dotcom boom in India, eight other co-founders joined Soota. Siddhartha and venture capital firm Walden Software put in about $8 million, while Soota and his eight friends came up with $1.4 million.
Finally, on the morning of 19 August, the nine co-founders, led by Soota, who was appointed as chairman and managing director, announced Mindtree to the world at a press conference in Bengaluru. A get together in the evening at Taj Residency was attended by over 100 guests, including Premji and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys Ltd.
S. Janakiraman, who was Wipro’s global head of research and development at the time and who would join in October as the 10th co-founder, was understandably missing from the party.
Mindtree, which raised $9.5 million, was valued at $40 million in 1999. The 10 co-founders, together, owned 75% of the new company while Siddhartha and Walden Software, which exited in 2012, owned the remaining 25% shares.
In 1999, Wipro’s IT services business was a tad over $100 million while Infosys had ended the financial year with $120 million in revenue. In 2001, Capital Group invested $10 million while an additional $4.4 million was put in by Franklin Templeton (Siddhartha got them into the company), Soota, Siddhartha and Walden. By now the firm’s valuation had jumped to $80 million. Six years later, Mindtree, after having raised over $24 million, went public in February 2007.
Mindtree, like many of the other IT vendors, deploys engineers to do software testing, manage IT infrastructure and write codes for applications that eventually help its clients, from Microsoft Corp. to Southwest Airlines Co. run their business. It wasn’t a unique proposition but investors still liked the IT story and its shares were subscribed 110 times.
Now, the company’s founders owned about 35.46%, a number that would progressively go down even as they focused on building a unique work culture incorporating some of the best practices from companies such as Infosys and Wipro.
Indeed, Mindtree’s two-decade journey is full of moments that can be the stuff of business school curriculums. One such instance shows how the firm won an account. A month after he had joined Mindtree as head of marketing, Joseph King arrived in Mindtree’s US office early one morning and made a direct call to Larry Kinder, the chief information officer (CIO) of Avis, the car rental firm.
“The IT business is all about relationships. So Joe came into the office early and called directly because he realized that was the only time he could connect with him as the receptionists would not have come in at that hour,"" Soota recounted in an interview.
Kinder took the call, liked the story, gave Mindtree executives an appointment and finally agreed to give them business, which over a three-year period became a $7 million account.
“I was employee no. 7 in the US and I joined Mindtree on 4 October 1999,"" said Joseph King, who now heads marketing and communications for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the US. “I remember speaking to the Avis CIO in November 1999 and we started our engagement there in early 2000.""
However, the company also had its fair share of near-death experiences. The dotcom crash in 2000 was the first, followed quickly by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. “The second round of funding, led by Capital Group, got closed in the first week of September 2001, days before 9/11,"" said Janakiraman. “Post 9/11, it was a different world and imagine what would have happened had there been any delay.""
The financial crisis in 2008 was another. The company’s failed move to make mobile handsets, after it paid $8 million to buy Kyocera Wireless’s India R&D unit in 2009, only to shelve it later, was yet another. This failed attempt was too big a setback for Soota, who was spearheading this move. He decided to leave the company in 2011 and subsequently sold his 11.6% shares to Siddhartha, whose ownership increased to 20.32%.
Finally, Mindtree’s long restructuring exercise, which saw the firm hire management consulting major Bain and Co. in 2013, was another phase when both growth and profitability took a hit.
But Mindtree steered through each of these setbacks. Four reasons essentially explain how Mindtree survived many of the challenges it faced.
During the dot-com crisis, when almost 198 of the 200 companies that were set up in 1999 crashed, Mindtree had enough money to steer through the stress. “We survived because we had taken a lot of money and we still had money when the dot-com crash happened,"" said Soota.
Second, the decision to include engineering business helped the firm diversify with an alternative revenue stream.
Third, during the dot-com crash and then again during the financial crisis of 2008, the senior management, led by the founders, agreed to take salary cuts. Salaries of senior management were cut by 20-25% while mid-level managers agreed to a 10% cut. Finally, there was the excellent rapport between the founding team and the key investors, the two VCs in Walden Software and Siddhartha.
Betrayal or Bailout
So when the crunch came in 2018, why did Siddhartha choose to sell his crucial 20.32% stake in Mindtree at  ₹980 a share to L&T, even though the founders had repeatedly expressed their reservations to him about India’s largest engineering and construction company which had in the past, too, made overtures for a stake sale? After all, just two weeks before L&T’s announcement on 18 March, another global private equity firm had agreed to buy the shares at  ₹975, in a deal that was acceptable to Mindtree founders.
Siddhartha was forced to sell his shares because of a sudden liquidity squeeze in the lending markets, triggered by defaults in payments by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd in August. It led to his lenders calling in  ₹3,000 crore of loans given to him against his entire holding in Mindtree which had been pledged. 
With repayment deadlines fast approaching, he needed to monetize his holding in Mindtree at the earliest. However, none of the dozen-odd private equity firms, sovereign funds and long-term funds which were interested in buying his shares was okay with a complex deal. This was because for any sale to take place, the potential buyer needed to pay for the unpledging of the shares before buying them or at least agreeing to an arrangement wherein the shares stayed with the banks even while the transaction to sell them was underway. A deal just couldn’t happen as none of them was willing to pay unless the shares were transferred.
“They could have tried to get Infosys’s founders, including (N.R. Narayana) Murthy, (S.D.) Shibulal, and Krish (Senapathy Gopalakrishnan) to pick up some shares,"" said a former Infosys executive. “They would not have risked losing control of their firm. But the founders (Mindtree) thought nothing will happen to them.""
Natarajan does not comment on why the firm could not have got a friendly investor from an existing IT firm to buy Siddhartha’s shares, saying the founders did everything they could. It is also possible that at this moment of crisis, they missed Soota’s contacts and astuteness.
“Ashok was clearly the captain,"" said Janakiraman. “He was more like a father-figure to all of us and helped us stay sane as we sorted through each of the episodes.""
So did Mindtree miss Soota during this period? “Possibly,"" said Janakiraman.
“Absolutely not,"" Natarajan said, adding that the founders did everything possible to fend off the hostile takeover bid.

What is clear is that their inability to buy the shares of the five co-founders who exited the company over the years, in the process leaving the current founders with just 13.32%, cost them dearly—perhaps even their control over the company. Thus, when Soota exited in 2010, he sold his substantial 11.61% stake to Siddhartha. Ditto for Kalyan Banerjee and Anjan Lahiri, who together sold 2.06% in the open market.
Looking ahead
Even as Mindtree’s four independent directors evaluate the unsolicited offer by L&T, it appears a given that L&T will eventually get to own Mindtree.
L&T’s two listed technology firms, L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services Ltd ended with $1.13 billion and $580.4 million in revenue, respectively, in the year ended March 2018. The company has said it intends to keep Mindtree, which ended with $846.8 million last year, separate for now. However, most analysts like JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George expect parent L&T to combine the three entities once they, together, cross $5 billion in revenue. This will take at least three years, provided two of the three companies clock a 15% annual growth.

Will combining the three firms be enough to compete against the large IT firms? Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will end the current year with more than $20 billion in revenue while Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which follows January-December as the financial year, is expected to end with over $17 billion. Bengaluru-based Infosys will end with over $11 billion while HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd will end with more than $8 billion each.
Clearly, L&T’s consolidated IT business will still lack enough firepower to compete against the big boys of the industry. At best, it will be competing with Tech Mahindra Ltd, GlobalLogic and other mid-tier IT firms.
ALSO READ | Mindtree battle enters final decisive phase
The downside risk is in the cultural mismatch. Mindtree’s informal culture, where many employees call members of the founding team by their first names is in contrast with command-and-control and top-down management at L&T.
For now, Mindtree founders don’t have many options other than to delay the inevitable and negotiate for a smooth transition. Management guru Peter Drucker best described it as: “Many problems cannot be solved; they have to be survived."" Ironically, Bagchi often recounted this to employees in the past when the company was faced with challenging times."

Mumbai: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) on Friday approved Larsen and Toubro Ltd's (L&T's) takeover bid for Mindtree Ltd. The L&T-Mindtree deal, which will see the diversified engineering conglomerate purchase up to 66.32% stake in the Bengaluru-based IT services firm for around  ₹10,700 crore, is the first hostile takeover bid in the Indian IT industry. Two persons with direct knowledge of the CCI approval for the L&T-Mindtree deal confirmed the development.
The CCI approval was crucial as L&T has its own IT services business in L&T Infotech Ltd, whose market capitalization is almost twice that of Mindtree. Their combined valuation, as on Friday, stood at  ₹46,000 crore—a little higher than half of Tech Mahindra Ltd's market cap of  ₹76,623 crore.
The three firms are part of the mid-tier of the Indian IT industry, the top rung of which consists Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd.
“The CCI approval came in record time. Usually, CCI approvals take more than 21 days. This shows the confidence of the regulatory authorities in the deal,"" said one of the two persons cited above, requesting anonymity.

L&T also said it would buy 15% stake in Mindtree from the open market.
The three-part deal will see L&T buy up to 66.32% in Mindtree for around  ₹10,700 crore at  ₹980 per share.
L&T’s open offer for Mindtree will launch on 14 May and close on 27 May.
L&T had on 18 March said it planned to keep Mindtree ""independent for now"" but, in an investor presentation the next day, said it may consider a merger of Mindtree and L&T Infotech once their combined revenue—along with that of group firm L&T Technology Services Ltd—crosses the $5 billion mark.
In its offer documents, L&T has said that the purpose of acquiring control of Mindtree is mainly to grow the revenue and profit of its asset-light services business portfolio and increase the consolidated return on equity.

Infrastructure giant Larsen & Toubro (L&T) plans to hire 1,500 people this year, the same as in previous years, a top company official said.
""The company's manpower strength stood at 42,924 as on March 31, 2018 as compared to 41,466 as at March 31, 2017. On an average, we hire close to 1,500 people across functions every year and we see no discontinuity in this practice unless business dynamics change drastically,"" Yogi Sriram, Senior Vice President - Corporate HR, Larsen & Toubro, told PTI.
Sriram added that L&T's employee attrition rate of around 5 per cent was among the lowest in the industry.
L&T recently made a hostile takeover bid for mid-sized IT services firm Mindtree. However, the company's founders have resisted the unsolicited acquisition bid, citing differences in corporate culture and other factors.
Elaborating on L&T's HR practices, Sriram said: ""We are putting a greater emphasis on ensuring wider participation of women and frame policies to enable their career growth.""
Women employees are not just deployed in IT and finance roles, but are also present in core engineering jobs like heavy engineering shops, construction projects and defence engineering projects, he said.
Asked whether there will be job cuts as the company opts for digitisation, Sriram said, ""There have been no lay-offs and the exits were limited to reasons of non-performance.""
The company's Leadership Development Academy (LDA) at Lonavala has been set up for learning interventions, he said, adding that an artificial intelligence driven digitalised platform, called ATLNext, caters to the learning needs of its workforce.
Business magazine Forbes had listed L&T among the 'World's Best Employers' for 2018. The list, based on Forbes' Global 2000 rankings of publicly traded companies in 60 countries, placed L&T at number 22, making it the highest-ranked Indian firm across all sectors.
L&T has acquired Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha's 20.32% stake in Mindtree and has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15% shares from the open market. Besides, an open offer has been made to buy over 5.13 crore shares, amounting to about 31% stake.

Mumbai: Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) shares are down about 5% this year, even as the Nifty 50 index has risen by over 8%. The fall in L&T’s shares come despite the positive news on order flows and improving fundamentals in its core business. Worse, its one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 19 times is way below the levels of 24 times a year ago as well as the five-year average of 23 times earnings.
The first dampener for the stock came early this year when the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) rejected its share buyback offer, which was meant to return excess cash and boost return ratios. Investors have also perceived the decision to acquire software firm Mindtree Ltd as a negative in the near term because of a worry about using cash in non-core businesses. Some analysts also said it can weigh on near-term return on equity (RoE) of the company.
“Investors are not happy with L&T’s capital allocation to MindTree, especially in context of RoE being sub-5% at the acquired valuation multiple (of about 20 times),"" said Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.
L&T has set a target of achieving 18% RoE by FY21, which is now under question, given the Mindtree deal and the rejection of the buyback offer.
Growth prospects have also turned grim both in India and globally. Private sector investment is showing no sign of improvements. The slow pace of earnings growth in the core sector and poor capacity utilization may thwart private sector capex for some more quarters.
The overhang of the general elections will also limit government capex until the second half of FY20. “We do not expect the strong 15% CAGR seen in FY08-FY13 to repeat, especially as power will not be a major capex driver ahead. However, from negative growth, we expect to move to 10%+ CAGR over the next four years,"" said Jefferies India.
However, L&T’s efforts to contain working capital should bring down interest cost as a percent of sales. Meanwhile, the March quarter is usually robust on execution, translating into better conversion of orders into revenues. Also, analysts say L&T’s order flows for FY19 will top its guidance of 10-12% growth over a year ago. Investors will hope that improved fundamentals in the company’s core business will offset the negative investor sentiment due to recent developments."

41,2019-05-01,Larsen,"Larsen and Toubro’s open offer for Mindtree will begin on 14 May and close on 27 MayA 26% stake in Mindtree will entitle L&T to get a dividend income of  ₹102 crore

Larsen and Toubro Ltd on Tuesday formalized its stake purchase in Mindtree Ltd from Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder V.G. Siddhartha and two CCD affiliate firms for  ₹3,218.32 crore and is now looking to buy at least 6% more from the open market within a week.
A 26% stake in Mindtree will entitle L&T to get a dividend income of  ₹102 crore.
Two people with direct knowledge of the development confirmed this, adding that L&T has started its open market purchase of Mindtree shares on Tuesday and is hoping to cross its basic target of acquiring at least 26% within a week.
On 18 March, L&T, after declaring its plan to buy the 20.4% stake held by Siddhartha and his two CCD affiliate firms, announced its intent to launch an open offer to buy an additional 31% in Mindtree. L&T also said it would buy 15% stake in Mindtree separately from the open market.
The open market purchase began on Tuesday.
“In the next one week, L&T should be able to complete buying the crucial 26% stake in Mindtree. Shares will be bought at a price of up to  ₹980 apiece or lower, depending on the price movement,"" said the first person.
On 18 April, Mindtree, while declaring its annual results, announced a special dividend of 200% and a final dividend of 40% on every share at a face value of  ₹10 each for every shareholder of Mindtree. Separately, Mindtree has announced an interim dividend of 30% for all shareholders. However, since L&T’s stake purchase falls on a day beyond the record date for the interim dividend, L&T will not be entitled to receive any interim dividend.
The special and final dividend payout is subject to a shareholder approval in an annual meeting that is scheduled to happen in July. The record date for these dividends hasn’t been announced yet and if L&T manages to buy the planned 35.4% stake (20.4% stake of Siddhartha and 15% from open market) in Mindtree before the record date is announced, L&T will be eligible to earn a dividend of  ₹139 crore.
Finally, if L&T succeeds to end up with a total 66.4% stake in Mindtree after the open offer, the engineering firm will be eligible for a total dividend income of around  ₹260.5 crore. L&T’s open offer for Mindtree will begin on 14 May and close on 27 May.
On Tuesday, in an early morning bulk deal during the market hours, L&T bought 20% of the stake held together by Siddhartha, Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd and Coffee Day Trading Ltd. Following the stake sale, Siddhartha and his two firms are left with around 0.41% stake and L&T has emerged as the largest stakeholder in the Bengaluru-based IT firm, whose promoters have been resisting a change of guard ever since L&T announced its intent to acquire control of Mindtree on 18 March.
“The remaining stake of Siddhartha and his firms will also be purchased in a day or two, which will make Siddhartha earn around  ₹3,270 crore. The money will be used to repay the debt to Standard Chartered with which Siddhartha’s shares are pledged. Around  ₹2,900 crore will be used to pay Standard Chartered to release Siddhartha’s shares from encumbrances. Rest of the money too will be used to repay some of the debts taken by Coffee Day Enterprises and Coffee Day Trading,"" said the first person.
“Siddhartha and his firms have also got a clearance from the Income Tax department required under section 281, which will enable a transfer of the entire 20.4% stake to L&T,"" said the second person.
Section 281 of the Income Tax Act requires a tax assessee to secure approval of the assessing officer before creating a charge on or transfer of certain assets.
About a fortnight ago, right after announcing the dividend payout, Mindtree CEO Rostow Ravanan had said, “This is in no way done with an expectation to change the price."" But, ever since the dividend payout announcement, Mindtree’s stock price has been rising. The stock jumped from  ₹969.1 apiece on 18 April to  ₹988.85 a share on 25 April. On Tuesday the stock closed up 0.52% at  ₹980.30 on BSE.
After Mindtree announced its dividend plan, Ravanan had said, “The AGM is in July—and will take place after the open offer begins—so (it) shouldn’t have an impact. We haven’t done anything with an intention of influencing the price or anything like that. Moreover, dividend payment will only be done post the AGM in July (after approval), which will be after another quarter—and more cash flow would have come into the system.""
The dividend payout, if cleared by shareholders, will be the highest ever dividend paid by Mindtree since its inception two decades ago. Mindtree currently has around  ₹256.2 crore in cash and cash equivalents and  ₹3,141.9 crore in reserves and surplus. The dividend will be paid out of this money."

New Delhi: Infratsructure major Larsen & Toubro has purchased around 20% stake of V.G. Siddhartha and Coffee Day in Mindtree through block deal for about  ₹3,210 crore.
According to data available at the BSE, L&T bought 3.27 crore shares held by Siddhartha and Coffee Day Trading Limited on Tuesday.
The infrastructure major is in fray to buy up to 66% stake in the Mindtree for around  ₹10,800 crore.
L&T has entered into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner Siddhartha's 20.32% stake in Mindtree and has also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15% of the company shares from the open market for about  ₹2,500 crore.
Subsequent to these deals, L&T has made an open offer to buy additional 31% stake through an open offer.
Mindtree had formed a panel of independent directors to look into ""unsolicited open offer"" by infrastructure major L&T to give its recommendations.
Mindtree's promoters have called L&T bid as hostile and raised corporate governance issues at L&T and culture difference between the two companies.
The co-founders in a letter said that many institutional investors, clients and employees of MindTree have expressed their reservations to be part of an L&T-controlled organisation due to cultural difference between the two companies."

Engineering major L&T's software arm LTI or Larsen & Toubro Infotech will be hiring around 3,800 freshers this fiscal as it expects the business to grow at a faster clip, a top official has said. The company is working at a very high utilisation level now and wants to hire more to get down the level, chief executive Sanjay Jalona said.
""We will be hiring 3,700-3,800 freshers this fiscal year as against the 3,000 freshers we hired in FY19,"" he told PTI over the phone.
Additionally, it will also hire laterally as well as per project requirements on a ""just-in-time"" basis, he said.
Asked whether the necessary talent is available on call, especially given the fact that a lot many companies are depending on the just-in time hiring model, Jalona said talent is the biggest issue which keeps him awake and the concerns have only aggravated lately.
In FY19, the industry added 1.7 lakh new jobs, according to industry lobby Nasscom.
However, industry executives keep expressing concerns over the quality of the manpower available and doubt their skillsets are enough for a dynamically changing industry.
In the year to March 2019, Jalona said Larsen & Toubro Infotech has hired over 4,000 people on a net basis, of which 656 were in the fourth quarter alone.
The utilisation rates including trainees had stood at over 82 percent, and the company decided to ramp up hiring, even at the cost of compromising the margin, Jalona said.
The high utilisation is very ""unhealthy"" for a company of its size which is growing, he added.
Larsen & Toubro Infotech reported a 31% growth in March quarter net at  ₹378.5 crore on a faster revenue accretion.
Overall revenue grew 29.3 percent during the fiscal to  ₹9,445 crore.
Jalona said the demand environment is healthy for FY20 as the average contracted value during the quarter stood at a healthy $100 million per client.

Strong revenue growth and operational efficiencies led infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T) to report an 8% rise in net profit for the March quarter to  ₹3,418 crore, against  ₹3,167 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue from operations for the quarter grew 10% from  ₹40,676 crore to  ₹44,933 crore.
For the full fiscal year, net profit stood at  ₹8,905 crore, against  ₹7,369 crore in FY18. Revenue in FY19 was  ₹1.41 trillion, 18% higher compared with  ₹1.19 trillion in FY18. International revenue was  ₹45,109 crore for the year, constituting 32% of total revenue.
Order intake for the quarter was  ₹56,538 crore, growing 14% year-on-year and led by order wins in power, heavy engineering and hydrocarbons. Consolidated order book for the group stands at  ₹2.93 trillion as of March-end, with the international order book accounting for 22% of it.
For FY20, the management gave a guidance of 12-15% growth in revenues and 10-12% growth in order book.
The infrastructure segment saw order inflows fall 8% to  ₹31,033 crore for the quarter, while Ebitda margins were lower at 8.5% because of cost pressures and pending claims.
The heavy engineering segment saw orders rise 78% year-on-year in fiscal year 2019, because of increased demand for clean fuel supply to meet BS-VI and marine pollution norms.
Ebitda margins here rose from 21% in the previous year to 24.5%. The hydrocarbon segment secured orders of  ₹27,871 crore for the year, increasing 76% compared with FY18.
The financial services segment recorded customer revenue of  ₹12,638 crore for the year, registering growth of 26%, while revenues at the IT and technology subsidiaries grew 28% year-on-year to  ₹14,371 crore for the year.
In a statement the company said: “With the general elections in the first quarter, the disruptions in decision-making processes could impact key operating parameters in the first half of 2019-20.

37,2019-05-12,Larsen,"Larsen and Toubro’s Ebitda in the March quarter was slightly below Street expectationsBut growth in revenue and order flows was robust at 10.5 % and 14%, respectively

Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) shares have been in a state of inertia for a year. They have risen 0.5% in the past year. A robust March quarter show has propelled the company ahead of its order flow and revenue guidance for the full year. Will this energize the stock, or are there concerns that will weigh it down?
True, the March quarter Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of  ₹5,594 crore was slightly below forecasts. The company’s core business, namely the infrastructure segment, was the culprit.
According to the management, “Cost pressures encountered in a few projects and cost provisions pending client approval of additional claims in some projects"" dragged profitability.
However, analysts reckon that L&T’s quarterly margins are volatile, due to the long gestation of some of its projects and the manner of revenue recognition.
That said, the revenue growth of 10.5% and order flow growth of 14% were the highlights for the quarter. Segment-wise break-up of revenue shows that the company’s core business, which is infrastructure, clocked a robust 15% growth from the year earlier.
Even the hydrocarbon business, which has been gaining traction over the last few quarters, fared well with 29% revenue growth.
Barring the power segment, which continues to be a drag, other segments, including heavy engineering and defence, did well.
All this is on the back of its robust order book, which stood at  ₹2.93 trillion at the end of fiscal year 2019. Overall, L&T has clocked a decent show in FY19, in spite of headwinds, such as the liquidity crisis and weak private sector activity.
The management has spelt out a cautious outlook for the first two quarters of FY20, due to the overhang of the general elections. Further, while private sector capex is unlikely to revive in the near term, international trade conflicts amid high crude oil prices are risks to growth in international order flows as well. As if all this is not enough, government data showed that industrial output shrank for the first time in 21 months.
Some other issues have also weighed on the L&T stock in recent months. While the Mindtree Ltd acquisition may be a feather in its cap, investors are worried about allocation of capital towards non-core businesses.
Apart from the large cash reserves the company is sitting on, analysts foresee more cash addition as the sale of its electrical and automation division gets regulatory approval over the next 12-18 months.
The Street is worried that L&T’s return on equity (RoE) could be under pressure. True, RoE has risen to 15% in FY19 from 14% in FY18. The moot question, however, is: How will the company achieve its 18% RoE target by FY21?"

For the first phase, it has received nearly 1,800 booking applications from home buyers for 500 units offered, which belies the fears of a slowdown in the market.

NEW DELHI :
Larsen & Toubro's standalone market capitalisation will touch  ₹3 lakh crore and revenue will reach  ₹2 lakh crore in five years as strategic initiatives like L&T NxT have helped in making giant strides, Group Chairman A M Naik said.
The recently launched L&T-NxT initiative is a technology platform that focusses on artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), virtual reality, augmented reality, geospatial solutions as well as cybersecurity.
The $ 20 billion diversified L&T Group has a market cap of about  ₹2.5 lakh crore at present.

According to him, when he took over as L&T CEO, the combined market cap was around  ₹2,000 crore and it has now surged to  ₹2.5 lakh crore.
He joined L&T in 1965 as a junior engineer and rose to the positions of CEO and MD in 1999 and chairman in 2003. In 2017, he stepped aside from executive responsibilities and took over as Group Chairman.

According to BSE data, L&T acquired shares from the open market throughout the week (May 27-30) with the highest quantum of shares being purchased on May 28 when it picked up over 3.5 lakh shares of Mindtree at  ₹979.98 apiece.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that the company spent close to  ₹70 crore during the week for these transactions, which took its overall shareholding to 28.88 per cent.
In multiple tranches, L&T mopped up more than 7.11 lakh shares during the said week. Shares of Mindtree ended flat at  ₹977.70 apiece on BSE on Friday (May 31).
In March, L&T mounted a hostile takeover bid on Mindtree when it entered into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha's 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree and also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15 per cent of the company shares from the open market.
Subsequent to these deals, L&T is required to make an open offer to buy additional stake. In all, the infrastructure major is eyeing up to 66 per cent stake in Mindtree for around  ₹10,800 crore.
L&T's open offer - which was earlier slated to begin on May 14 - has been delayed as the engineering major is awaiting nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Emails sent to L&T didn't elicit a response.

27,2019-06-02,Larsen,"Long hours in conference rooms for skill-building sessions are a thing of the pastNow the corporate world is looking to theatre workshops, role play and gamification to impart training to employees

Gone are the days when a job application would only look at the projects you managed and the sales you made. More companies are evaluating employees personalities, too, to ensure that their next hire fits in with the company culture.
Soft skills, behavioural skills, essential skills... call them what you will, but employers can no longer ignore it and are proactively training their employees to be better at the way they interact with peer and teams as well as clients.
“Behavioural training is important and includes everything from how you react and take in to the feedback you get to the impact you have on clients and customers. It is important for us to understand what areas employees need to work on or what behaviour needs to be improved or modified,"" says Yogi Sriram, senior vice-president, corporate HR, Larsen & Toubro Ltd.
Sriram believes that there should be a framework for linking behaviour to appraisals and rewards. The feedback needs to be personalized and real time, so that the recall can be immediate.
But these need not be only through recognized and traditional methods such as classroom training and online courses. Some might have the traditional methods, others may have more uncommon ways to teach, and some may use a mix of both.
Focusing on key areas
The reasons for each organization to have soft skills training can be different, but it is good to recognize areas that need work. For example, Eli Lilly’s focus on diversity and inclusion was extended to soft skill trainings.
The pharma company has several scenario-based programmes which make participants aware of preconceived notions, hidden biases and micro-aggressions. These can include phrases like “oh, he got the role because he is a man"", or “she got a promotion because she is in that team"". Participants are each given a scenario and asked to understand which reactions are acceptable.
“The idea is to make our employees feel safe and thrive at Eli Lilly. When I say ‘safety’ I also mean psychological safety. We need to be aware about the things that can make someone uncomfortable, unwelcome or even unsafe at work and see how we can change it,"" says Anant Garg, HR director, Eli Lilly.
Scenario-based learning is also being used by the JSW group. Instead of a traditional computer-based training for prevention of sexual harassment (POSH), the company organized a play through which employees were taught about sexual harassment at the workplace. In the blended learning model that JSW uses, managers also share their experiences and start a discussion.
“We have had POSH training earlier, but this time, it created buzz and more people wanted to participate. Another thing we noticed was how it was possible to retain their attention for four to five hours. These interactive sessions are combined with classroom training for the basic theory,"" explains Gautam Chainani, group president, JSW.
Chainani explains how interactive methods bring out unconscious biases. During one such session a lot of senior male employees showed paternal instincts towards women. “They would say things like, let’s not give her that role, because it requires a lot of field work in not-so-safe areas, or it requires working alone at night, things like that. While it comes from a good place, it is a bias. Employees, especially millennial employees would not agree to such behaviour,"" he explains.
Reading patterns
Information technology and outsourcing company Mindtree, however, sticks to its roots. Since technology is its stronghold, it uses the digital medium for what it calls “non-technical"" learning.
A simulation game works to show how an employee’s (in this case, the gamer) behaviour influences stakeholders by allowing them to make decisions and understand the persona of the stakeholder.
“Gamification of learning has two plus points—one, you can scale it quickly. Two, digital learning gives you access to analytics and lets you read patterns, which can then be used to understand its effectiveness. What we used to consider soft skills earlier, such as effective communication, have become hygiene now. To stand apart from the rest, you need much more than just that,"" says Deepa Krishna, associate director-learning and development at Mindtree.
Reviewing impact
A common complaint is that while employees attend workshops and classes, they may not actually implement these brushed-up skills in the workplace. Reviewing therefore becomes important for companies to understand the effectiveness of such measures.
“Sometimes an employee may already have that skill, but is not using it effectively. To develop talent, it is important not just to train them on skills, but also understand what makes them better as team contributors,"" says Prince Augustin, EVP-group human capital and leadership development, M&M.
“If they can’t recognize the skills they need to build, it is the manager’s responsibility to point these out and encourage them to work on it,"" explains Augustin.
This is the thought behind the bi-annual relationship reviews at M&M where teams come together to understand the hurdles they are facing in effective collaboration.
Augustin further adds that solutions have to be hyper personalized – what works for one team or individual may not work for another. “There is no one way of developing. Organizations usually focus on developing the left brain, which is what businesses need. But individuals must take up creative paths to develop their right brain simultaneously – be it through theatre, photography, music or other activities,"" says Augustin.
clear communication
Max Life Insurance also has anonymous surveys for employees, where they comment on the company culture, how good is networking, how is it working with the peers etc. This can help HR teams to get a pulse of things and work on encouraging soft skill learning at work. During off-sites as well, employees are encouraged to take part in role-plays. This helps them to communicate without barriers, and they generally are seen to drop their guard—even if they are talking to supervisors. The informal format helps not only to grab attention, but also makes it more engaging and effective.
Shailesh Singh, director and chief people officer at Max Life Insurance says any plan for the company has to take into account its people. “In any organization, for success, the model must have people at the core. This is why we insist that supervisors get in touch with the team and see where development is going year on year. The development plan for key talent is shared with the CEO, who then shares it with the board. Ultimately, the plan to develop lies with you,"" explains Singh."

MUMBAI :
Engineering firm Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T) has announced an open offer of  ₹5,029.89 crore to acquire a 31% stake in mid-cap IT major Mindtree. The open offer, at  ₹980 per share, will begin on 17 June and end on 28 June, according to the offer letter filed with the exchange.
L&T said in March that it would increase its stake in Mindtree to 66.32% through an open offer for 31%, and an open market purchase of 15%. This puts the total value of the acquisition at  ₹10,700 crore. On 6 June, the company had upped its stake in Mindtree to 28.90%.
On 18 April, L&T announced that buying at least 26% in Mindtree will be its first priority, and critical for the engineering company’s overall aim of raising its stake to 66.32% to gain management control. The  ₹10,700 crore deal is India’s first hostile takeover in the IT industry.
L&T signed a definitive agreement to acquire 20.32% from V.G. Siddhartha and his coffee enterprise for over  ₹3,000 crore on 18 March. The deal was formalized in late April. L&T began its open market purchase on 30 April.
The initial open offer was slated to take place on 14 May, but was postponed due to a delay in approval by the Securities and Exchanges Board of India.
The market regulator sought clarifications from L&T regarding the open offer. As a result of this delay, the committee of independent directors set up by Mindtree was unable to recommend to shareholders whether or not to take up the open offer.
As per the revised schedule, the independent directors of Mindtree have till 13 June to give their recommendations to stakeholders. The last date for revision of the offer price is 14 June.
The move was against the Mindtree founders, who did not want to be part of a large conglomerate. The weeks leading up to the buyout of Siddhartha’s majority stake by L&T saw the Mindtree founders taking all necessary steps to fend off the hostile takeover bid. This included a buyback of shares or a search for another white knight. The company’s moves failed on both counts.
Mindtree’s shares gained 0.39% to close at  ₹969 apiece on Thursday on the BSE while the Sensex gained 0.22% to close at 39,615.90 points."

Shares of Mindtree Ltd slumped 10.7% on Monday after the company said some key personnel in its top management have resigned. Mindtree’s founders have been vehemently opposing the company’s takeover by Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T), and hence their exit isn’t entirely surprising.
The Mindtree stock now trades at  ₹772, about 21% lower than the price at which L&T had offered to buy shares from the former’s shareholders. Following the open offer, L&T has ended up with an over 60% stake in Mindtree and has been categorised as its promoter.
But no sooner did it check in, and the erstwhile promoters checked out, investors have become worried about the potential disruption in operations. “Obviously the exits at the top create uncertainty. The new management has to build confidence and clients may take time to give new business. It that event it is likely we may see a slowdown in near term,"" said Nitin Padmanabhan, analyst, Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Kotak Institutional Equities has pared its revenue growth estimates for Mindtree for the current fiscal (FY20) to 7% from 12.7% earlier.
In the IT services business, client relationships are crucial and top 10% of employees control and run the business, said an analyst.
In Mindtree’s case, analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd point out that its greater exposure to short term discretionary spends require it to maintain high level of customer engagement. With some key executives exiting, this process will naturally get affected.
Much now depends on how L&T manages the transition. Holding on to the remaining top-level employees is crucial to limit the disruption in the business. Quick replacements for outgoing executives will also help shore-up the confidence.
Analysts expect moderation in the company’s performance in the recently concluded June quarter itself. In its recent interactions the outgoing management alluded to the slowdown in deal closures. “Mindtree indicated that new deal closures are getting delayed as clients are awaiting clarity over ownership with the ongoing L&T bid,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note on 17 June.
There are other headwinds for the Mindtree stock. “Post the recent proposal in union budget to increase public shareholding to 35%, it is unlikely L&T may want to raise its stake further in the company. In that event the outgoing promoters who hold around 13% in Mindtree will have to sell in the open market, which is a risk to the stock,"" said Padmanabhan.
Besides, some analysts have concerns about keeping L&T’s IT services arm and Mindtree as separate entities, given potential conflicts of interest. “Both companies have a rich client base which can be mined through complementary offerings. We hope that Mindtree will be eventually merged with L&T Infotech to make the most out the acquisition and eliminate any potential conflicts,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note."

MUMBAI :
Mutual funds reduced their exposure to commercial papers (CP) in June in the aftermath of the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) crisis.
According to data released by Prime Database on Friday, holdings of mutual funds in CP in value terms stood at  ₹3.72 trillion as on 30 June, down 13.69% from  ₹4.31 trillion in the previous month. It also marked a 24.4% fall from the all-time high of  ₹4.92 trillion on 31 August 2018.
The highest mutual fund holdings by value as on 30 June were in CPs issued by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, or Nabard (at  ₹24,989.50 crore), Housing Development Finance Corp. (at  ₹19,255.00 crore), Reliance Jio Infocomm (at  ₹14,516.60 crore), Vedanta (at  ₹14,478.80 crore) and Reliance Retail (at  ₹14,077.90 crore).
The issuers that saw the steepest fall in mutual fund holdings in commercial papers issued by them in value terms in June were Reliance Industries Ltd, National Housing Bank, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Larsen and Toubro Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd.
Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd, National Fertilizers Ltd, Power Finance Corp. Ltd and Vedanta saw the highest increase in mutual fund holdings in commercial papers by value in May.
Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database Group, said: “Mutual funds have significantly reduced their exposure to CPs, after the IL&FS crisis last year.""
IL&FS had defaulted on its debt in June 2018.
Back then, it had a debt obligation of  ₹91,000 crore. The contagion effect from the IL&FS debt crisis spread to at least two other major non-banking financial companies (NBFCs)—Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) and Reliance Capital Ltd (RCAP).
According to CARE Ratings Ltd, CP issuances in June aggregated  ₹50,950 crore, which was 31% lower than the previous month, and 65% lower than the corresponding month of the previous year.
“Housing finance companies (HFCs) and NBFCs on an aggregate level have raised funds amounting to  ₹16,955 crore, which is almost half of the amount raised in the previous month. HFCs accounted for 10.8% of total CP issuances in June while NBFCs accounted for 22.5%. In the corresponding period a year ago, both accounted for almost 60% of total issuances, out of which 22% share was of HFCs and the balance 38% of NBFCs,"" CARE Ratings said in a report on 16 July.
CARE Ratings added that interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India and the change in the monetary policy stance to accommodative have aided the fall in corporate bond and commercial paper yields in recent months. “In addition, easing of the liquidity conditions in the banking system, along with a decline in GSec yields further supported the fall in yields in both the markets,"" it added.
Holding of mutual funds in corporate bonds in value terms stood at  ₹5.80 trillion in June, down 4.13% from  ₹6.04 trillion in May. The highest ever holding of mutual funds in corporate bonds was in September 2017 at  ₹6.61 trillion.

13,2019-07-23,Larsen,"Barring the power segment, infra, defence, heavy engineering and hydrocarbons clocked good revenue growthL&T’s robust project execution skills played out in its favour despite challenging macroeconomic times

Will investors give a thumbs up to Larsen and Toubro Ltd’s (L&T’s) June quarter performance? The engineering conglomerate reported a surprise 11% year-on-year jump in order flows to  ₹38,700 crore. Note that investors had hammered the stock over the last few trading sessions, expecting a drop in order flows. The increase in order flows came primarily from the domestic market, despite tough conditions.
Although there were hardly any central government orders, public sector units and the private sector compensated.
Therefore, the order book of  ₹2.9 trillion, which was 9% higher than a year ago, should insure the company against near-term slowdown in the economy.
Besides order flows, the Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) margin was at 11.2%, or 100 basis points higher year-on-year. It also surpassed Bloomberg’s 14-brokerages’ average by 25 basis points.
However, a slight drag in margins of its core business of infrastructure (engineering and construction) mirrors pressure in long-gestation projects.
That said, L&T’s robust project execution skills played out in its favour despite challenging macroeconomic times. Barring the power segment, which has been languishing for long due to lack of orders, infrastructure, defence, hydrocarbons and heavy engineering segments clocked good revenue growth.
However, the 10% growth in total revenue to  ₹29,636 crore was lower than Bloomberg’s forecast of  ₹31,360 crore, because of the elimination of the electrical and automation segment, which was sold to Schneider Electric.
Operating leverage and strong execution together translated into 20.6% Ebitda growth.
To be sure, the infrastructure giant’s performance is commendable. But, there are concerns. Although the management has maintained its FY20 order flow and revenue guidance at 10-12% and 12-15%, respectively, it is cautious on the near-term outlook. The liquidity crunch in the system and weak consumption if allowed to fester, will delay economic revival.
According to ICICI Securities Ltd, “On the balance sheet side, borrowings increased a bit leading to higher interest cost while working capital (ratio up 200 bps YoY) and cash flows were impacted negatively.""
In spite of these odds, L&T coped well on the profit front. But the macroeconomic trend in the next two quarters remain crucial to gauge the company’s prospects; not to forget the impact of Mindtree Ltd’s consolidation in the September quarter results."

MUMBAI :
Engineering and construction conglomerate Larsen and Toubro (L&T) reported net profit of  ₹1473 crore, growing 21.2% year-on-year, and with operating margins improving by 100 basis points in the June 2019 quarter. A Bloomberg poll of 14 analysts had estimated net profit of  ₹1560.3 crore for the quarter.
The company reported consolidated revenue of  ₹29,636 crore, rising 10% year-on-year from  ₹27,005 crore in the year-ago period. L&T won new orders of  ₹38,700 crore during the quarter, registering a growth of 11% year-on-year. International orders account for 23% of order inflow. With the infrastructure and power segments accounting for the bulk of new orders, the consolidated order book stands at  ₹2.94 trillion as of June 30. Consolidated margins for the quarter improved to 11.2% from 10.2% in the year-ago period.
The company's management, however, has cautioned about private investment in infrastructure taking another 12-18 months, with new government contracts also being thin on the ground. ""In the first quarter, 50% of our orders came from the private sector, for building airports, campuses, data centres, and a large cement factory order. But do we see the industry adding capacity? No,"" said R Shankar Raman, CFO, L&T. ""There's no capital raising in the public market, the debt market is in a shambles and banks are hesitating to take credit risks. We should expect subdued orders from the private sector in the next 12-18 months. Order inflow will also depend on how much money is available with the government to finance projects.""
SN Subrahmanyan, MD and CEO, said: ""There is some turbulence in the payment cycle, but we expect it will ease out in 2-3 months. We are also seeing a general tightening of the fist and on liquidity from the government's side.""
Despite this, the company has maintained its FY20 guidance of 10-12% order book growth and 12-15% growth in revenues.
After the founders and CEO of Bengaluru-based IT firm Mindtree resigned and with L&T now holding 60.59% of the company, L&T said it will appoint the new CEO on August 2.
The infrastructure segment secured fresh orders of  ₹17,497 crore, lower by 10%, with margins falling slightly to 6.4%. It recorded customer revenue of  ₹13,865 crore, higher by 14% year-on-year. The power segment won orders of  ₹6700 crore and recorded revenue of  ₹561 crore, lower by 48% year-on-year because of a lower opening order book, the company said. The EBITDA margin for the quarter also stood at 3.3%, lower than 4.1% in the previous comparable period. The heavy engineering segment earned  ₹874 crore in revenue, defence earned  ₹965 crore while the hydrocarbon business earned  ₹3763 crore, with orders falling 28% here to  ₹3424 crore.
From its subsidiaries, L&T earned  ₹3819 crore of customer revenue from IT and Technology Services arm,  ₹3462 crore in financial services and another  ₹1149 crore realty, construction and mining machinery and the products and valves business. The electrical and automation segment, which is pending sale to Schneider Electric, clocked customer revenue of  ₹1359 crore. The company said it has received Competition Commission of India's approval and the sale will be completed in the next 1 year.
With the Bombay High Court halting work on the city's ambitious Coastal Road Project for want of adequate environment clearances, L&T as the contractor will has taken the setback in stride. ""The government has been asked to regularise approvals, we remain optimistic about it,"" SN Subrahmanyan, MD and CEO, said. He also highlighted the new Andhra Pradesh government's approach to review past project contracts and the disruption it causes in operations. ""We have some residential projects in AP under review. All projects which haven't achieved 25% billing in the state are under review.""."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court today issued notice in the appeal filed by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai against the Bombay High Court order that quashed the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) approval for the southern part of the Bombay Municipal Corporation’s (BMC)  ₹14,000-crore coastal road project.
Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Mukul Rohatgi appearing for the appellants appeared before the Apex court bench headed by the Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and comprising of Justice Deepak Gupta. The bench also refused to stay the Bombay court order but issued the notice to the opposite parties on the plea for interim relief. The case shall be next heard on 20 August.
This is setback for Maharashtra Govt, Larsen & Toubro (L&T) and Hindustan Construction Company (HCC) who are the main effected parties in the coastal road project.
Earlier this month, a bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Justice N.M. Jamdar on 17 July in a detailed judgement, asked the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to stop work till fresh environment clearances and notifications are obtained after a proper Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Work on the long-pending project had started in October, after the Union ministry of environment and forests (MoEF) issued the final clearance in May 2017. The court quashed various environmental clearances granted by the state and Central governments. The bench also held that there was a lack of “proper scientific study"" and this was overlooked by the MCZMA (Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority), EIA and MoEF.
The judgement came in response to a bunch of public interest litigations filed by two fishermen’s cooperatives, called Worli Koliwada Nakhwa Matsyavyavasay Sahakari Society Ltd and Worli Machchimar Sarvoday Sahakari Society, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) Vanashakti, Conservation Action Trust, Society for Improvement, Greenery and Nature, Bombay Environmental Action Group, and a number of architects and environmental activists, against MCGM, the department of fisheries, government of Maharashtra, MoEF and MCZMA, among other government authorities related to the project. All petitions were filed against different components of the project before construction began last year.
The expressway, when and if completed, is projected to be used by nearly 130,000 vehicles every day and reduce the 120-minute ride between South Mumbai and western suburbs to 40 minutes. The Shiv Sena-ruled MCGM is the implementing authority for the 29.2-km-long eight-lane highway."

MUMBAI :
Shares of Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd slumped 20%, or their maximum daily limit, to an all-time low on Tuesday after company founder and managing director V.G. Siddhartha went missing and was suspected to have committed suicide.
The stock tumbled  ₹38.50, or 20%, to  ₹154.05 on BSE. It is down 57% from its all-time high of  ₹360.20 on 22 January 2018. Year to date, the stock has lost 44.4%.
In an emergency meeting on Tuesday, the board of Coffee Day Enterprises said that it is confident that the professional management of the company and each of the entities in the Coffee Day Group and their respective leadership teams will ensure continuity of all business operations consistent with past behaviour.
In the interim, the board said it is evaluating and assessing the situation, formulating appropriate steps to ensure business operations are unaffected, and has resolved to cooperate with authorities.
“V.G. Siddhartha, our promoter and chairman and managing director has not been reachable since yesterday evening. We are shocked by this development and our thoughts and prayers are in support of his family and loved ones,"" said a company statement to the exchanges.
The incident rattled investor sentiment in an already gloomy environment. On Tuesday, the Sensex fell 289.13 points, or 0.77%, to 37,397.24, while the 50-share index Nifty declined 0.93% to 11,085.40.
Fear engulfed financial stocks on worries that the incident may deepen the liquidity crisis. Nifty PSU Bank index shed 4.88% while overall Nifty Bank index fell 1.72% on Tuesday.
“The latest episode of missing promoter of Coffee Day Enterprises has dealt a sentimental blow to investors who are already undergoing a lot of pain. The repercussion of this event on other entities is still being calculated,"" said Deepak Jasani, head of retail research, HDFC Securities Ltd.
The Coffee Day stock has been on a downward trend since March after Larsen & Toubro Ltd signed a deal with Siddhartha to buy his stake in software services company Mindtree. “Now, the unfortunate event of founder going missing and the alleged letter left by him underlines the crisis in the company. The letter in the media reveals that Siddhartha was under tremendous pressure from other lenders. From the information available, CCD is severely affected by the slowdown in the economy and liquidity crunch,"" said an analyst.
As of June, Siddhartha held 32.75% in Coffee Day Enterprises, of which he has pledged nearly 71.4%. Infosys co-founder Nandan Nilekani owns 2.6% while KKR Mauritius has a 6.07% stake in the company."

MUMBAI :
Sterling and Wilson Solar Ltd’s initial public offering (IPO) will test investor appetite for large issues.
After receiving an approval to raise  ₹4,500 crore, the promoters of the company have decided to sell shares worth  ₹3,125 crore.
At the higher end of the price band of  ₹780, the price-to-earnings ratio works out to about 20 times FY19 earnings. As such, there are no direct listed peers for Sterling and Wilson in India. Nonetheless, these valuations are similar to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T), and significantly higher than KEC International Ltd, both of which derive sizeable overseas revenues from EPC (engineering procurement and construction) work, although from different sectors.
Even so, Sterling and Wilson’s shorter execution cycles limit the working capital requirement, thereby offering superior returns. Furthermore, sizeable revenues come from overseas, where execution risks are comparatively lower. The promoters’ presence in a number of markets, industry relationships and project management expertise helps Sterling and Wilson Solar, which partly explains the IPO valuations.
“It is not easy for a normal EPC company to build such capability,"" says Deepak Agrawala, executive director (investment banking) at Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Revenue and profit, on an average, have grown 44-72% per annum in the last three fiscal years. The robust growth and steady profitability underscores Sterling and Wilson’s competitive advantage in utility scale projects.
That said, given the short execution cycles of solar power projects, it is crucial that the order book is replenished quickly. Note that excluding other income, the company’s profitability has remained stable despite the steady decline in tariffs across the globe. This was helped by high exposure to overseas projects, which are more remunerative than projects in India.
Even so, Sterling and Wilson’s Ebitda margin (excluding other income) of 7.8% is lower than 11.6% clocked by L&T and 10.5% by KEC for FY19. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Further, as projects in the overseas markets are increasingly being awarded through competitive bidding, suppressing tariffs, analysts fear profitability of the industry stakeholders will be compressed or capped.
According to one domestic market observer, the pressure ultimately comes on EPC. “We are living through a revolution in the costs of renewable power technology. Lower costs will boost wind and solar generation’s share of the power mix from the current 6% to a much higher level in coming years. This will create both opportunities and disruption in the industry,"" Alex Whitworth, research director at Wood Mackenzie, said in a recent note on renewables in Asia-Pacific."
9,2019-08-19,Larsen,"A.M. Naik says that India is exporting jobs instead of goodsMore than 10 million young people enter the job market every year in India

Mumbai: The government’s Make in India initiative has failed to create enough jobs as companies across sectors still prefer to import goods instead of manufacturing locally, said Larsen and Toubro Ltd chairman A.M. Naik.
“The Prime Minister’s Make In India programme, which is spoken about a lot, has to do a lot more. We are exporting jobs now instead of exporting goods,"" Naik, who also heads the National Skill Development Corp. (NSDC), a public-private partnership, said in an interview. “We have to find answers as to why most Indian companies are keen to import rather than manufacture here.""
The other reason for high imports is because Indian companies do not have enough financing options available, Naik said. “We allow imports because it often comes with credit facility.""
India, home to the world’s largest youth population, needs to create enough employment opportunities for the more than 10 million young people who enter the job market every year. The latest jobs report suggests that the country is not creating enough jobs for its massive population.
Economic growth slowed sharply to 5.8% in the three months ended 31 March, on the back of weak consumption and slowing private investment. Growth, according to some estimates, may weaken further in the current fiscal.
Naik said job creation, especially in the manufacturing sector, has failed to keep pace with the supply of skilled labour.
“The mismatch between the right skills and jobs will always be there. But it’s the gravity of the situation that matters the most,"" Naik said. “We need at least an economy equivalent to China’s since our population is almost the same. Otherwise, there is always going to be a shortage of jobs and unless the economy grows like it did in China, which means at least 12-13% growth every year, this disparity will remain.""
“We are not able to create jobs at the pace needed to bridge this gap,"" he said.
NSDC, set up in 2008 under the Union ministry of skill development and entrepreneurship, implements short-term skill development programmes of the government. According to NSDC’s 2018 annual report, it trained 3.98 million students that year, through 11,035 training centres across 40 skill development programmes. Only about 12% of those who were trained under NSDC programmes found jobs, according to government statistics.
Naik said his focus as chairman of NSDC is on improving the quality of trainers in the system. “We need high-quality staff and teachers for training,"" he said. “In smaller cities, the situation is quite pathetic and the teachers are very average. L&T is also setting up a training institute in Madh Island near Mumbai, which will offer residential training for teachers in the NSDC system. It will become operational from 1 April and start with five trades. “If this experiment is successful, we will open more such centres,"" he said.
Citing the ongoing trade war between the US and China as an emerging opportunity, Naik said that while several countries, including Vietnam and Thailand, have benefited from President Donald Trump’s diversification from China to other countries for manufacturing, India has failed to take advantage. “What did India do? If I was implementing this, I would have created a separate ministry on how to bring foreign investment and export-oriented business to India.""
“I strongly feel that Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to bring the Gujarat model to the national level,"" Naik said, referring to Modi’s tenure as the chief minister of the state before he became the prime minister. Modi is credited with attracting large investments and creating a conducive environment for industry in the state."

By establishing its new European headquarters, Mindtree said in a statement that it will be better positioned to meet the needs of Europe-based customers and provide greater access to domain expertise where multi-disciplinary teams can ideate, design and craft meaningful digital experiences.
The new office is equipped with the first European Digital Pumpkin innovation hub, which aims to help clients discover and design their path to digital transformation success, the company said. The interactive hub is designed to “reimagine enterprise-wide solutions by leveraging the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, cognitive solutions, virtual and augmented reality, machine learning, conversational platforms, cloud and big data.""
Since the launch of Mindtree’s Bengaluru-based Digital Pumpkin in 2013 and the US-based Digital Pumpkin in 2017, the hubs have been the seedbeds behind more than 100 strategic digital transformation engagements, Mindtree said.

Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd. an Indian provider of information technology services, discriminates against people who aren’t South Asian when hiring workers at its U.S. facilities, according to a lawsuit filed by two former employees.
The ex-employees, both white Americans, allege that the Mumbai-based company’s U.S. workforce of 7,500 is 95% of South Asian decent and is mostly made up of visa holders from India.
The complaint filed Wednesday in New York is one of several similar cases accusing India’s big IT firms of hiring bias in the U.S. The first to go to trial ended last year in a victory for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., which was cleared by a California jury of discrimination claims.
Larsen & Toubro is accused of submitting fraudulent letters with visa applications to maximize the number of South Asians it hires in the U.S. The suit describes how the company would send a letter to the U.S. government, supposedly from a client, attesting to the need for certain employees to work in America. But the letters were drafted and signed by Larsen & Toubro, according to the complaint.
Larsen & Toubro is now under investigation by U.S. Customs and Immigration Services for the practices, according to the suit, which is seeking class-action status. In one example cited in the complaint, Larsen & Toubro allegedly submitted fake invitation letters purportedly signed by client Apple Inc.

The Indian markets may react to British Parliament's vote to delay a decision on Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal next week.

Mumbai: After disappointing investors with lower-than-anticipated earnings growth in the last few quarters, Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd’s second quarter was a welcome relief. The results were in line with market expectations, with no negative surprises and a promise of better margins in the second half of FY20. That perked up the stock up in trade on Friday, with LTI gaining 7%.
Investors are clearly relieved that LTI struck the right note this time, with 2.4% revenue growth quarter-on-quarter in constant-currency terms. Also, it won three large deals in the keenly competitive tech environment, which has been well-received by the markets.
The company seems to have shrugged off some of the past negatives. “Although in trade today the stock reacted sharply to results, we believe that this was due to the absence of negative surprise, as was the case in the past 2-3 quarters,"" said Emkay Financial Services in a note to clients.
In a conference call with analysts on Friday, the management clarified that account-specific events had soured performance in the first half. It now expects a ramp-up in deals announced last quarter, which, coupled with the new large deals, should give growth a fillip in the second half of FY20. In fact, the management maintains a double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY20, with a corresponding improvement in margins, which analysts consider a decent outlook.
In the recent past, investors have been worried about the growth outlook. The company’s first-half dollar revenues have shrunk to about 10% year-on-year. Note that over FY17-19, LTI notched about 18% annualised revenue growth. Three of its top clients have been struggling. But lately they have shown signs of stability. Hence, the outlook announced for the full year has reassured investors.
Revenue growth in most of the company’s verticals has been steady, with about 40% of LTI’s second-quarter earnings coming from Digital services. Most of its verticals saw strong double-digit revenue growth y-o-y, which is considered good given the headwinds in banking and finance, where growth was flat y-o-y. The firm is acquiring PowerupCloud Technologies Pvt Ltd, a cloud consulting firm, and this should add artificial intelligence and data analytics to its verticals.
Still, overall margin growth has not been as desired. In the second quarter, higher operating expenses pulled the Ebitda margin down to 18.1%, from 20.5% in the corresponding quarter the year prior. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Another worry is the marginal uptick in attrition in the second quarter. A lot will depend on LTI’s ability to scale up its operations in coming quarters, while maintaining margins. Besides, investors will look for synergies from the group's other IT services company, the newly acquired Mindtree Ltd."

1,2019-12-13,Larsen,"Strong pipeline makes it hopeful of returning to the top quartile of the industry-level growth rates in fiscal 2021LTI’s strategy of adding new business clients is progressing well

Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd’s (LTI’s) shares have had a rough ride this year, falling by about 6%, at a time when the Nifty IT index has risen about 10%. The company has been trying to send a message that it was on a recovery path. In a post-earnings call with analysts in October, the management had exuded confidence of acceleration in revenue growth in the second half of FY20.
The management backed up the claim at its latest analyst meetL&T Infotech. Deal flow remains strong. The overall order pipeline is 42% higher than last year, it said, adding that execution was gaining pace. “Well-oiled sales engine is improving visibility and could reflect in better 2H FY20E growth vs H1 and influences our constructive view,"" analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
LTI’s strategy of adding new business clients is progressing well. New clients constitute 35% of the deal pipeline, up from 19% last year.
Large deals pipeline is also notably higher than last year. More than half of the deals were in the “proposal-plus"" stage, implying a potential closure within six months. The strong pipeline makes LTI more hopeful of returning to the top quartile of the industry-level growth rates in FY21, said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.
The strong commentary and possible improvement in performance should hold the stock in good stead. But valuations at 17 times the FY21 earnings per share estimates are not particularly cheap.
Also, profitability has been under pressure, with the company continuing to invest in the business. Despite the revenue growth slowdown in the first half of FY20, LTI did not scale back investments. Better revenue growth should help the company absorb the costs better, improving profitability. The management alluded to this in the September quarter results earnings call.
Also adding to the concern is the recent visit by the US department of homeland security to LTI’s office in New Jersey, purported to be about H-1B visa petitions. Analysts fear an adverse ruling on this front can impact the company. “While such investigations are not singular for Indian IT services companies, the settlement timelines are long and may have financial implications (penalties/settlement charges),"" JM Financial analysts said in a note."
