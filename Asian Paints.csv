43,2018-01-19,Asian Paints,"In a bid to close the wide gap with Asian Paints, AkzoNobel is extending its premium brand Dulux to introduce mass paints under the Dulux Promise brand

Mumbai: Dutch paints and chemicals firm AkzoNobel India Ltd will focus its energies on the mass paints segment and new niches to help accelerate its growth in India, two top company executives said. 
Mumbai: Dutch paints and chemicals firm AkzoNobel India Ltd will focus its energies on the mass paints segment and new niches to help accelerate its growth in India, two top company executives said.
In a bid to close the wide gap between itself and Asian Paints Ltd, the country’s largest paints and coatings company by far, AkzoNobel is extending its premium brand Dulux to introduce mass paints under the Dulux Promise brand. This will now be a key focus for the company to help it build a presence outside India’s top metros and bring in new consumers.
“We find as a strategy that increasingly the fastest growing segment is the mass segment,"" David Teng, director – decorative paints, India and South Asia, said in an interview. “That means going out from the top 15-20 cities to secondary and tertiary markets. This is something we’re working on. This is our fastest growing segment too.""
“This is the sector we’re going to focus on, easily the most competitive right now,"" Jeremy Rowe, managing director of decorative paints, Southeast & South Asia, Middle East, said in an interview. “Apart from the big 4, there are also a bunch of smaller, local players in the mass market.""
AkzoNobel is also extending the brand to new categories, including waterproofing, and will look to make new “specialty"" offerings.
“We can leverage global technology to launch into specialist niches,"" Rowe said. “We entered waterproofing last year. You will see Dulux in a lot more categories than we were in the last 3-4 years.""
AkzoNobel has been in India since the 1950s, but has remained a distant player in the paints market after much larger leader, homegrown Asian Paints. While Asian Paints closed FY16-17 with over Rs34,000 crore in revenue, AkzoNobel India made just over Rs3,100 crore in the same time period, as per data from the BSE. Asian Paints also sells paints across the value chain from luxury emulsions to distempers.
“In a scenario where aggressive multinational managements are garnering market share from the top 2 players in the Indian paints sector, lack of ‘required’ focus from Akzo is leading to the company continuing to lose out to competition,"" equities brokerage firm Spark Capital said in a note on the firm dated 7 November 2017. “We believe with uncertainty at parent level (Akzo Nobel NV merger/takeover talks), lack of heightened focus alongside GST disruption coupled with aggressive competition in marketplace has led to the current underperformance of the company.""
Asian Paints and Berger Paints lead India’s paints market."
42,2018-01-22,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints' revenue from operations was flat at Rs4,267.49 crore, although comparable growth in revenue was 10.9% year-on-year, after GST effects on line items

Mumbai: Asian Paints Limited, the country’s largest paints firm, on Monday posted a 15.9% rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended 31December, even as revenue remained flat on a consolidated level. Profit from continuing operations was up 19.5% year-on-year. 
Mumbai: Asian Paints Limited, the country’s largest paints firm, on Monday posted a 15.9% rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended 31December, even as revenue remained flat on a consolidated level. Profit from continuing operations was up 19.5% year-on-year.
Asian Paints’ revenue from operations was flat at Rs4,267.49 crore, although comparable growth in revenue was 10.9% year-on-year, after GST effects on line items. Consolidated net profit for the period stood at Rs567.21 crore up from Rs489.31 crore in the December 2016 quarter.
“The Decorative Paints business registered single digit volume growth in the current quarter,"" K.B.S. Anand, managing director and chief executive of Asian Paints, said in a statement. “In the international markets, units in Bangladesh, Oman, Bahrain, and Nepal witnessed good growth. However, the international group performance was impacted by adverse exchange rate fluctuations in some key markets,"" he said.
However, the company’s input costs also rose rapidly, up 13.66% from a year earlier to Rs2,142.17 crore for the quarter. This was largely led by higher prices of crude and Titanium Dioxide, both crucial factors in paints markets. While Brent Crude prices hit a three-year high at $70 a barrel this month, prices of Titanium Dioxide are up nearly 38% since January 2016.
“There is not much by way of a base effect of demonetization because paints companies made most of their sales in the September quarter of 2016, during the festival Diwali season,"" Sachin Bobade, equity research analyst at Dolat Capital said. “We estimate volume growth for the quarter was at 7% year-on-year. This is still low, largely because demand in rural markets is low,"" he said.
“Asian Paints will have to take a price hike, because their gross margin is at just 150 basis points,"" Bobade said. “They are largely managing on reduced A&P (advertising and promotion) spends. I don’t expect A&P spending to rise until the company takes price hikes,"" he added.
Asian Paints is not satisfied with its volume growth rates and is considering a price hike, its management said in a conference call with analysts on Monday.
“We are definitely not happy with the volume growth we are getting,"" Anand said. “However, our value growth is reasonable. We don’t think we are losing market share, but the growth in the paints industry has not been good enough for us to grow higher.""
“The demand has not yet reached pre-GST levels in our opinion. The overall economy growth has still not reached the numbers it was reaching earlier,"" Anand added.
Stocks of Asian Paints Limited closed at Rs1,176.70 per share, down 1.40%, while the benchmark BSE Sensex closed 0.81% higher at 35,798.01 points. The results were declared after markets closed."

40,2018-01-24,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints, for the third consecutive quarter, saw its decorative paints volume growing in low single digits, despite a lower base due to demonetisation

The colour is fading from Asian Paints Ltd’s earnings performance, particularly in terms of volume growth and gross margins. 
The colour is fading from Asian Paints Ltd’s earnings performance, particularly in terms of volume growth and gross margins.
For the third consecutive quarter, the company saw its decorative paints volume growing in the low single-digits, despite a lower base due to demonetisation.
The company’s management attributed this soft growth to the weaker macro environment, adding that paint demand is yet to bounce back to pre-goods and services tax levels. Second, the extended monsoon and intensifying competition in south India, a key market for Asian Paints, impacted overall demand, it said in a post-earnings conference call. Further, early festive demand too impacted sales to some extent, added the company.
According to analysts, the paint maker has clocked around 6% volume growth in the third quarter.
Interestingly, peer Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd has reported double-digit growth in both decorative and industrial segments in the same quarter. 
Though the management is blaming subdued macro demand for disappointing volume growth, the fact that competitors continue to grow at a much faster rate is a concern, say analysts.
“For the past 4-5 quarters Asian Paints has been growing volumes much below its competitors. In 3Q Asian Paints’ volume growth was 6-7% versus nearly 12-13% volume growth for Kansai Nerolac. This divergence is yet to be fully explained, and there is a possibility that Asian Paints is losing market share. We need to watch this for a few more quarters to conclude,"" Credit Suisse said in a report.
However, the company believes that it has not lost market share.
Meanwhile, Asian Paints’ operating margins surprised positively, thanks to tight cost control and lower advertisement spends, but higher raw material costs eroded gross margins. Gross margins declined sharply by more than 150 basis points in the December quarter (100 basis points equal one percentage point). 
Prices of titanium dioxide (TiO2), rutile and other crude oil-based inputs are inching up. Though the company has not effected a price hike this quarter, it will take appropriate pricing action depending on input cost trends, added the management. TiO2 accounts for 20% of the company’s raw material costs.
The only way to curb further margin erosion is by way of a price increase, but some analysts are of the view that even with a price hike, Asian Paints’ gross margins would be lower on a year-on-year basis in the fourth quarter.
Worried about these issues and the company’s muted international operations, some brokerage firms have revised the company’s volumes and earnings estimates lower. The Street too punished the Asian Paints stock, which corrected nearly 2% intraday on Tuesday, ending the day down 0.76% at Rs1,167.70."

38,2018-04-19,Asian Paints,"After raising prices by around 1.5% in March, Asian Paints recently announced yet another price hike of nearly 2% effective May and peers are expected to follow suit

Paint companies are tackling persistent input cost pressure with price increases. After raising prices by around 1.5% in March, Asian Paints Ltd recently announced yet another price hike of nearly 2% effective May and peers are expected to follow suit. 
Paint companies are tackling persistent input cost pressure with price increases. After raising prices by around 1.5% in March, Asian Paints Ltd recently announced yet another price hike of nearly 2% effective May and peers are expected to follow suit.
Paint makers have effected a slew of price increases in the past few quarters mainly to protect margin erosion on the back of rising raw material expenses. In 2017, all paint firms announced aggregate price hikes of approximately 5.5% across segments. 
Though the price of titanium dioxide (TiO2), a key input material, is currently down by around 12% from its peak, it remains elevated (see Chart 1). Most Indian paint companies import TiO2.
Similarly, prices of crude oil have also inched up on a sequential and year-on-year basis. Many of the inputs used in the manufacture of paints include monomers and crude oil derivatives, and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. 
The price increases are expected to partially offset the impact of inflated raw materials on margins. 
According to ICICI Securities Ltd, gross margins of paint makers are expected to fall by 75-100 basis points year-on-year in the March quarter, but the margin contraction will be lower than the 150-300 basis points seen in the first nine months of fiscal year 2018 (FY18). A basis point is 0.01% (see Chart 2).
As the full impact of price hikes is realized, along with the planned hike from May, the brokerage house has factored in a 20-50 basis points expansion in its FY19 gross margin estimates.
As far as demand is concerned, year-end schemes and incentives provided to the dealers along with a favourable base will aid volume growth in decorative and industrial segments in the March quarter. That said, paint demand is yet to see a meaningful pickup. 
“Our survey of ~30 paint dealers pointed to a modest demand environment for decorative paints. While channel has recovered from goods and services tax (GST) impact and has restocked to pre-GST levels, substantial pick-up in consumer sentiment and spending remains elusive. Further, RERA implementation and sand shortage in several states continues to hurt demand from institutional buyers,"" IIFL Institutional Equities said in a report dated 9 April. RERA stands for the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act. 
Meanwhile, shares of key paint manufacturers are trading at an expensive one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of more than 40 times and considering the aforementioned issues, these valuations need to correct."

36,2018-05-11,Asian Paints,"The silver lining is that Asian Paints has taken price increases to offset cost inflation, and that has helped in revenue growth

There are shades of brightness in paint maker Asian Paints Ltd’s March quarter financial results. The decorative paint business in India has registered double-digit volume growth, thanks to better demand conditions. What’s not to like about that? Especially when this comes after three quarters of single-digit volume growth. Besides, operating profit margin rose, aided by the growth in volumes and some price increases.  
There are shades of brightness in paint maker Asian Paints Ltd’s March quarter financial results.

Especially when this comes after three quarters of single-digit volume growth. Besides, operating profit margin rose, aided by the growth in volumes and some price increases. 
But the cheer hasn’t spread all the way down to profits. A higher tax outgo and a decline in other income took a toll on net profit. It grew at a much slower pace of 4% to Rs496 crore, and was lower than Street expectations.
And that’s not all. Things are a bit dull when it comes to the company’s full-year numbers. At the beginning of fiscal year 2018 (FY18), Kotak Institutional Equities had forecast Asian Paints to grow its earnings per share by 20% from FY17. The company eventually ended up growing earnings by only 2.5%. Needless to say, that’s a big miss. The gap between expectations and actual performance was large in FY17 as well. 
“Expectations from FY2018 were high to begin with; GST (goods and services tax), good monsoons, busy state election cycle and the then-benign raw material environment were seen as a potent combination of tailwinds,"" wrote Kotak analysts in their note to clients. In this backdrop, performance has fallen far short of expectations. It’s little wonder that the company’s shares have underperformed the market in the past year.
Still, valuations are rich at 48 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year. Investor expectations remain lofty, despite big misses on past expectations. 
Kotak’s analysts say, “Clearly, narrative is the only thing that matters for the Indian FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) stocks, for now. Poor delivery? No fuss.""
Going ahead, there isn’t much relief on the costs front either. Raw material prices of titanium dioxide, rutile and other crude oil-based inputs are inching up and these should weigh on profit margins in the coming quarters.
The silver lining is that Asian Paints has taken price increases to offset cost inflation, and that has helped in revenue growth. But whether earnings growth catches up with the company’s sky-high valuations this year, that’s another matter altogether."
35,2018-05-11,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints on Thursday reported 3.39% increase in consolidated net profit at Rs495.91 crore for the quarter ended March 2018

New Delhi: Shares of Asian Paints on Friday surged over 6% as the company reported 3.39% increase in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2018.  
New Delhi: Shares of Asian Paints on Friday surged over 6% as the company reported 3.39% increase in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 2018. 
The stock rose sharply by 6.17% to close at Rs1,289.60 on BSE. During the day, it zoomed 6.56% to Rs1,294.40—its 52-week high. At NSE, shares of the company jumped 5.53% to end at Rs1,285.05. The stock was the top performer among the blue chips on both Sensex and Nifty. 
Following the sharp rise in the stock, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the company climbed Rs7,185.15 crore to Rs1,23,698.15 crore. In terms of equity volume, 3 lakh shares of the company were traded on BSE and over 47 lakh shares changed hands at NSE during the day. 
Asian Paints on Thursday reported 3.39% increase in consolidated net profit at Rs495.91 crore for the quarter ended March 2018. The company had posted a net profit of Rs479.61 crore in the January-March quarter a year ago. It reported a total income of Rs4,531.52 crore in the fourth quarter as against Rs4,442.25 crore in the corresponding period a year ago, Asian Paints said in a BSE filing."
34,2018-07-17,Asian Paints,"Ahead of their June quarter results, shares of Asian Paints and Berger Paints have hit new 52-week highs intraday on NSE on 11 July and 12 July, respectively

Paint firms may finally manage to put the gloss back on their earnings performance. Not only is volume growth anticipated to be robust, but the margin picture is set to get pretty. Ahead of their June quarter results, shares of key paint makers Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd have rallied. These stocks touched new 52-week highs intraday on the National Stock Exchange on 11 July and 12 July, respectively. 
Paint firms may finally manage to put the gloss back on their earnings performance. Not only is volume growth anticipated to be robust, but the margin picture is set to get pretty. Ahead of their June quarter results, shares of key paint makers Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd have rallied. These stocks touched new 52-week highs intraday on the National Stock Exchange on 11 July and 12 July, respectively.
Volume growth in the decorative paints business is likely to be in double digits. The improvement would be partially aided by a lower base due to the impact of destocking during the transition to the goods and services tax.
According to ICICI Securities Ltd, Asian Paints would report its second consecutive quarter of double-digit decorative paints volume growth of 13-14%, suggesting a particularly steady recovery trend.
Its peers Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd are also seen continuing their double-digit decorative volume growth momentum with 14-15% growth. The latter’s industrial paints business is seen posting high single-digit volume growth.
As for margins, they are poised to expand, despite input cost inflation, thanks to price hikes.
All paint makers announced multiple price hikes across product categories in the last one year, aggregating around 5.5-5.8%. This includes the recent price increases of around 1.5% in March and 2% in May.
While the cost of titanium dioxide (TiO2)—a key raw material—has softened from its peak, crude oil prices have risen sharply. TiO2 prices have declined by about 5% when compared to a year ago, but remain high sequentially.
According to analysts, the Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin for Asian Paints and Berger Paints is seen expanding in the range of 80-100 basis points compared to the year-ago period. A basis point is 0.01%.
However, given a comparatively higher exposure to the industrial paints segment, Kansai Nerolac’s margins may contract. Usually, it takes a longer time to pass on cost increases here than in the decorative paints segment. A higher margin base could add to the pain, add analysts.
What investors also need to watch out for is the impact of the recent weakness in the rupee. Most Indian paint companies meet their raw material requirements, especially TiO2, through imports. This makes them vulnerable to a depreciating local currency. CLSA India Pvt. Ltd cautions about a negative impact of adverse currency movements on net importers such as Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac Paints.
Meanwhile, on a year-to-date basis, shares of Asian Paints and Berger Paints India have posted 18.2% and 11% returns, respectively. During the same span, the Nifty 500 index has given negative returns.
As for valuations, on a one-year forward price-to-earnings basis, Asian Paints and Berger Paints trade at 52 times and 50 times, respectively. Despite their outperformance, these valuations are too expensive for comfort."
33,2018-08-23,Asian Paints,"Had there been no GST rate cut, paint makersincluding Asian Paints and Berger Paintswould have hiked prices again due to higher raw material costs

The rupee depreciation has impacted India’s paint makers, given that the raw materials are mostly imported. The surging cost of Brent crude has kept prices of crude oil-based derivatives, monomers and TiO2 (titanium dioxide) at higher levels for the past few quarters. 
The rupee depreciation has impacted India’s paint makers, given that the raw materials are mostly imported. The surging cost of Brent crude has kept prices of crude oil-based derivatives, monomers and TiO2 (titanium dioxide) at higher levels for the past few quarters.
As a consequence, paint prices were raised by around 5% in fiscal year 2018. Prices were hiked by 2-3% in the June quarter as well. Increased prices, along with some cost-saving measures, aided operating margins of decorative paints market leader Asian Paints Ltd, and Berger Paints India Ltd in the three months ended June.
Subsequently in July, the goods and services tax (GST) on paints was reduced from 28% to 18%. Given the anti-profiteering clause under GST, paint makers passed on the full benefit to consumers by slashing prices.
Had it not been for the GST anti-profiteering clause, paint companies would have simply raised prices this time too, given that historically, the industry passes on the burden of increased costs to consumers to protect its margins.
According to the Asian Paints management, following the GST rate cut, it will be difficult to take fresh price hikes in the short term to avoid the anti-profiteering clause.
In a post-earnings conference call with analysts, the management said pressure on gross margins will increase in the coming quarters as firms will refrain from taking price hikes despite input cost inflation.
On the other hand, competitor Berger Paints India told analysts that considering the rising raw material costs and the rupee depreciation, it may take a price hike in ensuing quarters to maintain margins.
While it remains to be seen how paint companies tackle this, in case no price increase is undertaken, gross margins are estimated to get squeezed by 20-30 basis points in the September quarter, according to analysts. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. Further, increased pressure on margins will restrict overall earnings growth for paint makers in 2018-19 to some extent."

New Delhi: Asian Paints, which humanised the concept of home through ‘Har ghar kuch kehta hai’ (every home has a story of its own) brand positioning, is highlighting the importance of how people add colour and warmth to homes in its new ad campaign. 
Made by advertising agency Ogilvy India, the television commercial https://youtu.be/Tsr__4-YTYs shows how people and the joy of redecorating one’s home can create colourful moments and memories. 
The ad spot features an elderly couple, who are empty nesters, recreate a sense of home with strangers. 
The film concludes with a wall adorned with photographs and colourful memories with their paying guests in the couple’s home, beautifully capturing the brand message, ‘Ghar sajta hai uski chahal pahal se’ (a home is beautiful when there are people in it). 
“With the new corporate TVC ‘People add colour’, our core objective is to recapture the essence of how people who live under the same roof bring colour to each other’s lives, and highlighting the emotional equity a home holds. Building on our positioning and expression of ‘Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai’, we aim to resonate with our consumers by instilling empathy and meaning into decor,"" according to Amit Syngle, chief operating officer, Asian Paints Limited. 
Apart from 20 second films, the campaign will be promoted across print, outdoor, retail promotion, radio spots, digital engagement and on-ground activation. 
“People make homes beautiful. This campaign celebrates this thought and encourages people to make their homes happier. The launch film for this campaign is a beautiful story of an empty nester couple. A story that will probably resonate with many people across India. When their son leaves for studying abroad, the couple decides to redecorate their son’s room and open it for other children. Filling their life with joy and making their home happier again,"" said Sukesh Nayak, chief creative officer, Ogilvy Mumbai. 
Founded in 1942, Asian Paints is known for its popular heart warming advertising. It’s mascot Gattu — born in 1954 and designed by renowned cartoonist RK Laxman — remains one of India’s most memorable brand icons. In 2002, the brand consciously shifted from a colour focused positioning to one that invoked pride in one’s home: ‘Har ghar kuch kehta hai’, which remains one of the most popular advertising campaigns of all times. It also runs a digital series on celebrity homes. 
Talking about the new campaign, Vivek Dutta, executive planning director​ at advertising agency Hakuhodo India, feels the storyline is simple, and demonstrates the need and importance of human relationships. “Paint category is a commodity category. The biggest need of the category is to maintain top of the mind recall. For a brand like Asian Paints it is important to keep up with consumer mindshare by latching on emotions rather than just attributes and features. This campaign does justice to that effort."""

Overall, we still don’t see a great reason for people to buy stocks or take positions at this point,"" Pattabiraman added.

27,2018-11-26,Asian Paints,"Because the benefit of the oil price drop depreciation will come with a lag, the pain on the margins front may not yet be over for Asian Paints, Berger Paints, Kansai Nerolac and Pidilite

Crude oil prices have corrected by over a fifth in the last one month. At the same time, the rupee, which had taken a hard knock, is stabilizing. This comes as a huge relief for companies who were hit by the double whammy of rising crude oil and a falling rupee. Paint and adhesive makers are the major beneficiaries. In the last one month, shares of Asian Paints Ltd, Berger Paints India Ltd, Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd and Pidilite Industries Ltd have risen between 10% and 19%, outperforming the broader market. 
Crude oil prices have corrected by over a fifth in the last one month. At the same time, the rupee, which had taken a hard knock, is stabilizing. This comes as a huge relief for companies who were hit by the double whammy of rising crude oil and a falling rupee. Paint and adhesive makers are the major beneficiaries. In the last one month, shares of Asian Paints Ltd, Berger Paints India Ltd, Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd and Pidilite Industries Ltd have risen between 10% and 19%, outperforming the broader market.
Monomers and titanium dioxide used in paints are derived from crude oil, and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. Similarly, vinyl acetate monomer is also a crude oil derivate and a key raw material for making adhesives. It accounts for 60% of Fevicol maker Pidilite’s total raw material cost.
And since these firms meet their input material requirements through imports, this undesirable combination was hurting their margins.
But while the favourable moves in the crude oil and forex markets are welcome, it will take some time for these developments to reflect in their earnings, especially on the gross margins front. On account of hedges and advance purchase of materials, benefits of a price drop usually reflect with quite a lag.
In the September quarter, these companies saw their gross margins shrink 150-400 basis points on a year-on-year basis. And in a bid to curb further margin erosion, they took price hikes of around 3% effective October. So far in FY19, prices of these products have been increased by nearly 5%.
But, because the benefit of the price drop depreciation will come with a lag, the pain on the margins front may not be over for these companies yet. As such, some investors may well be disappointed with the results in the near term. Even recent management commentary suggests caution on the margin front.
Meanwhile, the demand outlook for these sectors is upbeat. Paint companies have guided for double-digit volume growth in the decorative paints segments. Having said that, valuations of some of these stocks are expensive at 43-60 times FY19 earnings, especially given the earnings growth expectations of around 20% at best."

Here are 10 things to know about stock market fall today
1) Among 30 Sensex stocks, just two stocks - Maruti Suzuki and Coal India - managed to close in the green. Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, Tata Motors, Asian Paints and Reliance Industries fell between 3% and 4% . Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slumped 6% after the private sector lender said that it has challenged in court the RBI’s decision to disregard the issue of preference shares to reduce promoter stake in bank.
2) The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure BSE midcap and smallcap indices also falling nearly 2% each. 
3) Some analysts expect a knee-jerk reaction from the markets, depending on the outcome of the state election results. G Chokkalingam, founder & managing director of Equinomics Research & Advisor, said: “There may be knee-jerk reaction in the markets depending upon the outcome. We firmly believe that the results of state elections do not matter much for the stock markets for the long term.""
4) Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, says: “Any correction may be gradually bought into as markets will discount state election results as macros are improving for India."" Global oil prices are down from around $86 a barrel in October to around $60 now. This had sparked a 5% rally in Nifty in November. 
5) Rahul Sharma, senior research analyst at Equity99, said investors should stay cautious ahead of the outcome of state elections. On the economic front, industrial production data for October and retail inflation data for November will be declared on Wednesday. 
6) Asian markets slid today, extending their recent slide on worries over slowing global growth and fears that a fresh flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing could quash any chances of a trade deal. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.7%, falling to a two-week low.
7) Global markets were already reeling on news last week that Canadian officials had arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the US. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies.
8) White House trade adviser Peter Navarro’s comments that US officials would raise tariff rates on Chinese imports if the two countries could not come to an agreement during a 90-day negotiating period fanned fresh concerns over US-China trade relations.
9) Data released over the weekend showed China reporting far weaker than expected November exports and imports, underscoring concerns over slower global growth. 
10) Further adding to concerns for the Indian markets, oil prices rose today, extending gains from Friday when producers club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. Brent crude edged up 0.2% to $61.79 per barrel."

Stocks of paint companies have risen as much as 33% from their lows seen in the December quarter. With crude oil prices easing and the rupee stabilizing, a key headwind for paint makers is behind them. This should have caused a relief rally; but it has extended into exuberance.
While analysts are upbeat on the sector’s volume growth prospects in the medium term, as well as the relief on the margin front, some of them have revised their ratings on these stocks because of high valuations.
“Given the steady uptrend in stock prices recently, we revise our ratings on Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac from Buy to Hold and on Berger Paints and Pidilite Industries from Add to Hold,"" ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 31 December.
Standard Chartered Bank has removed Asian Paints from its list of top stock picks. “The current stock price factors all positives related to softening of raw material cost pressures faster than our expectations. Hence, we would like to book profits and exit the stock from the list,"" it said in a note to clients on 20 December.
From its peak in early October, Brent crude prices have corrected by more than 35%. Similarly, the rupee has recovered by around 7% from the low of 74.39/US dollar it touched on 9 October.
Monomers and titanium dioxide are derivatives of crude oil and used in producing paints. So, easing crude oil prices have resulted in moderation of their cost as well. They account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector.
Similarly, vinyl acetate monomer is a crude oil-based chemical and a key raw material for making adhesives. It accounts for 60% of Fevicol maker Pidilite Industries Ltd’s total raw material cost. Most of these input materials are sourced via imports.
Usually, the benefits of favourable moves in the crude oil and/or foreign exchange markets reflect with a lag on the earnings of these companies, especially on the gross margins front. This is because of hedges and advance purchase of materials.
As pointed above, margin gains can’t be ignored. But with valuations of about 40-50 times one-year forward earnings, the markets are pricing in these gains and much more."
24,2019-03-15,Asian Paints,"Colour Next, a trend-mapping initiative by Asian Paints announced its trend report for 2019 at India Design IDThe trend-mapping initiative, now in its 16th edition, focuses on the Indian mood and regional cultures

Luxury is in a flux. So says Colour Next, a trend-mapping initiative by Asian Paints with a focus on influences specific to contemporary India. At India Design ID (12-15 February) in Delhi, the brand announced its compendium of trends for 2019.
One of the key trends for the year, F-Lux, roots luxury in authentic experience, details and storytelling. Minimalism is a defining factor in this one. Hammered metal and handwoven silk are materials of choice, and textures reference the Japanese art of kintsugi. The colour palette ranges from pale beiges and ivory to deeper hues like plum, which is also Colour Next’s official colour of 2019 (titled Awakening).
But minimalism isn’t the only way forward. The Enchanted trend, which emphasizes surreal patterns and use of glass and organza, offers a larger-than-life take on design. At the other end of the spectrum, Harvest offers a fresh take on sustainability, spotlighting the use of technology and bio-materials to find new design solutions. Think organic wall paints and furniture made from fungi and snail shells. Millennials make an appearance in the final trend presented by the report—Adulting—characterized by bright colours, pop culture décor and marquee lights.
While global trend forecasting organizations like Pantone make headlines with their annual pick, Colour Next focuses on the Indian mood and regional cultures. “We see international influences, as well as what’s happening in our country,"" says Amit Syngle, chief operating officer of the brand, adding that over 16 years, research by Colour Next has influenced varying industries, from automobiles to consumer durables. “We felt that because earlier people (in India) had nothing, they would by default take Pantone’s help. But now things are changing as people realize that Indian research is very valuable."""
23,2019-04-10,Asian Paints,"Since the market for distempers and putty is largely fragmented, getting a handle on their market size is difficultGrowth at Asian Paints, Berger Paints and Kansai Nerolac is likely to be aided by better sales of distempers and putty in Q4 

Low-value products such as putty and distemper are fast gaining traction. A recent survey of around 30 paint dealers across India conducted by IIFL Institutional Equities Ltd indicated sustained market share gains for these products in the March quarter.
Since the market for these products is largely fragmented, getting a handle on their market size is difficult. However, dealers’ feedback is largely in line with management commentaries of key paint makers.
Post the December quarter earnings, Asian Paints Ltd told analysts that sales of distemper remained buoyant. In the September quarter, it had pointed out that the share of distemper and wall putty has been on an uptrend.
So, what is driving demand here? According to Asian Paints, this increase was led by channel stocking for the festive season and potential market share gains from the unorganized segment.
Peer Berger Paints India Ltd told analysts that tailwinds from reduction in the goods and services tax (GST) rate would result in healthy growth in the distemper and putty segments. GST on paints, varnishes and putty was reduced from 28% to 18% in July 2018.
And looks like the rate reduction measures are bearing some fruits. “Industry participants have witnessed increasing use of putty in rural areas. Direct application of paints on cemented or plastered walls is now reducing as rural consumers become aware of the benefits of applying putty over these walls before painting,"" ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 1 April.
Other factors such as increase in incentives to painters for putty purchases along with paints have helped. However, in the long term, this trend may not sustain. Berger Paints India believes that the changing mix of sales growth across the industry was fuelled by a pickup in sales growth of distemper and putty. And this would normalize going forward, as benefits from the GST rate reduction start to reflect in the base, the company told analysts.
But for now, sector analysts expect high growth in low-value products to aid volume growth for paint companies in the March quarter of fiscal year 2019."

NEW DELHI :
Asian Paints today reported dip in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, hurt by high raw material prices and higher marketing spends. Net profit dropped to  ₹487 crore, down from  ₹495 crore in the previous corresponding period. Asian Paints revenue from operations rose to 11.7 % to  ₹5,018 crore, from  ₹4,492 crore in the year-ago period.
The decorative business segment in India registered double-digit volume growth in the fourth quarter while the industrial coatings JV (AP-PPG) witnessed good growth in the dealer channel for both, powder and protective coatings. 
But automotive coatings JV (PPG-AP) growth was impacted as a result of the slowdown in the auto segment.

16,2019-05-09,Asian Paints,"Volume growth has come at the expense of realizations, as seen by its lower-than-estimated revenue growthConsolidated net profit at  ₹473 crore fell 1.6% year-on-year, lower than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹587 crore

Shares of Asian Paints Ltd fell 2.3% on Thursday after the company reported a dull performance in the March quarter. The leader in the decorative paints segment missed expectations on most key parameters. Consolidated net profit at  ₹473 crore fell 1.6% year-on-year, lower than Bloomberg’s consensus estimate of  ₹587 crore. Revenue of  ₹5,018 crore was also disappointing, falling short of the consensus estimate of  ₹5,223 crore.
“While the company has taken price hikes amounting to 6% during fiscal year 2019, the price growth of around 2% for the quarter was disappointing. The product mix is more likely to be skewed towards low-end products such as Putty, which would have led to lower price growth. This has resulted in lower than expected revenue growth for the quarter,"" Naveen Kulkarni, senior head of research at Reliance Securities Ltd, said in a note.
Operating margin also narrowed, impacted by high raw material costs and advertisement spends. Further, the management said that challenging business conditions affected operations in some of its key overseas markets, especially in Egypt, Ethiopia, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
The only bright spot in the results was a double-digit volume growth in its decorative paints business. But investors shouldn’t get carried away by this.
After all, the much-talked about India consumption story has hit a rough patch. March quarter earnings of Hindustan Unilever Ltd showed that fast-moving consumer goods firms were feeling the heat. So, for consumer discretionary products, such as paints, an extended consumption slowdown could translate into subdued demand going ahead.
Analysts also point out that this volume growth for Asian Paints has come at the expense of realizations, as indicated by its below-than-estimated revenue growth. And considering the current volatility in crude oil prices, it is difficult to gauge if raw material pressure is completely out of the way. Since most of the raw materials are imported, a further depreciation in the rupee could add to the pain. Also, in the absence of robust demand, taking further price hikes to protect margins would be tough.
Asian Paints’ shares have declined about 12% from their highs in April this year. But as for valuations, akin to most firms in the consumption basket, its price-to-earnings (P-E) multiple remains high. As the alongside chart shows, the stock trades at a one-year forward P-E of 46 times and is the most expensive listed Indian paint stock. No doubt these valuations are expensive and what makes them look even more unjustified is this lacklustre earnings performance."
15,2019-05-30,Asian Paints,"Easing cost pressure a positive but slowdown in consumption demand hit volumesDespite dull earnings, Berger Paints is trading at expensive valuations akin to peers

The Berger Paints India Ltd stock was trading in the red ahead of its March quarter results on Thursday. Given that bigger peer Asian Paints Ltd reported dismal earnings for the last quarter, the Street’s nervousness wasn’t surprising.
Berger Paints India’s consolidated earnings were a miss both on the profit and revenue front. Net profit increased by about 5% year-on-year to  ₹111.43 crore, lower than Bloomberg analysts’ consensus poll of  ₹129.4 crore. True, revenue increased at a faster pace of 14% year-on-year to  ₹1,472.09 crore but even that fell short of the Street’s expected  ₹1,518.5 crore.
As for volumes, similar to Asian Paints, Berger Paints India’s decorative paints business saw low double-digit growth, according to analysts’ estimates. Not surprisingly, the overall slowdown in consumption demand has weighed on volumes.
Note that the company derives more than 75% of its revenue from decorative paints. As such, analysts aren’t too worried about the sluggish automobile demand impacting its industrial paints segment. That said, investors would have to closely monitor the impact of the ongoing consumption slowdown on the sector in general.
One comforting factor is that the cost of raw materials consumed has declined by around 3% in the March quarter on a sequential basis. On a year-on-year basis though, it remains high. Still, it helps that crude oil prices are showing signs of cooling off. In the last one year, Brent crude prices have dropped by 11%. As the chart alongside shows, the price of titanium dioxide, a key raw material, decreased by around 7% on a year-on-year basis. Also, prices of some crude oil-based solvents and monomers are said to have softened during the March quarter.
This could be a factor why the Berger Paints India stock ended the day’s session slightly higher compared to Wednesday.
Even so, the worry is given the subdued demand outlook, steep price hikes may not come in a hurry. Accordingly, a meaningful improvement in operating margin, which was below expectations during the March quarter, may still be few quarters away. Moreover, the risk from a weak rupee remains since many raw materials are imported.
Valuations, though, paint a brighter picture. The Berger Paints India stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 44.76 times, a bit lower than 51.07 times that peer Asian Paints is trading at.
While comparatively cheaper, Berger Paints India’s valuations may not be justified. Add to that, the weak earnings show is hardly encouraging. The company’s shares have corrected by 9% on a year-to-date basis, underperforming the Nifty 500 index, which posted 7% returns in the same span. Perhaps, Berger Paints India’s investors are taking cognizance of the demand outlook."
14,2019-06-11,Asian Paints,"According to estimates, nearly 55% of the raw material used by paint companies are crude oil derivativesIn fact, with crude oil prices on a weak footing now, the outlook on margins has improved

At a time when volume growth is lacklustre, a welcome development for paint companies is the easing of input cost inflation. Paint producers Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd have cut prices for their enamel products by 2-3%, to pass on the moderation in crude oil prices.
In a post-earnings conference call, Berger Paints’ management highlighted that a price reduction across its enamel portfolio would not have a material impact on its earnings. “Enamels account for 15-18% of the decorative industry sales, in our view,"" it said.
Analysts tend to agree. Apart from the high correlation of enamel with crude oil prices, the other reason margins are unlikely to be significantly impacted is the low share of these products in the overall revenue contribution, they said.
In fact, with crude oil prices on a weak footing now, the outlook on margins has improved.
“Gross margins of paint companies declined for the second consecutive year in fiscal year 2019 by 100-335 basis points (bps). However, crude oil price has corrected recently (WTI crude down c.15% over FY19 average). We build-in 50-70bps expansion in gross margins in FY20 for all paint companies,"" ICICI Securities Ltd said in a report on 5 June. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point and WTI is West Texas Intermediate crude oil.
Apart from softening raw material prices, price hikes taken in the decorative paints portfolio by these companies would also help. In FY19, paint makers had announced a nearly 6% aggregate price hike.
Brent crude prices have declined nearly 15% from their recent peak of $74.57 per barrel seen in April 2019. According to analysts’ estimates, nearly 55% of raw material used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives. These account for 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector.
As for volume growth, despite a dull FY19, companies are anticipating decorative paints volumes to recover to double-digits in FY20. According to analysts, the outlook on industrial paints remains subdued due to muted automobile demand. Revival in decorative paints would depend on how soon the consumption slowdown eases, they said.
Meanwhile, paint stocks are trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 50-42 times. These valuations are expensive considering their poor returns. While these stocks have been underperforming the Nifty 500 index this year, a look at their valuation multiples suggests the correction should continue."

8,2019-07-24,Asian Paints,"Despite a demand slowdown, volume growth in decorative paints surprised with decent growthMargins, in-line with expectations, improved due to easing input costs and lower expenses

Shares of Asian Paints Ltd jumped nearly 6% from their intra-day low on Wednesday after the company reported surprisingly decent June quarter results. Considering the ongoing consumption slowdown, expectations weren’t very high. But Asian Paints reported high double-digit volume growth in its key decorative paints segment. Analysts say year-on-year (y-o-y) volume growth for the June quarter works out to around 16%, higher than the 10.5% growth in the March quarter.
What’s more, the company also exceeded analysts’ expectations on other key parameters such as net profit and revenue.
Consolidated net profit at  ₹655 crore was up around 18% y-o-y, beating Bloomberg analysts’ consensus profit estimate of flat profit at  ₹550 crore. Similarly, revenue at  ₹5,130.63 crore was better than the anticipated  ₹4,885.8 crore.
In a post-earnings conference call with analysts, the company management said an aggressive channel push through incentive schemes at its dealers end aided volumes. Besides, it mentioned a low base-effect, since the company had witnessed de-stocking in the year-earlier period in anticipation of a change in goods and services tax (GST) on paints. The company also pointed to some benefits coming from the GST-led demand shift to the organized sector.
But if an aggressive channel push had a role to play, that may mean lower growth in the future. In the quarters ahead, unless demand significantly improves, repeating such a volume growth will be challenging.
After all, the automotive and industrial coatings businesses continue to be impacted by the severe slowdown in the automobile industry and the overall slowdown in the economy.
Of course, none of these challenges were reflected in the first quarter results. Margins improved on the back of benign raw material costs and a stable currency. Prices of titanium di-oxide, a key crude-based input material, have eased by around 10% y-o-y and 6% sequentially. The company took marginal price cuts in some categories to pass on the benefit to customers. Besides, lower overhead costs helped improve margins.
Asian Paints’ closing price of  ₹1483.40 on the NSE is not too far away from its 52-week high of  ₹1529.85 seen in April. It has largely bucked the bearish trend on the Street.
On the valuations front, the stock is trading at one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 52 times. It is the most expensive stock among peers. It is also one of the dearest in the consumption-focused basket of stocks.
Although June quarter earnings may have beaten estimates, there is limited clarity on a revival in consumption. Further, since the company has significant exposure to rural areas, sustaining such a performance would also depend on how the monsoon pans outs, which, so far, hasn’t been impressive. Also, challenges in the international business remain a drag on the company’s overall earnings performance."

The dollar’s gains weighed on gold, which fell back to $1,416.76 per ounce from last week’s peak of $1,452.60.

Benign raw material prices, however, supported the margins for the entire coatings business, he said.
""In the international operations, key units like Egypt and Sri Lanka continued to witness challenging business conditions impacting the overall performance,"" he added.
Shares of Asian Paints were trading 1.10% higher at  ₹1,444 apiece on the BSE.

7,2019-08-22,Asian Paints,"A good monsoon, govt’s inclination to improve rural fortunes are likely to improve the demand situation in the second halfThe volume performance of consumer staples firms in the June quarter shows that some companies have fared better compared to others

India’s largest biscuit maker Parle Products has said it may have to lay off up to 10,000 employees if the consumption slowdown persists. Parle’s rival and listed company Britannia Industries Ltd had earlier said, while announcing its June quarter results, that consumers are thinking twice before buying even a  ₹5 pack biscuit.
But how severe is the slowdown?
“There is some underlying demand slowdown, for sure, but the deceleration is not as sharp as the reported growth comps suggest,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a 20 August report.
According to analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd, “Consumer staples’ volume growth was relatively resilient in Q1FY20 despite the slowdown brouhaha.""
As the chart shows, while sales growth of consumer discretionary firms has declined, these firms are still growing at a fairly decent pace. Asian Paints Ltd, for instance, reported 17% increase in volumes in the June quarter.
The volume performance of consumer staples firms in the June quarter shows that some companies have fared better compared to others. For perspective: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) clocked volume growth of 5%, moderating from the March quarter volume growth of 7%. Volume growth for Marico Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and ITC Ltd were 6%, 5%, 9.6% and 3% (estimated), respectively.
“Dabur is generally seen as the stock to play the ‘rural’ theme and here, we have the company report the highest growth (off a high base; so, no base benefit) in a quarter where nearly all companies suggested a sharp rural slowdown,"" wrote Kotak analysts.
While announcing the June quarter results, the HUL management said the rural market, which was earlier growing ahead of urban, is now growing at par with it. This trend was highlighted in the previous quarter as well.
Of course, the slowdown has cast a shadow on consumer stocks. The Nifty FMCG index has underperformed the Nifty 50 so far this calendar year.
Besides, management commentary during the earnings calls wasn’t upbeat on near-term demand. However, some expect the demand situation to improve in the second half of the year aided by a good monsoon and government’s inclination to improve rural fortunes.
“We believe, demand will pick up from Q4FY20 (even companies believe so) once payouts under direct transfer schemes and better monsoon lead to more money in the hands of consumers,"" said Edelweiss analysts in a 20 August report.
That said, until investors see visible signs of a revival in demand, investors can be expected to hold on tightly to their purses."

5,2019-09-03,Asian Paints,"Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd, saw volumes grow in double digits, beating some key fast-moving consumer goods companies in this respectThe managements of Asian Paints and Berger Paints told analysts that an aggressive sales push helped them in filling up stocks at the dealer level

In stark contrast to the ongoing consumption slowdown, decorative paint companies reported impressive volumes in the June quarter.
Leaders in this segment, Asian Paints Ltd and Berger Paints India Ltd, saw volumes grow in double digits, beating some key fast-moving consumer goods companies in this respect (see chart).
But before investors get carried away, it is important to know what factors led to this improvement and whether they are sustainable.
According to analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd, the headline volume growth of paint companies creates an optical illusion that the paints industry is unaffected by the economic slowdown. “In our view, there are three drivers to overall volume growth of 10-15% (range) for Asian Paints and Berger Paints—(1) 5-6% growth in core decorative paints (a multiplier of GDP) (2) 3-4% growth driven by market share gains from unorganized sector (in bottom-end enamels) post implementation of GST (this share-gain led growth is likely to last till end-FY20, in our view) and (3) 4-5% incremental volume growth from traded goods (putty, primer and other ancillary products),"" they said.
The managements of Asian Paints and Berger Paints told analysts that an aggressive sales push helped them in filling up stocks at the dealer level.
Besides, there were some market share gains from the unorganized sector, and better sales of lower-end products such as putty, distemper and economy paints.
However, repeating this performance in the quarters ahead will be a challenge. And, especially so, if the overall economic scenario doesn’t improve meaningfully. Of course, following the dismal June quarter gross domestic product data, expectations of a quick recovery aren’t high.
According to ICICI Securities, a key downside risk is unexpected irrational competition due to deceleration in general consumption demand.
Further, the slowdown in the automobile industry would keep the performance of the paint makers’ industrial coatings businesses lacklustre. While Asian Paints and Berger Paints get more than 70% of their overall revenues from the decorative business, an underperformance in the industrial segment will dampen investor sentiment. Managements of these companies acknowledged that near-term pain in the industrial coating segment will persist.
On the bright side, easing input costs may continue to aid gross margins. Paint makers took some price cuts in the enamel segment to pass on this benefit.
But analysts caution that further price cuts remain a risk to future gross margin improvement.
On the valuation front, Asian Paints trades at a one-year forward price-to-earnings (P-E) multiple of 57 times, while Berger Paints’ P-E is at 55 times. It should be noted that their valuation multiples are higher than some blue-chip fast-moving consumer goods stocks.
Considering the aforementioned concerns, these valuations look expensive."
4,2019-09-20,Asian Paints,"Shroff is currently also a director on the boards of prestigious Indian listed companies like Apollo Tyres Ltd., Trident Ltd. and Asian Paints LtdIndiGo’s co-promoter Rakesh Gangwal had earlier demanded the appointment of an independent woman director in the airline's board

New Delhi: India's largest domestic airline, InterGlobe Aviation Limited operated IndiGo, on Friday said that the board of directors of the airline has approved the appointment of advocate Pallavi Shardul Shroff as an independent woman director in the company.
Shroff, who's a managing partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co, has been inducted in the airline's board, with effect from 19 September, IndiGo said in a statement.
The induction of Shroff into the airline's board of director comes after the shareholders of the company voted in favour of expanding the board’s strength to 10 at the annual general meeting (AGM) in New Delhi on 28 August.
""The aviation sector in India is among the fastest growing internationally and that makes IndiGo’s story and goals quite compelling,"" Shroff said in a statement.
""I look forward to contributing my experience to support the company in enhancing its growth and maximizing value for its shareholders,"" she added.
Shroff is currently also a director on the boards of prestigious Indian listed companies like Apollo Tyres Ltd., Trident Ltd. and Asian Paints Ltd. Besides these, she is also on the Boards of One97 Communications Ltd (Paytm's parent company), and Juniper Hotels Ltd.
""Her rich boardroom experience, her deep and extensive knowledge of law, her analytical bent of mind and her problem-solving attitude will considerably strengthen the Board, as it seeks to provide quality leadership to the company,"" IndiGo's chairman M Damodaran, said in a statement.
IndiGo’s co-promoter Rakesh Gangwal, who is in the midst of a tussle with promoter Rahul Bhatia, had earlier demanded the appointment of an independent woman director in the airline's board.
In an 8 July letter, addressed to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi, Gangwal alleged several violations at IndiGo including those pertaining to related-party transactions (RPTs); appointment of senior management personnel, directors and the chairman, who has always been an independent director by convention."
3,2019-10-24,Asian Paints,"It has introduced new products in the low-end distemper category to improve growth ratesAsian Paints stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 51 times, making it one of the expensive stocks in the consumer discretionary space

Market leader Asian Paints Ltd’s volume growth would have been extremely dull, had it not been for low-end products. The company’s key decorative paints segment continued to register double-digit growth in the September quarter as well. According to analysts, volumes are estimated to have grown 13-14% in the September quarter. However, volume growth was lower compared to the June quarter.
Analysts at UBS Securities Pvt. Ltd said, “We believe that the company has allowed mix dilution of 5-6% by pushing low-end putty throughput from newly added distributors.""
An analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm said on condition of anonymity, “For now, the stock has not reacted negatively to the increase in sales of low-end products. But valuations are expensive and if sales of high-end paints don’t revive, then some pressure might be seen eventually on the stock and valuations.""
The Asian Paints stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of around 51 times, making it one of the expensive stocks in the consumer discretionary space.
In a post-earnings conference call, the management acknowledged that low-end paints, emulsions, putty and distempers were growing at a much faster rate. The market size of putty and distempers is estimated at  ₹5,000-6,000 crore and  ₹10,000 crore, respectively. So, the company has introduced a number of new products in the low-end distemper category to improve its growth rates, said the management.
As anticipated, benign raw material costs helped Asian Paints’ gross margins. Gross margins expanded by more than 250 basis points on a year-on-year basis in the September quarter. Operating margins, however, rose only 60 basis points, impacted by higher staff cost and other expenditures.
Consolidated profit rose 67.5% year-on-year to  ₹823.40 crore in the September quarter, aided by deferred tax reversal of around  ₹149.7 crore. Adjusting for that, the company’s net profit grew 29% year-on-year, say analysts.
The Asian Paints stock opened Wednesday’s session in the green at  ₹1,762.40 on National Stock Exchange, but ended about 0.7% lower at  ₹1,767.40. The stock has risen 29% so far this year, easily beating the Nifty India Consumption index’s return of around 3%."
2,2019-10-29,Asian Paints,"Berger Paints’ presence in tier-2 and tier-3 cities has helped it push products at the bottom of the pyramidAsian Paints is now pushing low-end products like distempers and putty

Asian Paints Ltd may be trading close to its all-time high market capitalization of  ₹1.75 trillion, but Berger Paints Ltd, its much smaller competitor, has been racing ahead as far as valuation multiples go.
In the past three months, Berger’s share price has risen by 47%, while that of Asian Paints has risen by 19%. More importantly, the former’s one-year forward price-earnings multiple has risen to 64 times, far higher than Asian Paints’ 54 times valuation, according to Bloomberg consensus earnings estimates.
So, what has changed? “Berger has been primarily focusing on the mid and the lower-end of the decorative paint segment. In this area, it has kept the price point very attractive, and for this reason, has experienced strong growth in volumes. This has been ahead of other bigger paint companies, so there was some shift in market share in decorative paints from other larger players to Berger Paints. Since growth was high, people started giving higher multiples to Berger,"" said Amit Agarwal, vice president, Kotak Securities Ltd.
In the FY19 March quarter earnings conference call, Berger’s management said it had priced its product nearly 2.5% lower than Asian Paints’. Furthermore, Berger’s presence in tier-2 and tier-3 cities has helped it push bottom-of-the-pyramid products. According to some analysts, Berger’s edge over its competitors stems from lower dependence on the slow-moving industrial and automotive paints segment. That is one reason why Berger reported higher margin expansion in Q1 compared to Asian Paints and Kansai Nerolac Ltd. While Asian Paints reported 18% growth in net profit in the June quarter, Berger’s bottomline rose by over 32%.
Asian Paints is now pushing low-end products like distempers and putty. Its double-digit volume growth of nearly 13-14% in the September quarter was driven by these products, as the growth of its core paint segment remained sluggish. Berger Paints hasn’t reported Q2 results yet.
Interestingly, while some analysts do not expect Asian Paints to regain its top spot in terms of valuation multiples in a hurry, they don’t find Berger’s premium valuations justified either. “Berger has gained 50-100 basis points market share annually in the past four-five years. New and innovative launches should ensure more gain in market share. We believe the company has lower market penetration compared to the leader, Asian Paints, and has a higher scope for further growth. However, considering rich valuations, we maintain a sell rating,"" analysts at Dolat Capital Market Pvt. Ltd said in their June quarter earnings review report."
1,2019-11-11,Asian Paints,"India’s paint industry, which Asian Paints dominates with around 40% market share, has been viewed as a havenThe paint manufacturer has climbed 29.5% in the last six months -- when the broader gauge was up 6.7%

Mumbai: Surrounded by all the doom and gloom around the Indian consumer sector, a paint producer got so much love from investors that it is now the most expensive stock in the country’s benchmark index.
Asian Paints Ltd.’s price-to-earnings ratio of 80.1 makes it the highest valued on the S&P BSE Sensex Index. The paint manufacturer has climbed 29.5% in the last six months -- when the broader gauge was up 6.7% -- and has hit a record high in the past month.
Investors value its ability to churn out a record profit at a time when management at other consumer-oriented companies have warned of the impact from an economic slowdown. Of the 39 analysts who cover the stock, just four have the equivalent of a sell call. India’s paint industry, which Asian Paints dominates with around 40% market share, has been viewed as a haven.
“Asian Paints is likely to keep rising"" thanks in large part to double-digit growth in its volume of paint sales, said Abhijeet Kundu, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd., who estimated the increase to be 15%-17% in the last quarter. “There are very few companies that are growing at that kind of rate.""
Asian Paints’s stellar performance is a contrast to its consumer peers. Titan Co Ltd., the country’s biggest jeweler, plunged 10% last week after nearly halving its growth guidance for the second half of the year. Srinivas Phatak, chief financial officer at Hindustan Unilever Ltd., India’s biggest consumer goods company, said “the demand outlook is definitely challenging"" in an earnings call last month.
Consumer businesses are suffering in India as economic expansion has slowed to a six-year low, exacerbated by a credit crunch amid a shadow banking crisis. Consumers have also tightened their belt as the unemployment rate hit the highest in 45 years. Even the recently concluded festival season doesn’t seem to have lifted spending by much, with shopkeepers reporting a poor show.
Defying weakening consumer confidence, Asian Paints’s net income has risen for two straight quarters to a record  ₹830 crore ($117 million) in the July-September period. Over the past 10 years, the firm has returned investors almost 1,000%, the third highest among stocks on the Sensex index.
To be sure, the company is not totally immune to the economic malaise. Its revenue growth has stalled this year, and an unexpectedly long rainy season also crimped demand. Asian Paints didn’t respond to emails and calls requesting comment.
Analysts say the weakness in revenue is due to price cuts and popularity of cheaper products rather than a substantial decline in demand.
For bulls, the company also stands out on management track record. Its decades-old tradition of prioritizing corporate governance, rare in a country that’s still dominated by family-run businesses, is valued by long-term investors.
Asian Paints is one of the rare companies in India that has always had a genuinely independent board, Saurabh Mukherjea, co-founder and chief investment officer at Marcellus Investment Managers, wrote in his book “The Unusual Billionaires.""
