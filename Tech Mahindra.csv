79,2018-01-29,Tech Mahindra,"In dollar terms, Tech Mahindra's profit grew 16.5% to $147 million while revenue was up 8.3% to $1.2 billion over the year ago period

New Delhi: IT services firm Tech Mahindra on Monday reported 10.2% rise in consolidated net profit to Rs943.1 crore for the third quarter ended December 2017.  
New Delhi: IT services firm Tech Mahindra on Monday reported 10.2% rise in consolidated net profit to Rs943.1 crore for the third quarter ended December 2017. 
The firm had registered a net profit of Rs856 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal, Tech Mahindra said in a statement. The consolidated revenue stood at Rs7,776 crore in the quarter under review, up 2.9% from Rs7,557.5 crore in the year-ago period, as per Indian Accounting Standards. The earnings per share stood at Rs10.73 for the December quarter. 
“Our focus on digital transformation, continuous reskilling of our workforce to meet the future demands of our market space is showing encouraging results,"" Vineet Nayyar, vice chairman of Tech Mahindra said. He said that the results also demonstrated the company’s focus on execution, that is key in an “otherwise unpredictable macro business environment"".
On sequential basis, net profit was up 12.8% while the revenue was up 2.2%. In dollar terms, the company’s profit grew 16.5% to $147 million while revenue was up 8.3% to $1.2 billion over the year ago period. The company added 18 active clients compared to the trailing September quarter, taking the active client count to 903 at the end of December 2017. 
Its total headcount was at 1,15,241 people. C.P. Gurnani, chief executive officer (CEO) and managing director (MD) of Tech Mahindra, said: “We have continued to clock steady growth in the quarter across revenue, profits and new business. Our commitment to ‘DAVID’ strategy (Digitisation, Automation, Verticalisation, Innovation, Disruption) has yielded marquee deals in the digital space""."
78,2018-01-30,Tech Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra's earnings before interest and tax margins increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 12.8%, significantly ahead of Street estimates

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares have done rather well in the past year despite an unexpected hit to its profitability in the fourth quarter (Q4) of FY17. As the company embarked on a cost rationalization exercise to salvage the situation, the stock gained 29% over the last one year. The December quarter (Q3) results should help support this optimism. 
Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares have done rather well in the past year despite an unexpected hit to its profitability in the fourth quarter (Q4) of FY17. As the company embarked on a cost rationalization exercise to salvage the situation, the stock gained 29% over the last one year. The December quarter (Q3) results should help support this optimism.
The company has seen a sharp recovery in profitability. Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 12.8%, significantly ahead of Street estimates. Margins are now back to pre-March 2017 levels (see chart).
According to Milind Kulkarni, chief financial officer at Tech Mahindra, three factors helped the company report a better margin. One is the improvement in the utilization level, which rose from 81% in Q2 to a record 83%. Another is the improvement in performance of the firms it acquired some time ago. The third reason is the reduction in low- yield business. What’s more, Kulkarni expects the trajectory in margin improvement to sustain. The company plans to continue discarding low-yield business and to use automation to further optimize employee utilization levels.
Another set of reasons for investor optimism comes from the management commentary. Kulkarni dubs the current demand environment to be materially better than a year ago, in line with the commentary given by the company’s larger peers, although different from their business performance in the just concluded quarter.
The mainstay communications business, which generates about 42% of Tech Mahindra’s revenue, remains sluggish, barely seeing any growth. But thanks to better performance in other business verticals, notably technology, the overall sequential revenue growth in US dollar terms stood at 2.5% in Q3. Kulkarni expects the communications vertical to recover this year, which should push up overall growth rates.
If indeed the improvement in profitability continues, then the stock can rerate, says Sanjeev Hota, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd. While the commentary should please investors, one factor investors need to be wary of is employee reduction.
As an analyst with a domestic broking firm points out, the headcount of software professionals is now down a good 10% from the March quarter. The sharp drop can impact the company in two ways. One is employee morale, the other being cost. If the business environment has to improve as projected, Tech Mahindra may have to pay a premium to scale up its employee base, says the analyst. 
Tech Mahindra’s Kulkarni, on the other hand, says headcount has no direct correlation to the revenue growth trajectory because of automation and other changes. The ramp-up in headcount may lag, but scaling up should not be a problem, he avers.
While one cannot accurately analyse this risk now, Tech Mahindra investors would do well to keep a watch on this trade-off, if any."

76,2018-02-08,Tech Mahindra,"Cognizant, DXC Technology, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, which together employed 719,471 people on 1 January 2017, saw their workforce fall by 26,677 people to end the year with 692,794 people

Bengaluru: Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., DXC Technology Co., Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd have reported that their workforce has shrunk in 2017, an event that has no parallel in the two-decade history of the information technology industry in India.  
Bengaluru: Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., DXC Technology Co., Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd have reported that their workforce has shrunk in 2017, an event that has no parallel in the two-decade history of the information technology industry in India. 
Notwithstanding that fact, the companies have denied that they have laid off employees in this period.
These four firms, which together employed 719,471 people on 1 January 2017, saw their workforce fall by 26,677 people to end the year with 692,794 people (see table). Cognizant, Wipro and Tech Mahindra together saw a net decline of 3,677 people, after having added over 55,000 people in 2016. DXC, which was formed last year from the merger of Hewlett-Packard’s enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp., reported the largest decline in workforce, dropping from 178,000 people in January to 155,000 by the end of September, the latest quarter for which numbers are available.
Although Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd have managed to increase their workforce, the number of people let go by the largest companies is higher than the decline in workforce suggests as they all continued to hire young engineers.
These seven largest companies employed 1,404,656 people at the end of December. That compares with the 1,408,823 they employed in January, a net decline of 4,167 in 2017, after having added more than 103,000 people in 2016.
Until 2017, not a single large IT outsourcing company has ever seen its headcount decline, and starting 1996, year after year, for more than two decades, all companies managed to keep adding to their workforce until the industry hit a perfect storm last year. 
These companies’ traditional approach of deploying armies of engineers to manage computers or offering customer support to clients and client-run businesses was getting commoditised and increasingly disrupted by the embrace of smart automation tools. Business from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud and Internet of Things—all of which is clubbed under the fuzzy word Digital—is on the rise, although it is still less than a fourth of total revenue at home-grown IT firms.
A fallout of this shift is that the world has become digital, and the IT outsourcing companies haven’t (at least, not enough), reflecting their under-preparedness in adapting to newer technologies. US President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies have also forced these companies to hire more Americans.
Since the industry now is the largest job creator, employing 3.9 million people, fewer jobs at the largest companies is worrying news not just for the companies but for the country as a whole.
Many experts feel that the industry will see a further reduction in headcount in the years ahead.
“The global IT and BPO services industry employs 16 million workers today. By 2022, our industry will employ 14.8 million—a likely decrease of 7.5% in total workers,"" Phil Fersht and Jamie Snowdon, analysts at US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm, wrote in a 3 February note. “This isn’t devastating news—we’ll lose this many people through natural attrition, but what this data signifies is this industry is now delivering more for less because of advantages in automation and artificial intelligence."""
75,2018-02-17,Tech Mahindra,"Zoomcar will use the funding from Mahindra and others for accelerating marketplace supply growth, improving IoT technology capability and for expansion across India

Bengaluru: Self-drive car rental start-up Zoomcar India Pvt. Ltd has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round led by automobile maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), the company said in a statement on Friday.  
Bengaluru: Self-drive car rental start-up Zoomcar India Pvt. Ltd has raised $40 million in a Series C funding round led by automobile maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M), the company said in a statement on Friday. 
Existing investors, including Ford Smart Mobility, Sequoia Capital, Empire Angels, Nokia Growth Partners and others also participated in the round.
Zoomcar will use the fresh capital primarily for accelerating its marketplace supply growth, improving its IoT (Internet of Things) technology capability and for expanding across India. The company lets users book vehicles and make payments online. Users have to locate a Zoomcar car lot within their locality to pick up the vehicle. It also offers doorstep delivery of the rented vehicle.
The firm had also launched an associate programme in April 2016, which allowed people to lease their own cars to its platform under a revenue-sharing model. Zoomcar charges a 25% commission on revenue that its associates make. 
Mint reported in November that Zoomcar was in talks to raise money from new and existing investors. It was also running an electric vehicle (EV) pilot in Mysore through a tie-up with M&M. It plans to launch 500 more EVs across 20 cities in the coming months.
The firm raised $24 million in Series B round in August 2016 led by Ford Smart Mobility, and another $21 million in two tranches between October 2014 and July 2015, from Sequoia Capital, Empire Angels and T.V. Mohandas Pai among others. This takes Zoomcar’s funding till date to $85 million.
Zoomcar has a customer base of more than two million. It had started shifting to a marketplace model last year and said that it would sell all vehicles in its fleet over time. The company said that its marketplace model currently accounts for 25% of its total 3,000-vehicle fleet, which is a mix of company-owned vehicles and those leased from third parties.
In October 2017, Zoomcar introduced a new bike-sharing service named PEDL, which currently operates across 10 cities with a fleet of more than 3,000 cycles. The service claims to complete nearly 15,000 rides per day. With the fresh funding, the company also expects to increase its cycle count and plans to expand across more than 75 cities by the year-end. 
“We’re incredibly excited to welcome the Mahindra team on board for this next phase of growth within the Indian self-drive mobility space. Our collaboration with Mahindra dates back to 2013 when we kicked off in Bangalore. Most importantly, Mahindra shares Zoomcar’s vision for multi-modal urban mobility and we look forward to leveraging their diverse platform to help accelerate the transformation to a shared, electric mobility future for India,"" Greg Moran, co-founder and chief executive of Zoomcar, said in a note.
For the year ended March 2017, Zoomcar reported a loss of Rs100.4 crore, which narrowed down from Rs101.4 crore in FY16. Total revenue grew 35% to Rs121.2 crore from Rs89.82 crore in FY16."

Hyderabad: Tech Mahindra has set up a lab in Bengaluru in association with US chipmaker Intel as part of its preparedness for 5G services expected to be rolled out by 2019, said a top executive of the IT firm. 
The Department of Telecom (DoT) expects to finalise a road map for the services by June this year. C P Gurnani, CEO and Managing Director of Tech Mahindra, said the company has already re-skilled about 30,000 of its employees in handling emerging technologies. 
The remaining 75,000 employees will be re-skilled by the end of the current calendar year, he said. “In our case, the key drivers (for future growth) are clearly 5G roll out if it happens in 2019. We will see better capex spending in telecom,"" he said. 
“We have set up a lab with Intel in Bengaluru. We have set up labs with other companies also. You don’t learn swimming by practicing on the beach. So we are working on software-defined networks. “We are getting ready for the (5G) roll out,"" Gurnani told PTI on the sidelines of the just concluded World Congress of Information Technology 2018 here. 
According to him, the company employees are in the process of acquiring required skill sets and getting ready for pilot phases to be rolled out soon. “A large delegation of Tech Mahindra is going to the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona (staring from 26 February) and intense discussions have been planned around 5G roll out,"" he said, without elaborating on the time-frame for pilot projects on the new mobile phone technology. 
“It (re-skilling of employees) will remain a big focused area. I am already done with 30% to 35% (of the employees), (but) there is a lot more to be done. “Within this calendar year (2018), the remaining (70%) will be done,"" he added. 
Declining to reveal specific recruitment plans, the TechM CEO said the IT industry may witness 4% growth in hiring if the industry expands at 8% per annum for the next two years. “I am giving a back of the envelop calculation. I don’t think it (hiring) will become stagnant,"" said Gurnani, whose company currently has 1.05 lakh employees. Referring to the IT industry’s apex body Nasscom’s projections, he said 7 to 9% expansion of the sector during the next fiscal will be a “very good growth""."

72,2018-05-28,Tech Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra still believes it has sufficient margin levels at work, such as automation, improvement in performance of subsidiaries and optimization of the onshore-offshore workforce mix

Tracking the recovery in profitability, shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd have gained a handsome 64% over the last year. The company continued the trend in the March quarter as well with earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margins expanding both sequentially and compared to a year ago. (See chart). 
Tracking the recovery in profitability, shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd have gained a handsome 64% over the last year. The company continued the trend in the March quarter as well with earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) margins expanding both sequentially and compared to a year ago. (See chart).
Profitability was aided by a better business mix, improvement in utilization, seasonality in certain business segments and a favourable currency. But the key question to ask is: will the existing triggers be sufficient to drive stock performance?
The management still believes it has sufficient margin levers at work such as automation, improvement in performance of the subsidiary companies and optimization of the onshore-offshore workforce mix.
However, improvement in profitability from here on is expected to be rather gradual. 
Margins in the current quarter will be weighed down by wage hikes and seasonal weakness at one of its subsidiary companies. 
In the event of the near term headwinds and only gradual margin improvement, profitability alone cannot be the earnings driver for long. Revenue growth should accelerate. Unfortunately, the outlook on this front remains hazy.
The 1.7% sequential constant currency revenue growth in the March quarter was slightly ahead of Street estimates. 
However segmental performances do not provide any signs of revenue acceleration in the near term. According to analysts, deal sizes remain small and growth in total contract value remains subdued.
The enterprise business continues to do well. 
But the largest business vertical—communications—which generates 43% of Tech Mahindra’s revenues is either flat or seeing a revenue fall (on a year-on-year basis). According to the management, the company has given up some low yield business which impacted revenues.
Even so, the communications division still lacks structural growth drivers. 
Transition to the fifth generation (5G) mobile technologies is expected to open new opportunities. But there is no clarity when the spending will kick in.
The management expects clarity on this to emerge in another year which means near term growth expectations remain more or less unchanged. “Given the fact that revenue growth was in line this quarter, and that expectation of trends in communication and enterprise remains unchanged, our revenue estimates remain where they were,"" Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in a note.
True, estimates for margin have seen a slight upgrade. 
But lack of revenue upgrades is a handicap for the stock that has rallied over the last year. 
“We keep our revenue growth estimates intact but increase margin estimates slightly on good execution in FY18. However, the valuation is already capturing the growth prospects,"" Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note."

Mumbai: Of the 10 top-performing BSE 200 companies, five are from the information technology (IT) sector, signalling a revival in the Indian software services industry on the back of an improving US economy and a depreciating rupee, besides relatively attractive valuations.
“It was an underperforming sector. Now, given the market dynamics, it has become a sought-after defensive bet,"" said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer-equity, Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co.
Leading the pack were mid-cap IT stocks such as Mindtree Ltd, Larsen and Toubro Infotech Ltd, Mphasis Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd, besides sector leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). The company stocks posted between 34.2% and 61.6% returns.
“Over the past six months, mid-cap IT companies have handsomely outperformed the benchmark index. The demand environment is improving in their biggest market, the US, with the world’s largest economy firing on all cylinders,"" said Ajay Bodke, chief executive and chief portfolio manager at brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.
“Mid-cap IT companies have grown in double digits off late, and guidance for FY19 is also in early-teens,"" said Bodke. He added that the good show was triggered by a shift in focus towards new-age, high-margin services such as digital, analytics, intelligence and internet of things (IoT). “A weakening rupee has also been a big positive for them."" 
The rupee has depreciated 5.84% year-to-date and currently trades at 67.83 against the dollar. A depreciating rupee translates into higher revenues in rupee terms for the export-focused software companies. 
Others seem to agree. “The US economy is showing steady improvement and this eventually means there is going to be better demand for our IT companies from their top verticals such as BFSI (banking , financial services and insurance), retail and manufacturing, as these sector are likely to spend more,"" said Gaurav Dua, head of research, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. “Weakening rupee and attractive valuations are added pluses."" 
The BSE IT index had gained 10.8% in 2017, compared to the Sensex’s 27.9%. Year-to-date, it has gained 20.8% compared to the Sensex’s 4.8%. The BSE IT index trades at 18.46 times its one-year forward earnings, and even as its valuation has risen since December 2017, it looks more attractive as the visibility of earnings is much better than it was last year.
Domestic mutual funds snapped up shares of technology companies among other top large-cap stocks in May, supporting the market in a month that saw continued exit of foreign investors.
If we look at the top 20 in the pack, consumer-focused stocks and financials form a major chunk, reiterating the faith in India’s consumption and economic growth story.
“After the two exogenous shocks to aggregate demand – demonetisation and the GST (goods and services tax), the aggregate demand has bounced back, which is reflected in consumer retail names,"" said Bodke. “Especially, rural demand has picked up strongly."" 
Upadhyaya of Kotak Mahindra AMC, agrees: “The consumption story continues to be very strong, and that has driven pure consumption stocks, as well as enablers of those consumptions such as retail-focused financials."" 
“What underpins is consistency in performance and pristine asset quality,"" said Bodke, referring to companies such as Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, Bajaj Finance Ltd and Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd. 
The top-performing stock for the year, however, was Indiabulls Ventures Ltd, with the stock gaining 85.3% to  ₹  491.75. The performance comes on the back of a stellar 1,192.46% rise in 2017."

Tech Mahindra’s vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar who retires this year, earned  ₹ 363.13 crore during this period, making the total payout by the company to two of its senior-most executives to  ₹ 873.16 crore over the last five years.
Gurnani and Nayyar’s annual salary has a large component of stock options exercised during the last four years and for this reason, their compensation is higher than their peers.
Tech Mahindra defended the high compensation to its two executives, saying the grant of shares to Gurnani and Nayyar is tied to the company’s performance, with the company having clocked the fastest compound annual growth since 2013.
“The grant of shares for the executives including MD (managing director) & CEO is based on performance parameters and is decided by the Nomination and Remuneration committee, consisting of non-executive and independent directors,""said a spokeswoman for Tech Mahindra. 
“If one looks at the last five years of growth, Tech Mahindra has been the fastest-growing company amongst the top five and the stock has been one of the best performers amongst peer group,"" said the spokeswoman.
Although this is correct, Tech Mahindra’s performance—both revenue and profitability—is not significantly better than its four larger rivals. 
Again, as Tech Mahindra is much smaller than TCS or Infosys, it is only expected of the firm to grow faster. 
Sample this: Tech Mahindra reported a 9.6% dollar revenue growth to end with $4.77 billion in revenue in 2017-18 as against TCS’s 8.6% growth to end with $19.1 billion in revenue last year. 
TCS’s $4.97 billion revenue in the January-March period is more than Tech Mahindra’s $4.77 billion sales for the entire year. 
Still, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan earned  ₹ 12.49 crore, as against Gurnani’s  ₹ 146.19 crore last year. 
Vishal Sikka, Infosys’s former US-based CEO, who faced criticism over higher salary from some of the software services company’s founders, earned  ₹ 111.32 crore over three years.
“Capitalism is still trying to find a comfortable home in India and it is such instances of high, excessive compensation which in a democracy likes ours gives capitalism a bad name,"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India. 
“The fact is that flaunting wealth is distasteful and imprudent in our country. The last thing you want is the government to get involved in fixing salaries, but one should not forget that it is these examples of inequality that has partially contributed to leaders like Donald Trump getting elected in the US because it bothers a lot of people. The board of Tech Mahindra and Anand Mahindra (chairman of Tech Mahindra) should use self-restraint and make sure that there is no resentment among employees in Tech Mahindra,"" Das said.
Gurnani, 59, joined Tech Mahindra in 2004, and took over as chief executive officer in August 2012. 
Tech Mahindra, which was founded in 1986 and went public in 2006, allotted shares to Gurnani in 2006-07 and again in 2010-11."
69,2018-07-10,Tech Mahindra,"If Accenture grows at the upper end of guidance, its new revenue growth will be just a few hundred million dollars lower than the annual sales of Tech Mahindra at $4.77 billion

Bengaluru: Accenture Plc will add more than $4.37 billion in incremental revenue in the fiscal year ending August 2018, the highest new revenue done by an information technology (IT) outsourcing company in over two decades. 
Bengaluru: Accenture Plc will add more than $4.37 billion in incremental revenue in the fiscal year ending August 2018, the highest new revenue done by an information technology (IT) outsourcing company in over two decades.
Accenture expects to clock revenue of $9.8-10.05 billion in the June-August quarter. The company, which has added $29.42 billion in the nine months to May 2018, expects its full-year revenue at $39.22-39.47 billion. This translates into a dollar revenue growth of 12.5-13.26%. The IT firm follows a September-August financial year.
Put simply, Accenture’s projected incremental revenue of $4.37-4.62 billion for the financial year will be just a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.
If Accenture grows at the upper end of guidance, then the company’s new revenue growth will be just a few hundred million dollars lower than the annual sales of Tech Mahindra Ltd at $4.77 billion.
Only twice earlier have two companies added more than $2 billion in new business in a year, according to a Mint analysis. In 2015, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant had added $2.15 billion in incremental revenue in 2015, while Mumbai-based TCS added $2 billion in new business in the year ended March 2015.
Last December, Mint had first reported that Accenture was on its way to script history by growing faster than TCS, Cognizant, Infosys and Wipro. The company’s impressive performance is significant for two reasons. One, its ability to clock double-digit growth on an already large base (it had ended last year with $34.85 billion in revenue) should make shareholders question the managements of the other five home-grown IT firms. Save for Noida-based HCL Technologies, all IT companies reported single-digit growth in the year ended March 2018.
TCS will kick off the earnings season when it reports its first-quarter results on Tuesday, while Infosys will put its numbers out in the public domain on Friday. TCS does not give annual or quarterly guidance, but the manage
ment expects to report double-digit growth in the current financial year. Infosys expects 9% dollar revenue growth. 
If TCS manages 11% dollar revenue growth and Infosys grows at 9%, this would translate into the two firms adding $2.1 billion and $985 million, respectively, in incremental revenue.
If Cognizant adds $1.49 billion at 10%, the three companies’ incremental revenue would add up to $4.57 billion. 
At the heart of Accenture’s performance is its strong consulting practice and aggressive investments in new technology areas such as cloud computing, data analytics and design capabilities, which are clubbed as digital technologies. 
Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies, considerably more than the $1.58 billion spent by TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, since 1 April 2014.
Accenture said 60% of its business, or $6.18 billion, in the March-May quarter was from the new technology solutions, which was far higher than the $4.1 billion in digital revenue from TCS, Cognizant, Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies.
“Revenues for ACN’s (Accenture’s) “New"" strategic initiatives, which includes digital, cloud and security, grew strong double digits for the May Q... [We] believe ACN is the best run player in our IT services coverage,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 28 June."

Bengaluru: The Kerala government has allocated land for Tech Mahindra to set up an IT centre, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of IT investments coming to the state. 
Bengaluru: The Kerala government has allocated land for Tech Mahindra to set up an IT centre, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Wednesday. The move is the latest in a series of IT investments coming to the state.
Tech Mahindra has been allocated about 12,000 sq ft in state-run Technopark third phase, India’s biggest IT park, in Thiruvananthapuram, Vijayan said in a Facebook post. Their office will start functioning within three months, generating 200 immediate jobs and about 2000 others by the time the office opens, he said.
Kerala got a major boost when global car-maker Nissan Motor Co. Ltd., decided to set up its first research hub on automated, driverless cars in Technopark on 29 June. The deal is expected to generate 500 direct jobs by the fiscal end. 
Tech Mahindra, which has a large number of global companies on its clients list, is also catering to Nissan and had immediately contacted the state government after the Nissan deal, said a government official who did not want to identified. 
Four other major IT companies -- Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Wipro Ltd -- have their offices in Kerala. 
In March, the government resisted tough local opposition to change land laws and have Taurus Downtown, a joint venture between US-based Taurus Investment Holdings and Embassy Property Development Holdings, develop a  ₹ 2000 crore technology center in Technopark. The project was proposed in 2012 but went into limbo because of land issues.
In the same month, Kerala also held a first-of-its-kind global IT summit titled ‘#Future’ in Kochi, under the aegis of an IT advisory committee chaired by S D Shibulal, former Infosys CEO. The event was attended by top IT executives such as Nandan Nilekani, Infosys non-executive chairman, and Vijay Shekar Sharma, founder of Paytm.
In April, global IT networking major Cisco announced it will launch an incubator for startups in Kerala, on the sidelines of a government-sponsored networking workshop for startups called Huddle Kerala, billed as Asia’s largest startup ecosystem congregation.
The chief minister also made an effort to publicize his pro-business agenda by personally congratulating the founders of Kerala-based startup Chillr when it was acquired by Stockholm-based Truecaller in June. He did it again when UST Global, a pioneer in Kerala-based IT startups, raised $250 Mn from Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund Temasek and turned into a unicorn in June. 
In response, UST said it will actively work with Kerala-based startups with the money. Seperately, UST Global, along with Intel, has also agreed to set up a laptop manufacturing unit in Thiruvananthapuram, giving a boost to the chief minister’s previously stated wish to make Kerala an electronic hardware manufacturing hub."

Back home, according to Mint, the RBI monetary policy committee may raise policy rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday but is expected to maintain its neutral policy stance given the volatility in crude oil and food prices, economists say. Of the 15 economists surveyed by Mint, 12 expect RBI to raise its repo rate, the rate at which it lends to commercial banks, to 6.5%. Only three economists expect RBI to keep rates unchanged at 6.25%.
Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services Ltd, said that as expected, Q1 earnings season has started on a positive note. “On global front, trade tensions seems to be ease and we are seeing some positive momentum in domestic markets. In the near term the momentum will also depend on the outcome of RBI meet, were consensus is showing 25bps rate hike. On global front, investors are keenly awaiting US GDP data which might put some influence on US Fed policy meet next week,"" he added.
On the earnings side, Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd, Vedanta Ltd, Power Grid InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, Avenue Supermarts Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd are among the key companies that will report their June quarter numbers this week.
Auto stocks will be in focus this week after sales data for July is out on 1 August. According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), passenger vehicle sales in rose by 37.54% in June, the fastest monthly growth in nearly ten years mainly due to low base of last year when customers postponed purchases expecting price cuts after GST rollout, inflating the growth rate.

New Delhi: IT services firm Tech Mahindra on Monday reported 12.4% rise in consolidated net profit at Rs897.9 crore for the first quarter ended June 2018. 
The firm had registered a net profit of Rs798.6 crore in the corresponding quarter of the last fiscal, Tech Mahindra said in a statement. 
The consolidated revenue stood at Rs8,276.3 crore in the quarter under review, up 12.8% from Rs7,336.1 crore in the year-ago period, as per Indian Accounting Standards. 
Earnings per share (EPS) was at Rs10.12 for the quarter ended 30 June, 2018. The company’s net profit declined 26.5%, while revenue was up 2.8% as compared to the March 2018 quarter. 
“The overall business growth trajectory for the FY19 is on track. While business seasonality has affected the current quarter, our ‘run-change-grow’ strategy with strong focus on digital transformation is keeping the business buoyant,"" Tech Mahindra managing director and CEO C. P. Gurnani said. 
The changing demand landscape for next generation technologies is going to fuel the digital business further, he added. 
Gurnani said Tech Mahindra vice chairman Vineet Nayyar has decided to retire. Also, the company has appointed Harshvendra Soin as the firm’s chief people officer. 
In dollar terms, Tech Mahindra’s profit grew 6.5% to $131.8 million in the June 2018 quarter, while revenue was up 7.5% to $1.22 billion from the year-ago period. 
The company added 13 active clients compared to the trailing March quarter, taking the active client count to 926 at the end of June 2018. Its total headcount was at 1,13,552 people, including 72,462 (software) and 34,700 (BPO). 
“We will continue to focus on our journey of margin improvement in FY19; while the global macros, including currency, continue to be volatile, we are working with a multi-pronged approach of enhancing operational efficiencies, embracing new-age delivery, re-skilling and increasing value per employee,"" Tech Mahindra CFO Manoj Bhat said."

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares had underperformed peers in the past one month on concerns about growth in the near-term. Analysts, in fact, had estimated revenues to drop 1% sequentially in constant currency largely because of pressure in the telecom vertical. But as it turned out, things weren’t as bad as expected. Revenues rose 0.3% sequentially in the June quarter. While revenues from the telecom segment declined as expected, the enterprise business grew by a strong 3.8% sequentially.

Revenues rose 0.3% sequentially in the June quarter. While revenues from the telecom segment declined as expected, the enterprise business grew by a strong 3.8% sequentially.
While this segment is expected to continue driving overall growth for the company, investors were also enthused by the company’s comments that some large deal wins can potentially drive growth in the telecom segment as well going forward.
“Tech Mahindra is optimistic about a revival in revenue growth in telecom after staying weak for the last five quarters. The confidence is coming from a) ramp-up in deals won in 4QFY18 ($300 million worth deal wins had a higher share of telecom deals) and b) strong deal wins in 2QFY19; Tech Mahindra indicated a $200 million of net new deal wins so far in the quarter. This bodes well for FY20 dollar revenue growth outlook,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.
In addition, there are expectations that increased spending by global telecoms service providers on 5G deployment will result in increased demand for Tech Mahindra.
Needless to say, the company’s optimism needs to translate into actual results for investors to gain more confidence about the recovery in the telecom vertical. Nonetheless, the company’s shares rose nearly 4% on Tuesday, since the June quarter results weren’t as bad as what was initially feared.
Tech Mahindra shares have now outperformed peers year-till-date. However, its valuations look inexpensive vis-a-vis peers at 15 times estimated one-year forward earnings. Investors evidently believe it’s premature to assume a sharp recovery in the telecom vertical is a given."

Gurnani also said Tech Mahindra hopes to garner over $100 million as revenues from blockchain technology during the current fiscal.
“By the year-end, I would think is that it will become significant ( revenues) by my standards. That means I am talking of $100 million+. By somebody else’s standards it may not be significant.... We are in 90+ countries. Tech Mahindra is going to spend a lot of its energy and time on skill development.We don’t have a India-based platform for blockchain. China has Neo. Korea has its own. Why would not we have our own?,"" said Gurnani.

Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.
In the year so far, the BSE IT index has gained nearly 40%, outpacing gains in the benchmark Sensex index which has gained around 10%. In 2017, even as the Sensex rose 27.91%, the BSE IT index gained only 10.83%, as revenues grew slower at large IT services companies. This is the best performance of the BSE IT index in the last five years. In 2016, it had slipped 8%, gained 4.26% in 2015, was up 17.6% in 2014 and jumped 55.24% in 2013.
According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities, the improving US economy has changed sentiments toward IT sector, which draws a large chunk of its business from the US. “Better profitability of US companies (a part of which could come from tax cuts) would mean better business prospects for Indian IT services. Similarly, Europe is also limping back to stability following the economic revival of the financial crisis-hit peripheral economies. This improvement in the business prospects of Indian IT companies has led to the re-rating of the IT sector in general,"" he added.
Among IT stocks, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd are up 20-53% while Wipro Ltd is up 3%. 
Thukral believes Indian IT firms have witnessed a revival of growth on the back of increased technology investments from clients in the US and Europe. “But these investments are in newer areas such as digital and cloud at the cost of traditional outsourcing, where budgets are shrinking. Hence, we like Indian IT companies who are increasing their revenue share from digital and cloud business,"" he added.
According to a Kotak Institutional Equities note dated 10 September, a 1% rupee depreciation aids earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of IT firms by 20-30 basis points (bps) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 2-3%. It has upgraded FY2019-21 earnings per share (EPS) by 0-7% but slashed its US dollar revenue growth assumptions due to cross-currency headwinds, stating FY2019 EPS will be influenced by hedges, and all companies will receive an earnings boost in the subsequent year. 
According to Kotak, even though the rupee has weakened, its impact on immediate earnings will be decided by hedging. Kotak said Infosys has minuscule cash flow hedges of $300 million; TCS hedges but through options, meaning it will realize the benefit of rupee depreciation unless the company has entered into range barrier options with the rupee depreciating beyond the range; Mindtree hedges only the monetary assets and does not have any cash flow hedges; and Tech Mahindra has hedged 70-90% of net cash inflow over the next 12-months. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware, it said, have hedged aggressively. “Infosys, TCS and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from Indian rupee depreciation,"" the Kotak note said. 
According to a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, a weak rupee boosts net profits and operating margins of the entire IT sector; however, the impact on individual company earnings will be determined by three aspects -- the share of dollar revenue among all currencies; the extent of onsite-offshore revenue mix that will determine the net exposure after natural hedge; and the hedging policy in terms of duration and proportion of the net exposures hedged.
However, it added that had the rupee weakened similarly against all currencies, the impact would have been felt on the majority of the revenues. In the calendar year so far, the rupee has fallen 11.51% against the dollar, 8.03% against the pound and only 8.27% against the euro. 
“Bottoming cyclical pressures and improved capital allocation are factors that will feed into the valuation multiples favourably. Currency keeps earnings growth ticking further,"" Motilal said in its note on 10 September. 
However, Nomura said Indian Tier 1 IT valuations are at a 20% premium to that of multinational corporations (MNCs) and 15-25% discount to Tier 2 IT and challengers. “Indian Tier-1 IT, after progressively showing lower market share gains over the past three years, has lost market share to MNCs. Also, FY19 guidance suggests a weaker year, with Cognizant and HCL Tech guiding for slower organic growth in FY19 versus FY18, Infosys likely to grow near the lower end of guidance (similar to FY18) and Wipro expected to grow low-single digits for FY19, on our estimates. The only exception is TCS, where we expect growth to accelerate in FY19,"" it said in a note on 6 September."

New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.

This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.
This development is significant as telecom firms over the last two years had held back their spend on technology, leading to tepid growth at telecom verticals for all IT firms. A new gusher of money should further boost growth for the five largest IT firms, which share among themselves about 30% of homegrown IT companies’ business from telecom companies. 
“The impending rollout of 5G networks by telecom service providers (TSPs) globally could translate to a USD 10bn incremental market opportunity – implying a 1 ppt addition to the overall industry CAGR – over 2019-25 for the Indian IT companies, on our conservative estimates,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note dated 29 October.
Homegrown IT firms got $5.4 in business during 2014-16 when telecom companies set up the 4G infrastructure and Kapoor of JM Financial estimates a higher spend of over $10 billion, although over a much longer period of six years.
The world’s largest telecom firms are looking to give a face-lift to the current 4G infrastructure as newer technologies allow them to send billions of bits of data a second, higher than the current hundreds of millions of bits of data. This, in addition to letting a consumer download a movie in seconds, also allows autonomous cars and industrial equipment to work better as they need this network of ultra-fast speeds for relaying data sets.
For now, executives at some of the largest IT firms remain optimistic on the new technology spend and maintain that much of the incremental revenue will come in from the second half of the next financial year. 
A big reason behind the optimism of Indian IT companies from this rollout of 5G infrastructure by telecom firms are some of the recent mega-IT contracts awarded to set up hardware. In July, US-based T-Mobile awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Nokia to supply 5G network gear. This was followed by T-Mobile awarding another $3.5 billion contract to Ericsson in September, under which Ericsson will offer both hardware and software to the US telecom major.
“All telecom firms first set up the hardware and software and then work for the services needed to run them. Now the contracts may not be this large but then with newer technologies needed for 5G, many of us (Indian IT firms) have the chance to offer IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, data analytics solutions and other work as part of managing the network,"" said an executive at Mumbai-based TCS. The executive did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
“Recent commentaries by major operators indicate selective commercial launches could start as early as 2019, though a wider global coverage is likely to be spread over 2020-22… The biggest commercial use-case of 5G is likely to be around narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) that could open an additional market for Indian ER&D/IT services players. While the timing of project flows is difficult to predict, conservatively, we see a meaningful financial impact of 5G on Indian IT companies only from 2HFY20,"" wrote Kapoor in the note."

Hyderabad: The Hyderabad high court Monday set aside an Enforcement Directorate order provisionally attaching fixed deposits worth  ₹ 822 crore belonging to Tech Mahindra.
The Enforcement Directorate or ED in 2012 provisionally attached the fixed deposits under Section 5 (1) of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) 2002, before Tech Mahindra formally took over scam-hit Satyam Computers.
The ED attached the amount alleging that it was ill-gotten proceeds of Satyam Computers.
A bench comprising Justices V Ramasubramanian and J Uma Devi set aside the ED’s order.
Counsel for Tech Mahindra Vivek Reddy told PTI 
that they argued that there was no money with the fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services Ltd in 2009, when it was taken over and the Mahindra group company infused the amount to revive the Ramalinga Raju-founded company.
On January 7, 2009, Raju in his capacity as chairman had sent an email to Sebi, wherein he admitted and confessed to inflating the books of Satyam besides understating liabilities and other financial misstatements.
After the fraud came to light, the government ordered auction of the company to protect investors and employees of the then fourth-largest IT firm.
Satyam was acquired by Tech Mahindra, and then was renamed Mahindra Satyam and was eventually merged with Tech Mahindra.

55,2019-01-14,Tech Mahindra,"The race to showcase the future of electric cars is actually being run on the Formula E racing circuit with a dazzling dose of technology power

Mumbai:  If Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. is considered to be the poster boy of electric cars, carmakers such as Audi, Porsche, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and BMW are also pulling out all stops to make their presence felt in the electric vehicle (EV) market. 
Mumbai:  If Elon Musk’s Tesla Inc. is considered to be the poster boy of electric cars, carmakers such as Audi, Porsche, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar Land Rover and BMW are also pulling out all stops to make their presence felt in the electric vehicle (EV) market.
That said, though, the race to showcase the future of electric cars is actually being run on the ABB FIA Formula E racing circuit with a dazzling dose of technology power—composites, longer-lasting batteries, enhanced powertrains, numerous sensors and a lot of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms that can analyse the humongous amounts of data that is generated daily.
A case in point is the Mahindra group-owned Mahindra Racing’s M5Electro race car that was unveiled on 10 December 2018, which has a steering wheel that is fully configurable by the team. “Software plays a huge role in an electric car,"" says Dilbagh Gill, chief executive officer and team principal of Mahindra Racing—the only Indian motor sport team to compete in the Formula E Championship.
Formula E cars, Gill points out, are getting more complex and already have hundreds of sensors and many different complex electronics and software systems. A Formula E car, for instance, can have 200 data channels, providing information that must be collected and logged, generating gigabytes of data. Mahindra Racing collects data from every race. “Here’s where we are trying to use AI. In fact, last year we spent a lot of time in IBM’s Watson Lab to try and see what we can do with automation. Our big investment is on software and simulation,"" says Gill whose team spends close to 100 hours of simulation for every one hour on the track.
Other than data analytics, the electric racing cars’ powertrains are also becoming more efficient, according to Lewis Butler, technical director at Mahindra Racing. A powertrain (dubbed “powerbrain"" by Mahindra Racing) includes the engine, transmission, driveshaft and axles—basically anything from the engine through to the rotating wheels that converts the engine’s power into movement.
“In Formula E, we have reached 93% efficiency. The reason (it’s only 93) is because we have used the mechanical gear box as per regulations. The moment we remove the mechanical part of it and focus on a motor inverter, we will have more than 96% efficiency,"" says Butler.
Moreover, every time the driver hits the brakes, the car’s kinetic energy is recaptured and converted into electricity. Moreover, since a reverse sensor feeds energy back into the battery, it almost doubles its efficiency. “We do not use rear brakes in the car anymore, making the car more efficient and recouping 15-20% of the energy used,"" explains Butler.
Meanwhile, the energy density of a battery has gone up too, which according to Gill, means that the batteries can be charged faster and “the anxiety of charging a car"" will reduce.
India is targeting 40% electricity generation from non-fossil fuel-based resources by 2030. With the cost of lithium ion batteries consistently falling, and governments the world over discouraging the use of fossil fuels while encouraging the use of EVs, Gill believes the Mahindra Group would “have done 15 cycles of powertrain development, and be far ahead of its competition by that time (2030)"".
The Mahindra group’s electric car journey began when it acquired a controlling stake in Reva Electric Car Co. in May 2010. Six years later, the company was rebranded as Mahindra Electric Mobility Ltd, following which Mahindra Racing “started working with them on its so-called ‘Race to Road’ concept"", according to Gill.
As part of its ‘Race to Road’ strategy, the Mahindra group acquired automotive design company Pininfarina in December 2015. Three years later, Automobili Pininfarina christened its first car, code-named PF0, as Pininfarina Battista. This estimated €2 million luxury electric hypercar will be unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show in mid-March. “This is where we are going to see lot more of technology going forward,"" says Gill.
Further, Gill believes that the Mahindra Group can “literally take out the engine of a Formula E car and put in a road car—and it will run"". Gill hopes to have this so-called “race-to-road"" car ready in “18-24 months"" as opposed to the “almost 4-5 years to do a similar exercise with a Formula 1 car""."
54,2019-01-25,Tech Mahindra,"Finding a successor to CEO Francisco D’Souza, improving growth figures are the two key challenges ahead for firmCognizant has had only four CEOs so far, while Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone

NEW DELHI :
For a quarter of a century since it was set up in 1994, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has followed a simple mantra: capitalize on the opportunity emerging out of every crisis.
“Frank (CEO Francisco D’Souza) often says never miss a crisis, it’s an opportunity,"" said Ramakrishnan Chandrasekaran, executive vice-chairman, Cognizant India.
This approach is best exemplified by the company’s performance during the financial meltdown of 2008. Cognizant’s revenue grew 16% in 2009 and 40% in 2010; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd could only manage single-digit growth.
“Unlike some Indian firms, Cognizant increased its investments in business. From hiring more sales executives to even doing some work pro bono for clients, Cognizant realized that all this will help the company in future,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity.
Cognizant, which started as a software services arm of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. with 175 employees in 1994, will end 2018 with over $16 billion in revenues. The Nasdaq-listed firm completes 25 years on 26 January. TCS completed 50 years last year.
Cognizant is envied by its Indian rivals for its scorching pace of growth. Beginning 2010, it has been adding over $1 billion in incremental revenue every year. In other words, in the 12 years ended December 2018, Cognizant has added $14.66 billion in revenue, or the combined numbers of what Wipro and Tech Mahindra Ltd could achieve.
“Cognizant had a challenger strategy,"" said Ray Wang, founder, Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “The key was that they had less rules, less bureaucracy to do the right thing, and that led to explosive growth.""
Four things underline Cognizant’s steroid-charged growth.
First, the company’s super-aggressive sales culture as the firm always had more people managing its large accounts. Second, Cognizant’s senior management comprises more people from outside the firm, unlike the insular approach followed by homegrown companies. “We are truly an MNC,"" said R. Ramkumar, executive director, Cognizant India. “We had a CEO who operated out of the US, the next one operated out of India, and the one after him out of the US. If you were to look at the next 25 years, this one aspect of being a global organization with a global mindset and a global leadership positions us well to thrive in the digital era,"" said Ramkumar, who joined Cognizant from TCS in 1998. Third, stability at the top. Since inception, Cognizant has had only four CEOs. Srini Raju and Lakshmi Narayanan were based out of India, while Kumar Mahadeva and current boss D’Souza are based out of US. Both Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone.
Finally, the company has gained from its focus on fewer countries and industry segments. In 2017, the US accounted for three-fourths of its total revenue, while business from banking, financial services and insurance and healthcare accounted for 38.1% and 28.8%, respectively.
Still, 25 years later, Cognizant again finds itself at a crossroads.
The IT major’s growth fell to single digit for the first time in 2016, when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed the management to focus on improving profitability rather than its growth-at-all costs approach. 2018 will be the third straight year of Cognizant reporting single-digit growth.
Understandably, a few analysts such as HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal, have said in the past that Elliott’s decision was nothing short of “destructive activism"".
A bigger challenge ahead for the company is to find the successor to CEO D’Souza, and the board is evaluating both internal and external candidates. D’Souza is expected to step down sometime this year.
“Cognizant has been a good story,"" said former Infosys CFO V. Balakrishnan. “Their USP has, however, been to grow higher than Indian firms. The Elliott chapter was a distraction for the company, and it needs to be seen if the company can get back its old DNA.""
Amazon, which was also founded in 1994, set up its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, in 2006. AWS’s revenue now stands at $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis), more than TCS.
For now, Chandrasekaran won’t admit if Cognizant, like its Indian peers, lacked the foresight to invest in cloud computing business. “The good thing is that we were able to scale our business. The bad thing was we didn’t focus on path-breaking innovations, but in the future you will see a lot more path-breaking innovations,"" said Chandrasekaran.

NEW DELHI :
IT company Tech Mahindra Tuesday posted a 27.5 per cent increase in consolidated profit after tax (PAT) to  ₹1,203 crore in the December 2018 quarter.
It had reported PAT of  ₹9,431 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.

52,2019-02-05,Tech Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra’s constant currency revenue grew 4.3% on a sequential basisThe digital business, which drove business growth, has better realizations and margins

After languishing for years, shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd have nearly doubled from their lows touched in mid-2017. The rebound is largely to do with a recovery in the company’s margins. Operating profit margin has widened from merely 9% in the June 2017 quarter to 16% currently.
In the December 2018 quarter, operating margin improved 80 basis points sequentially, and 340 basis points from a year ago. Analysts were expecting an improvement, albeit at a much slower pace, as they assumed recent large deal wins involved lower margins.
What’s more, Tech Mahindra’s constant currency revenue grew 4.3% on a sequential basis, against estimates of about 2.7% increase. Deal wins remained strong, although they fell marginally compared with the second quarter.
The digital business, which drove business growth, has better realizations and margins. Further, cost-rationalization measures such as automation helped improve profitability.
On the negative side, attrition continues to increase. From 17% in the year-ago quarter, attrition rose to 21% in December 2018. The worry about high attrition levels is that it comes in the backdrop of high utilization levels, which reached 83% last quarter. Both factors together may drive up employee costs, said some analysts.
Heading into FY20, investors will be keen to know if the much-awaited spending in next-generation telecom technology (5G) materializes. That will not only result in sustained growth momentum but also help the Tech Mahindra stock reduce the valuation gap with its larger peers."

Gurnani, Hellion Ventures’ co-founder Ashish Gupta, chairman of Genpact and Clix Capital Pramod Bhasin, Dilip Pathak, partner at Warburg Pincus in UK, education entrepreneur Vineet Gupta, and Ajay Arora, managing director of D’ Décor.
“Education is a big multiplier…most of us got good education at IITs almost for free and what we are today is because of that quality education. Over the last three decades, the world has changed and it is time for us to come together and create a new model that can be best in the world in terms of teaching, learning, and market worthiness,"" said Oberoi in an interview.
The entire team of 40 has brainstormed for three years and wish to put in place a vision that advocates the best model in pedagogy, curriculum, culture, faculty, and processes, said Aggarwal.

47,2019-03-04,Tech Mahindra,"Some investment funds could decide to join forces with a strategic bidder to make a joint offerAdvent International and some Chinese investment funds have also been weighing offers for HNA’s Pactera Technology International

HONG KONG :
HNA Group Co.’s sale of its technology outsourcing arm has attracted interest from suitors including Digital China Group Co. and Tech Mahindra Ltd., people familiar with the matter said.
Buyout firm Advent International and some Chinese investment funds have also been weighing offers for HNA’s Pactera Technology International Ltd. unit, according to the people. The embattled Chinese conglomerate has asked for second-round bids within the next few weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Some investment funds could decide to join forces with a strategic bidder to make a joint offer, the people said. No final decisions have been made, and there’s no certainty the parties will decide to submit formal bids, the people said.
Representatives for Advent, Digital China, HNA and Tech Mahindra declined to comment. A representative for Pactera didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
HNA, which has been offloading assets to pay down debt, is working with Credit Suisse Group AG as it seeks to revive a sale of Pactera, Bloomberg News reported in December. Options under consideration include a full sale to one or multiple buyers, people with knowledge of the matter said at the time.
Valuation could be one of the main hurdles to a deal, according to the people. The Chinese conglomerate’s ownership of Pactera dates back to 2016, when it agreed to buy the company from Blackstone Group LP for about $700 million.
Pactera’s holding company, HNA EcoTech Panorama Cayman Co., said last month it would be further delaying a planned early redemption of its U.S. dollar bonds. HNA EcoTech’s notes due 2021 were indicated Friday at around 89 cents on the dollar, according to Bloomberg-compiled data.

New Delhi: IT major Tech Mahindra on Tuesday said it has signed a defence contract worth  ₹300 crore, its biggest till date.
As part of the 'Armed Forces Secure Access Card' (AFSAC) Project, Tech Mahindra will implement RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) based access control system across all naval bases and ships, a statement said.
The new AFSAC card will replace the existing paper based identity card for all Navy personnel, including dependents and ex-servicemen, it added.
The Mumbai-based company will develop a secure application to manage the access control devices, network devices and the AFSAC card through a data centre, it said.
""Scheduled to be implemented over the next two years, the project will ensure smooth issuance, handling, administration, management and life cycle support of AFSAC Cards on turnkey basis,"" it added.

43,2019-05-21,Tech Mahindra,"After an exceptionally strong show in Q3, Tech Mahindra’s growth fell off the cliff in Q4Worse still, profit margins fell at a higher-than-expected rate, underscoring cost pressures

After an exceptionally strong performance in the December quarter, things were expected to cool down at Tech Mahindra Ltd. But as it turns out, growth fell off the cliff in the March quarter. Dollar revenues grew just 0.5% on a sequential basis, notably lower than the Street’s estimates. Worse still, profit margins narrowed at a higher-than-expected rate, underscoring cost pressures.
It’s interesting to note that the company’s revenue growth has moderated at a time when its largest business vertical, communications, returned to the growth mode. Revenue at the division, which generates about 41% of overall sales, grew 4.4% on a sequential basis. Growth stood at 4.6% on a year-on-year basis, up from 0.1% in the December quarter. Company-wide growth, on the other hand, slowed to merely 1.9% in the March quarter year-on-year, down from 4.3% in the December quarter.
Evidently, other business segments are performing poorly. Revenue in the enterprise business segment dropped 2.2% on a sequential basis. According to the management, closure and deferment of some projects weighed on revenue in the enterprise business.
The disappointment does not end there. A notable rise in sales and general administration expenses resulted in profit margins moderating by 70 basis points, snapping a long streak of improvement on this front (see chart).
The performance will displease investors. But a 7% fall so far this month vis-à-vis the 5.6% drop in the Nifty IT index, and low valuations, mean the damage may be limited. Tech Mahindra is trading at about 12 times FY21 earnings estimates, a notable discount to tier-I IT firms.
On the positive side, the company continues to see strong order bookings. It signed contracts worth $408 million last quarter. This comes on the back of $440 million in deal wins in the December quarter and $550 million in the three months ended September.
The strong deal wins should help the company deliver good growth in FY20, said the management. “We are encouraged by the revival of the communications business,"" C.P. Gurnani, managing director and chief executive officer, Tech Mahindra, said in a statement.
Though the enterprise business vertical lagged in the March quarter, the hope is that execution of the order book should help it maintain the growth momentum in FY20. Revenue in the non-communication vertical, which largely constitutes the enterprise business, grew 7.9% in FY19.
But as they say, there is many a slip between the cup and the lip. It remains to be seen if orders translate into revenues at a pace investors like. Further, high attrition and elevated expenses can weigh on profitability as well. The Tech Mahindra stock may be cheap, but the narrative around it isn’t compelling."

Indian markets are likely to stay volatile today ahead of the general election results. SGX Nifty trends indicate a positive opening for markets in India. Asian stocks were on shaky ground today, as earlier relief over Washington's temporary relaxation of curbs against China's Huawei Technologies failed to offset deeper worries about trade frictions between the world's two largest economies.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan initially edged up following gains on Wall Street but was last down 0.15%.
The US Commerce Department on Monday granted Huawei Technologies Co Ltd a license to buy US goods until August 19, a move intended to give telecom operators that rely on Huawei time to make other arrangements. The United States blocked Huawei from buying US goods last week, a major escalation in the trade war against China, saying the firm was involved in activities contrary to national security.
Back home, key companies expected to declare March quarter earnings today are Cipla, Bank Of Baroda, IndusInd Bank, Canara Bank, Central Bank Of India, Bajaj Electricals, Bajaj Hindusthan Sugar, and JK Lakshmi Cement.
Shares of Tech Mahindra are likely to be in focus today after reporting a dip in net profit for the quarter ended March 31, hurt by a decline in its margins. Its net profit fell 6% quarter on quarter to  ₹1,132 crore.
Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) will also be watched out after it announced late Tuesday that it has stopped accepting fresh public deposits and renewals of existing deposits with immediate effect. It also halted pre-mature withdrawals of existing deposits to ""help reorganise its liability management"".
Among currencies, dollar traded at 110.58 yen after popping up to a two-week high of 110.67 against the safe-haven Japanese currency as risk aversion in the broader markets softened. The greenback was also supported as US yields rose in the wake of gains by Wall Street shares.
The euro was little changed at $1.11 after brushing a 2.5-week trough of $1.11. The pound was steady at $1.27. Sterling had sunk to a four-month low of $1.26 on Tuesday on Brexit worries but bounced back after British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a “new"" Brexit deal.
In commodities, US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 0.59% at $62.76 per barrel after American Petroleum Institute data showed that US crude stockpiles rose unexpectedly last week.

Indian markets edged higher today, a day ahead of counting of votes in the general election, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to retain power. Exit polls that came out on Sunday after the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections ended showed Modi is set for a clear win. Markets have been on a bull run with both the NSE Nifty and the BSE Sensex gaining 6% in three sessions to Monday.

Tech Mahindra shares fell 3% after March-quarter profit dropped 7.4% and missed estimates. Shares of DHFL, one of India's biggest home loan lenders, fell 9%, after it stopped taking new deposits and blocked premature withdrawals following a credit rating downgrade.
However, analysts predict that the markets will quickly discount the election results.

35,2019-07-29,Tech Mahindra,"In their current form, such banks serve largely as money-transfer channels. This business model, however, appears unsustainable in the absence of other reliable streams of revenue

Since at least 1969, financial inclusion has been a core goal of Indian policy. Among the relatively recent efforts in that direction, letting payments banks operate has been a decidedly bold move. Unlike classic banks that borrow cheaply from depositors to lend at higher rates of interest to businesses and others, these banks are not advancers of loans. Instead, they were conceptualized as new-age entities that would leverage information and communication technologies to grant transactional ease to people in far-flung parts of the country, especially those who have never visited a bank before. However, the nascent industry stares at a bleak future, with competition snapping at everyone’s heels, targets hard to achieve, and virtually all space for manoeuvre blocked. Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank said as much when it announced it was folding up barely 18 months after it began operations. The decision, the bank recently stated, was taken “due to unanticipated developments in the business landscape that have made the economic model unviable"".
It was on 19 August 2015 that the Reserve Bank of India gave in-principle approval to 11 entities to set up payments banks in the country. Four of them, including Sun Pharmaceuticals and Tech Mahindra, dropped out within months, but others were hopeful that millions of people—particularly the poor—would open small savings accounts with them and use a variety of remittance services via their mobile phones. Airtel’s bank was first off the block, its launch coinciding with demonetization in November 2016, and the concept seemed well-suited for a telecom network of its size and reach. Apart from it, Fino, India Post, Jio and Paytm are among the brands of payments banks still in operation. As a pre-existent online payment device, Paytm had already stolen a march on the rest by getting its app onto handset screens and establishing a consumer interface—the first challenge for any online business. It also made the most of the cash scarcity caused by demonetization, its user base doubling from 140 million in October 2016 to 270 million in November 2017. Most of the rest, though, have found it tough signing customers up. They had pinned their hopes on a cheap Aadhaar-based verification process, but this got a jolt once the Supreme Court ruled that this number was not mandatory for bank accounts or phone connections. Too few sign-ups, coupled with the regulatory limit of  ₹1 lakh per account on deposits they’re allowed to accept, leave payments banks with little money for asset creation. In any case, under the rules, 75% of deposits have to be invested in low-yield government bonds. As they pay depositors higher rates than regular banks, they need to cover their costs on far thinner spreads. It’s a wafer-margin business that requires high-volume money transfers to justify. For most, that’s a tall order.
Like with other network-based concepts, it can be argued, payments banks are a winner-takes-all business. This suggests that only one or two will survive. Even so, the very model looks like getting crushed between that of regular lenders and simple payment devices. Perhaps they need to be converted into either full banks or transaction enablers. This would kill the original idea. But then, reaching payment services to the last woman in the farthest village was never their sole responsibility. State-run banks could also fan out across the countryside to hardsell Jan Dhan accounts and get their apps onto millions of phones."
34,2019-07-30,Tech Mahindra,"Revenue grew by a slower 4.55% to  ₹8,653 crore on annual basis but fell 2.69% on a sequentiallyThe company closed $475 million worth of deals in the reporting quarter

Mumbai: The fifth largest software exporter Tech Mahindra Tuesday reported a tepid 7 percent rise in June quarter net income at  ₹959.3 crore, restricted by crimping margin that fell 390 bps to a lowly 15.2 percent.
The Mahindra group company, however, sounded confident of accelerating growth going forward, with managing director and chief executive CP Gurnani mentioning that the company is in the ""final stages"" of negotiating at least two large deals.
In a first, he also disclosed that they closed $475 million worth of deals in the reporting quarter.
Revenue grew by a slower 4.55 percent to  ₹8,653 crore on annual basis but fell 2.69 percent on a sequentially.
As against March quarter, its margin printed at 15.2 percent, down 3.9 percent on sequentially and slipped 1.70 percent annualised. The average industry margin is over 24 percent for the peers.
Chief financial officer Manoj Bhat explained that there was a 100 bps impact on margins each due to wage hikes and seasonal weakness in its largest revenue contributing communications business, while there was another 50 bps impact each on US visas fees and rupee gains during the quarter.
""We are optimistic about the communications vertical and growth over the next three quarters...this year we will focus on growth,"" Gurnani told reporters.
He said there was a ""temporary sluggishness"" in the enterprise segment which hit revenue.
Pointing to the two large deals under negotiations now, he said the pipeline is also good on deals and also on acquisition prospects.
To a question on profitability, he said the company has to balance between transition for large deals and also pursuing digital business, which has now grown to 36 percent of the total revenue pie.
The company will continue to work on margin levers, he said specifying it will not look specifically at utilisation levels which go down as employees get trained for the future.
Utilisation level for its 1.25 lakh employees came down to 82 percent from 84 percent a year ago.
Meanwhile, the company also announced the acquisition of a Boston- based firm MadPow, a strategic design consultancy, for an undisclosed sum.
The company counter closed 0.93 percent down to  ₹640.30 on the BSE, as against a 0.77 percent correction on the benchmark."
33,2019-07-31,Tech Mahindra,"Contribution from the top 10 clients has seen a notable fall sequentially; staff attrition remained elevated at 21%Dollar revenues grew just 1.9% year-on-year; and fell 1.6% compared to the March quarter

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s shares had underperformed the market after its revenue growth fell sharply in the March quarter. Profit margins narrowed at a higher-than-expected pace as well, raising concerns about its earnings. The June quarter results, released after market hours on Tuesday, provide no major reason to alter the stock’s trajectory.
Dollar revenues grew just 1.9% year-on-year; and fell 1.6% compared to the March quarter. “In the current quarter, the company faces seasonality, however, even after factoring the seasonality, Tech Mahindra’s revenues were below our expectation,"" ICICI Direct Research said in a note.
Worse still, the fall in profitability was far higher than Street expectations. Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margins contracted 1.5 percentage points from a year ago.
As a consequence, operating earnings (Ebit) in dollar terms dropped 9% from a year ago. Sequentially, they are down as much as 26%. “Margins are way below estimates leaving room for earnings-per-share cuts,"" an analyst said in a note to his clients.
The performance is weak across key business verticals. Revenues in the communications division, the largest business vertical, were down 3.2%, sequentially. Revenues at manufacturing, banking and financial services, and retail also lagged. Contribution from the top 10 clients, who together generate more than 30% of Tech Mahindra’s revenues, has seen a notable fall sequentially. And, as if all this wasn’t bad enough, employee attrition remained elevated at 21%.
However, digital business continues to see positive momentum. Tech Mahindra acquired a US-based company at an enterprise value of $25 million to enhance its capabilities in digital transformation offerings.
Further, deal wins remain healthy with the company signing contracts worth nearly half a billion dollars, on the back of deal wins worth $408 million in the March quarter. “We remain optimistic on the demand environment, evident from a very strong pipeline and deal conversions. Digital will continue to be a primary growth driver,"" C.P. Gurnani, managing director and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
But the slow transformation of the deal wins into revenues and earnings may keep Tech Mahindra investors on the sidelines, even though valuations are less than 12 times estimated FY21 earnings."

New Delhi: The RBI's interest rate decision, US-China trade conflict and quarterly earnings would influence trading in the equity markets this week, say analysts.
Participants will also keep an eye on taxation issues following reports that the Prime Minister's Office and the finance ministry have held talks regarding tax surcharge on FPIs announced in the Budget.
However, the key trigger this week is likely to be the Reserve Bank's three-day policy meeting, beginning Monday (5 August).
The central bank is expected to cut the benchmark interest rate for the fourth time in a row to boost the economy at time when key indicators are pointing towards a slowdown, experts said.
""The market is now awaiting the RBI meet which is scheduled this week,"" said Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research.
PMI data for the services sector is due on Monday, which would also influence trading sentiment, according to marketmen.
According to Arun Thukral, MD and CEO, Axis Securities, ""The recent correction has been driven by various factors — global weakness, selling by FPIs along with signs of a slowdown in domestic economy. Having breached the psychologically crucial levels, markets are expected to be volatile in the near term.""
Also, the ongoing results season will continue to determine the market trend.
Cipla, HCL Technologies Limited, Lupin, M&M, Tata Steel, Hexaware Technologies and GAIL India are among the major corporates scheduled to announce their results this week.
""The BSE-30 share index declined 2.1% this week led by weak domestic and global cues. Commentary of the US Federal Reserve on the future rate cut, weak underlying trends in quarterly results, slump in automobile sales dented investor sentiments,"" said Sanjeev Zarbade, VP PCG Research, Kotak Securities.
Global markets were rattled last week after US President Donald Trump announced fresh tariffs on Chinese imports, which Beijing vowed to retaliate.

News Delhi: If you ask anyone in India to name the most popular Mahindra car on the road, the XUV would be perhaps the first name that most would recall. The latest Mahindra XUV300, which the company wants you to pronounce as “three double oh"", is the toned-down version of the XUV500 that operates in the full-fledged sport utility vehicle (SUV) segment.
While the XUV300 isn’t the most technologically-advanced car on Indian roads anymore, if you consider its price, the tech isn’t shabby at all. It starts at a price point of  ₹7.90 lakh (ex-showroom) for the petrol W4 variant, while the diesel W4 variant is priced at  ₹8.49 lakh (ex-showroom).
One of the first bits of technology that sellers will probably show you on a test drive is Mahindra’s Ecosense technology. You will find this in the XUV500, too, and it gives you a driving score based on how you drive. It’s placed as a separate option on the infotainment screen and rates the driver on acceleration, gear selection, speed, clutch override, idling and aggressive braking.
The idea, of course, is to help you improve your driving skills and optimize fuel consumption in your car. The better you drive, more efficient will the fuel consumption be. You can even share this score on social media. But while this is a commendable step, it would perhaps have been better if Mahindra could also provide the driver pointers on what they’re doing wrong.
Then there’s the Mahindra Blue Sense app, which offers smartwatch control among other things. You can access data like tyre pressure, parking location and emergency assist to call Mahindra’s customer care. The smartwatch control works on Wear OS supported smartwatches, allowing you to control music and the other options mentioned above.
The XUV300 also brought a segment first feature in allowing dual-zone climate control for the front passengers. This allows you to set different air conditioner temperatures for the driver and front seat passenger. There are also three memory slots to save your settings so you don’t have to tweak the temperature manually every time.
But by now you’re probably wondering why we haven’t mentioned any of the usual infotainment features that many include. That’s because while Blue Sense and Ecosense do make for smart technology, Mahindra seems to depend on Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for the other infotainment features.
They work only when you connect your phone via USB, like in most vehicles, and basically put your phone on the infotainment screen. It makes sense too, considering the more affordable pricing of this vehicle. CarPlay and Android Auto are easy enough to control and easier to get used to than regular infotainment systems that automakers put by themselves.
Further, touch latency on the 7-inch touchscreen is just low enough to make usage seamless. We only wish Mahindra had included some more controls on the steering wheel so drivers didn’t have to take their focus off the road in most scenarios. The steering does have phone and audio controls though, which is standard among most vehicles today.
If you consider only the technology inside, the Mahindra XUV300 does seem to come in behind the Nissan Kicks or Hyundai Venue. However, all things considered, the technology inside this car is quite practical and given that there aren’t many cars in this segment that boast such technology, this is definitely one worth considering."

At 12:30 pm, the stock was trading up 3.56% at  ₹720.10 on the BSE. The stock is the top gainer on both the NSE and the BSE.
In early trade, the stock was trading at  ₹728, up 4.68%, on the NSE.
""The multi-year agreement will enable AT&T to focus on core objectives, including having the most advanced software defined 56 network, and migrate the majority of its non-network workloads to the public cloud by 2024. This comprehensive program will help drive sustainable operational improvement across the network and software development domains,"" the company said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.
Tech Mahindra shares gained almost 9% in August.
While the deal size is not known, it is said to be one of the largest deals in the last few years, and among the five deals that the management had suggested as part of the company's pipeline in its Q1FY20 commentary.
""The company suggests that while the rebadging costs will be minimal compared with the size of the deal, it may incur significant transition costs in the near term. This will support in lifting revenue growth in the Communications vertical (already recovering in recent quarters, with us penciling in an estimated 7% dollar revenue growth in FY20 for communications),"" Emkay Global said in its report.
""We see this deal as providing further confidence to the recovery that the Street (including us) is building on the communications vertical ( estimated 40% of revenues), although the overall revenue growth trajectory remains unchanged due to a sharp moderation in the enterprise segment through recent quarters,"" the report added.
The fifth-largest software exporter reported a tepid 7% rise in net income to  ₹959.3 crore in the June quarter. Revenue grew by a slower 4.55% to  ₹8,653 crore on an annual basis, but fell 2.69% sequentially."
25,2019-09-09,Tech Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra’s announcement of the AT&T deal brings some respite to the company’s investorsEven as the deal brings in incremental revenues for the firm, it can be margin dilutive initially

Tech Mahindra Ltd’s investors can breathe a little easy, and look beyond the gloom and doom headlines following the announcement of a large strategic deal with leading US network operator AT&T Inc.
While Tech Mahindra has not disclosed the deal size, analysts suggest this could well be one of the largest contracts secured by the Indian IT services firm. The deal entails optimizing AT&T’s core operations and modernizing its internal network applications to accelerate innovation.
Investors gave a thumbs up to the transaction, taking the company’s shares up by 3.8% on Friday on the National Stock Exchange.
Even as the deal brings in incremental revenues, transition costs in the near term can be expected to weigh on profit margins. “We would not be surprised if the deal has negative Ebitda initially,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 6 September. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and is a key measure of profitability.
“Tech Mahindra has moved away from the ‘scale at any cost’ approach of the past to a profitable growth approach in the past three years. Assuming this approach continues, Tech Mahindra can make higher margins if executed well,"" added Kotak. The brokerage firm has revised its revenue and earnings estimates upwards for FY22 as a result of the deal announcement.
The deal is expected to help support revenue growth of Tech Mahindra’s telecom (or communications) vertical, which accounted for 42% of total revenues in the June quarter. Note, that growth rates of this segment have shown an improvement in recent quarters, albeit on a low base.
Notwithstanding the gain on Friday, Tech Mahindra shares are 7% down so far in FY20—blame it on the lacklustre financial performance in the past two quarters. The flip side is that valuations are not demanding. Currently, the stock trades at about 15 times estimated earnings for FY20, according to Bloomberg data.
While the better outlook for the telecom segment is encouraging, this doesn’t necessarily mean things will look up on an overall basis, especially given the pressure in the enterprise segment. “The overall revenue growth trajectory remains unchanged due to a sharp moderation in the enterprise segment through recent quarters,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on Friday.
Note that the enterprise segment’s revenues had declined by 2.2% in the June quarter.
Even so, the steadying effect of the recent deal win will calm investors’ nerves. Large deal wins of this nature can be used by a company to showcase itself to other clients and, hence, gain more business. “We raise FY21-22 constant currency revenue growth estimates by 3-4%. We forecast 12% revenue growth in FY21,"" said analysts at Kotak."
24,2019-09-10,Tech Mahindra,"A mix of robotics, AI and IoT is making the Indian factory smarter. How  will  the  shop floor look 10 years from now?While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 1990s, the bus has now become more advanced. And the edge lies in industrial IoT,  robotics,  AI  and 3D  printing

Bengaluru: Three years ago, TAL Manufacturing Solutions Ltd, a unit of Tata Motors Ltd, showcased a robot called BRABO at the “Make in India"" week in Mumbai. Short for “Bravo Robot"", BRABO was touted by the company as the first “Made in India"" industrial robot, and is designed to lift loads of up to 10 kilograms.
Mahindra and Mahindra LTd already has a “robotic weld line"" at its factory in Nashik, which now caters to many of its products including the Marazzo and the XUV300. Tata Motors, too, uses robots in its Pune factory, while Godrej and Welspun run their shop floors with the help of an Intelligent Plant Framework, which enables tracking of machinery and productivity on the floor in real time.
Maruti Suzuki India Ltd has numerous robots employed at its Manesar and Gurugram car factories, with more than 2,000 robots working at the weld shop in its Manesar facility alone. Manjushree Technopack Ltd’s Bidadi (in Bengaluru) manufacturing plant also has more than a dozen of its packaging machines connected to a network, providing monthly updates on maintenance issues.
Automation, of course, is no stranger to shop floors. Many factories all over the world and India have been using computer numerical control (CNC) machines for years. These machines allow operators to feed a program of instructions directly into a mini-computer via a small board, similar to a traditional keyboard. After loading the required tools in the machine, the rest is done automatically by the CNC machines, which use these instructions to control machinery such as the grinder, milling machine, and lathe. But next-gen automation is likely to be vastly different on one score: it will either make humans redundant or vastly alter the necessary skill set that is required to hold on to one’s spot on the shop floor. A human-machine interface, or HMI, may eventually make the good old CNC machine voice-activated, for example, allowing an operator to just speak instructions.
These oncoming changes will leave long-lasting impacts on India’s labour force, particularly in some sectors—automotive, textile, and banking and financial services, apart from information technology—which have become far more attuned to global shifts due to the nature of modern supply chains. The “smart factory"" will, in all likelihood, change the popular conception of what a shop floor looks like.
An army of robots
The number of robots in use worldwide multiplied threefold over the past two decades to 2.25 million, according to a June 2019 report by Oxford Economics. Trends suggest the global stock of robots will multiply even faster in the next 20 years, reaching as many as 20 million by 2030—with 14 million in China alone, the report adds.
India is way behind at the moment. But things can change very quickly. The automotive industry, which is currently racked by a slowdown, is a great example. In the face of stagnation, firms that had begun to ramp up their robot density (robots per 10,000 workers) in the mid-2000s have now merely chosen not to rehire a bulk of the short-term, rotational, low-skilled contract workforce. According to a 22 January 2019 report by the International Federation of Robotics, India’s automotive sector was the main customer for industrial robots, accounting for as much as 62% of the total supply.
“On average, each newly installed robot displaces 1.6 manufacturing workers,"" the report says. Despite these rapid changes, industry players like Harshvendra Soin, chief people officer at Tech Mahindra, say: “We believe the future will be more human than we think."" However, some factories are now beginning to acquire the capability for “lights out"" production—meaning, they can operate without the presence of human workers. In fact, Japanese robotics firm FANUC, which is considered to be the poster boy for such factories, has been operating a “lights out"" factory with robots since 2001.
Unique quandary
India is in a unique quandary. While the country needs to find jobs for its booming population, the globally competitive opportunities are almost entirely in smart manufacturing, most of which require less human hands per unit of output. “The conventional ways of doing incremental business will no longer suffice. India needs to push its people to adopt disruptive ways of doing business,"" said Ashutosh Sharma, secretary, Department of Science and Technology at the 4th Confederation of Indian Industries Smart Manufacturing Summit, held on 26 October 2018 in Delhi.
While India may have missed the manufacturing bus of the 1980s and 90s, which powered China’s growth, the bus has now become more advanced. And the competitive edge lies in artificial intelligence (AI), industrial Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, robotics and additive manufacturing (better known as 3D printing), which are all set to fundamentally transform global production.
In any case, automation on the shop floor is now being taken to new levels. Machines develop faults like parts getting worn out or equipment not getting calibrated properly. An operator could, thus, waste a lot of time trying to locate the origin of the problem. It’s here that automation is being combined with AI and IoT on the shop floor to resolve such issues.
AI, for instance, can be integrated with CNC machines to enable self-diagnosis. Thus, when a fault develops, it will be detected and the software will try and solve the problem. Apart from using the data that is collected thus for diagnostics, a more advanced AI system could analyze that data and alter the settings of the machine to optimize a prototype being manufactured.
According to a 10 May blog by Craig Lyjak, EY Global Smart Factory leader, the smart factory is no longer a futuristic vision. It is the heart of the broader Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which refers to the gradual combination of traditional manufacturing and industrial practices with digital technologies. The most prominent of these technologies, according to Lyjak, include computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software, cloud computing, IoT, advanced sensor technologies, 3D printing, industrial robotics, data analytics, AI and machine learning (ML), and enhanced machine-to-machine (M2M) communications.
These technologies are already showing impressive results both globally and in India. In 2016, The Times of India reported that the country’s first “self-aware"" factory was being set up in Bengaluru at the Indian Institute of Science’s Centre for Product Design and Manufacturing with seed funding from the Boeing Co. The factory is enabling data to be continuously collected and monitored, from both sensor-fitted machines and digitally connected wearables in order to provide real-time insights about every movement and process taking place on the factory floor. The factory remains a “work in progress"".
On its part, German auto-component maker Bosch’s Bidadi plant has cobots, or collaborative robots, working alongside humans. GE’s Chakan (in Pune) factory’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) system is linked to the manufacturing execution system (MES). Equipment efficiency is monitored in real time to decide production schedules like availability of forks or lifts, raw material trucks, workers and machines while sensors (read IoT) send warnings on possible breakdowns.
Digital factories
While the Indian automobile industry is unquestionably at the vanguard of the oncoming change, other companies are not entirely untouched. Mondelez India describes its Sri City (in Andhra Pradesh) unit as an “integrated digital factory"", one which can pack 6,300 chocolate bars a minute, while Jaipur Watch Co. has added a new collection of stainless steel watches that were 3D printed.
Lyjak cites the example of Microsoft Dynamics’ integration with smart factory processes and technologies as a case in point. Microsoft Dynamics’ Remote Assist application, for instance, combines Microsoft HoloLens (a self-contained, holographic computer) with mixed reality, video calling, annotations, and file sharing to enable experts to remotely troubleshoot complex problems and help technicians. This saves time, reduces travel costs and improves operational efficiency on the shop floor.
Further, AI is used to optimize the multi-robot fulfilment system in Amazon warehouses. The average cost for a spot welding robot, according to the report, is projected to decrease by 22% by 2025, and robots-as-a-service models are beginning to appear.
Although bringing AI onto the shop floor would require a massive capital investment, the return on investment (ROI) is higher, according to SaaSnic Technologies. AI and ML, for instance, can test numerous demand forecasting models with precision, while automatically adjusting to different variables such as new product introductions, supply chain disruptions or sudden changes in demand. Using AI systems, every single part of a product can be tracked from when it’s first manufactured to when it is assembled and shipped to the customer.
Walmart, for instance, cut its physical inventory from one month to 24 hours by using drones that fly through the warehouse, scan products, and check for misplaced items. Using algorithms that learn from experience to optimize logistics, BMW tracks a part from the point it was manufactured to when the vehicle is sold—from all of its assembly facilities across the world. In finance operations, AI can close operations and automate monthly, quarterly and year-end processes. Using ML, bots can learn from human inputs to make better judgments and adapt to the behaviour patterns of accounting professionals.
The future office
Smart robots also assist shop floor operations indirectly by increasing employee satisfaction and appealing to a millennial mindset. A couple of months ago, for instance, Indian IT services provider Tech Mahindra introduced a Human Resource (HR) humanoid at its Noida Special Economic Zone Campus in Uttar Pradesh. Christened K2, this was the second HR humanoid (a robot that resembles a human) from the Mahindra Group company—the first was launched at its Hyderabad campus in May.
K2 can address HR-related employee queries and even handle personal requests for actions like providing payslips, tax forms, etc. With the help of AI, K2 can start a conversation without any need for wake-up commands. It can even converse with differently-abled employees by responding to queries with a text display along with speech. Tech Mahindra now plans to deploy the next humanoid at its Pune campus.
Despite the immense potential benefits of enhancing ERP systems with AI, there are risks with regard to sharing of sensitive data and regulations that need to be considered, such as the European Union general data protection regulation (GDPR), besides the loss of jobs to automation and robots. That said, the benefits may outweigh the risks if governments devise sensible privacy regulations, and revamp labour policies to factor in the impact of these new technologies on the workforce.
As an example, Tech Mahindra, which has already implemented an AI-based facial recognition (which typically raises privacy invasion concerns) system to register the attendance of employees, claims it has “drastically reduced the time spent by an associate in updating the timesheet"". The company also has Talex—an AI-driven marketplace of talent that maps skills of the existing talent pool.
But the increasingly common use of AI and robotics in the Indian context may lie inside the e-commerce package. Gurugram-based AI-powered robotics firm GreyOrange’s Butler, for example, is an autonomous robot that uses goods-to-person technology for inventory storage and order picking. It populates the many warehouses that have come up across the country in order to fuel the e-commerce boom. Butler runs on a software platform that uses AI algorithms and ML, which optimize path planning, maximize storage, and accelerate order fulfilment.
The final piece of the puzzle is the ability to hire these intelligent machines on contract, like workers. As a precursor for what may become commonplace soon, US-based Hirebotics allows firms to hire cloud-connected robots. The hourly wage starts at $15 per hour and they can work a minimum of 80 hours a week—and, they neither tire nor need bathroom breaks. Of course, companies have to give Hirebotics a 30-day written notice if they fire any robot. What these robot work contracts show is this: the future is already here."
23,2019-09-23,Tech Mahindra,"Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocksThe new taxation rule will be neutral event for Indian IT companies at the consolidate level, a report said

Mumbai: Shares of information technology companies fell on Monday after investors booked profit as analysts see no material impact on tax rates after the government cut tax rates for domestic companies.
Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocks as investors took to defensive plays due to concern over an economic slowdown and liquidity crunch.
On Monday, shares of Infosys Ltd fell 3.2%, Wipro Ltd declined 2.2%, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 2%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 1.7%, HCL Technologies Ltd 1.3%. Nifty IT Index slumped 2%.
According to a Credit Suisse report, there will be no material impact on tax rates on IT services companies following the tax cuts. The current blended effective tax rates of 22-27% are a combination of higher tax rates paid outside India and much lower tax rates paid in India. IT companies, thus pay lower than 25% tax rates in India and the cuts announced Friday will not lower their overall tax rates.
Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said it has increased underweight on the sector to 390 basis points and remains cautious as growth in tech spends in BFS clients in the US and European geography will be muted compared to last year due to trade war concerns, uncertainty on central bank policy and interest rates, Brexit related uncertainty. The rupee advantage will also weaken now.
The new taxation rule will be neutral event for Indian IT companies at the consolidate level. Tax rates will be lower than 25% as US and UK rates are at 21% and 18% respectively, Prabhudas Lilladher report adds."

IT firm Tech Mahindra on Tuesday posted 5.6% increase in consolidated net profit at  ₹1,124 crore for the September quarter, and said it will acquire US-based Born Group at an enterprise value of $95 million (approximately  ₹671 crore).
The Mumbai-based company had registered a net profit of  ₹1,064.3 crore in the July-September 2018 quarter, Tech Mahindra said in a statement.
Its revenue from operations grew 5.1% to  ₹9,070 crore in the quarter under review from  ₹8,629.8 crore in the year-ago period, it added.
In dollar terms, the company's profit was at $158.6 million, while revenue was $1.28 billion in the September 2019 quarter.
""We are thankful to our customers for believing in our capabilities despite a tough demand environment. Our consistent large deal wine is a testimony of our differentiation in the marketplace,"" Tech Mahindra Managing Director and CEO CP Gurnani said.

15,2019-11-05,Tech Mahindra,"Tech Mahindra’s profit margins expanded after falling for two consecutive quartersThe company saw record order inflows, and revenues expanded at a better than expected pace

Unlike other information technology companies which are facing a slowdown in growth, the concerns for Tech Mahindra Ltd are largely to do with its profitability.
Robust order inflows notwithstanding, the company’s operating earnings dropped for two consecutive quarters till June this year, leading to cuts in earnings estimates. Profitability was impacted by transition costs pertaining to large projects and investments in human resources.
The September quarter earnings issued after market hours on Tuesday will address some of those concerns. Operating margin improved sequentially, helped by a recovery in revenue and better economies of scale. Consequently, operating earnings grew 13.7% from the June quarter.
The performance will please investors. The 3.2% sequential revenue growth and 1.3 percentage points expansion in operating profit margin to 12.8% is higher than Street estimates, implying traction in project execution. Revenue growth was driven by the enterprise business segment. Utilization levels perked up even as attrition remained elevated.
Deal wins were strong, with the company receiving orders worth $1.49 billion. This comes on the back of strong deal flows in the previous four quarters. In an earnings call, the management said it has a “high degree"" of confidence on the project pipeline. Combine this with low exposure to financial services sector, which is seeing softness, analysts are fairly confident about revenue growth prospects. “We are confident of revenue growth acceleration in FY2021E for Tech Mahindra, even as it is too early to comment on others,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 3 November note.
The commentary is impressive vis-à-vis the growth concerns aired by other IT majors. But as Tech Mahindra executes the recently won contracts, high transition costs may hit profits in the near term. “We see the impact (transition costs) over the next two quarters,"" the management said in conference call. So, even as the company expects to deliver better revenues in the second half of the current fiscal, expectations on operating earnings are muted. Improvement in last quarter notwithstanding, earnings before interest and tax (ebit) in dollar terms is down 10.6% in the first half of the current fiscal on a year-on-year basis. The management is non-committal if this will reverse in the second half of the fiscal. But it is confident profitability next fiscal (FY21) will improve to FY19 levels. This is in line with Street expectations and should hold the stock in good stead, whose valuations are at a discount to larger peers.
The stock began outperforming NSE IT index from its June quarter earnings announcement. The quantum of outperformance will be determined by the pace of improvement in profitability and net earnings in the coming quarters."

On the global front, US Fed and ECB meeting, along with Brexit and trade deal developments would drive the markets"", said Siddhartha Khemka, head - retail research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.

3,2019-12-17,Tech Mahindra,"The strong deal pipeline assures revenue visibility for Tech MahindraHigh transition costs and patchy performance in H1 are making analysts wary

Mumbai: Shares of Tech Mahindra Ltd saw a remarkable recovery in the last four months, in part fuelled by a sequential rebound in revenue growth in the September quarter.
At an analysts meeting on Monday, the company sounded confident about growth prospects. But currency volatility and transition costs related to recent large deals indicate that the management is less certain about profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.
Indeed, analysts have flagged concerns over the above-mentioned factors. “In FY20, margins are likely to be affected by transitional cost from the large telecom deal and sector specific challenges such as auto in manufacturing,"" Nomura Research said in a note.
Tech Mahindra’s Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin dropped to 12.1% in the fiscal first half from 15% in FY19. This suppressed the company’s earnings growth during the first half. The management expects profit margins to recover to previous year’s (FY19) level in FY21 on better operating efficiencies and revenue flow from execution of large deal wins.
To be sure, profit margins did improve slightly in the September quarter to 12.8% from 11.5% in the three months ended June. According to SBICAP Securities Ltd, Tech Mahindra’s management expects FY20’s margins at around 13%, implying an improvement in the fiscal second half. Even so, caution persists and not everyone shares the enthusiasm on margin trajectory.
Profitability improvement is contingent on consistent execution, warn analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
“Continued delivery excellence, the absence of transition cost, and portfolio synergy could be key tailwinds for YoY improvement in margin in FY21. However, we trim our assumptions and model in 14.1% Ebit margin for FY21E,"" the brokerage firm said in a note.
Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd kept their estimates unchanged for FY20 and FY21.
The concerns are not unfounded. Employee attrition remains elevated. This may warrant an increase in expenditure on human resources. The deal pipeline continues to remain strong. Pipeline in the enterprise vertical is 20% more than the year-ago level. Moreover, the large deal pipeline in this business segment has doubled compared with the beginning of FY20.
The strong deal pipeline assures revenue visibility for Tech Mahindra. But there is no denying that high transition costs and patchy performance in the first half of FY20 are making analysts wary.
“Valuations are not demanding, but acceleration in revenue growth trajectory with margin improvement and consistency in performance would be key to drive further rerating, in our view,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities wrote in a note."
2,2019-12-20,Tech Mahindra,"In an interview, Sujit Baksi, president corporate affairs and business head, APAC, and Puneet Gupta, head, India Sales, Tech Mahindra spoke on the company’s renewed interest in India, key projects and emphasis on reskilling

Information technology (IT) and communications service provider Tech Mahindra Ltd has been instrumental in the digital transformation of several large and small organizations. Ranked 15 in the world’s top 30 digital companies list by Spectator Index, published in March, the company has been more active in India than before. In an interview, Sujit Baksi, president corporate affairs and business head, APAC, and Puneet Gupta, head, India Sales, Tech Mahindra spoke on the company’s renewed interest in India, key projects and emphasis on reskilling. Edited excerpts:
What is the size of Tech Mahindra’s overseas business, and what is the share of India market in that?
Baksi: While we do not share geo-specific number, we would like to add that India is definitely a key market for Tech Mahindra. The Indian market accounts for about 5% of the total revenue. The company’s total revenue is about $4.9 billion, and it aims to double its Indian revenue in the next few years on the back of growing IT spend by customers. This year, H1 has been specifically at a historic high for India business with 12 new logos being added. Our India business grew YoY (year-on-year) by 29% and our QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) growth in India for Q2 is 4% roughly.
What is Tech Mahindra’s strategy for India going forward?
Baksi: According to a Gartner study, the India IT market opportunity stands in excess of $85 billion, growing at 9%, which is nearly three times the global average. We believe the total pie will increase and digitization will accelerate the growth. Rapid digitization across all verticals in recent times has paved way for better business opportunities and facilitated our renewed focus in the Indian market. Tech Mahindra has set up a strategic business unit to specifically cater to the deals coming from India. We have seen great success in the past two years in India after the formation of this new business unit. While we have taken up/accomplished large government projects for modernization, opportunities for improving customer experience in the e-commerce space and IT transformation projects involving enterprise customers such as banks and telecom players, we continue to remain very selective about the projects that we work on.
In which sectors, Tech Mahindra is most active in India?
Gupta: We are working with various organizations and the government in India. With Coal India Ltd, we are working on a digital transformation project at the backdrop of an ERP (enterprise resource planning) implementation. We are also working with the government on a modernization project involving six ports and with the Indian Navy on an access control system. We have also helped in the transformation of India’s largest banks.
E-commerce is another area where we are focused and have nine major e-commerce companies as our customers. As part of our TechMNxt charter, we are also focused on leveraging emerging technology. Tech Mahindra is among the first to implement blockchain in one of the largest banks in India for money transfer and also for a telecom operator.
At the start of digital transformation, the industry found a huge gulf between the available skill sets and their needs. How much of that gulf has been addressed, and how is Tech Mahindra addressing this?
Baksi: At Tech Mahindra, our continued focus is on skill-based hiring, especially in new-age digital technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), robotic process automation, blockchain, 5G, internet of things, and cybersecurity. As part of our TechMNxt charter, we are dedicated to create a future-ready workforce to solve real business problems of our customers by leveraging these emerging technologies. We are also investing heavily in reskilling employees in next generation technologies like blockchain, cybersecurity, AI, machine learning, robotics, and automation, and 5G."
