47,2018-01-09,Britannia,"Price reduction is part of Britannia's wider strategy of premiumization the biscuit market, which also led to it kicking off 2018 by launching a super-premium biscuit called Pure Magic Deuce

Bengaluru: Britannia Industries Ltd is looking at reducing prices for some of its super-premium biscuits in order to attract more consumers and boost business, a top executive said. This is part of the company’s wider strategy of premiumising the biscuit market, which also led to it kicking off 2018 by launching a super-premium biscuit called Pure Magic Deuce.  
Bengaluru: Britannia Industries Ltd is looking at reducing prices for some of its super-premium biscuits in order to attract more consumers and boost business, a top executive said. This is part of the company’s wider strategy of premiumising the biscuit market, which also led to it kicking off 2018 by launching a super-premium biscuit called Pure Magic Deuce. 
Biscuits account for around three-fourth of Britannia’s total sales and the company’s strength lies in selling premium varieties of the product over regular glucose biscuits, which are viewed as mass products. 
Biscuits cost around Rs100 per kg on average and Britannia sells super-premium biscuits - those that cost Rs400 per kg or more—under its Pure Magic and Good Day brands. 
“We are strong in 60% of the market, which is premium. But what we’ve realised is value could be a large source pool from which we can upgrade consumers into our premium products. In some cases we’ve even realised that our pricing is possibly higher than we should charge consumers, and if we democratize some of those brands slightly we could see a significant upside in business,"" said Ali Harris Shere, Britannia’s marketing head. 
Shere did not reveal details on the exact amount of price cut. But he said Britannia will not shy away from doing what is required. For example: if the price for some brand needs to be lowered to Rs400 per kg from Rs500 a kg, then that’s what the company will do. 
Even for its newest product, Pure Magic Deuce, Britannia had initially test-marketed selling four large biscuits for Rs30. But when it finally launched Deuce on 2 January, it went with six biscuits to a pack to optimise the ratio of number of biscuits to price. 
“We are seeing companies trying to get the Indian middle class to upgrade their choice of biscuits by smaller packs as well as attractive pricing where a premium range gets perceived as affordable. This could open up a new set of customers who are currently treating biscuits as one option for a tea-time snack or a children’s snack,"" said Sreedhar Prasad, partner at KPMG in India. 
Indeed, Britannia’s plan to lower prices is partly based on the company’s previous success in launching smaller packs, for Rs5, of its Good Day and Marie Gold premium brands to attract consumers, especially in the rural markets. 
Biscuits as a category grew at a 10.6% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2012 and 2017 and is led by Britannia, Parle Products Pvt. Ltd and ITC Ltd, according to data from research firm Euromonitor International. But the market is expected to grow at a significantly slower 2.3% CAGR between 2017 and 2022. 
“It is a price sensitive category by and large. But is it as price sensitive as it was, say, five or ten years back? No. You’ve seen the consumer upgrade and shift from a 50% glucose market to a struggling and almost non-existent glucose segment today. What you have to look for is value for money. If the consumer feels that you are giving proper value, then he will pay that premium,"" said Nikhil Sen, managing director at premium cookie maker Unibic Foods India Pvt. Ltd. Unibic has experimented with smaller packs to increase market penetration rather than go for price cuts."

Bengaluru: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd reported a 19.60% jump in profit for the October-December quarter aided by strong domestic consumer demand. 
Bengaluru: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd reported a 19.60% jump in profit for the October-December quarter aided by strong domestic consumer demand.
Profit rose to Rs263.65 crore from Rs220.44 crore a year ago, Britannia said in a BSE filing. Total revenue grew 8.81% to Rs2,603.42 crore during the period.
“Our double-digit domestic growth of 15% for the quarter is backed by double-digit volume growth on the back of investment in brands and widening our distribution network through focus on direct reach, rural and weak markets,"" managing director Varun Berry said in a statement.
Britannia’s international business, however, continued to grow at a slower rate due to deteriorating geopolitical situation and currency fluctuations in markets like the Middle East and Africa. Growth in the company’s dairy business has also been subdued, even though profitability in this division has improved as it focuses on products with high profitability, the company said.
Britannia continued its premiuimisation and innovation journey through various launches during the fiscal third quarter including Pure Magic Deuce—a super-premium biscuit with a chocolate slab—and Good Day Choco Almond and Chocochips.
Good Day along with Tiger, NutriChoice, Tiger, 50:50 and Marie Gold are Britannia’s power brands.
Prices of key raw materials have been stable during the quarter, the company said, adding its cost efficiency program has also helped improve profitability.
“We have progressed well in our journey of building technologically superior factories. In this context, I am pleased to announce that our new greenfield factories at Guwahati, Assam and dedicated facility for servicing export markets at Mundra, Gujarat are nearing completion and are expected to be commercialised soon,"" Berry said.
Britannia had originally announced its plans to set up the facilities in Assam and Gujarat last November. That is part of its wider strategy to invest Rs1,500 crore over the next three years to expand its manufacturing footprint, which includes what the company says will be its biggest manufacturing facility yet at Ranjangaon in Maharashtra.
The company also said it continues to work actively on bridging portfolio gaps in its biscuits business and other adjacent snacking opportunities to achieve profitable growth."

New Delhi: Consumer packaged goods major Britannia Industries Ltd has plans to launch around 50 new products under its existing as well as new categories by the end of the next fiscal as part of efforts to be a total food company, said a top company official. 
In view of its growth strategy, Britannia will launch dairy products by October-November and croissants through its joint venture with Greek cakes and confectionery major Chipita by March 2020.
 Besides, the company will continue with its strategy of adding new countries in its list and scout for new markets in Africa, while foraying into Bangladesh and Myanmar. 
“Almost 50 new products would be there by the end of next financial year,"" Britannia Industries managing director Varun Berry told PTI. The Kolkata-headquartered company is looking to diversify in bakery and non-bakery segments and also focussing on snack items. 
“We are also looking into other areas as bakery and outside bakery, the macro-snacking category, which could be potential areas for us to grow,"" he said. Besides, Britannia may also launch new sub-brands in the market for some categories, although it will primarily rely on its existing ones. 
The group will continue with its existing sub-brands to make sure that it is not completely entering the unknown territories, Berry said, adding that however, in some categories, the company will look for a new one where there is no suitable brand. The company is in the process of putting up a manufacturing line with its JV partner Chipita for croissants, which is expected to come up by the third quarter of the coming fiscal. 
On his plans for the dairy sector, Berry said, “We are pretty clear that we would go into it and the value added product segments."" 
The company is also in the process of setting up a Rs1,000-crore plant at Ranjangaon, Pune which would be an integrated food park, he said, adding tow plants in Guwahati and export-oriented unit at Mundra SEZ would be commercialised early next year. 
Britannia’s Nepal plant would start in the fourth quarter of the next fiscal as it is awaiting environmental clearance there. “Our target is to add a new country every year and that is going well,"" Berry said. 
On being asked about the next destination, Berry said: “We have still not identified the next destination but we are looking at a bunch of countries in Africa, and countries like Myanmar and Bangladesh. We would identify one of those and move forward in FY 2019-20."" At present, Britannia has manufacturing units in Dubai and Oman, which cater to the Middle East markets."

New Delhi: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd is planning to launch croissant in packets during the second half of this year, said Gunjan Shah, vice president (sales) of the Kolkata-headquartered company. 
New Delhi: Biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd is planning to launch croissant in packets during the second half of this year, said Gunjan Shah, vice president (sales) of the Kolkata-headquartered company.
Croissant—a French crescent-shaped roll made of sweet yeast dough that is usually consumed as a breakfast item worldwide—will mark Britannia’s formal entry into the breakfast market that the company has been eyeing for a long time. Britannia also sells cakes, breads, rusks and a few value-added dairy products. In India, croissants are mainly sold at restaurants and bakeries. 
“Last year, we formed a joint venture with Greek company Chipita SA for producing and selling croissants. A factory is being set up currently,"" Shah said. 
The joint venture entity—Britchip Foods Ltd may also look at launching a few other products, according to Britannia’s fillings with BSE. Britannia holds 60% in Britchip Foods while Chipita has the remaining equity. After the 10-year lock-in, Britannia will have the right of first refusal if Chipita intends to sell its stake.
Britannia, which has been working on turning itself into a ‘total foods company’, is also eyeing new categories, Shah said. Earlier this month, Britannia managing director Varun Berry had said that the company aimed to launch about 50 new products by March 2020 as part of its plans to expand presence in bakery, non-bakery and micro-snacking categories, PTI reported.
“The focus on value-added dairy will continue,"" Shah said. India’s dairy market has always been a difficult space for most companies, including the multinationals. Last month, Danone SA of France formally shut down its dairy business in India after three failed attempts to penetrate the market, Mint reported on 12 January. 
However, Indian dairy market has always attracted big companies. In recent years, local entities of PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola Co., home-grown biggies like ITC Ltd have entered the market hoping to grab a share from the dominant players, such as Swiss Packaged food company Nestle India Ltd and home-grown Amul brand with focus on the value-added segment.
According to Berry, dairy would contribute about Rs1,500 crore to Britannia’s annual sales in five years, from Rs400 crore at present, and could be as big as its core biscuits business over a period, the Britannia managing director told Mint in an interview on 14 February. 
Britannia Industries reported a 19.60% increase in profit for the quarter ended 31 December to Rs263.65 crore while revenue grew 8.81% to Rs2,603.42 crore during the period, according to its filings with BSE. For the year ended 31 March 2017, its revenue stood at Rs8,684.39 crore."
41,2018-03-01,Britannia,"Britannia plans to operate with a 'zero-day inventory' by 'reducing distance between its distribution centres and retail stores that the company reaches directly

New Delhi: Britannia Industries Ltd is adapting the “leanest possible"" distribution model to directly “tailor-serve retail outlets"" across the country in less than a day as part of its plan to multiply sales and expand retail reach, said a senior executive. Currently, the process takes between one and three weeks. 
New Delhi: Britannia Industries Ltd is adapting the “leanest possible"" distribution model to directly “tailor-serve retail outlets"" across the country in less than a day as part of its plan to multiply sales and expand retail reach, said a senior executive. Currently, the process takes between one and three weeks.
In the new distribution model, the Kolkata-headquartered biscuit maker plans to operate with a “zero-day inventory"" by “reducing distance between its distribution centres and retail stores"" that the company reaches directly.
“Direct distribution results in much better offtake of brands. We have seen two to three times higher brand offtake (sales) after we started serving a particular retail outlet directly,"" said Gunjan Shah, vice president (sales), Britannia Industries. The aim, he added, is to go as deep possible ensuring it makes “commercial sense"".
But how far can Britannia go? “In some areas, we can go up to the level of a store that sells Britannia products worth Rs1,000 at least,"" said Shah. That’s just 100 packets of biscuits priced Rs10 each—Britannia’s largest selling pack size in non-metro markets.
The decision to focus on direct distribution came soon after Varun Berry took over as the company’s managing director in March 2014. At that time, Britannia used to serve only 6.5 lakh retail outlets directly. In comparison, Fritolay — a brand marketed by PepsiCo where Berry spent almost two decades — had a direct reach of 1.1 million outlets despite being one-fourth of Britannia’s size.
“From now on, every year we will add 2-3 lakh outlets to our direct network,"" Shah said. At present, the company directly reaches to 1.7 million retails stores of the 4.8 million outlets where Britannia products are sold. There are about 11 million retail outlets in India, of which around 8 million sell biscuits.
In the new direct distribution model, the entire supply chain is controlled by Britannia. Every day, around 20,000 people who are on Britannia’s direct payroll, visit retail stores, analyse local demands, suggest required tweaks in product placements based on the company’s in-house analytics and take orders on their mobile phones through an app. The orders are then delivered directly by Britannia from the nearest distribution centre within a day.
Traditionally, Britannia stocks products at its distribution centres. Products first go to its exclusive wholesale dealers, then distributors and direct retailers. The entire process takes anything from one week to three weeks, depending on the distance between the retail outlet and the factory. Britannia wants to reduce this to less than a day. 
While the focus on direct distribution was initiated in 2014 and increased reach, the new form of direct distribution is fairly new. In the last couple of years, Britannia tested the model for commercial viability in different pockets across 10 cities, starting with Mumbai.
“The new system is mapped real-time. It also reduces operational cost for dealers and distributors as they would not need to stock products,"" added Shah.
At present, Britannia has more than 800 vendors, 70 factories, 50 depots, 300 stock-keeping units and 3500 wholesalers. “The role of dealers and distributors is changing first. We need them for local knowledge, logistics and credit collection. Plus, they would take our products to geographies where Britannia can’t reach direct in a commercially viable manner. This would further expand reach,"" added Shah.
Britannia is not alone in implementing the new distribution model. Kolkata-based cigarette-to-biscuit maker ITC Ltd, which reaches about 2 million retail stores directly, has been working on a similar ‘factory-to-retail in a day’ model for the last few years, Mint reported on 10 June 2015. Britannia’s rival Parle Products, the maker of Parle G biscuits, has the largest retail reach.
According to a McKinsey and Co. report on the future of retail supply chains, companies can reduce costs by about 20% at the distribution centre level, while optimal deployment of inventory can reduce working capital by about 10%.
To move to a “zero-day inventory"" operational model, Britannia has been increasing its distribution centres aiming to reduce distance between them and retail outlets. “We now have around 14,000 distribution points, 4 times higher than what it was in 2013,"" he added.
“Britannia has been in revamp mode for the past couple of years backed by change in distribution strategy. The focus on direct distribution is the right thing that the company has done. It would help accelerate revenue, increase market share, and improve cost efficiency in the long term. But direct distribution would not make commercial sense in remote areas,"" said Sachin Bobade, an analyst with Dolat Capital Market.
For  ₹ 8,684-crore Britannia Industries, the theme is “pretty clear"": “Reduce distance to the market"", Berry told investors in the company’s last earnings call on 14 February."
40,2018-05-07,Britannia,"Despite ploughing lots of money into it and changing several executives, Britannia's dairy business constantly falls short of the company's expectations, contributing less than 5% of its annual revenues

Bengaluru: Since Britannia Industries Ltd started selling dairy products two decades ago, the company has put much store in making the business its next big thing. However, despite ploughing lots of money into it and changing several executives, the dairy business constantly falls short of the company’s expectations, contributing less than 5% of its annual revenues. 
Bengaluru: Since Britannia Industries Ltd started selling dairy products two decades ago, the company has put much store in making the business its next big thing. However, despite ploughing lots of money into it and changing several executives, the dairy business constantly falls short of the company’s expectations, contributing less than 5% of its annual revenues.
Britannia’s biggest problem is that it has been unable to dent the dominance of regional companies such as Hatsun Agro Product Ltd and Tirumala Milk Products Pvt. Ltd and co-operatives like the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF) that owns the Amul brand. Milk procurement is also a challenge as it is scattered and mostly unorganized. Parts of the dairy market, especially in Gujarat, are also tied to the politics of the state.
This leaves Britannia’s new dairy head, Venkat Shankar, with a massive challenge. Shankar joined the company in April from HT Media Ltd, which owns this newspaper, where he was executive director. He replaced Sarad Garodia, who quit Britannia last August and started a milk aggregator firm of his own called Happy Cow Dairy Co. Pvt. Ltd.
Shankar’s appointment marked the third time Britannia has changed its dairy head in as many years. He is tasked with accelerating sales growth in a very competitive market without compromising too much on profitability.
To put things into perspective, GCMMF earned Rs29,220 crore in provisional revenues for the financial year that ended 31 March on the back of the popularity of Amul. In February, Britannia managing director Varun Berry estimated that the company’s dairy business had the potential to grow to Rs1,500 crore annually within five years from Rs400 crore currently.
“It is very tough, there is no doubt about it, for any company to compete against Amul, which has now become very large on all fronts—distribution-wise, product range-wise and brand-wise. Britannia, being a large bakery/biscuit company, they have not been so tuned to the dairy dynamics,"" a consumer goods industry expert said on condition of anonymity.
Britannia will need disruptive and first-to-market products to succeed in the dairy space, said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities.
“It has strong brand equity in cheese, curd and ready-to-drink products but it was not competitive as it was outsourcing (production),"" Roy said, adding that the company will need to invest in the back-end also to really make a mark in the long run and compete with the likes of Amul.
Expanding the dairy business is important for Britannia as it has been looking to reduce its dependence on biscuits, its largest revenue earner. Under Berry, who became managing director in April 2014, Britannia has rapidly expanded sales and profits, gaining market share in biscuits. Over the long-term, biscuits is seen as a category that may struggle to expand significantly given changing consumer preferences. So, despite Britannia’s struggles in dairy, the company is expected to continue its attempt to crack the business.
“Given that India is a dairy-consuming country, the potential is far bigger than in biscuits in terms of the quantum. Earlier we used to make yogurt at home and now we have graduated to buying branded yogurt from supermarkets and even getting it delivered to our doorstep. Britannia is absolutely right in going after it,"" said Harminder Sahni, managing director at consulting firm Wazir Advisors."

Bengaluru: Biscuits maker Britannia Industries Ltd Wednesday said its board has re-appointed Varun Berry as managing director for five years, subject to approval by its shareholders.
Berry, who joined from PepsiCo Inc. in January 2013, took over as managing director at Britannia about four years ago. During his tenure, the company has rapidly expanded sales and profits and gained market share in biscuits even as it continues to make big pushes into other segments, including dairy and snacking.
After joining as chief operating officer in 2013, Berry was given several promotions by the company’s chairman Nusli Wadia, including being named executive director in November of the same year. He took over as managing director from Vinita Bali in April 2014.
His re-appointment for another five years starting 1 April 2019 is subject to the approval of members at Britannia’s annual general meeting, the company said in a BSE filing on Wednesday.
In another filing, Britannia also said the board had approved a grant of 1,50,000 stock options to Berry. Each option will entitle him, once he exercises it, to receive one equity share of the company at a face value of Rs2.
The grant of options is subject to an amendment of Britannia’s employee stock option scheme (ESOS), with respect to increasing the maximum number of equity shares that will be issued under it, the company said. This is also subject to approval at its AGM.
On Tuesday, the company reported a 24.77% jump in its net profit for the fourth quarter of 2017-18 to Rs263.16 crore, propped up by double-digit volume growth. Revenue grew 9.88% to Rs2,581.93 crore from a year ago.
“In the coming year, priority will be on bridging portfolio gaps in our bakery business and other adjacent macro snacking business opportunities to ensure we stay ahead of market and achieve profitable growth to take our company to the next level,"" Berry said in the company’s results statement on Tuesday."

36,2018-08-07,Britannia,"While Britannia's performance has improved, its balance sheet has a problem of plenty and it is using the bonus debenture issue to fix that

Britannia Industries Ltd’s June quarter results raises a question of whether profitability is levelling off or if this is a temporary phase. Sales grew by 13.6% in the June quarter over a year ago. If we assume volume growth was 10%—the company only said it grew in double digits—then price played a relatively small part. While revenue growth was decent, input costs provided a good boost to margins. Moderation in prices of key inputs such as flour, milk and sugar helped. 
Britannia Industries Ltd’s June quarter results raises a question of whether profitability is levelling off or if this is a temporary phase. Sales grew by 13.6% in the June quarter over a year ago. If we assume volume growth was 10%—the company only said it grew in double digits—then price played a relatively small part. While revenue growth was decent, input costs provided a good boost to margins. Moderation in prices of key inputs such as flour, milk and sugar helped.
While that meant Britannia had a fat margin of sales left over, it saw a sharp increase in employee costs and other expenses. Still, its net profit rose by 19.4% over a year ago. The press statement indicated that sales growth in the dairy segment was subdued as the company shifted focus to value-added products, but the shift helped margins.
Also, the international business growth was flat. It plans to enter new categories to drive growth. For now, its plans are to sell croissants, cream wafers and similar snacks.
The past few years have seen Britannia increase its distribution reach and lower costs. While these have yielded significant gains, they are likely to reach a threshold. After that, the firm needs to drive more sales through its network. That’s where selling more premium products and new categories will help.
While Britannia’s performance has improved, its balance sheet has a problem of plenty and it is using the bonus debenture issue to fix that. As of 31 March, its bank balance and current investments together rose to  ₹ 1,044 crore, up 3.5 times from a year ago. Free cash flow generated was  ₹ 826 crore.
This depresses asset utilization ratios. In FY18, for example, the company’s return on capital declined to 31.3% compared to 35.2% a year ago, while its return on net worth fell from 36.9% to 32.9%. How do bonus debentures help? 
In the first stage, the company will transfer money from one hand to another, with  ₹ 721 crore or one-fifth of net worth being turned into bonus debentures. This will see net worth decline by this amount, while debt increases. Shareholders will get these debentures without having to pay for them. Britannia will pay 8% interest for three years, which is a tax-deductible expense for the company.
Its return on net worth will jump after the issue, even if profits remain flat (though they are not expected to be flat). In the short run, this is indeed an artificial way of boosting return ratios, but not in the longer run. After three years, the debentures will be redeemed and money paid to shareholders. 
At that point, Britannia’s capital employed will also decline since debt is paid off (capital employed is net worth plus debt). At that point, its return on capital employed will also improve.
Why not simply pay the entire amount as dividend? The firm will then have very little cash left, either for a business exigency or to fund an acquisition. This way, it manages to make its ratios look better, even while the cash remains with it.
Britannia’s shares fell by 1% on Monday though they are up by 16% from its level three months ago. The results were broadly in line with the Street’s expectations but the levelling of margins is something to keep a watch on. If that prevails, sales growth has to be healthy for earnings growth to bring cheer."

New Delhi: Britannia Industries, the home-grown company which sells products like Tiger Biscuits, Good Day cookies and rusk, has launched an advertising campaign to mark the 100 year milestone. Made by Lowe Lintas, the campaign comprises ten films featuring consumers across age groups sharing how Britannia products have played a crucial role in their lives.  
New Delhi: Britannia Industries, the home-grown company which sells products like Tiger Biscuits, Good Day cookies and rusk, has launched an advertising campaign to mark the 100 year milestone. Made by Lowe Lintas, the campaign comprises ten films featuring consumers across age groups sharing how Britannia products have played a crucial role in their lives. 
“From a six-year old to an octogenarian everyone consumes Britannia products. We are a part of billion Indian consumers’ lives by playing multiple roles through our brands. The campaigns highlight different kind of consumers consuming various Britannia products and how these products change the life of the consumers,"" said Ali Harris Shere, Vice President Marketing at Britannia. 
The campaign consists of ten product films which will go on television and digital. We will also be creating content on digital along with radio, outdoor, print and activation. 
Britannia, with a new logo and tagline ‘Exciting goodness’, aims to become a whole foods company launching new products like wafers and croissants and entering new categories. It will also revamp its existing products with change in formulations and new product packaging. Good Day, 50-50, and health biscuit brand NutriChoice, Marie Gold and Tiger Biscuits are some of the products which will be relaunched shortly. 
“Through the new brand positioning ‘Excitement and Goodness’ we want to strike a perfect balance providing consumers both indulgent and healthy snacking options. While our Chunkies and Bourbon fall in the indulgent category, brands such as Milk Bikis and NutriChoice provide healthier option,"" Shere said. 
Contrary to perception, he further notes that consumers are talking about health & wellness, but the adoption of healthy food has been slow. While the category is growing faster than rest of the biscuits the rate of growth is not disruptive. 
“But we are investing ahead for the future in our brand Nutrichoice. There are certain barriers when it comes to healthy products price being one of the biggest one followed by taste. In healthy biscuits, Nutrichoice is the market leader we have more than 80% share in the premium health biscuit category. The onus is on us to grow this category,"" he added. 
Britannia is also relying on the premium category for growth. It is providing premium brands such as Chunkies cookies at  ₹ 5 and  ₹ 10 price points letting more consumers sample the product as well as consume it on the go.
According to Narayan Devanathan, Group Executive and Strategy Officer, Dentsu Brand Agencies South Asia, a company of the stature, respect and heritage of Britannia doesn’t need to merely thank people and remind them of its role in their lives in the past 100 years, but has the opportunity to highlight how they make better things in the future. 
“The “goodness"" part of “Exciting Goodness"" is clear enough. Mondelez’s chocolate brand Cadbury has also added that dimension to its communication recently. However, I couldn’t see any “exciting"" bit in the Britannia campaign,"" he said. 
Narayan also feels that Britannia, as a brand is an inseparable part of the fabric of life in India, need not remind viewers of the same fact through its communication. “I feel Tiger, Good Day and Marie Gold are even more ubiquitous in India than Maggi and Lifebuoy,"" he said. 
To his mind, since healthy food is an emerging topic of discussion in India, Britannia could take a lead in that direction in its future communication. “Given the emerging debate around healthy food, conscientious capitalism, sustainable practices and ethical ingredients, how will brand Britannia lead the conversation on that? Perhaps there’s a clue there too,"" he added."

Bengaluru: Britannia Industries Ltd plans to strengthen its dairy and snacks portfolios through new product launches and by ramping up its supply and distribution network. The maker of biscuits, bread and dairy products is considering repositioning the brand as a foods company and diversifying its revenue streams.  The 100-year-old company has traditionally earned a majority of its revenue through the sale of biscuits. As part of the recent business strategy, it plans to launch milk-based drinks and yogurts, besides cream wafers and croissants early next year. 
Bengaluru: Britannia Industries Ltd plans to strengthen its dairy and snacks portfolios through new product launches and by ramping up its supply and distribution network. The maker of biscuits, bread and dairy products is considering repositioning the brand as a foods company and diversifying its revenue streams.  The 100-year-old company has traditionally earned a majority of its revenue through the sale of biscuits. As part of the recent business strategy, it plans to launch milk-based drinks and yogurts, besides cream wafers and croissants early next year.
In fact, ever since Varun Berry took over as managing director of Britannia in April 2014, the focus has very sharply been on introducing new products and categories. India’s biscuit market is estimated to be worth  ₹ 30,000 crore.
But over the long-term, biscuits, as a category, may struggle to expand significantly given the changing consumer preferences. Britannia is therefore looking to diversify its portfolio with dairy, breads, rusks and macro-snacking products.
Dairy alone is a massive market in India with Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd’s (GCMMF) Amul brand leading the pack with revenue of about  ₹ 30,000 crore.
Experts say Britannia’s toughest challenge is to get a bigger slice of the dairy pie considering the presence of Amul and a host of other regional brands.
The company’s new dairy head, Venkat Shankar, is in charge of the ambitious plan of making it a  ₹ 1,500 crore business over the next five years. While Britannia sells its products under two brands—Britannia and Winkin’ Cow (for milkshakes)—the plan is to “resolve a brand architecture"" for its dairy business by the end of the current financial year.
“The way we see this business is not to play in the turf where others are strong, which is largely around liquid milk, but in the value-added segment only, and there we feel the game is wide open,"" said Shankar. Besides, snacking is also a significant market, dominated by unorganized mom-and-pop stores and bakeries. Britannia’s Jayant Kapre, who heads its breads, rusks, cakes and related business verticals, estimates the snacking market to be worth  ₹ 1 trillion. Of that, salty snacks account for  ₹ 24,000 crore, he added.
However, Britannia typically prefers sweet over savoury. For instance, it launched cream wafers two weeks ago.
“We’ve had snacks in the other space in the past and I have to say upfront that it’s a very difficult and complicated space to be in. We’ve done salty snacks a few years ago. We’ve seen other players come in and go out. So we want to decide whether we can make a meaningful play and do it well or else not do it at all,"" said Kapre."

BENGALURU :
Biscuit maker Britannia Industries Ltd’s third quarter profit grew 13.81% while revenue increased 11.48% as its efforts to expand direct distribution, focusing on geographies where it is weak, and keeping costs under check continued to pay off.
The company reported an increase in consolidated profit to  ₹300.07 crore from  ₹263.65 crore in the October-December quarter of 2018-19 versus the same period a year ago. Total revenue grew to  ₹2,902.44 crore from  ₹2,603.42 crore last year, it said in a filing with the BSE on Thursday evening.
“The building blocks of the business continued to be: expanding distribution reach in urban and rural markets, increasing presence and share in weak territories, accelerating innovation journey and doubling down on cost through our cost efficiency programs,"" Varun Berry, managing director of Britannia said in a statement.
Britannia’s decision to focus on expanding distribution came soon after Berry took over as managing director in 2014. Traditionally, Britannia stocks products at its distribution centres. Products first go to its exclusive wholesale dealers, then distributors and direct retailers. The entire process takes anything from one week to three weeks, depending on the distance between the retail outlet and the factory.
In the new direct distribution model, the entire supply chain is controlled by Britannia. Every day, a bunch of employees visit retail stores, analyse local demands, suggest required tweaks in product placements based on the company’s in-house analytics and take orders on their mobile phones through an app. The orders are then delivered directly by Britannia from the nearest distribution centre within a day.
The company also continued to focus on premiumisation and innovation in the third quarter and launched products like Swiss rolls, layer cakes, cream wafers and flavoured milkshakes. These launches are part of Britannia’s wider long-term strategy to become a total foods company.
It said it will continue to focus on bridging portfolio gaps in the bakery business and other adjacent macro snacking business opportunities. The company’s greenfield plant in Nepal is expected to be commissioned by the end of the current year, it said. It has also commissioned additional cake and biscuit lines at its factory in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra."

28,2019-03-07,Britannia,"The company’s market cap has increased 6.9 times in the last four years to  ₹72,740 croreEffective April 2019, Britannia will become only the third fast-moving consumer goods firm in the index

What is the best thing to have happened since sliced bread? Whatever it is, Britannia Industries Ltd appears to be partaking some of it, going by the dramatic increase in its market capitalization over the past few years. The company’s market cap has increased 6.9 times in the last four years to  ₹72,740 crore and, with this, it has catapulted itself into the bellwether Nifty 50 index. Effective April 2019, Britannia will become only the third fast-moving consumer goods firm in the index, after industry heavyweights Hindustan Unilever Ltd and ITC Ltd.
In the past, investors saw Britannia as a bread-and-butter business, which was growing steadily. Now, product introductions and rising premiumization are driving higher-than-industry growth. With consumers shifting to higher value-added products, Britannia has positioned itself well with new launches. The company has been introducing newer variants of its biscuits and entering fresh categories, such as croissants. It has also been expanding its cakes menu.
All this has seen its revenue expand. Its December quarter revenue stood at  ₹2,827.40 crore, compared to  ₹2,558.3 crore in the year-ago period. The increase in sales of value-added products has also boosted margins. The Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin rose from 14.79% in December 2017 quarter to 15.79% in the latest quarter.
Lately, though, the Britannia stock has been experiencing a bumpy ride from its peak of  ₹3,467 in August 2018. It is already down 12.7% to  ₹3,027. Analysts attribute investors’ concerns to slowing revenue growth. Its year-on-year revenue growth rate has slowed in the December quarter to 10.5%. In contrast, revenue growth in the year-ago period stood at 12.9%.
Part of the reason for the stock’s stagnation is concerns over its ability to drive further margin expansion. Raw material prices have been stable largely due to the drop in food prices. “One of the big concerns is food inflation. Rising raw material prices will tend to impact margins,"" says Naveen Kulkarni, head of research at Reliance Securities.
A larger concern is the rich stock valuations, due to higher demand for consumer goods stocks. In March 2015, Britannia’s one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio used to be about 35 times. Currently, it is 51.8 times, which is 48% higher. Unless it can bake healthy growth rates in the future, investors might soon find the stock unappetizing."
27,2019-03-07,Britannia,"On 6 March, Britannia announced winners who were awarded  ₹10 lakh each to scale up their businessesThe businesses ranged from home-bakers to makers of natural personal care products, among others

New Delhi: The 100-year-old Britannia Industries has set out to help homemakers in India kick-start their own businesses as the maker of Marie Gold and Good Day biscuits wants to up its engagement with consumers through more meaningful marketing campaigns. As part of a marketing plan for its Marie Gold biscuit brand, the company has funded 10 startup ideas led by women homemakers in India.
On 6 March, Britannia announced winners who were awarded  ₹10 lakh each to scale up their businesses. These ranged from home-bakers to makers of natural personal care products, and an entrepreneurial idea by a 23-year-old resident of Namakkal who wants to set up her own lassi shop.
In the first such marketing effort for the brand, the company said it was looking to use more social and purpose-driven messaging going forward. “There was a time when each of our brand campaigns used to be product-out (or more product driven) and made functional promises about the product to the consumer. But now we have realised that it is very important to take each of our brands to a higher purpose so we can have meaningful conversations with our consumers. That’s because there is a sense of realism and a social sensitivity emerging within consumers today,"" according to Ali Harris Shere, vice-president, marketing. Going forward, the company planned to attach a purpose with each of its brand, he added.
While the company will continue its product-focused campaigns, corporate social responsibility (CSR) or social messaging could also be part of marketing plans, he indicated.
The adaptation of social media was also pushing the company to rethink its marketing narrative, he added. “Indians always had a point of view on everything but they did not have the means to express it. Today anyone can express their point of view on anything and so they also resonate with brands that have a point of view.""
The company has already released a few campaigns. Last year, its Marie Gold brand rolled out a “Go Anywhere"" campaign that offered a chance for women to win free scooties. It launched the ""Kyunki Bahut Kuch Hai Karna Hai"" campaign in December last year as a prelude to the contest where it has now funded women entrepreneurs.
Over the past few years, brands have been pivoting to marketing campaigns that draw from larger social issues such as promoting voter rights, breaking the taboo around homosexuality, shedding spotlight on inter-caste marriages, and even focusing on gender equality. Brands such as Close-Up, Tata Tea and Titan have in the past woven their campaigns around these issues, as consumers especially in urban markets use social media to voice their opinions on such topics.
Britannia sees itself participating in such conversations going forward wherever it fits with the brands. “Elections are coming up, IPL is happening and then there is the World Cup. This offers a lot of contextual opportunities for our brands,"" Shere said."
26,2019-03-28,Britannia,"The key drivers for Indians to eat snacks are emotionalBeverages are emerging as alternatives to food as a snacking choice

New Delhi: Snack-loving Indians are turning to chips and namkeen when stressed, feeling indulgent or are taking a break, according to findings of a new report by research firm Mintel that studied the Indian consumers' attitude to snacking.
The key drivers for Indians to eat snacks are more emotional—majority of Indians said they indulge in snacking to treat themselves, or while taking a break. Of those surveyed, 37% eat snacks to get rid of stress. In all, Mintel studied snacking habits of 3000 online respondents in 2018.
“Modern lifestyle pressures are pushing today’s consumers towards food and activities that make them feel good...consumers are looking to manage their emotional well being, and treating oneself with indulgent foods is one way consumers are managing their mood. Hence there is a correlation between what we eat and our emotional state, especially when it comes to stress eating,"" Minu Srivastava, consumer research analyst, India, at Mintel, said in a release on March 28.
This has prompted more consumers to look out for health benefits while picking their snacks. In the past, a bulk of consumers munched on snacks without counting calories, but a growing number of consumers today said health benefits in snacks are a key purchase driver.
“Health and nutritional benefits have become an integral part of the snacking experience, as half of Indian snackers wish there are healthier snack options,"" the research note said. Moreover, some Indians are justifying their snacking frequency by saying that they snack to control their weight (28%) while some said snacks help them avoid overeating during meals.
Consumers are now also seeking convenience—be it better packaged snacks or bite-sized packs.
Mintel noted that close to 40% users were seeking a variety of conveniently packaged snacks, while one-third of those surveyed sought single-serving size packaging.
India's snacking market is huge.
While brands packaged food companies such as PepsiCo, ITC, Britannia, Parle, and Nestle have scored big in the market here, local companies that offer regional snacks such as banana chips, khakras, sevs, cookies et basis local taste preferences also occupy a huge space on the other end of the market.
India’s savoury snacks market is estimated at  ₹33,500 crore according to research firm Euromonitor; while biscuits, snack bars and fruit-based snacks are another Rs36,400 crore. Savoury snacks are expected to grow a massive 22% over the next five years, Euromonitor said in its recent estimates on India’s packaged foods market.
Consumers are increasingly scouting for snacks made with natural ingredients, and with added nutritional benefits, Mintel noted. Flavour and calorie content are among the other factors that consumers look for while picking a snack.
This Mintel said is creating more opportunities for companies to offer better and healthier snacks to Indians.
“...health guides many consumers' life choices, and snacking is no different as Indian consumers are now looking at the functional benefits like added nutrition, lower calorie content while choosing a snack. Thus, snacks need to evolve and transform with these changing consumer lifestyles and habits,"" Srivastava added.
Interestingly, beverages are emerging as alternatives to food as a snacking choice. Over 50% of those surveyed said they have used a beverage as a snack throughout the day."
25,2019-04-04,Britannia,"Weak Q4 results may give FMCG stocks a reality check on valuationsSlowdown in the rural economy is seen hurting consumption growth

The slowdown in consumption demand is well known, but valuations of fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have remained lofty. However, if these muted demand trends rub off on the March quarter (Q4) financial results of these companies, investors may well finally wake up and smell the coffee.
After reporting strong volume growth for the past six quarters, growth is expected to falter in Q4. For Q4 FY19, analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd estimate revenue and net profit growth of 8.7% and 9.2%, respectively, far lower than the 14.3% and 14.8% year-on-year growth reported in the December quarter. These are aggregate numbers for FMCG companies on whom the brokerage firm has research coverage.
One of the reasons for this moderation in demand growth expectations is the slowdown in the rural economy. In fact, the rural growth multiplier to urban multiplier has come down sequentially to about 1.1 times from 1.3 times in the December quarter. That apart, an extended winter also means that demand for products that picks up with rising heat took some beating. Additionally, some hit on the demand can also be explained by the tight liquidity conditions.
“Volume growth for most staples will soften in Q4FY19,"" wrote analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 2 April. Within its coverage universe, the broker expects Marico Ltd to outperform with 9% year-on-year volume growth helped by a favourable base. This would be followed by Britannia Industries Ltd and Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd with 8% and 7% year-on-year volume growth, respectively.
In its pre-quarterly update on 2 April, Marico said: “While rural grew ahead of urban in the traditional channel, we believe consumption trends should be closely monitored in light of some sluggishness in wholesale in March."" The company said that it witnessed stable demand conditions and healthy offtake growth on the back of the competitive strength of its franchises.
Analysts expect Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) to clock a volume growth of about 5%. The base March 2018 quarter volume growth was much higher at 11%, representing a high base.
On the positive side, margins may get a leg-up because of some softening of input costs compared to the December quarter.
For investors, management commentary on demand outlook would be crucial to follow. Besides, a good monsoon may bring cheer for FMCG companies on expectations of better rural demand.
As pointed out earlier, valuations of consumer goods companies are high. According to Bloomberg, the Nifty FMCG index trades at 35 times estimated earnings for FY20. In that sense, the Q4 results could offer investors a reality check as far as valuations are concerned."

New Delhi: Ness Wadia, son of industrialist Nusli Wadia and inheritor of one of India's wealthiest business families, has been sentenced for drugs possession while on a skiing holiday to Japan.
Financial Times reported that Ness Wadia, heir to the 283-year-old Wadia Group and co-owner of the Kings XI Punjab cricket team, was arrested in early March at the New Chitose Airport in the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido.
According to a brief report carried by a local Hokkaido station of state broadcaster 'NHK', customs officials at New Chitose were alerted by sniffer dogs and a search revealed that Wadia had about 25 grams of what appeared to be cannabis resin in his trouser pocket.
""Ness Wadia is in India. The judgement is clear. It's a suspended sentence. Hence it won't impact Ness Wadia in the discharge of any of his responsibilities,"" 'ANI' quoted the Wadia group spokesperson as saying.
The Wadia empire has many units, including Bombay Dyeing, Bombay Burman Trading, biscuit giant Britannia Industries to budget airline GoAir and a share in IPL franchise Kings XI Punjab, with the total market valuation of its listed entities standing at $13.1 billion.
A court official in Sapporo told the 'Financial Times' that Wadia admitted to possession, arguing that the drug was for his personal use.
Wadia spent a period in detention before his indictment on 20 March and an undisclosed period of detention before a court hearing.
The Sapporo District Court handed him a two-year prison term, which was suspended for five years.
Shares of Wadia group companies dropped on Tuesday after the report. Bombay Dyeing & Mfg Co Ltd dropped 10.1% on the BSE, while National Peroxide slipped 5.1%. Bombay Burmah Trading Corp Ltd was down 3.6% and Britannia Industries fell 2.6%.

Nobody expected much from consumer goods firms for the March quarter. Therefore, the financial results of Britannia Industries Ltd are not disappointing, even though they are far from being encouraging.
The company’s domestic volumes grew 7% year-on-year in the March quarter, broadly in line with estimates. Investor expectations had softened after December quarter volume growth came in at 7%, missing expectations.
Consolidated revenue for the quarter increased 10.3% to  ₹2,799 crore. International business was restrained, witnessing single-digit growth due to a slowdown in business in the Middle East. Profit growth was more or less in line with revenue growth, as a slight decline in margins was offset by higher other income.
Management commentary during the earnings conference call on demand outlook was lacklustre. Rural demand, too, did not offer much assurance.
“We have seen a slowdown in the market in recent months,"" said the Britannia management in a press release. Analysts, however, point out that the company has gained market share from competitors such as Parle Products Pvt. Ltd in a declining market.
This has been aided by new launches, which have boosted sales. In the March quarter, the company launched Treat Burst, Treat Stars, Whole Wheat Marie and Milk Bikis Choco Cream.
“Britannia continues to gain market share in its core biscuits category, coupled with a stepped-up focus on building new categories,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 2 May.
But new launches also mean higher marketing expenses, which is why margins fell in the March quarter. “While new categories would aid topline growth in the near term, they would restrict margin expansion given investments needed in the scale-up,"" added the Jefferies India report.

“Britannia continues to gain market share in its core biscuits category, coupled with a stepped-up focus on building new categories,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 2 May.
But new launches also mean higher marketing expenses, which is why margins fell in the March quarter. “While new categories would aid topline growth in the near term, they would restrict margin expansion given investments needed in the scale-up,"" added the Jefferies India report.
There are some other worries as well. “We have concerns on the increase in ICD (inter-corporate deposits) to group companies over FY2015-18,"" wrote analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a report on 2 May. ICDs have increased to  ₹350 crore in FY18 (10% of net worth, and 42% of free cash-flow) from  ₹50 crore in FY14, added the brokerage firm.
Collectively, these factors seemed to have weighed on Britannia’s shares on Thursday, dragging the stock down 4% on the National Stock Exchange. Even after Thursday’s drop, it’s not as if the valuations have turned inexpensive. The stock still quotes at a pricey 47 times estimated earnings for FY20. Going ahead, better volume growth rates hold the key to ensure valuations don’t get bitten into."
21,2019-05-03,Britannia,"HUL could register softer volume growth in the fourth quarter of FY19: AnalystsBut price hike could help expand margins in some categories

New Delhi: India’s largest FMCG firm, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, is set to announce its March quarter (Q4) results today. The company, that sells products across personal care, home care, and food and beverages segments, has been reporting strong volume growth over the last few quarters.
HUL’s earnings—usually the bellwether for India’s fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) market—helps gauge consumer demand and monitor sentiment.
However, over the last few months companies and analysts have been warning of a consumer slowdown especially in rural markets. Additionally, a higher base in the previous quarters and a delayed onset of summers are likely to soften top line growth in the fourth quarter for some companies. For instance, biscuit maker Britannia Industries posted a 7% volume growth during the quarter in its earnings announced earlier in the weeks while Dabur India reported its slowest domestic volume growth in seven quarters in Q4.
HUL, which has been registering strong double-digit volume growth over the last few quarters, could register softer volume growth in the fourth quarter of FY19, said analysts who track the sector.
Volumes at the maker of Sunsilk shampoo and Surf detergent are expected to grow between 6% to 8%, according to estimates from various brokerages. Revenues at the Mumbai-based company are expected to grow between 6% to 12%, while analysts expect profit growth to come between 13% to 18%.
Jefferies expects volume growth to moderate for HUL at 5%. In the March quarter of FY18, the Mumbai-headquartered company had posted volume growth of 11%, albeit on a lower base.
“This will be a soft quarter for the company on the base of higher volume growth in the previous quarter and slow offtake in rural,"" said Naveen Trivedi, AVP, institutional equities at HDFC Securities, which expects a 7.5% volume growth.
Another brokerage Edelweiss too expects moderation in volume growth at 6% year-on-year on account of a high base in the year-ago period. Edelweiss expects revenue, EBITDA and PAT to grow at 7%, 13% and 18%, respectively.
Volume growth is an important indicator in a way as it looks at growth in sales minus the price hikes undertaken by the company.
Additionally, analysts are also watching out for numbers across different segments. HUL operates in the personal care, home care and foods and refreshments category. “For personal care as a category HUL’s growth have been slow, driven by higher competition and promotional expenses on behalf of HUL,"" HDFC Securities’ Tripathi said.
In Q3FY19, HUL reported lower margins of 21.9% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The company has been managing costs with slight price hikes.
Over the last few months, the company took a price hike in talc, deos, skin and skin wash products, whereas it cut prices in detergent bars. The company increased price of Axe Dark Temptation deodorant by 5% and Fair & Lovely Advanced Multi-Vitamin Cream by 3% during the last few months.
This price hike could help expand margins in some categories.
“Selective price hikes and cost-saving efficiencies should drive margin expansion,"" brokerage Emkay Global said in an April 9 report.
The company’s EBITDA margin could expand by 175 bps year-on-year helped by operating cost efficiencies (including advertising and promotional spends) while gross margin may expand 70 bps year-on-year, Kotak Securities said in an April report.
HUL’s earnings come at a time when market research firm Nielsen lowered its growth projection for India’s fast moving consumer goods market to 11-12% in 2019, a downward revision from its earlier projection of 13% to 14%. “While a slight drop is witnessed in urban growth, there is a significant softening of growth trends in rural, which is dampening the overall FMCG industry growth from Q318 to Q119,"" Nielsen said in a report last month."
20,2019-05-07,Britannia,"After reporting strong volume growth over the past few quarters, the FMCG companies reported subdued numbers for January to March 2019A moderate rural demand, liquidity crisis in the market and the adverse impact of a delayed summer led to lower growth

New Delhi: A consumption slowdown dampened sales in the March quarter at some of India’s largest consumer goods firms, as a slow offtake of goods in rural markets and an elongated winter forced companies to report moderate volume growth.
India’s largest FMCG firm Hindustan Unilever Ltd., biscuits maker Britannia Industries Ltd., along with Dabur India Ltd., Marico Ltd and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd., announced their fourth-quarter earnings earlier this month. After reporting strong volume growth over the past few quarters, the companies reported subdued numbers for January to March 2019.
Top executives at these firms acknowledged that a moderate rural demand, liquidity crisis in the market and the adverse impact of a delayed summer led to lower growth.
India’s largest consumer goods firm, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) on Friday reported 7% volume growth for the quarter ahead of its peers, but this was its slowest growth in six quarters. Revenues at the maker of Lux soaps and Surf Excel detergent were up 9.3% to  ₹9,945 crore and its profit jumped by 13.8% to  ₹1,538 crore.
The company’s managing director and chairman Sanjiv Mehta said the company witnessed moderation in the general trade and wholesale channels. ""And if I look at it from the lens of geography, then moderation is more pronounced in rural markets,"" Mehta added. HUL, which has been seeing rural markets grow at a faster pace than urban markets, said “rural growth has come on the same level as urban,"" indicating a reversal of the trend.
Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL), which sells the popular Cinthol soap and Good Knight mosquito repellent, posted a mere 1% increase in domestic volumes; while its net profit was up 51% at  ₹935.24 crore during the quarter. “It has been a relatively weak quarter for us,"" Vivek Gambhir, MD and CEO, GCPL, told investors over a post-earnings call. “Our India business remained soft on account of a general slowdown in staples consumption, on liquidity pressure that we saw in the channel, and the adverse impact of the delayed summer for much of our portfolio, particularly soaps and household insecticides.""
These numbers come days after research and insights firm Nielsen had lowered its annual growth projection for India’s fast moving consumer goods market to 11-12% for 2019, a downward revision from its earlier projection of 13-14% after it observed a “significant softening of rural growth trends.""
The trend was visible across categories.
Biscuit maker Britannia reported a 7% jump in domestic volumes, largely in line with street expectations, while its profit for the quarter was up 11.82% at  ₹294.27 crore.
However, the maker of Good Day and NutriChoice biscuits said it had witnessed softening of consumer demand for its products over the last two quarters. “In the last two quarters, we've seen a certain slowdown in our overall growth… from September (ish) to this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown of about 5%, 500 basis points overall, in the categories that we operate in,"" the company's management said in an earnings call on 2 May. A large part of that slowdown is in rural markets, the management noted. Varun Berry, managing director, Britannia, added that while rural continues to outgrow urban, growth rates in both markets have come down from the levels that they were six months ago.
On Tuesday, Jyothy Laboratories, posted a 6.3% jump in volume for the fourth quarter. However, the company that sells Ujala fabric whitener and Margo soaps said that rural markets that contribute close to 35% of the company’s sales have decelerated in the last two quarters. As a result, consumers are downtrading to lower pack sizes, said Ullas Kamath, joint managing director, Jyothy Laboratories Ltd.
In the north, a delayed summer also hit sales at FMCG companies.
Dabur India Ltd, the maker of Real juices and Vatika hair oil, posted a 4.7% rise in consolidated revenue for the quarter at  ₹2,128.19 crore, with a 4.3% growth in domestic volume—its lowest in seven quarters."

Producers of household items have been India’s best stock market bets for years. But the consumption slowdown in the world’s fastest-growing major economy is rubbing the sheen off these shares.
The 74-member S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Goods Index, which has had only one down year since 2006, has bucked the gains in the nation’s benchmark measure. And some of the biggest names in the gauge have accumulated double-digit losses five months into the year.
India’s consumption engine is sputtering as the cash crunch caused by the crisis in the shadow-banking sector has curbed spending even on staples after hurting demand for cars and homes. Hindustan Unilever Ltd., whose soaps and detergents are used by nine out of 10 Indian households, in an analysts call Friday pinned the deceleration on weak rural demand and said it is unable to say when the buoyancy of the past would return.
“When a generally-measured management like Hindustan Unilever’s uses the term ‘recession’ in its comments in the post-result presser, it generally isn’t a one-quarter blip,"" analysts led by Rohit Chordia at Kotak Institutional Equity Research wrote in a note on the weekend.
The company’s volume growth slowed to 7 percent in the March quarter after five straight quarters of double-digit expansion. Growth for Dabur India Ltd. during the period was 4.3 percent compared with about 8 percent a year earlier. Britannia Industries Ltd. grew 7 percent, versus 11 percent, and Godrej Consumer Products Ltd. posted a 1 percent increase in its domestic branded-business volumes.
The market is repricing the growth outlook. Hindustan Unilever has declined 5.8 percent in 2019, Godrej Consumer 21 percent, Britannia 15 percent and Dabur 11 percent. The S&P BSE Fast-Moving Consumer Index trades at a 12-month blended forward price-to-earning of 32, higher than its five-year average, signaling potential for further contraction in values.
“The sector isn’t a bad place to be in but the high price-earnings ratios are a challenge,"" Pashupati Advani, president of Advani Group, said by phone. “The explosive growth we saw in the past has disappeared. It is difficult to say when the economy will revive.""
The slowdown may not be cyclical, according to a separate report by Kotak Institutional Equities, which cites insufficient income growth as the reason for the weak demand. Lower property purchases by households from fiscal 2013 through 2018 helped sustain consumption, which is cooling off now as incomes fall, according to the note co-authored by Sanjeev Prasad.
As India’s on-going general elections enter the last stretch, the task for the new government is cut out -- take steps to revive economic growth. Prasad has three suggestions:"
18,2019-06-18,Britannia,"Multiplex operator Inox Leisure Ltd is showcasing all the big matches to be played by team India, along with the semi-finals, finalThe idea is to give Indian fans a stadium-like experience

New Delhi: Apart from running television and digital advertisements, a clutch of brands across categories is also offering fun experiential opportunities to Indian fans leveraging the hype around the ongoing ICC World Cup.
Multiplex operator Inox Leisure Ltd is showcasing all the big matches to be played by team India, along with the semi-finals, final and few marquee league matches. The idea is to give Indian fans a stadium-like experience. “Cricket in India is loved by a wide audience and we want to provide a community experience of cricket viewing by providing a carnival like experience. We have put up balls, cricket bats and cutouts in our lobby to create a World Cup like décor. We are providing props to cheer India and we have also introduced a World Cup special menu,"" said Alok Tandon, chief executive, Inox Leisure Limited.
Food continues to be a big area where brands are wooing fans through heavy discounts and menu experimentation. Online food delivery platforms such as Swiggy and Zomato are in overdrive offering heavy discounts to consumers. Meanwhile, Bira 91, which is the official partner for ICC England and Wales World Cup 2019, has launched a massive activation in the country partnering with over 900 restaurants across the country. The beer brand is running promos, along with hosting official match screenings for the
Cricket World Cup at select venues across New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru, and Pune.
According to Gulshan Singh, national planning director, FCB Interface fan communities are an extremely attractive segment – fans bring their time, money and passion to the table. “For the super-connected millennials and Gen Z, shared experiences are arguably the most valuable kind. Brands seek to drive positive association and consumption cues amongst this passionate set, and thus garner greater share of mind, share of social media, and share of wallet,"" he added.
Packing and product innovation is another way some brands are trying to tap into consumer consumption. Liquor brands such as Officer Choice’s Blue and 8PM have launched limited edition World Cup packs. Biscuit maker Britannia has brought back its decade old campaign ‘Britannia Khao World Cup Jao’ campaign under which consumers have to ‘SMS’ good old promo codes and stand a chance to win a trip to England and goodies. Meanwhile, chocolate maker Mondelez has introduced a limited edition Cadbury Dairy Milk Champions pack which comes with cricket icons like bat, ball and bails engraved on the chocolate bars.
According to Sanjay Sarma, founder, SSARMA Consults, a branding & communication advisory, packaging innovation that coincides with a big global sporting event is a smart strategy, particularly for food & beverage brands. “It closes the loop of a larger marketing campaign at the point of consumption. There is nothing bigger than cricket in India and the World Cup will see families, friends and entire neighborhood in towns come together to watch games. Naturally, this will drives consumption, and any brand that can smartly slip into the moment, will see a huge spike in its half yearly results,"" he said."
17,2019-06-22,Britannia,"Brands such as Star Sports, Coca-Cola, GoDaddy, Bira 91, Emirates, Hublot and Britannia are ICC’s partners in this edition of the world cupRain-affected matches could cost brands associated with the tournament dearly as they lose out on advertisement space and time

""Unlike the weather, you can depend on us for cheap prices,"" reads a billboard advertisement for ASDA, a British supermarket retailer, near the Heathrow international airport in London.
The advertisement is an interesting take on how unpredictable the weather can be in England, especially during summers.
At least seven group-stage matches in the ongoing International Cricket Council (ICC) World Cup in England and Wales have been affected—with play abandoned or the number of overs curtailed—as rains play spoilsport.
Rain-affected matches could cost brands associated with the tournament dearly as they lose out on advertisement space and time.
However, if top officials of the ICC are to be believed, no sponsor has expressed disappointment over the rain-hit matches.
""All the feedback that we are getting is that the brands that have partnered us are exceptionally happy with what’s taken place so far and their engagements with audiences. So that explains,"" Campbell Jamieson, general manager-commercial, ICC, said during an interaction with journalists in Nottingham, where a match between India and New Zealand was abandoned.
Brands such as Star Sports, Coca-Cola, GoDaddy, Bira 91, Emirates, Hublot and Britannia are ICC’s partners in this edition of the world cup.
""ICC has never ever had reserve days outside of knockout final games,"" Jamieson said, adding that the world cup would have to be extended by at least a month if reserve days were added for group-stage matches, and that this isn't feasible.
The sponsors, meanwhile, say they are more concerned for the fans who miss out on the excitement of seeing their favourite teams play in the tournament.
""Forget about us sponsors, and think about the cricket fan, who is all excited to watch his or her favourite team play in the world cup, but goes home dejected after the match they have come to watch with so much hope is abandoned,"" said a senior communications official at Coca-Cola, a global sponsor of the world cup, adding that a potential hit on return on investments due to the rains cannot be ruled out.
Brands such as Coca-Cola and others are running a number of promotional campaigns during the tournament that offer a range of prizes--from cash-backs on orders to tickets to the finals of the world cup.
According to ICC rules, if play is restricted or does not take place at the venue on the day for which a ticket is valid, including any reserve day, the ticket purchaser may claim a refund of the original sale price of that ticket, excluding fees.
Fans can get a full refund if less than 15 overs were played because of adverse weather conditions. A 50% refund is applicable for games that are restricted to between 15.1 overs and 29.5 overs because of rough weather.
If the tickets for such abandoned or curtailed matches are purchased from the official ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 ticketing website, the refund will be issued automatically within 28 days to the card used to buy the tickets, says ICC.
Francis Bernard, a banker from Australia and a die-hard fan of the Indian cricket team who traveled from Melbourne to watch the India versus Pakistan match--one of the most eagerly anticipated games of the tournament--at Manchester last week, said he had bought the tickets for the match during presale for £70 (around  ₹6,200 today).
“The rain gods were merciful on the day and we had a good day’s game,"" Bernard said.
The rains and wet grounds have also been affecting crucial practice schedules of various teams ahead of crunch games as entire net sessions are being abandoned.
Meanwhile, it’s not just the fans, teams and sponsors who are affected by the rough weather and washed-out matches.
Christeen Sheath, an elderly member of the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club and a volunteer at the Trent Bridge stadium, said it is disappointing for the hosts to see fans, especially those who have travelled from afar, dejected after they miss out on a match due to the rains.
“Fans, especially from India, spend so much of time, money and effort to come here to watch and enjoy a game of cricket. It is extremely disappointing for us to see them go out of the stadium dejected after a washout,"" Sheath, who was volunteering for the India versus New Zealand match that got washed out at Trent Bridge last week, said.
Sheath says India and Sri Lanka, which beat hosts England by 20 runs in a do-or-die match on Friday, are her favourite teams and that she is hoping to see them in the finals at Lord’s on 14 July.

NEW DELHI :
FMCG major Britannia Industries Wednesday dispelled speculations over the resignation of its Managing Director Varun Berry from the company.
Terming the speculations as ""false"" as well as ""incorrect and baseless"", Britannia Industries said, Berry was re-appointed as the Managing Director for five years effectively from April 1, 2019, following his six years stint in the company from 2013.
""There have been false speculations over the last few days on Varun Berry's resignation from the company. We would like to clarify that these rumours are incorrect and baseless,"" Britannia Industries said in a statement.
According to the company, Britannia Industries has seen strong results in Berry's tenure and is trying to be a ""global total foods company"".
Berry had joined Britannia Industries, which owns popular brands as Good Day, Tiger, Milk Bikis and Marie Gold, from food and beverage firm PepsiCo in 2013.
In FY2018-19, Britannia Industries, which operates in segments as biscuits, bread, cakes, rusk, and dairy products, had revenue of  ₹10,482.45 crore.

New Delhi: Cigarettes to packaged consumer goods conglomerate ITC Ltd on Friday reiterated its plans to expand its fast-moving consumer goods business by adding newer segments under its portfolio and even looking at strategic acquisitions, the company said during its 108th annual general meeting in Kolkata.
“To accelerate growth in the FMCG businesses, the endeavour is not only to fortify the existing categories towards delivering industry leading performance but also to foray into newer categories and sub-segments. This would be supported by multi-dimensional investments as well as strategic opportunities for acquisitions,"" ITC’s Sanjiv Puri told shareholders during his maiden AGM address as the chairman of the company.
The move is in line with ITC’s efforts to reduce its dependence on the tobacco business riddled with excessive taxing and regulation, and instead build a large stable of consumer goods brands to compete with the likes of Hindustan Unilever, PepsiCo and Britannia.
For the year ended March 2019, ITC posted a net revenue of  ₹44,415 crore, with profit after tax of  ₹12,464 crore. For the same year, the revenue for its FMCG-others business, including branded packaged foods, personal care stationery products, lifestyle retailing, incense sticks and matches stood at  ₹12,505.28 crores.
To be sure ITC already sells packaged foods, personal care, and stationery under its consumer goods portfolio, spanning brands such as Aashirwad, Sunfeast biscuits, Yippie noodles, B Natural juices, Vivel soaps, Bingo chips and incense sticks. Last year, the company also forayed into dairy products. Over 50 products were launched last year to strengthen existing categories and enter newer segments, the company said.
“In the last two to three years, ITC has expanded its FMCG portfolio by foraying into new segments. This includes the luxury ‘Fabelle’ Chocolates collection, dairy & dairy beverages under the ‘Aashirvaad Svasti’ and ‘Sunfeast Wonderz’ brands, frozen foods from the ‘ITC Master Chef’ collection, skincare with the premium ‘Dermafique' among others.
As a result, newer FMCG businesses contribute 25% to ITC’s segment revenue; while EBITDA for the segment jumped over 50% to  ₹688 crore in FY19, the company said on Friday. Some of its key brands also achieved scale. In the last financial year, its packaged foods brand Aashirvaad touched  ₹4,500 crore in sales; Sunfeast is over Rs.3,800 crores; Bingo! became a  ₹2,500-crore brand.
The company, said Puri, is also scaling its manufacturing infrastructure, by “investing in building state-of-the-art manufacturing infrastructure across the country to rapidly scale up the FMCG businesses..."" This includes the creation of 20 Integrated Consumer Goods Manufacturing and Logistics (ICML) facilities that will aid the company with economies of scale, freshness and close-to-market distribution.
ITC’s consumer goods reach six million retail outlets today, a network it will continue to expand, according to Puri. “Substantive investments are being made in expanding this network and in developing alternate and emerging channels such as modern trade, on-the-go, food services, end-to-end cold chain, e-commerce and so on.""
ITC Ltd had earlier set a target of achieving  ₹100,000 crore in revenue from the sale of fast-moving consumer goods by 2030."

New Delhi: Market researcher Nielsen lowered its annual sales forecast for India’s packaged goods sector on Wednesday, as consumption cooled for the third straight quarter, led by a sharp rural slowdown.
Sales of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) grew 10% in the three months ended 30 June, Nielsen said in its quarterly insights report, down marginally from the year-ago period and down 3.4% from the preceding quarter.
“In Q219, FMCG value growth has dropped to 10% inching towards a slowdown; this follows the softening from the highs of Q32018 when the sector grew by 16.2%,"" Nielsen said in a statement. Nielsen follows a January-December year.
In the first half of the year, growth in FMCG sales was 12%, lower than Nielsen’s earlier prediction of 13-14% for the same period. For the second half, Nielsen expects growth of around 8%.
Nielsen lowered its 2019 growth forecast for FMCG to 9-10% from its previous forecast of 11-12%, citing macroeconomic factors such as slowing growth and the impact of a deficient monsoon. Within this, food categories are expected to grow at a higher rate of 10-11%, while personal and home care are expected to grow 7-8%.
India is an agrarian economy significantly dependent on rainfall, Sunil Khiani, head of retail measurement services at Nielsen South Asia, said at a press conference in New Delhi. “So, the distribution of rainfall is critical. Also, we have to see how GDP and inflationary trends play out that will have a huge impact on consumption.""
The slowdown in growth was more pronounced in rural markets, even as they continued to grow ahead of urban. “Rural is slowing down at double the rate of urban,"" noted Nielsen, something that could reflect in the upcoming June quarter earnings of some of India’s biggest consumer goods companies.
The slowdown in sales of FMCG products in the hinterland, accounting for 37% of spends for the sector, occurred at a sharper pace compared to urban markets. Rural growth dipped to 10.3% in the April-June quarter, down from 12.7% clocked in the year-ago period. Compared to the third quarter of 2018, FMCG growth in rural areas fell 9.7%.
“Rural India has historically been growing around 3 to 5 percentage points faster than urban on account of increasing affordability, availability and demand. However, rural growth is slowing down at double the rate of urban in recent quarters. This has brought rural growth closer to urban growth in Q219,"" Nielsen said.
The rural slowdown is most pronounced in north India, followed by the west. Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Assam are among the states leading the slowdown."

Investors will find Britannia Industries Ltd’s June quarter results unappetizing. True, consumer staples firms are facing a demand slowdown and, as such, expectations from the company were not running high. Still, Britannia’s Q1 performance is disappointing, with growth being much lower than peers. To add to that, the management’s commentary on demand outlook was discouraging.
“Britannia management all but ruled out a quick recovery in demand, with its commentary being sharply weaker than we have heard from other consumer packaged goods (CPG) managements,"" said analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities in a review report.
In a post-earnings conference call, the management said: “If the consumer is thinking twice before buying even a  ₹5 product, then obviously there is some serious issue in the economy."" In that backdrop, it’s hardly surprising that Britannia’s shares have fallen by 3% since it announced its Q1 results on 9 August.
Perhaps, the most disappointing aspect is the subdued domestic volume growth of 3%, a marked deterioration from the past few quarters. Consolidated revenue growth of about 6% appears discouraging, missing Street expectations.
“We are surprised by the growth divergence between Britannia (biscuits) and other players (categories). It is worth noting that (1) Nestle (F&B play akin to Britannia but much more urban centric) reported strong 12%+ growth driven by chocolates and noodles, and (2) Dabur (rural play) reported 10% volume growth despite rural weakness,"" said Kotak’s analysts.
On the profitability front, growth slowed further with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declining by 69 basis points year-on-year to 14.6%. Even though revenue growth rates fell, some costs, such as employee and other operating expenses, rose as much as 11%.
Additionally, the consumption slowdown woes are likely to continue. Analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said: “Britannia’s earnings trajectory is witnessing a sharp slowdown from the past given the low hanging fruits of market share gain in biscuits and overall cost savings are captured in the base."" In a report on 12 August, it added: “While we like attempts to build categories for future, they would remain margin and ROCE dilutive in short term. Consensus expectations and valuations remain rich relative to actual delivery."" ROCE is return on capital employed.
So far in FY20, Britannia’s shares have shed nearly 19% of their value, underperforming the Nifty 200 index. Still, with valuations at about 47 times estimated earnings for FY20, investors may not be tempted to bite the stock."
12,2019-08-22,Britannia,"A good monsoon, govt’s inclination to improve rural fortunes are likely to improve the demand situation in the second halfThe volume performance of consumer staples firms in the June quarter shows that some companies have fared better compared to others

India’s largest biscuit maker Parle Products has said it may have to lay off up to 10,000 employees if the consumption slowdown persists. Parle’s rival and listed company Britannia Industries Ltd had earlier said, while announcing its June quarter results, that consumers are thinking twice before buying even a  ₹5 pack biscuit.
But how severe is the slowdown?
“There is some underlying demand slowdown, for sure, but the deceleration is not as sharp as the reported growth comps suggest,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a 20 August report.
According to analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd, “Consumer staples’ volume growth was relatively resilient in Q1FY20 despite the slowdown brouhaha.""
As the chart shows, while sales growth of consumer discretionary firms has declined, these firms are still growing at a fairly decent pace. Asian Paints Ltd, for instance, reported 17% increase in volumes in the June quarter.
The volume performance of consumer staples firms in the June quarter shows that some companies have fared better compared to others. For perspective: Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) clocked volume growth of 5%, moderating from the March quarter volume growth of 7%. Volume growth for Marico Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Dabur India Ltd and ITC Ltd were 6%, 5%, 9.6% and 3% (estimated), respectively.
“Dabur is generally seen as the stock to play the ‘rural’ theme and here, we have the company report the highest growth (off a high base; so, no base benefit) in a quarter where nearly all companies suggested a sharp rural slowdown,"" wrote Kotak analysts.
While announcing the June quarter results, the HUL management said the rural market, which was earlier growing ahead of urban, is now growing at par with it. This trend was highlighted in the previous quarter as well.
Of course, the slowdown has cast a shadow on consumer stocks. The Nifty FMCG index has underperformed the Nifty 50 so far this calendar year.
Besides, management commentary during the earnings calls wasn’t upbeat on near-term demand. However, some expect the demand situation to improve in the second half of the year aided by a good monsoon and government’s inclination to improve rural fortunes.
“We believe, demand will pick up from Q4FY20 (even companies believe so) once payouts under direct transfer schemes and better monsoon lead to more money in the hands of consumers,"" said Edelweiss analysts in a 20 August report.
That said, until investors see visible signs of a revival in demand, investors can be expected to hold on tightly to their purses."
11,2019-08-25,Britannia,"When purchasing power dries up to the extent that rural laborers, urban blue-collar workers have to think twice about cheap munchies, then the situation is desperateThe culprit is deep-rooted wage suppression, a long-term issue that needs attention

When snack makers start to lament that Indians can’t afford to spend  ₹5 (7 cents) on biscuits, (1) it’s time to stop arguing over how much of the nation’s slowdown is cyclical and what part is structural.
Considering its glaring income, wealth and consumption inequalities, India is a surprisingly calm society. However, when purchasing power dries up to the extent that rural laborers and urban blue-collar workers have to think twice about cheap munchies, then the situation is desperate. The culprit is deep-rooted wage suppression, a long-term issue that needs attention.
Britannia Industries Ltd., the No. 1 Indian biscuit maker, recently sounded alarm bells over the sharp deceleration in its domestic sales volumes. Rival Parle Products Pvt. chimed in and said jobs were at risk for as many as 10,000 of its workers.
A Parle executive blamed India’s 2017 goods and services tax, or GST. While the consumption tax may indeed have been an additional burden in an economy slowing under a disastrous November 2016 currency ban, the funk has its roots in insufficient wages. In recent years, only about a third of the economy’s income has gone to labor, with providers of debt and equity capital taking the rest, according to India Ratings and Research Pvt., a unit of Fitch Ratings. Raising that 33.2% labor share to the developing-country average of 37.4% would put an extra $100 billion of annual spending power in the hands of Indian households.
Only then can India start facing up to the tougher challenge of reaching advanced-economy levels. It has a long way to go. The labor share of income in the US was almost 57% in 2016, even after a near 10-percentage-point drop following World War II that was caused by technological changes and globalization, according to McKinsey & Co.
Trouble is, the distribution of the Indian economic pie is more lopsided than the aggregate numbers suggest. As India Ratings’ analysis shows, 80% of the output generated in informal production gets used up in paying for capital, which is scarce; households get only 20% in exchange for toiling on farms and in cottage industries. At the same time, only 32% of the production of a bloated public sector is shared with the taxpayers and banks that provide the capital; as much as 68% goes to a privileged group of state and quasi-state workers who enjoy assured jobs and higher pay than they would in the private sector.
Taxes aren't the solution. Easier hiring-and-firing norms – and not mere consolidation of archaic labor laws – will boost employment in more productive large firms that can pay better. If Amazon.com Inc. can build its largest global center in India, why should factories be afraid to scale up by hiring blue-collar workers? At the other end of the spectrum, small firms need finance.
A yearlong liquidity crunch in the shadow banking industry has caused jitters in India’s market for loans-against-property, which is how midsize businesses finance themselves. But even the luxury of a $25,000 loan obtained by mortgaging property worth $350,000 isn’t for everyone, as Pratibha Chhabra, a financial inclusion specialist at the World Bank, notes. Most small firms only have inventory and invoices to pledge, and no lender wants to be left holding half-made chairs, or potatoes rotting in a warehouse.
However, if a bank lending to a furniture maker or a potato farmer in India can get repaid directly by Ikea or PepisCo Inc. against certified invoices, it can share the benefit of the final customer’s creditworthiness with the borrowers. This is how Citigroup Inc. greases the global supply chain of 700 multinationals and their 70,000 vendors. Since most tiny businesses run on household labor, only statisticians will worry about whether wages or profits are getting the lift. Spending power in the economy will rise.
Such financing is well established in developed markets, though in India “to efficiently finance small firms by locating them in larger supply chains will be the next frontier,"" says Gaurav Arora, head of Asia Pacific at Greenwich Associates LLC.
India is overdependent on Bangladesh’s model of microfinance, which uses group pressure and social shame to collect on exorbitantly priced – but collateral-free – small loans. The country is barking up the wrong tree. A woman doing embroidery on a sari will never get more than a fraction of what her craft will ultimately sell for. But she can be given access to cheap credit. Then, she’ll also be able to buy more biscuits for her children."
10,2019-08-29,Britannia,"The Britannia stock is still down by about 12% so far in FY20. In comparison, the Nifty FMCG index has shed 5% According to Britannia, its ICDs have dropped to under  ₹500 crore from about  ₹690 crore at the end of March

Shares of Britannia Industries Ltd have surged as much as 13% inthe past five trading sessions. This comes at a time when the Nifty FMCG index has risen by about 1.5%. FMCG stands for fast-moving consumer goods. What gives?
To begin with, the stock had corrected sharply after the company’s disappointing June quarter performance, and rather tepid management commentary. On 21 August, the stock had closed at a 52-week low.
Analysts said this is only a recovery in the stock from its lows and that the short-term outlook continues to remain muted, given the demand slowdown. Domestic volume growth had dropped to an eight-quarter low of 3% in the June quarter.
Having said that, Britannia’s investors may well have other worries. “The pessimism in Britannia’s stock really began around the time when it disclosed that an additional part of its treasury surplus had been lent to promoter-group companies as inter-corporate deposits (ICDs carry 10% p.a. interest),"" said analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a report on 26 August.
According to Britannia, its ICDs have dropped to under  ₹500 crore from about  ₹690 crore at the end of March.
JM Financial points out, “Given several debt-related issues that surfaced amongst Indian corporates in the recent past, such an issue remains a sore point in a company with an otherwise solid business opportunity.""
And, as pointed out earlier, it’s not like Britannia has impressed on the financial performance front. The June quarter results don’t inspire confidence. Consolidated revenues increased by 6% over the same period last year, the weakest in the past many quarters.
“Given slowdown in its core category and Britannia’s recent entry into new categories, earnings trajectory will remain weak,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd after the company’s June quarter results.
Notwithstanding the recent share price appreciation, the Britannia stock is still down by about 12% so far in FY20. In comparison, the Nifty FMCG index has shed 5%.
Still, Britannia’s valuations at about 50 times estimated earnings for FY20 are not exactly cheap. Unless demand revives meaningfully, scope for expansion in valuations appears capped."
9,2019-09-15,Britannia,"Manufacturers are hoping for a reduced tax burden on lower-priced biscuits or those priced below  ₹100 per kilo from the current 18% to 5%India’s biscuit market is estimated at over  ₹31,200 crore and sees the participation of large companies

New Delhi: Biscuit makers are hoping for a lowered tax rate on widely consumed mass biscuits priced below  ₹100 a kilo as an increased instance of GST has put additional burden on manufacturers.
The GST Council is expected to meet on 20 September and could consider tax revisions on various goods. Auto and biscuit manufacturers are hoping for a reduced tax burden amid a slump in consumer demand.
Mayank Shah, category head, Parle Products, and vice president, Biscuit Manufacturers Welfare Association said biscuit manufacturers are hoping for a reduced tax burden on lower-priced biscuits or those priced below  ₹100 per kilo from the current 18% to 5%.
“Our request is to continue the distinction between two categories of biscuits ie those below and above  ₹100 per kilo because the sub  ₹100 per kilo biscuits are targeted at the middle class and lower strata of the society—the consumption is huge there,"" Shah told Mint. “We are okay paying 18% GST on biscuits priced above  ₹100 per kilo,"" Shah added.
Biscuits priced below  ₹100 per kilo include largely affordable biscuits such as glucose, and milk and account for 25% of all biscuit sales in India; these are typically priced under  ₹10. Earlier in September, the Biscuit Manufacturers Welfare Association, which represents close to 40 biscuit makers, including Parle Products, made fresh petition to the government seeking a reduction on tax slabs.
To be sure, biscuit makers have been seeking a reduction in taxes on biscuits in the mass market segment since 2017, after the government clubbed them in the same tax bracket as premium cookies or those priced above  ₹100 per kilo, thus doing away with a varied tax structure under the new GST regime.
This, companies added, has prompted manufacturers to reduce the size of biscuits offered per pack amid growing cost pressures and even take price hikes leading to a slump in demand. Shah added that in the first quarter of the current year premium biscuits or cookies grew between 7% to 8%; while mass biscuits or those priced below  ₹100 per kilo declined by 8%, he said citing industry figures.
India’s biscuit market is estimated at over  ₹31,200 crore and sees the participation of large companies such as Britannia Industries, Parle Products, ITC, Mondelez India, among others. It is among the largest categories of packaged foods sold in India.
But an increased instance of tax has burdened manufacturers who complain that they have had to resort to price hikes or cut the grammage of biscuits priced under  ₹10 to ensure consumer demand is intact. Shah added that last December the company took measures to control costs and has since reduced the number of biscuits sold in its  ₹2 to  ₹5 packs, including Parle-G —India’s largest selling biscuit.
“We had absorbed the costs for a while, but then last December we started to reduce the quantity offered so that we don’t pass on the prices to consumers,"" Shah said. He added that the company had to rule out price increase in ceratin packs as shoppers are “extremely value-conscious, they notice things like this and easily switch to cheaper alternatives."" For Parle, biscuits priced under  ₹100 a kilo account for 40% of its sales.
Anmol Industries, which sells namkeen, butter and cream biscuits priced between  ₹5 to  ₹20, said it has been gradually reducing the size of some of its biscuit packs over the last two years as raw material prices, especially wheat, continue to climb. “Earlier we used to have a 60 gram pack at  ₹5, today it has been brought down to 45 grams and if this continues we could soon be selling 40 grams,"" said Gobind Ram Choudhary, managing director at the company.
Choudhary who is also part of the India Biscuit Manufacturers Association, an industry body of ten biscuit companies in the North, made representation to the government to reduce the GST on biscuits are priced below  ₹150 per kilo to 12% about two months ago. “For us these account for 90% of our sales,"" he added.
The move to push to lowered tax rates comes amid a slowdown in consumer demand largely aggravated by a slump in rural consumption where consumers are holding back on purchases of essentials such as household products and staples. This has spooked FMCG companies, which draw over 35% of sales from the hinterland.
In its quarterly update on the FMCG sector for the April-June quarter, research firm Nielsen said that categories such as salty snacks, biscuits, spices, soaps and packaged tea led the slowdown during the quarter. Nielsen also lowered its guidance for the sector for the full year."
8,2019-09-25,Britannia,"The brokerage has rebalanced its 'quality list' of stocks againSome other stocks included in this list include Britannia Industries, UltraTech Cement, GAIL, Hero MotoCorp and Repco Home Finance

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits"" for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt.
The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list"" of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries Ltd. to smaller names including Manappuram Finance Ltd., Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.
“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,"" he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.""
India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.
Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9% while small cap names gained 7%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3% in the last three sessions.
The gains show that the “first round impact"" of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.
Here are the key insights from the report
-Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6% above Tuesday’s close
-Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75% of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

7,2019-10-06,Britannia,"Companies look to invest in budding consumer startups, which have not been hit by slowdownConsumer spending across consumer goods segments have fallen in past few quarters

Leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms and retailers including Haldiram’s, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting Ltd, LuLu Group and Burman Family Holdings, the family office of Dabur India, are scouting for investments in consumer brand startups to boost growth in a weak economy, multiple investors and industry executives said.
Consumer spending across the FMCG and consumer packaged goods (CPG) segment have fallen sharply in the last couple of quarters.
Wipro Consumer recently launched a venture fund to invest in startups in the consumer brands space. A Wipro spokesperson said the company will look to invest about  ₹10-30 crore in early to mid-stage startups. “We will be looking at those startups where we can add value as well learn from them. Financial returns would be an important objective of the fund as well as adding strategic value, but all as a minority investor,"" the spokesperson added.
Dabur Group’s family office Burman Family Holdings’ has been evaluating startups in the branded consumer goods space, according to a person aware of the group’s investment strategy. Gaurav Burman, director of Dabur International and investor in Burman Family Holdings, said his family fund’s investments will be stage-agnostic with a long-term investment view. “We have no minimum limit on ticket size, although we will look to deploy at least  ₹70 crore per investment through the life of the opportunity,"" Burman said in an email.
LuLu Group, an Indian MNC that operates hypermarkets and retail chains has also been eyeing Indian startups in consumer goods, a consultant aware of the development said. LuLu Group did not respond to an email seeking comments until press time.
Haldiram’s, one of the oldest names in packaged foods space in India, is in discussions with multiple startups in the consumer brands space including Bengaluru-based Frozen Bottle, a quick-service restaurant (QSR) chain that sells milkshakes and desserts, Mint reported on 14 September. While big FMCG and CPG majors turn to consumer brands led by startups, their overall revenues have also been declining consistently in the past couple of quarters, amid an economic slowdown.
Dabur, Hindustan Unilever, ITC Ltd and Britannia Industries have acknowledged that the slowdown has hit their revenue, especially among premium portfolio brands.
A Credit Suisse report this month said the FMCG segment revenue is likely to decline by around 5% in the second and third quarters of 2019-20. FMCG revenue growth had earlier declined from 11% in the third quarter of 2018-19 to around 7% in the first quarter of the current fiscal, the worst revenue growth in the last 15 years.
Analysts and industry observers attribute falling consumer spending to not just low incomes, but also a lack of brand innovation, and failure to understand niche consumer needs, at least in Tier-1 and Tier-2 markets. The renewed interest displayed by traditional firms in startup-led consumer brands, is mostly steered by the fact that these brands virtually saw no impact of the economic slowdown.
“When you are the market leader with a 30% market share, slowdowns are scary. (But) when you are an insurgent brand with less than 1% market share and have a strong product and brand narrative, you should continue growing,"" said Deepak Shahdadpuri, founder and MD, DSG Consumer Partner. According to him, CPG start-ups are least impacted by the cyclical slowdown because they are doing between  ₹50 lakh to  ₹5 crore of net revenue per month. Between May to August from the DSGCP portfolio, companies like Veeba, Sleepy Owl, Arata, The Moms Co., Chai Point, Suzette Kitchen Garden, and Goa Brewing, did not see any slowdown, added Shahdadpuri. “It could also be because the companies we back tend to be in the more premium categories in Tier-1 cities where the slowdown has not had the same impact yet,"" Shahdadpuri added.
Vinay Singh, co-founder and partner at consumer-focused VC fund Fireside Ventures said his portfolio of brands across segments like personal care, clothing and accessories, and lifestyle, witnessed record month-on-month growth (in terms of revenues) in the last couple of months. Fireside Ventures had earlier raised money from ITC, Emami, L’Oreal, and Unilever to reinvest in consumer startups.
To be sure, if smaller brands which appeals to a niche consumer base escape the slowdown, then logically, big FMCG and CPG majors should also be emulating them, but that isn’t the case in the Indian scenario.
According to Harsha Razdan, partner, head of consumer markets at KPMG India, a large company with its vast distribution network is better off acquiring startups and layering their distribution network on top of the new brand, mostly because small brands are splintered in size and reach, which poses a logistics challenge."

Coal India: The state-owned coal mining company will report its earnings for the quarter ended September today. Another company in the metal and mining sector Hindalco Industries Ltd will also announce its numbers for July-September.

BPCL: The state-run fuel retailer on Friday clarified that it has not received any official communication from the government about a plan to sell its 53.3% stake. Investors have cheered news reports on privatisation of the firm. According to a Mint report, Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total SA and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company have had talks with the Centre regarding the matter.
Eicher Motors: The manufacture of Royal Enfield brand of premium motorcycles on Friday reported a 4.4% year-on-year rise in net profit for the September quarter to  ₹573 crore led by a reduction in corporate tax rate.

Aurobindo Pharma: The pharmaceutical company on Friday said it is making progress on its acquisition of dermatology and genetics operations of Sandoz amid concerns that the deal was being held up due to certain queries sought by the US Federal Trade Commission.

Bank of Baroda: The bank, after market hours on Friday, reported a five-fold jump in net profit to  ₹736 crore for the quarter ended September due to higher other income.

IDBI Bank: The state-owned lender on Friday said its net loss narrowed to  ₹3,458.8 crore on the back of higher net interest income, other income and fall in provisions for bad loans.

Earlier this year, Life Insurance Company acquired a 51% controlling stake in the bank, which now operates as the subsidiary of the insurer."

Mumbai: Stock markets may continue to keep their momentum intact on Monday following firm global cues. Last week markets consolidated, barring Friday when investors rushed to sell shares due to concerns after rating agency Moody's lowered India's outlook.
Asian shares edged higher on Monday after US President Donald Trump said over the weekend that trade talks with China were moving along ""very nicely"", though uncertainty remained over whether a deal would be signed this year.
Japan's Nikkei was up 0.2% to inch closer to a recent 13-month high. Australian shares rose 0.5% to a two-week high while South Korea's KOSPI was off 0.2%. That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan firmer at 534.63, testing a recent six-month peak.
Trump told reporters on Saturday that talks with China had moved more slowly than he would have liked, but added that Beijing wanted a deal more than he did. That was a more upbeat tone than just a few days earlier when Trump stressed that the White House would not agree to a full rollback of existing tariffs, remarks that hit stock prices and the dollar.
By the close of Wall Street on Friday, optimism had returned to the market as investors bet that Washington needs a deal and it is in the interests of China, too. All three major US indices eked out record closing highs. The Dow inched up a tad while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.5%. The record closing high by the S&P 500 was the fourth in six sessions as US stocks rallied on hopes of a trade deal.
The US officials said a lot of work remained to be done when Trump announced the outlines of an interim deal last month, and Beijing has since pushed back on US’ demands for big agricultural purchases, among other issues.
Analysts said the outlook for equities was highly dependent on US economic data as a US-China trade agreement would help bolster manufacturing and industrial sectors.
Data on October US industrial production and retail sales, along with the National Federation of Independent Business's monthly small business survey, are scheduled for release this week.
Back home, markets regulator has written to the finance ministry over its recent circular tagging foreign-controlled mutual funds as investment vehicles, two people familiar with the matter said. The regulator’s intervention comes amid fears that the new rules could force several equity asset managers to freeze investment activity and even sell their holdings. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) made its representation after mutual funds made their case to the regulator. The anomaly arising from the circular is that retail domestic money invested in the schemes of foreign-owned mutual funds will be counted as foreign money.

3,2019-11-14,Britannia,"Consolidated net profit of  ₹403 crore during Q2 was better than Bloomberg’s poll of analysts’ estimates of  ₹366 croreA year-on-year decline in tax outgo during the September quarter helped Britannia’s profit performance

When Britannia Industries Ltd announced its June quarter results, its consolidated revenue increased by 6.2% year-on-year. At that time, it was the weakest show in the past eight many quarters. One more quarter down the line, things have not worsened with year-on-year revenue growth remaining constant at 6.2%. “We continued our premiumisation & innovation journey with the launch of limited edition ‘Treat Cream biscuits’ & ‘Little Hearts Strawberry’,"" said the company in a press statement.
While steady revenue growth looks good given the ongoing consumption slowdown, growth rate has not improved. Further, a few analysts estimate September quarter domestic volume growth at 3%, which is what the company had clocked in the June quarter.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Britannia Industries’ stock ended up as the largest gainer among the Nifty 50 firms, rising by almost 5%. This is at a time when the Nifty 50 index had declined marginally.
What explains this?
Sure, it helps that the consolidated net profit of  ₹404 crore for the September quarter exceeded Bloomberg’s poll of analysts’ estimates of about  ₹366 crore. However, a year-on-year decline in tax outgo helped boost the profit tremendously.
Some analysts say that the stock had declined prior to the results announcement on Monday after market hours. For perspective: the Britannia Industries stock had declined by 13% from its 52-week-high on 23 September on the National Stock Exchange until Monday. As such, the jump seen in the shares on Wednesday is a partial recovery, according to analysts. The market was closed on Tuesday for Gurunanak Jayanti.
Meanwhile, the company’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin for the September quarter expanded by 31 basis points year-on-year to 16.1%. Even as employee costs rose at a relatively faster pace, the decline in other expenses as a percentage of revenue helped Ebitda performance. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
“On the balance sheet side, ‘loans receivables’ (including related-party inter-corporate deposits or ICDs) have fallen by  ₹290 crore but core working capital has risen significantly ( ₹520 crore versus  ₹35.1 crore in March 2019) due to higher quantum of wheat procured to hedge against price-inflation therein,"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.
On the stock, “Given limited pricing power, slowing pace of market share gains and rich valuations risk-reward doesn’t look attractive enough,"" point out analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 13 November.
The Britannia Industries stock trades at a pricey 49 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2021, implying high expectations, despite the current low growth run rate."

New Delhi: An Origami plane, childhood innocence and a pack of Good Day together is creating magic in Britannia’s new ad campaign. The cookie brand from the homegrown company has weaved a heartwarming story to convey how simple the path to happiness is.
The brand is leveraging Bollywood actor Deepika Padukone to nudge people to reprioritise their goals and chase the real deal, and conveys it simply as “Khushiyon ki zidd karo"". The message being if one resolves to stay happy and pursue happiness, then every day can be a Good Day.
Created by advertising agency McCann Worldgroup India, the film unfolds with a couple of children asking a shopkeeper for Good Day and being shooed away as they are not carrying money. When her father is away, Padukone, the daughter of the shopkeeper, calls them back and asks what can they can pay her in return for their favorite biscuit. She soon gets inundated with creative Origami art – boat, frog, airplane -- as young school children line up at the store to grab a packet of Good Day in exchange.
Vinay Subramanyam, head - marketing, Britannia Industries Limited said “Isn’t it interesting that in our daily interactions, the parting wish to people is always a “Good Day"", no matter how your own day is panning out. This little, universal insight inspires the work we do on Good Day. The core idea of Good Day has always been about happiness and Khushiyon ki zidd karo is the brand’s point of view in context of today’s social reality. This campaign is also backed with new product packaging bringing alive the richness and abundance of ingredients with bolder & stronger branding.""
The campaign will be promoted across television, digital as well as social media platforms.
Prasoon Joshi, CEO and chief creative officer of McCann Worldgroup India and chairman of McCann Asia Pacific said, “The concept of this Good Day campaign is very dear to my heart, especially because it has the potential to infectiously inspire people to not give up and keep trying for a happier world for all. It’s nuanced in craft; be it direction, acting, the music or the lyrics which am sure will resonate with many.""
Naresh Gupta, strategy head and managing partner at advertising agency Bang in the Middle feels that Good Day has done a fabulous job of taking the brand name and turning it into a heartwarming story. “This is the classical Good Day where the earlier ads were always on this theme, but they were never this endearing. Deepika and others have been wonderfully cast. The brand leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling that will make you reach out for Good Day. I do see children reaching out for origami kit and making many more paper planes,"" he added."
