48,2018-01-22,Eicher,"Eicher Motors shares, which have soared almost 8,000% in the past decade, have hit a sweet spot, says Goldman Sachs

Singapore: Shares of Eicher Motors Ltd, which have soared almost 8,000% in the past decade, have hit a sweet spot, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Singapore: Shares of Eicher Motors Ltd, which have soared almost 8,000% in the past decade, have hit a sweet spot, says Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
The stock is down 16% from its 8 September record of Rs33,483.95 even as the broad market posted a fresh record. Eicher’s retreat has pushed down the valuation to below its five-year average and presents a buying opportunity, according to analyst Pramod Kumar.
While the street took Eicher’s sequentially flattish third-quarter sales as signs of demand saturation for Royal Enfield—a British wartime motorcycle brand—the moderation was mainly due to plant rejig and model year change, Kumar wrote in a 18 January note. He added the stock to regional conviction list with a target price of Rs35,208, implying a 26% gain from Friday’s close, when it had a market value of about $12 billion dollars.
Network expansion and new models will lead to Eicher’s revenue and operating profit compounding at 25% and 30% respectively, over the fiscal 2017-2020 period, according to the note.
Eicher Motors is the best-performing company on the NSE Nifty 50 Index over the past 10 years, and one of the gauge’s two members with a five-digit price tag on its shares. Bloomberg"
47,2018-01-30,Eicher,"Eicher Motors's premium motorcycle brand Royal Enfield's monthly sales growth is settling down at around 17-20%, from a scorching pace of 25-30% year-on-year growth

After scaling a 52-week high of Rs33,483 apiece in September 2017, shares of Eicher Motors Ltd have lost steam and underperformed the benchmark indices. The shares are down 18% since then, paling in comparison to the Sensex and BSE Auto index, which rose by 14% and 8%, respectively, during the period. 
After scaling a 52-week high of Rs33,483 apiece in September 2017, shares of Eicher Motors Ltd have lost steam and underperformed the benchmark indices. The shares are down 18% since then, paling in comparison to the Sensex and BSE Auto index, which rose by 14% and 8%, respectively, during the period.
Coming at a time when the Street is ballistic on the India story and most stocks are racing up, Eicher Motors’ fall mirrors a rerating in its valuation. This is not without reason. In the last few months, sales growth of the premium motorcycle unit Royal Enfield, which accounts for nearly all its profits, has cooled off. From a scorching 25-30% year-on-year growth, Royal Enfield’s monthly sales growth is settling down at around 17-20%.
Importantly, analysts feel that Royal Enfield’s growth rates will remain at these levels in the future. While demand for premium motorcycles is increasing, the number of firms in the segment is increasing too.
True, it cannot be disputed that the growing aspiration levels will see the market for premium motorcycles expand. That said, Eicher Motors is losing its virtual monopoly in the segment. Many global manufacturers such as HD Motor Co. India (Harley Davidson), Triumph Motorcycles, Suzuki Motorcycles and India Kawasaki Motors are aggressively entering the market, even as domestic motorcycle makers Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd have made plans for the segment.
Growing competition may impact Royal Enfield’s pricing power in the future, which in turn may push down realizations over the medium-to-long term. This may weigh on Eicher Motors’ operating margin, which at its current level of 31%, is among the highest in the listed auto original equipment manufacturers in the country. If at all, operating leverage coming from higher sales could support margins.
No doubt, the firm’s share in the commercial vehicle segment is inching up and there’s hope on the Street that with pollution norms becoming stringent, scrapping and replacement of old trucks could fuel sales too. Economic revival may translate into higher truck and bus sales too. Yet, the segment’s contribution is too small in the company’s consolidated profitability.
In other words, with little room to improve margins, Eicher Motors’ profit growth would track its revenue movement, which will moderate in the near term compared to the earlier quarters. Lower profit expansion may then temper the rich valuations of 30-35 times the one-year forward estimated earnings, which in turn will keep the stock price subdued."

45,2018-02-15,Eicher,"Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Eicher are hoping that higher government infrastructure spending will increase demand for their trucks

New Delhi: Truck makers are preparing to boost production, encouraged by the government’s proposal to raise allocation for infrastructure by more than Rs1 trillion for the year starting 1 April, two people aware of the matter said. 
New Delhi: Truck makers are preparing to boost production, encouraged by the government’s proposal to raise allocation for infrastructure by more than Rs1 trillion for the year starting 1 April, two people aware of the matter said.
India’s top three truck makers—Tata Motors Ltd, Ashok Leyland Ltd and Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd—have asked their suppliers to ramp up capacity, anticipating an increase in demand for trucks and tippers which are used for road construction, transportation and mining. 
Truck makers are hoping that the increased spending on infrastructure by the government will translate into rising demand for their products. 
Total expenditure on infrastructure for the next fiscal is expected to rise 21% to Rs5.97 trillion from Rs4.94 trillion for 2017-18, according to budget estimates. A substantial part of that allocation will fund the ambitious Bharatmala road project, which aims to link about 75% of India’s districts through a network of highways.
Tata Motors has asked its engine supplier Cummins India Ltd to increase monthly supply of engines to 20,000 units from an average of 14,000-16,000 units that it now supplies to India’s largest truck maker, one of the two people cited above said, requesting anonymity.
“This would also include exports but the main focus will be the domestic market,"" the person said.
A Tata Motors spokesperson said that the company has been experiencing an increase in demand for medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCV). 
“We are aligning our production with the increasing demand,"" he said.
Demand in the commercial vehicle segment has started to look up after the implementation of overloading rules, barring trucks from carrying loads beyond prescribed limits. The BS VI emission norms that will come into effect from 2020 will also create replacement demand, the executives cited earlier said.
Sales of commercial vehicles rose 10.45% to 257,001 units in the 10 months ended 31 January. This has prompted Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers to raise its FY18 forecast for M&HCV sales to 13% from 5-6% projected at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Chennai-based Ashok Leyland, India’s second-largest truck maker, has increased orders for tippers, the second person said. One of the firm’s suppliers has been asked to supply 250 tippers in February and 300 in March, up from an average 200 units now, the person said. 
Ashok Leyland is working closely with all its suppliers to meet demand, managing director Vinod K. Dasari said in response to an emailed query.
Volvo Eicher has also asked its suppliers to increase output, the second person said. The company may also commission a new factory in Bhopal in 2019 to meet demand, the person added.
Sales of trucks are likely to touch a new peak in March, said Vinod Aggarwal, managing director and CEO of Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, a joint venture between Eicher Motors Ltd and Volvo AB."

Bengaluru: Eicher Motors Ltd on Monday announced its decision to shut its joint venture (JV) Eicher Polaris Pvt. Ltd (EPPL) with US-based Polaris Industries Inc. as sales of its personal utility vehicle Multix dropped to unsustainable levels.
The JV was incorporated in 2012 and its only product, Multix, was launched in 2015 from a manufacturing capacity established on the outskirts of Jaipur, Rajasthan.
According to a press release issued by the company, given its unique positioning and differentiated product features, Multix initially generated significant interest from customers. However, the interest could not be sustained and subsequent sales performance was significantly slower than the company’s expectation.
“Despite several initiatives, the company’s performance could not be revived. Hence, the board of EPPL has concluded that in the present circumstances, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to close the operations of the company,"" the statement noted. 
During the year ended 31 March 2017, EPPL’s net loss amounted to Rs91.83 crore, 50% of which was consolidated with the net profit of Eicher Motors.
As of 31 December 2017, Eicher Motors had invested Rs289.50 crore in the joint venture and the amount invested so far, together with additional investments, as required to close down the operations, shall be written down, the company mentioned in the press release.

New Delhi: Royal Enfield on Tuesday said it will invest Rs800 crore in FY19 as capital expenditure (capex) and is starting work on the second phase of its Vallam Vadagal plant in Tamil Nadu.
Royal Enfield will also form wholly owned subsidiaries in Indonesia and Thailand in FY19.
After the second phase of the Tamil Nadu plant is complete, Royal Enfield’s total capacity in India would be 950,000 units per year.
According to Siddhartha Lal, chief executive and managing director of Royal Enfield parent Eicher Motors Ltd, demand for the company’s products continues to exceed supply, and the motorcycle brand continues to see strong growth from all the markets.
“Therefore, we have decided to expand our production capacity with the second phase of our Vallam Vadagal plant near Chennai, Tamil Nadu. We will also complete construction of our technology centre in Chennai this year, and invest further in the development of new products to meet upcoming regulations and to expand our portfolio for our global markets."" said Lal in a statement.

Eicher Motors Ltd scored well on all counts in the March quarter, with the strong growth in truck sales being particularly impressive. Yet, it did little to appease investors and the stock inched up only marginally. 
Eicher Motors Ltd scored well on all counts in the March quarter, with the strong growth in truck sales being particularly impressive. Yet, it did little to appease investors and the stock inched up only marginally.
The company’s valuations have come off sharply from the dizzying 50 times one-year forward earnings about two years ago to about 30 times now. The drop in valuations traces the decline in sales growth of its premium motorcycle brand, Royal Enfield. March quarter sales of the flagship brand grew 23% year-on-year; but the fact remains that growth has fallen from 38% a year ago. 
Meanwhile, the hype associated with the Enfield brand appears to be waning. The six-month waiting period is down to about a month-and-a-half, as a result of higher production capacity. Further, competition is increasing, as more foreign motorcycle manufacturers are willing to test the luxury bike market in India. 
Be that as it may, analysts still remain confident about Enfield sales. A report by Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd recently upgraded the stock “despite concerns on greater volatility in growth as waiting periods disappear, due to better underlying industry outlook and sharp acceleration in contribution to Eicher’s sales from low penetrated states"".
Apart from the launches planned in the premium range of motorcycles, Enfield’s pricing power is impressive. In spite of stiff competition, realization on sales has been increasing. March quarter’s realization was 5% higher year-o-year. 
Meanwhile, truck sales increased 33%, which added to overall revenue growth. As a result, consolidated revenue rose by 34% from a year back, to Rs2,528 crore. And thanks to benefits of operating leverage, operating margin expanded to 31.3%, the highest for the company so far.
Be that as it may, Eicher Motors’ valuations price in the estimated earnings growth of around 25% over the next two years. What could give investors a bonanza is any breakthrough in export markets and the response to its forthcoming new launches in the higher-end premium motorcycles. At the end of the day, Enfield accounts for nearly 90% Eicher Motors’ earnings."

New Delhi: Eicher Motors will focus on its motorcycle business through Royal Enfield and will not look to enter new verticals in the wake of failure of its off-road vehicles joint venture with US-based Polaris, a top company official said. 
The company, which currently has a 50:50 joint venture with Volvo for trucks and buses (VECV), had recently announced shutting of another JV—Eicher Polaris Pvt Ltd (EPPL), which produced and sold personal utility vehicle Multix—in March this year. 
“We are aboslutely 100 percent focussed on motorcycles, nothing else...Other than motorcycles we don’t have any intention to get into any other vertical,"" Eicher Motors managing director and CEO Siddhartha Lal said in a con-call.
Royal Enfield, the motorcycle arm of Eicher Motors, sells mid-sized motorcycles both in India and overseas markets. 
When asked after the EPPL experience, if the company would consider getting into four-wheeler segment again, he said, “Abosolutely (we are) not open to anything...Of course VECV is the only other part of our business, which is doing very well. We are in the process of winding up EEPL operations"". 
On Royal Enfeld’s plans for expansion in global markets, he said, the company is in the process of establishing wholly-owned subsidiaries in Thailand and Indonesia and may go for contract manufacturing there at a later stage. “We are extremely bullish about these two markets. We have seen very good traction for Royal Enfield in these markets. So, the first step is to set up a marketing company,"" Lal said.
Royal Enfield now has over 540 dealerships across 50 countries and 36 exclusive stores, 11 of which were opened in 2017-18. 
For the current fiscal, Royal Enfield has earmarked a capex of Rs800 crore. The investment would go towards various activities, including setting up of second phase of the company’s third plant at Vallam Vadagal near Chennai, completion of construction of the technology centre in Chennai this year and development of new products. The planned production capacity for the current fiscal is 9.5 lakh units, the CEO said."
38,2018-06-19,Eicher,"Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles to launch a CNG truck with a gross vehicle weight up to 14 tonnes during September quarter

Mumbai: India’s fourth-largest commercial vehicle maker, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV) Ltd, a joint venture between Eicher Motors Ltd and Volvo AB, plans to widen its range of medium-duty trucks that run on compressed natural gas (CNG), according to a senior executive. 
Mumbai: India’s fourth-largest commercial vehicle maker, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV) Ltd, a joint venture between Eicher Motors Ltd and Volvo AB, plans to widen its range of medium-duty trucks that run on compressed natural gas (CNG), according to a senior executive.
During the quarter ending September, VECV will launch a CNG truck with a gross vehicle weight (GVW) up to 14 tonnes, said Shyam Maller, executive vice president, light and medium-duty trucks and buses. This GVW is an industry first, Maller claimed.
GVW measures the weight of the vehicle, in addition to the payload.
On Tuesday, VECV showcased CNG variants of its 4.9 and 5.9-tonne trucks, typically used in last-mile delivery operations by fleet owners. While these are the lightest payload trucks VECV offers, the automaker plans to bring in CNG trucks with higher payloads as the footprint of CNG stations grows, Maller said.
“The footprint of CNG stations run by Indraprastha Gas (Ltd) and GAIL (India Ltd), is increasing predominantly in New Delhi and NCR (National Capital Region), and in parts of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. This growth compels us to look at a range of vehicles with higher tonnage,"" Maller said.
A greater availability of CNG will impel fleet owners to demand higher tonnage trucks to move longer distances, instead of having lighter trucks cover smaller distances, he elaborated.
Competitors such as homegrown auto conglomerates Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd do not have CNG variants of higher tonnage medium duty trucks. However, Maller expects them to begin developing such products as the “writing on the wall becomes clearer"" on the back of the central government’s focus on cleaner fuels, where “CNG will play a very big role"".
The market for trucks running on CNG is negligible, but VECV hopes to leverage the “green tax"" imposed in the New Delhi-NCR region to drive sales, in addition to the inherent cost advantages offered by CNG in last-mile delivery. Such trucks make up 20% of VECV’s total truck sales in north India.
Diesel-guzzling commercial vehicles entering New Delhi would have to pay an environment compensation charge, informally called the green tax, ranging from Rs700 to Rs2,600 depending on their GVW, according to a Supreme Court order of 2015.
While CNG trucks are more expensive by about 10%, the associated cost of operation is lower by almost 40%, depending on the price of CNG, according to Maller.
“We expect to see a larger market share for the CNG variant of the 4.9 tonner, as it offers double the value at a very low price premium"", Maller said, claiming that the product “offers twice the payload as compared to the nearest competitor and has an extra 1.5 feet of load body length"".
VECV also offers a range of almost 10 trucks running on liquefied natural gas, in addition to two electric buses, and plans to bring in other variants on existing platforms as the market allows."
37,2018-08-10,Eicher,"Scorching growth rates have created a high base for Royal Enfield, but investors were peeved by the mere 7% increase in sales during July

The Eicher Motors Ltd’s stock seems to be tired after riding in top gear for many quarters. Even the 25.3% year-on-year growth in its June quarter consolidated net profit to  ₹  576.2 crore failed to enthuse investors, given that it came a tad below consensus earnings estimates. Meanwhile, consolidated results that mirror the performance of the company’s premium motorcycle brand Royal Enfield, are showing that growth rates are slowing down after scaling dizzy heights. 
The Eicher Motors Ltd’s stock seems to be tired after riding in top gear for many quarters. Even the 25.3% year-on-year growth in its June quarter consolidated net profit to  ₹  576.2 crore failed to enthuse investors, given that it came a tad below consensus earnings estimates. Meanwhile, consolidated results that mirror the performance of the company’s premium motorcycle brand Royal Enfield, are showing that growth rates are slowing down after scaling dizzy heights.
The 27.3% year-on-year revenue growth was driven by a 22.5% increase in quarterly motorcycle sales. To give the company its due, scorching growth rates have created a high base for Royal Enfield. But then, investors were peeved by the mere 7% increase in sales during July, which came as a big dampener. 
While the management clarified that this was partly the effect of the transport strike, it would do little to improve confidence on the Street, until sales improve in the forthcoming months. 
And there’s good reason for this thinking too. Domestic sales remained nearly stagnant for the last six-seven months. 
In its recent report, SBICAP Securities Ltd says, “Our channel checks indicate intensifying ‘brand fatigue’, with the weakness in retails spreading beyond Maharashtra and Karnataka to other mature markets such as Kerala (Royal Enfield’s largest market) and Delhi during recent months.""
Certainly this is not good news. Of course, Eicher Motors has maintained the operating performance, with consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) growing by 30.4% from the year-ago period. Profitability inched up slightly as seen in the 80 basis point rise in the Ebitda margin. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Indeed, Eicher Motors’ commercial vehicle business is racing ahead. June quarter sales rose by 41% translating into a 61% year-on-year jump in Ebitda. However, this is less material to the company as its consolidated earnings mainly mirror the Royal Enfield tale. 
Besides, there is significant anxiety in the universe of premium motorcycles. Monthly sales growth has hit the slow lane from 30-40% a couple of years ago to about 20% currently. Analysts reckon that growth rates are now in line with the normal motorcycle industry.
Further, with more global manufacturers eyeing a share of the pie, Royal Enfield is faced with stiff competition. 
Given this scenario, the sharp drop in Eicher Motors’ rich valuation is not surprising. In fact, at  ₹ 27,484, the stock trades at about 21 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2020, making the rich 40-50 times valuation, even a year ago, history."

The company, which has earmarked a capex of  ₹  500 crore for 2018-19 towards new product development and capacity expansion, is working to drive in an affordable range of air-conditioned buses to cater to public transit.
In a message to shareholders in the company’s annual report for 2017-18, Lal said the company is also developing light and heavy-duty buses for the Middle East and African markets.
“We plan to have a complete range of electric mobility solutions for public transportation, offering world-class quality and comfort. We are also developing an affordable air-conditioned range of buses aimed at bringing superior comfort to public transit,"" Lal said.
The company has already commenced operations of its Skyline Pro Electric buses in Kolkata and thus joined the league of zero-emission vehicle manufacturers, he added.
VECV, which sold a record 65,932 vehicles in 2017-18, a growth of 12.5% over 2016-17, is also focussing on segments like construction, mining and e-commerce to drive future growth, he added.
On capex for 2018-19, Lal said: “We plan to invest  ₹  500 crore in VECV towards new product development and capacity enhancement.""
On domestic business, Lal said the company continues to retain 88% market share in the high performance trucks segment (400+ BHP) and is focussed on targeting mining segments besides quarrying, road construction, and irrigation to drive growth. He added the company is preparing to introduce the BS-VI range of trucks and buses in the domestic market much before the April 1, 2020 deadline.

“Despite several challenges that came up during the quarter, Royal Enfield recorded a strong performance in Q2 2019. The highlight of the quarter was the launch of our 650 Twins at Santa Cruz, California, in September 2018. We launched the motorcycles in Europe at EICMA motor show in Milan last week, and we are now all set to launch these motorcycles here in India later this week,"" said Eicher Motors CEO Siddhartha Lal.
Royal Enfield also showcased the Concept KX prototype—a V-Twin motorcycle developed by Royal Enfield’s design and engineering teams in India and the UK. Concept KX is inspired by Royal Enfield’s original Model KX of the late 1930s.
Royal Enfield expects sales in its new North American business to almost triple this year and is aiming to dominate the market for middleweight bikes into which Harley-Davidson Inc. has just shifted in a bid to revive sales, Bloomberg reported on Friday.

34,2018-12-05,Eicher,"A slump in Royal Enfield sales growth, increasing brand fatigue and competition from Jawa motorcycles and others are seen weighing on Eicher Motors shares and, in turn, its market capitalisation

Mumbai: Once the most preferred stock in the automobile sector, owing to its storied motorcycle brand Royal Enfield, Eicher Motors Ltd has lost about  ₹ 17,900 crore in market capitalisation so far in 2018, according to data provided by Bloomberg. To explain the fall, analysts cite factors such as slowing sales growth off a high base for Royal Enfield, increasing brand fatigue for the classic British brand’s limited portfolio, reduced waiting periods owing to higher production capacity and increasing competition in the premium motorcycle category. 
Mumbai: Once the most preferred stock in the automobile sector, owing to its storied motorcycle brand Royal Enfield, Eicher Motors Ltd has lost about  ₹ 17,900 crore in market capitalisation so far in 2018, according to data provided by Bloomberg. To explain the fall, analysts cite factors such as slowing sales growth off a high base for Royal Enfield, increasing brand fatigue for the classic British brand’s limited portfolio, reduced waiting periods owing to higher production capacity and increasing competition in the premium motorcycle category.
Royal Enfield accounts for nearly 90% of Eicher Motors’ earnings and dominates over 95% of the premium motorcycle category in India (250cc and above).
To be sure, extraneous factors such as the devastating Kerala floods (Royal Enfield’s largest market with a 30% volume contribution), rising input costs, a near-month-long strike at one of Royal Enfield’s Chennai plants, and a broader stock market correction also impacted the company’s shares.
Higher insurance costs and unfavourable macroeconomic factors, such as tightening liquidity conditions, higher inflation and a falling rupee also impacted consumer sentiment and hit demand for Royal Enfield and the broader industry.
However, Royal Enfield’s volumes in the mature states of New Delhi, Maharashtra and Karnataka have been under pressure for more than a year, said Ashutosh Tiwari, head of Equirus Securities in a 13 November note, adding that booking levels softened in Uttar Pradesh (India’s largest two-wheeler market) in August and September, but picked up during the festive season.
Due to a negligible waiting period for most models except recent launches, advance bookings have reduced, Tiwari said, adding “the aura around the bike created by longer waiting periods is also fading, and this has a perception impact"".
Shorter waiting periods, coupled with a stagnation in demand, imply Royal Enfield will no longer be immune to the overall demand scenario in the domestic motorcycle industry, said analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd in a 12 November note.
To factor in the “demand challenges, no strong order book and expected increase in competition"", the Mumbai-based brokerage firm has also reduced its volume and Ebitda margin estimates for this fiscal and the next.
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and is a key measure of operating profitability.
Additionally, competition in the premium category is set to heat up in the coming months as at least half a dozen motorcycle makers, including the iconic Harley-Davidson Inc., prepare to launch models in the middleweight category (250cc-750cc) in India, diluting Royal Enfield’s dominance.
In the domestic market, Royal Enfield’s most popular model, the Classic 350, now has a direct competitor with the reintroduction of Jawa motorcycles in India in November by Classic Legends Pvt. Ltd, a Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) subsidiary.
ALSO READ | Jawa is back: Here’s a look at its 2018 motorcycle line-up
The maker of the Bullet and the Classic models is banking on new launches and under-penetrated markets in India for its next wave of growth, as the broader trend of up-trading to pricier and more powerful motorcycles continues.
“We believe we have strong potential to grow and expand markets wherein the size of mid-size motorcycling segment is very less in comparison, such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan"", said Eicher Motors in an emailed reply to Mint queries.
The Gurugram-based firm unveiled the Interceptor 650 and Continental 650 models (650 twins) last week as an entry point into the more mature global market, in addition to a more powerful option for Indian customers to upgrade to.
The firm believes the twins are a “vital"" part of its portfolio but expects single-cylinder motorcycles “to be dominant in India for the immediate foreseeable future"".
Analysts believe Royal Enfield’s increasing emphasis on expanding its presence in global markets will not bear much fruit in the near-to-medium term. Describing the strategy as “long-drawn"", analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said it “would be a drag on the margins"" with “no major volumes expected in the near to medium term"".
Unfortunately, “now is the time when Royal Enfield needs to make the export market work"" as the “honeymoon period"" ends in India, said Deepesh Rathore, co-founder and director at London-based Emerging Markets Automotive Advisors.
“Sales in the US need to increase ten-fold from 1,000 units now in three years’ time. RE needs to make a mark in high-margin markets"", Rathore said, adding that overseas success would also enable the firm to explore more products on the newly-developed platform and “open up the next leg of growth"".
The twins fit “very well"" in the traditional American market of big bikes, which is now looking for easier, smaller bikes to ride, Rathore said, adding that profitability in India will come under pressure because the new launches, which have lower margins, are likely to cannibalise sales of the Classic 350 and Classic 500, which are more profitable."

31,2019-02-11,Eicher,"Operating margins of Eicher Motors contracts 160 basis points to 29.2% in Q3 on a consolidated basis Eicher Motors's Q3 revenue increases by just 3.4% year-on-year to  ₹2,328.25 crore

New Delhi: Operating margins of Eicher Motors Ltd contracted by 160 basis points to 29.2% in the December quarter (Q3) on a consolidated basis, the maker of Royal Enfield motorcycles reported Monday.
The contraction—sharpest in thirteen quarters or over three years—came on the back of muted demand in the domestic market and increase in prices of motorcycles that impacted sales and spike in overall input cost.
The contraction also mirrors the 26.9% decline in Eicher Motors's share price this fiscal—underscoring the current state of affairs in the most profitable automobile company in the world. During Q3, the New Delhi-based automaker's net profit rose 2.3% to  ₹532.90 crore from Rs520.50 crore a year ago.
Eicher Motors has over the past year increased prices of its products by almost 15% due to higher commodity prices and introduction of new features—such as anti-lock braking system (ABS)—on its Royal Enfield motorcycles. This, in turn, impacted sales.
In April-January of FY19, Royal Enfield sales increased by 4% year-on-year to 655,779 units. During Q3, volumes fell 7% as retail sales during the festive season remained substantially muted.
As a consequence, Q3 revenue increased by just 3.4% year-on-year to  ₹2,328.25 crore. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)—a measure of operating profit—also dropped by 3.8% to  ₹680 crore from  ₹707 crore in the year-ago period.
According to Siddhartha Lal, managing director and chief executive, Eicher Motors Ltd, the increase in prices due to introduction of ABS and other expenses have dented the financials of the company, and it will be very difficult to say if that will have an impact on the demand scenario in the future.
“Motorcycle sales during the quarter were down by 14% and for Royal Enfield it was down by almost 7%. The industry has shrunk overall as a result of the increase in prices. We also lost production of almost 30,000 units due to the protest by workers in one of the plants but that has been resolved now,"" said Lal.
Royal Enfield launched two 650cc motorcycles—the Interceptor and Continental GT—during the December quarter; the increase in other expenses during the quarter can be attributed to the marketing expenses incurred for these motorcycles.
Eicher Motors's commercial vehicle business—a joint venture with Sweden's Volvo AB—is also under pressure due to extensive discounting by competitors Tata Motors Ltd and Ashok Leyland Ltd, and an adverse product mix.
The revenue from operations of Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV) increased 9% y-o-y to  ₹2,818 crore while profit after tax decreased by 43% y-o-y to just  ₹76 crore. In Q3, sales of trucks and buses of the company increased by just 4% y-o-y due to lack of financing options available from non-banking financial companies and introduction of new truck axle norms which has increased the load carrying capacity of the vehicles.
“While the demand momentum continues in the commercial vehicle industry, sales were affected especially in (the) heavy-duty segment due to change in axle load norms and liquidity crunch. However, in Q3, VECV increased its market share in heavy duty trucks through focused market penetration and strengthening the product portfolio with new launches of our modernised ‘Value Trucks’ over the past year,"" said Lal.

30,2019-02-12,Eicher,"The launch of Royal Enfield's Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650 take their toll on Eicher Motors' Q3 resultsFor the tide to turn as far as valuations go, Eicher investors must look at the sales performance of the new Royal Enfield motorcycles

For the first time in nearly three years, Eicher Motors Ltd’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin veered off the 30% mark. In the December quarter, its consolidated Ebitda margin fell 220 basis points to 29%, and short of the average estimate of 30% on the Street.
Among a host of factors that took a toll on profitability, launch of two new Royal Enfield motorcycles—Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650—fuelled costs. Other expenses, which includes advertising and marketing costs, rose 11% year-on-year, even as employee costs soared by 27%. The company’s operating leverage was weak given a meagre 3.5% growth in net revenue. After all, revenue growth came from price hikes that led to a 10% jump in realizations. Royal Enfield’s volumes fell 6%. Ebit
Note that Royal Enfield had also suffered a setback on account of a labour strike that crippled production. Besides, competition in the 150cc and above motorcycle segment has risen, with aggressive strategies from international firms and incumbents. Consequently, Royal Enfield’s share in the premium segment has slipped by about 150 basis points year-on-year to 25% in December.
The upshot: Ebitda fell 4% year-on-year to  ₹680 crore. This decline was, however, in line with the Street’s forecasts, with analysts factoring in the adverse impact on profits due to the strike and higher costs entailed due to new launches.
While all of this was enough reason to weaken investor sentiment, what has made things worse is a drop in commercial vehicle sales as well. Eicher Motors’ heavy-duty trucks have been no exception to the impact of axle-load norms, which have led to sales slowdown across the industry. The share of profit from the joint venture operations (Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles) has declined by 43% year-on-year to  ₹42 crore as a result.
Note that the company’s shares have corrected 35% from their highs last April, given the rising competition in the premium motorcycle segment and the drop in commercial vehicle sales. Growth rates are bound to be under pressure as the base has ballooned as well.
Likewise, valuations have toned down from the dizzying levels of over 30 times one-year forward earnings. At the current price of  ₹20,675, the Eicher Motors’ stock discounts FY20 earnings by about 20 times. For the tide to turn as far as valuations go, investors must look at the sales performance of its two new motorcycles, and whether that would improve operating leverage and profits in the quarters ahead."

New Delhi: Siddhartha Lal, managing director and chief executive of Eicher Motors Ltd, was named the EY Entrepreneur of the Year 2018, for engineering the operational and financial turnaround of the company and reviving the Royal Enfield brand, while Wipro Ltd chairman Azim Premji was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award.

28,2019-03-08,Eicher,"Truck sales at Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Eicher Motors fell 18.2%, 3.2% and 0.4%, respectively in FebuaryAnalysts expect contraction in truck sales, which started due to new axle-load norms, to continue for two more quarters

If yield expectations on any investment avenue are on the decline, investors are likely to stay away. The same logic applies to truck rentals and truck sales. Truck rentals, one of the key indicators of future truck sales, fell 3% on key routes in February. This makes it the fourth straight month of decline, making the outlook for medium and heavy commercial vehicle sales appear dim.
Truck sales have been falling. In February, Tata Motors Ltd, the largest truckmaker in the country, reported an 18.2% year-on-year drop in local truck sales, while that of Ashok Leyland Ltd fell by 3.2%. Eicher Motors Ltd’s sales in the segment contracted too, albeit marginally by 0.4%.
Ashok Leyland’s inventory is at 15-20 days and Tata Motors’ at 25-30 days, HDFC Securities Ltd said in a note, citing dealer reports.
The turning point from heady double-digit growth came after new axle-load norms came into effect. “Trucking capacity in the country increased by 20% post the revised axle-load norms as the new norms legally allowed trucks to carry more load,"" said Bharat Gianani, analyst at Sharekhan Ltd.
The aim was to reduce the logistics cost and prevent overloading. The collateral damage, however, has been a drop in truck sales.
What has also added to the woes of truck manufacturers is the subdued movement of goods in the last few months. There has been a 10-15% reduction in movement of food and farm produce supplies to wholesale markets in February, according to the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training. Factory dispatches, especially from small and medium enterprises (SMEs), also declined.
The question is whether the situation will improve and give a leg-up to truck rentals and sales. For now, rural distress is likely to cause more pain. After all, farm income is down to a 14-year low and with the central bank also spelling out deceleration in rural wages, this can cause a slowdown in consumption.
The situation is unlikely to improve in manufacturing and in the private sector in a hurry. Capital expenditure (capex) is down and gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 6.6% in the December quarter was the lowest in five quarters. Mining sector activity, another determinant of truck sales, is not encouraging either. If anything, government infrastructure activity is the only big lifeline for trucking activity and truck sales at present.
Also read: Indian economy is losing momentum, data shows
The fallout of weak truck rentals amid rising fuel prices is that it may lead to higher loan delinquencies. This can have a spillover effect on sales as well.
Truck sales are trending lower, with northern and western markets worse off compared to the south. Shares of Ashok Leyland, which gets most of its revenue from truck sales, have fallen hard before inching up in the last few trading sessions.
Analysts expect the contraction in truck sales to continue for another two quarters. “We expect recovery only in Q3FY20, which will be triggered by some buying ahead of the BS-VI norms that will be effective from 1 April 2020. These norms will lead to a significant increase in overall truck costs and owners may buy trucks earlier to circumvent the increase in prices,"" said Gianani of Sharekhan."

New Delhi: Royal Enfield, India’s biggest middle-weight premium motorcycle maker, is forming a wholly owned subsidiary in Thailand and setting up its first assembly plant, the firm announced on Friday.
The plant marks a significant step by the Eicher Motors Ltd-owned company to establish itself on the global stage and have manufacturing bases in different locations to gain flexibility in production. The new production line will be Royal Enfield’s first outside India and the subsidiary will be its first in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Siddhartha Lal-led firm has been trying to create a niche for itself in the global stage, especially in South-East Asia, Western Europe, and North America after establishing itself as a clear market leader in the premium middleweight category in India.
This will be its second significant capital expenditure outside India after its investment in setting up a technical centre in the UK. Thailand has become Royal Enfield’s third home after the UK, where it originated, and India, according to Lal, managing director and chief executive, Eicher Motors Ltd. The initial success of the 650 twins in Thailand has proven that Royal Enfield is poised to fill the gap in mid-size segment.
“With a massive segment of commuters ready to upgrade and a robust long-distance, leisure riding culture in the country, Thailand offers huge headroom for growth for Royal Enfield. We believe that localising our operations in Thailand will allow us to serve our customers at a closer and more intimate level,"" said Lal.
This new facility will also help the company export its bikes to countries that have a free trade agreements (FTA) with Thailand, at a time when the company is looking to cover the developed and developing markets with products manufactured in India.
Thailand was one of the first markets in which the company launched its new products, Interceptor 650 and Continental GT 650 twins. Since their unveiling in December, 2018, the 650 twins have got more than 700 bookings and over 100 motorcycles have been delivered till date, said the company.
“Royal Enfield started with one store in Bangkok, which has been instrumental in helping us understand this market. We have an aggressive plan to expand our reach to about 15 stand-alone dealers and 25 authorized service centres by March 2020.

New Delhi: Royal Enfield on Monday appointed former Ashok Leyland CEO Vinod Dasari as its chief executive, replacing Siddhartha Lal, who will continue ""to support Vinod and the team on product and brand related areas"", the bikemaker said. Dasari will also join the board of Eicher Motors Ltd—the parent company—as an executive director. Lal continues to be the managing director of Eicher Motors.
Dasari brings to Royal Enfield and Eicher Motors over three decades of experience in the manufacturing sector. He joined truckmaker Ashok Leyland as chief operating officer in 2005 and was serving as CEO and MD since 2011. Prior to that he held several leadership positions at Cummins India Ltd and Timken Co. He started his career with General Electric Co. (GE) in 1986.
Dasari is a proven leader who combines business vision and people skills, said Lal on the appointment. He was a catalyst in reviving the fortunes of Ashok Leyland and reshaping the dynamics of a hitherto slow-moving industry, Lal added.
“Vinod’s fearless entrepreneurial leadership, experience of managing complex businesses globally, deep understanding of customers and his vision of how digital technology will be used and experienced around the world are precisely the qualities that Royal Enfield needs as it aspires to lead and catalyse the global motorcycling industry towards middle weights (250-750cc),"" added Lal.
In order to establish Royal Enfield as a global brand, Lal moved to London in 2016. In 2017, the company also opened its first technical centre in the UK. Royal Enfield recently announced that it will set up its first assembly plant in Indonesia.

Mumbai: Twenty-two years after Eicher Motors Ltd founder and former chief executive officer (CEO) Vikram Lal gave up his executive powers to let professionals run the company, his son Siddhartha Lal has initiated a similar transition. Lal junior has appointed Ashok Leyland Ltd's Vinod Dasari as the CEO of the company’s motorcycle brand Royal Enfield.
Lal is also giving up his executive responsibilities at Royal Enfield to ensure that Dasari gets a free hand in running the company. The move has striking similarities with the decision made by his father.
In 1997, Vikram Lal had stepped down as chairman of Eicher Motors and had elevated Subodh Bhargava as the group’s CEO and chairman. Subsequently, Vikram Lal had joined a newly formed supervisory board to monitor the operations of the group.
However, within a few years, Siddharth Lal had taken over the reins at Royal Enfield, which was then on the verge of closure, and revived it. In doing so, Lal also established his grip on the remaining group businesses and consolidated them under two verticals: motorcycles and commercial vehicles. Lal will continue to be the managing director of the parent company for now.
“To achieve our audacious goal of 2030, to catalyse and reshape the world of motorcycling towards middle-weights, thereby growing at twice the pace of the industry, I believe that we now need to run the company differently. While I have thoroughly enjoyed being at the helm of Royal Enfield for a large part of the 20 years that I have spent here, I believe I can serve Royal Enfield better by playing a role that is different from the CEO,"" Lal told his employees in a letter on Monday.
The internal note has been reviewed by Mint.
Lal said that his job as the managing director of Eicher Motors will be to sign off on the business plan each year and to review it on a quarterly basis. He will also be involved with communication decisions and brand and product reviews.
“Any decision in the future should be in the normal course, by the relevant manager, head, CXO and the new CEO,"" he said.
The move comes just three months after Lal reshuffled the management. According to an 8 January internal document reviewed by Mint, Lal had informed employees that Eicher chief financial officer Lalit Malik will take over the additional responsibility of chief commercial officer in the interim, after Royal Enfield’s president Rudratej Singh offered to quit after a four-year stint.
Shaji Koshy (head of business markets, India), Rod Copes (head of business markets, North America), Arun Gopal (head of business markets, Europe and LATAM), Vimal Sumbly (head of business markets APAC), Rich Rawlins (head of genuine motorcycle accessories), Puneet Sood (head of apparel business) and Pankaj Sharma (head of customer experience) were all asked to report to Malik.
Now, besides Lalit Malik, chief operating officer B. Govindarajan, chief human resource officer Rajeev Sharma and chief information officer Sudhakar Bhagavatula will report to Dasari, who will be based in Chennai.
Shubhranshu Singh (head of global brands) and Mark Wells (head of product strategy and industrial design) will now report to Malik. Wells and Singh were earlier reporting directly to Lal.
Lal, in his letter, has attributed these changes to Royal Enfield’s 2030 goal and its RE 2.0 plan, which he said will be an important part of aligning the company with the industry’s mega trends, such as digitization, electrification, connectivity and shared mobility."
23,2019-04-06,Eicher,"In her quest for mindful living, the co-founder of Nicobar immersed herself in a deeper understanding of ancient Indian wisdom and philosophyLal’s desire to share her experience with people led her to launch Paro, an experiential concept space in Delhi based on the idea of holistic beauty

I find myself in an idyllic campus called the Vedanta Academy, outside Pune, where we all wake up at 4am, study, then practise a few hours of yoga, followed by sports and lectures on Vedanta philosophy. It is almost spartan, but well thought through. I am in a small room with so little around me, and it strikes me that this is truly all one needs for inner happiness.
How did I get here? Around five years ago, on a family holiday in Germany, I asked my father, Vikram Lal, a question: “Pa, if you could choose to be born in any country in the world and everything remains the same—your family, work, etc., which country would that be?"" He closed his eyes, only opening them around half an hour later and saying, “I have finally concluded that the only country I would like to be born again in is India."" I was quite surprised with this response because my father spent a formative part of his life in Germany before he founded Eicher Motors, and keeps going back. We all have grown up highly influenced by Europe and I assumed he would mention one of those countries.
When I asked him why, he said, “Because the level of sophistication of ancient Indian thought, the nuanced philosophy, the heritage of its wisdom along with its richness of culture, craftsmanship and diversity is what shapes me. Everything else feels quite flat in comparison."" That got me thinking. I have always considered myself someone who is rooted in India and is deeply appreciative of our heritage. But I hadn’t spent much time getting to know our philosophical thought.
I lead a rather hectic life—I ran (lifestyle brand) Good Earth for many years, then my husband and I started Nicobar, and, most recently, I launched Paro. I have two young boys and as someone recently told me, this truly is the rush hour of one’s life—with so many different priorities to juggle, all at the same time. Till around two-and-a-half-years ago, I had been squeezing myself dry and not giving back to myself or nourishing my body or soul. I was constantly irritable and on edge.
Every so often, that conversation with my father would float in and out of my head. I started wondering about how I relate to the larger world; I started looking for connections between the mind, body and soul. That was my first moment of pause.
I picked up a book called Absolute Beauty by Pratima Raichur, a book that has been with me for over 20 years. But when I read it this time, it opened up a whole new world for me. It is a book based on Ayurvedic principles and explains how external skin tissue is a reflection of everything that happens within our body: the way we eat and breathe, as well as the thoughts and emotions that fill our mind and colour our spirit. She says: “How we view the world and how we feel about things affects our experience, and experience changes the body. When modern medicine asks where the body is diseased but not why the patient is ill, it ignores the basic truth of our experience. Most disease results from a breakdown in the immune system; immune breakdown results from stress; stress is due to perception; and perception derives from consciousness.""
I was deeply curious about what she called “consciousness"" and how that pervades everything. I joined a short online course at Oxford University on the philosophy of yoga and that gave me an overview of different philosophical thoughts. I bought The Yoga-Sutra Of Patanjali by Chip Hartranft—this one came highly recommended by my friend, Veer Singh, founder of the wellness destination Vana, near Dehradun. It took me deeper into the philosophical aspects of the yoga tradition. I also went through the bibliographies in all these books and bought those that piqued my interest. I re-read Cosmos by Carl Sagan. And, finally, another friend and colleague, Pareina Thapar, recommended the Vedanta Treatise by A. Parthasarathy. It is this book that made a huge impact on me.
Parthasarathy emphasizes that the Vedanta philosophy is a guide for daily living and says: “Living is an art, a skill, a technique. You need to learn and practice it as you would to play a musical instrument or fly an aircraft.""
It is a whole new perspective on life, from our own country. It encourages questioning and experimentation. I always thought of anything to do with our historic texts as something religious and emphasizing faith vs rationality. To my surprise, Vedanta made me look deeper into the nature of things, and, very importantly, the nature of the self through observation and questions.
The main tenets of Vedanta, as I understand them, are a reflective study of yourself (to eventually join with your higher self-consciousness). To quote Parthasarathy again, “It is not the world that distresses you but how you relate to it.""
Another main tenet is the deep connect with, and reverence for, nature. Which means being in sync with the rhythms of nature. I realized that something as basic as being connected to nature, prakriti, expressed through the rhythms of seasons and lunar cycle, is something that we urban Indians are increasingly removed from.
I started creating little daily rituals for myself to be more connected with the rhythms of nature, like going up to my terrace early in the mornings and bowing to the rising sun. It’s amazing what a change that has made: I started noticing the different types of birds that perch regularly on my terrace, I was more aware of the hue of the sun in winter (hemanta) vs spring (basant) vs summer (grishma), the deep fragrance of the mogra at sunrise vs later in the day.
I also started fasting between seasons, an old Indian tradition. This ritual of fasting is like a bridge between seasons, it is a pause: a moment to reflect, acknowledge the transition between seasons, a time to give your body and even the mind a break from the daily routine. I realized I was falling ill much less and feeling a lot more energetic.
That moment of pause, when we take in a deep breath, in that very moment we have a choice to see things for what they truly are: to readjust our perception, to respond rather than react. And that little moment of pause, if done mindfully and regularly, can be, and has been, life changing for me.
For me, it has been so powerful that I felt the deep desire to share this experience with people who may benefit. It is why I launched Paro (which in Sanskrit means the sharing of special knowledge), an offering for anyone who is intrigued and curious about this holistic approach to well-being.
Paro, which I intend to restrict to one space in Delhi’s Chanakya Mall, is an experiential concept space based on the idea of holistic beauty, which we define as inner and outer beauty (shringar) and deep comfort and well-being (saukhya). It has been quite a challenge because it is not a typical store. It leads with experience and sometimes leaves people with more questions than answers.
The idea is to give people the tools to create personal rituals of saukhya and shringar through workshops in our Shanti Space, a library of books that I have personally read and loved, special treatment rooms, the Botanica space built like an apothecary where an aroma therapist personalizes and blends the purest oils, and more.
I hope it will nudge people on to a journey, their own journey, that incorporates precious moments of pause.
Simran Lal is the CEO of Good Earth and co-founder of Nicobar and Paro."
22,2019-04-10,Eicher,"Auto production in FY19 grew by 6.3%, not even half the growth rate clocked in FY18Soft commodity prices will not aid margins due to weak sales and a negative operating leverage

Mumbai: Automobile sales are decelerating, and incentives and discounts are not helping shore up demand. The uncertain outlook and mounting unsold inventory have compelled companies to cut production in the March quarter. The auto sector is thus faced with earnings downgrades for the next two years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd, a leading brokerage firm, in its March quarter preview, has cut earnings estimates for FY20 and FY21 for all 8 original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that it covers. In contrast to the expectations of a turnaround in fortunes during the March quarter, which typically registers strong numbers for the sector, the net profit of almost all auto companies may witness double-digit declines for the fourth consecutive quarter.
Recent data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) shows that vehicle production in FY19 grew 6.3% year-on-year. This was not even half the growth witnessed in FY18.
The headwinds are strengthening. A truant 2019 monsoon, rampant rural distress led by weak farm income, increasing influence of shared mobility in urban areas, a rise in unemployment and the liquidity crunch are roadblocks to improved consumer sentiment. Pre-election sales of vehicles have also dipped in the past. 
All these point to a weak demand until after the elections.
Therefore, any improvement in sales can be expected only in the second half of FY20, beginning from the festival season, say analysts. There is hope of pre-buying in the March quarter of FY20, just before the BS-VI emission norms kick in. This is likely to substantially increase vehicle costs. Unfortunately, such regulatory changes have coincided with a cyclical downturn that would weigh on demand.
One would have expected some relief in margins on account of softer commodity prices. However, the forthcoming results are not expected to factor much gains. Low sales will translate to low operating leverage, which will weigh on profitability. “Weak demand is bringing in margin pressure from higher customer acquisition costs (marketing), as well as negative operating leverage,"" says IIFL Research.

In the auto sector, two-wheeler makers will feel more pain than commercial and passenger vehicle firms. Also, demand for two-wheelers may take longer to revive because of prolonged weakness in rural demand.
Siam’s outlook for FY20 is not encouraging with single-digit growth estimates in sales across most sub-sectors, except commercial vehicles.
No wonder auto stocks have been hammered on the Street since August, when the first signs of weakening sales were visible.
The Nifty Auto index has shed 33% in a year, widely under-pacing the Nifty 500 index for the first time in a decade. The only silver lining is that the valuations have come off."

Mumbai: In line with its global expansion plans, Eicher Motors Ltd's motorcycle arm Royal Enfield has started operations in South Korea by opening its first flagship store in Seoul. Royal Enfield has appointed Vintage Motors (Kiheung International) as its official distributor-partner in that country.
“Our focus is to sustain and expand our reach in international markets, especially in the Asia Pacific region. Royal Enfield has seen consistent growth in the APAC region with a 20% year-on-year growth. Korea is an important chapter in the growth story,"" Vimal Sumbly, head (Business Markets—APAC region) at Royal Enfield, said at a press meet in Mumbai on Friday. 
Commenting on the partnership, Kiheung Motors CEO Pablo Lee Jr said, “Royal Enfield motorcycles will offer Korean two-wheeler riders an opportunity to upgrade to a robust long-distance, leisure-riding culture with its modern classic machines, that are brilliant for long rides on the highway at the same time perfect to commute in heavy traffic in the city.""
Royal Enfield, to begin with, will sell only four motorcycles in the country, namely the Bullet 500, Classic 500, Classic Chrome and the Himalayan. It's recently launched 650cc motorcycles, the Interceptor and the Continental GT, won't be available in the Korean market for now, the company said. That said, Royal Enfield will offer the full suite of services in South Korea, including aftersales service and spares.
One of the biggest success stories in the automotive industry globally, Royal Enfield saw its bike sales rising from 50,000 units per annum in 2010 to more than 800,000 units in 2018. It has a network of over 850 stores in India and over 540 dealerships in more than 50 countries.
SIAM data suggests that while Royal Enfield’s domestic dispatches remained flat at 805,273 units in 2018-19, it recorded year-on-year sales growth of 8% in its exports at 20,825 units.

Indian markets may be marginally higher on global peers support. Asian shares inched up from two-month lows on Friday just hours ahead of the US President Donald Trump administration's plan to raise tariffs on Chinese imports as investors looked to whether negotiators from the two countries can clinch a deal to avert the hike. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4%.
Trump said on Thursday he had received a ""beautiful letter"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping, stoking hopes that Washington may suspend its plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. That provided some support for stocks in early Asian trade though sentiment remains cautious. Trump also said on Thursday he was taking steps to authorise new tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese imports.
Wall Street’s main indexes fell on Thursday ahead of critical trade negotiations between the United States and China, though they pared losses significantly after US President Donald Trump said reaching a deal this week was possible.
Back home, major companies that will announce March quarter results today are State Bank of India (SBI), L&T, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Syndicate Bank, Eicher Motors, Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare and IDFC First Bank among others.

Meanwhile, concerns about renewed escalation in the trade tensions supported safe-haven assets. The 10-year US Treasuries yield stood at 2.453%, near its lowest levels since late March.
In the currency market, the yen is favoured, with the dollar changing hands at 109.71 yen, having hit a three-month low of 109.47 on Thursday. The euro firmed to $1.12 while the Chinese yuan perked at 6.838 per dollar having hit a four-month low of 6.8638 to the dollar the previous day.

The company had reported a net profit after tax of  ₹461.53 crore in the year-ago period.
Total revenue from operations for the quarter stood at  ₹2,500.08 crore as against  ₹2,528.01 crore in the same period of 2017-18, Eicher Motors said in a regulatory filing.
During the period under review, the maker of niche Royal Enfield bikes sold 1,97,567 units, down 13 per cent from 2,26,907 in the same period last year.

Eicher Motors Ltd’s shares have declined by 5.5% since it announced the March quarter results. The company’s shares are now down by more than 37% in the past one year. Sales of its flagship Royal Enfield motorcycles have now declined for four consecutive months.
Initially, there was hope that the premium motorcycle segment will be insulated from the general weakness in demand for two-wheelers. But this hasn’t been the case. According to a post-results report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, “RE (Royal Enfield) is seeing demand weakness for the first time since its renaissance in 2008. It is in a perfect storm with a weak industry environment and substantial cost inflation, with sales expected to remain under pressure till FY20.""
In the March quarter, motorcycle sales fell 13% year-on-year. But revenues declined only 1.2%, thanks to higher realizations. There has been an increase in vehicle costs due to higher regulatory expenses, besides new model launches at higher price points.
Even so, Eicher Motors reported a sharp drop in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins, falling 410 basis points to 27.4% from a year earlier. Some analysts say that while margins have fallen as a percentage of revenues, they have been intact at around the same levels in absolute rupee terms for every vehicle sold.
Be that as it may, Ebitda dropped 14% year-on-year to  ₹684 crore. After all, if Ebitda per vehicle is intact and if volumes are falling, the company’s profits will naturally fall.
Coming back to sales, the management has forecast production of 950,000 units in FY20. This looks like an uphill task, going by the sales figure of 820,000 units in FY19.
That’s not all. Truck sales in the domestic market are feeling the heat of the slowdown too, falling 12.7% even as exports were sluggish.
A key concern is whether Royal Enfield’s motorcycles are facing product fatigue, especially with increasing competition and new entrants in the premium segment. In FY19-21, single-digit sales growth is likely to pale in comparison to the scorching pace of 35-40% between FY13 and FY18.
No wonder, brokerage firm CLSA India Pvt. Ltd trimmed FY20-21 earnings per share estimates by about 12-14%. Most others have cut back profit margin estimates, too, as Eicher Motors is forging ahead with expansion of its dealer network and launch of new products. This will keep the cost metre high in the coming quarters."

MUMBAI :
Have you heard of smallcases yet? These are portfolios of equities or exchange-traded funds with an underlying theme or strategy. If you are investing in smallcases, you get the direct ownership of the individual stocks bundled together in a portfolio. This is different from mutual funds, where you don’t have ownership rights in the stocks that form your mutual fund portfolio but you hold units of the portfolio. They might sound a lot like portfolio management services (PMS), but unlike PMS, they do not have a ticket size of  ₹25 lakh.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
A brokerage account is mandatory to trade in smallcases. Smallcase Technologies has partnered with brokerages such as Zerodha, HDFC securities, Kotak Securities, Axisdirect, Edelweiss, 5paisa and Alice Blue. Since you will be investing in stocks directly, a trading account and a Demat account is required. When you invest in smallcase, money is debited from your trading account and stocks are credited to your Demat account. There is no lock-in period as you hold the stocks directly and they can be sold any time. “You can make changes to your portfolio anytime during market hours,"" said Vasant Kamath, co-founder of smallcase Technologies. There are broadly four kinds of smallcase portfolios. “Asset allocation portfolios which are Etf-based portfolios consisting a mix of largecap equities, fixed income, and gold; smart beta portfolio which focus on large cap stocks; model-based that are based on established investment strategies and may have a bias towards mid- and small-cap stocks; and thematic/sectoral which may stocks,"" said Kamath. All stocks listed on the NSE are included in the potential investable universe.
THE COST
“Standard brokerage charges are applicable depending on the broker you pick. You pay this charge only when there is a transaction and only on the transaction amount, not the entire portfolio. In case of Zerodha, where the standard brokerage is zero, most smallcases have a onetime flat fee of only  ₹100,"" said Kamath. Standard taxes and charges associated with equity transactions will also be applicable. “However, no additional fees are required for re-investments, SIPS, to rebalance the portfolio and likewise,"" said Kamath.
SHOULD YOU INVEST?
You need to have a long-term view towards investing if you want to put your money in smallcases. “Most smallcases are designed as longterm investment products and may not perform as expected in the short run. If investors don’t have a longterm horizon, they should consider alternatives,"" said Kamath.
However, there may not be a minimum ticket prize since the concept of fractional shares does not exist in India.“this can sometimes lead to large minimum investment amounts in instances where stocks like Maruti Suzuki India Ltd or Eicher Motors Ltd [which trade at a high share price of  ₹20,350 and  ₹6,650 respectively, as of May 8] are included in the smallcase,"" said Kamath. “Smallcases as a concept is good only for well-informed investors. Equity penetration in our country is very low and common man still doesn’t participate in broad conservative products like mutual fund. In this scenario, smallcases as concept is way ahead of its time,"" said Jayesh Faria, senior executive group vice president, Motilal Oswal Private Wealth Management.
“However, for readymade smallcases, prior market knowledge is not a pre-requisite as the rebalancing is done by Sebi-licensed research analysts,"" said Kamath. Some amount of handholding may be required any way, but the platform itself does not employ financial advisors."
16,2019-06-09,Eicher,"Overall sales have declined by 13% in the fourth quarter from a year agoEicher plans to open 350 studio outlets that will have dedicated retail and workshop space

NEW DELHI :
New 650cc bikes and a renewed thrust on ramping up its sales and distribution network in India will spearhead the turnaround plan of Eicher Motors Ltd, the maker of the iconic Royal Enfield motorcycles, according to the plan unveiled by the company in an investor meet in the UK earlier this month.
This comes in the wake of overall sales of Royal Enfield models declining by 13% in the fourth quarter from a year ago.
India will remain the company’s primary market, said Siddhartha Lal, managing director, Royal Enfield. “India is still our highest priority and every new product that is being developed is being made with India in mind,"" Lal told investors.
Lal said the new 650cc twins, Continental GT and Interceptor, have been developed and are being priced to upgrade riders in the domestic market. “The growing trend of premium bikes will continue for decades in India. At Royal Enfield, we are riding on that,"" said Lal, credited with the revival of the 100-year-old brand over the last decade with a slew of new launches that combine the vintage appeal of the motorcycles with contemporary features.
The revamped Royal Enfield models led by the Classic 350 continued to post robust growth numbers for many years, but reported a drop of 14% in December 2018 in domestic sales, the sharpest decline since June 2011 when it had posted a 31% drop in its domestic volumes. Sales for Royal Enfield stood at 56,026 units in December against the 65,367 units clocked in the year-ago period.
The decline in sales of Royal Enfield motorcycles is in sharp contrast to an unprecedented surge in the bookings for new bikes from the Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M)-controlled Classic Legends’ Jawa Motorcycles, which were unveiled in mid-November last year. Like Royal Enfield, Jawa was also founded in early 19th century in what is now the Czech Republic.
Eicher will open 350 studio outlets that will have 225 sq. ft of retail space and 275 sq. ft of area dedicated to the workshop, according to Lalit Malik, chief financial officer, Eicher Motors. “These will be one-sixth the size of a typical Royal Enfield showroom in a metro. We don’t expect these small stores to sell more than 12-20 bikes per month. This is our first rural foray in India. Under our big distribution thrust, we aim to touch 1,100 towns via 1,350 stores this year,"" said Malik, who also said that 80 conventional large-format stores will be added in 2019. The company now has a network of 825 outlets in India and 42 stores globally.
“We attended Eicher Motors’ investor meet in the UK. Notwithstanding the current sluggishness in Royal Enfield (RE) volume, the company is well placed to leverage all its efforts over the last decade for an even stronger next decade. A big driver for this is plugging of geographical gaps (rural/exports), leveraging the resounding success of the recent 650cc Twins for its future product offerings, and growing non-motorcycle revenue. The seed of all this remains the cult RE brand, the legacy of which no competitor can replicate,"" said Axis Capital in a report."
15,2019-06-10,Eicher,"One-year forward price-earnings multiple has fallen from about 28 times a year ago to 21.6 times at presentThe management has chalked out a strategy to introduce small-format stores to expand its distributor footprint

The automobile slowdown has not dampened hopes at Eicher Motors Ltd. Although the company, too, has been hit by sluggish sales of its flagship brand Royal Enfield (RE), the management has rolled out plans to grow twice as fast as the motorcycle industry over the next decade. But that has hardly stirred up the stock, though after a sharp correction of about 32% in the last one year, its price seems to have stabilized lately.
The management has chalked out a strategy to introduce small-format stores to expand its distributor footprint. The company wants to target under-penetrated states where its brand has lesser market share compared to its national average. The management also indicated that it will open a larger number of small-format stores and raise the store count from about 1,100 to 1,350 by FY20. Besides, it also plans to raise dealer profitability by increasing spare and accessory sales.
While all this sounds good, investors are still reeling from the disappointing news of a 16.5% year-on-year decline in volumes in May 2019. That was the highest among motorcycle manufacturers. Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and TVS Motor Co. Ltd reported growth ranging between -7.99% and +2.99%. Note further that Eicher Motors has taken price hikes in the premium bike segment, which seems to have hampered volume offtake lately.
Analysts though see the management’s strategy to counter the urban slowdown with a deeper rural push as a positive in the long run. But that may not be enough to rev up growth in the short run. “We do believe the 15% increase in the price of RE bikes, coupled with the economic slowdown, has impacted sales. We concur that the RE brand is very strong and going deeper into rural India with smaller store formats could offset the urban slowdown,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients.
That said, transitioning to the new BS-VI norms is not expected to come cheap and will add to the company’s cost structure. Hence, lower sales and rising costs could be a double whammy this year. In fact, analysts expect an earnings downgrades in the near term. “Operating margins are too high, which are likely to come down. We see earnings downgrades from the street due to the decline in EBITDA margin from current levels,"" said Kotak in the same note. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
The earnings downgrade may also lead to further erosion in the stock’s valuations. Already, its one-year forward price-earnings multiple, as per Bloomberg consensus estimates, has crimped lower from about 28 times a year ago to 21.6 times at present. From the looks of it, that valuation may not be comforting just yet, with investors preferring to wait for volumes to rev up."
14,2019-06-19,Eicher,"In his new role, Singh is expected to oversee sales of BMW’s passenger cars as well as motorcycles in India, say sourcesSingh quit the Eicher Motors-owned motorcycle brand earlier this year

Mumbai: Rudratej Singh, former president at Royal Enfield, will join BMW India as head, three sources aware of the matter told Mint.
Singh, who quit Royal Enfield in January this year after serving for four years, is learnt to be in talks with the top management at BMW, which is looking to appoint an industry senior to head the India operations and fill in the post left vacant for the last 10 months.
Vikram Pawah, who served as president at BMW Group India, was re-appointed by the Munich-based luxury carmaker as chief executive of BMW Group Australia and New Zealand with effect from 1 August, 2018. After Pawah’s move, Hans-Christian Baertels, who was director, finance and administration, at BMW Group India, took over as acting president. Pawah, however, serves as the chairman, BMW Group India.
“Singh is coming on board as the new BMW India head as he fits the bill. While at Royal Enfield, he is known to have driven the sales, branding and marketing activities. He understands the consumer and the fast-growing premium vehicle segment in India,"" said one of the three sources mentioned above. The sources have requested anonymity on the matter.
The BMW India spokesperson refused to comment on the matter citing the absence of any such communication from the management. The company did not answer Mint’s email query. Singh remained unavailable to speak on the new development.
Singh, who has also served Unilever in Singapore in one of his previous stints, served Royal Enfield with primary duties that included overseeing global sales, after-sales operations, new product strategy, branding and marketing, along with steering new business opportunities.

NEW DELHI :
Eicher Motors Limited - manufacturer of Royal Enfield brand of motorcycles and heavy commercial vehicles - on Tuesday reported 21.5% year on year decline in net profit to  ₹452 crore for the quarter ending June 30, on the back of significant decline in sales due to the overall slowdown in the economy and tightening of the credit norms by financial institutions.
In the corresponding quarter, the company reported a net profit of  ₹576 crore.
Total revenue of the company declined by 7% to  ₹2382 crore when compared to  ₹ ₹2548 crore in the year ago period.
The operating profit or the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) decreased by 24% year on year to  ₹614 crore.
During the quarter the sales of Royal Enfield motorcycles decline by 19% to 181966 units compared to 225286 units sold in the corresponding period.
In the commercial vehicles business, the company - in joint venture with Volvo AB - witnessed a decline of 18% year on year to 13331 units.
The profit of Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles (VECV) decline substantially by 68% year on year to  ₹38 crore. In the corresponding quarter, the joint venture reported a net profit of  ₹118 crore. Revenue also declined by 14% to  ₹2255 crore.
According to Siddhartha Lal, managing director , Eicher Motors Ltd, the two-wheeler and the commercial vehicle industry continue to face headwinds on account of weak consumer demand. Sales of Royal Enfield motorcycles declined 19% on year on year basis during the quarter.
“In the commercial vehicle industry, sales have been low due to the weak demand on account of economic slowdown and liquidity and it is also witnessing heavy discounting. However, as a part of our long term commitment to drive modernisation in the industry, VECV unveiled the Eicher Pro 2000 series, India’s first BS VI compliant range of commercial vehicles,"" added Lal.
“The demand in two-wheeler industry remains weak due to slowing economic growth, tightening liquidity and regulation driven price increases, that have led to poor consumer sentiment. At Royal Enfield, we remain focused on our key priorities, which is to deepen our markets in India and to strengthen our position as a global consumer brand. To reinforce our distribution network in India, we are working on building a network of compact retail format stores,"" said Vinod Dasari, chief executive, Royal Enfield."
11,2019-08-16,Eicher,"Truck sales, a leading indicator of economic growth, are the worst-hit across automotive categoriesWhile discounts averaged 10% on retail prices earlier, they have now increased to 15-20% or, up to  ₹8 lakh, in Kerala

Mumbai: Sluggish sales and mounting stocks of unsold medium and heavy duty trucks—the result of the downturn in the wider economy—are prompting manufacturers to offer heavy discounts to push sales.
Information obtained from industry heads and large commercial vehicle dealers reveals that medium and heavy commercial vehicle (MHCV) sales have plunged in July from a year earlier across India even as inventory levels touch 60 days and beyond in the some regions, as opposed to the norm of two-three weeks.
Truck sales, a leading indicator of economic growth, are the worst-hit across automotive categories. Discounts go up to  ₹8 lakh on a 40-49 tonne truck as the two largest commercial vehicle (CV) manufacturers, Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, slug it out amid shrinking sales.
Meanwhile, smaller rivals such as Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd and Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Pvt. Ltd claim that heavy discounting by the two leading truck makers has impacted their retail sales as well.
These discounts are fixed by the truck makers based on the region-specific freight movements and demand-supply of carrying capacity, six large CV dealers, who dominate their respective home states told Mint. The discount rates vary by region, customer order size, availability of finance and the level of unsold inventory.
Dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers only after making complete payment via financing. The dealers who spoke to Mint preferred not to be named as discounting is largely subjective and customer-centric.
Rajasthan, one of the most price-sensitive markets in India, has reported a more than 50% drop in MHCV sales in the past few months.
“Rajasthan is a high tonnage market with more demand for 40-49 tonne trucks. However, currently the freight movements of steel, cement, building materials and other goods are down, hitting trucks and tractor-trailers the most,"" a Jaipur-based truck dealer said, stressing that all manufacturers are now resorting to discounts.
A 49-tonne Ashok Leyland truck with a price tag of  ₹32 lakh is on offer for  ₹25.5 lakh by another dealer, who operates several showrooms of Ashok Leyland in Rajasthan. “Until three months ago, the same truck was retailed for  ₹27 lakh. I lost one of my oldest customers, who is a large fleet operator, to Tata Motors as they were offering a better discount on a similar product,"" said this dealer principal.
“The discounts are based on what the competition is offering. These are approved by the manufacturers and, in turn, based on the sale price, the purchase price of the dealer is calculated. The manufacturers decide the final discounted prices. The dealer principals can at most work on better margins from them. However, the margins for Ashok Leyland dealers are squeezed by 40%,"" the dealer added.
Another large CV dealer, who operates multiple dealership outlets and workshops for Tata Motors across Kerala, said: “MHCV retails have dropped by 40-50% and stock inventory is good for up to 60 days. We have a flood-like situation again this year and the market does not look good for another two months. The bookings in the first two weeks of August this year are down 50%."" Typically, truck inventory should not be for more than two weeks as dealers pay hefty interests on loans raised for acquiring stock. He suggested that while discounting averaged 10% on retail prices earlier, it has now increased to 15-20% or, up to  ₹8 lakh, on MHCVs in Kerala.
Another Kerala-based Tata Motors CV dealer, who sells about 800 units every month, said an upfront discount of  ₹5 lakh is available on a 49-tonne truck, including the Signa 4923.S tractor cab ( ₹35 lakh) and 4923 Signa 16-wheeler truck ( ₹40.52 lakh).
Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland did not respond to emailed queries sent last week. Addressing an investor query on 3 August, Gopal Mahadevan, chief financial officer and whole-time director of Ashok Leyland Ltd, said, “It is not that we will let a large customer just walk away because of price.""
“The HCV segment sits on a record inventory of around 60 days currently. The average discounts fall in the range of  ₹3.5-4.5 lakh per vehicle across the truck segment,"" said Mitul Shah, an analyst at Reliance Securities. “There is high probability of more discounting to continue in MHCVs, given that challenging economic conditions persist.""
“The heavy discounts seen have not left us unaffected,"" said Rajaram Krishnamurthy, vice president of domestic sales, product management and network at Daimler India Commercial Vehicles.
Vinod Aggarwal, managing director and CEO of Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, recently said the CV discounting trend had impacted his company’s sales. Tata Motors, Ashok Leyland and Daimler India paused production for several days in the past."

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s big tax break announcements today might have brought the Diwali and year-end celebrations a bit too early for customers looking to purchase their car. Car buyers usually fish for discounts that time as companies clear their inventory before the next year’s models roll in. If automakers are quick to, and they may be very tempted to do so, pass on some of the benefits of lower taxes, customers may not have wait that long.
In order to boost consumption demand and increase spending from private companies, the Union government today cut corporate tax rate to 22% from the 25% and 30%. The effective tax to be paid by the companies including surcharge is going to be 25.17%.
The reduction in taxes will also help companies to spend more in research and development of products and other aspects of the business.
The move is sure to boost the sentiment among automobile companies facing their worst slump in more than a decade. Of the top five gainers on the benchmark NSE Nifty50, three were automobile companies. Eicher Motors was the Nifty gainer with gains of 13.76% while Hero MotoCorp ended the day 12.3% higher.
Automobile companies exploring opportunities to manufacture in India will have to pay an even lower income tax rate of 15%, provided they start their production by 31 March, 2023. According to experts, this move will also help companies who plan to invest in India to develop and manufacture electric vehicles. The effective tax rates on these companies will be 17.5%.
To boost research and development initiatives of the companies in India, the Minimum Alternate Tax has been also reduced from existing 18.5% to 15% for companies who want to continue availing incentives.
""The union government has sent two very important messages through today's announcements. The first message is to resolve the immediate issues of getting out of the downturn and the second one is this tax cut has essentially put a lot of money with the companies. That extra money enables them to take various kind of options actions to pump demand for their products in the market,"" said RC Bhargava, chairman Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.
According to Rajan Wadhera, president, Society of Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), welcomed the bold announcements made by the Finance Minister.
“These are indeed landmark announcements and would certainly help in reviving growth in the Indian Economy. These set of major tax reforms are a clear indicator of the government of India’s commitment to improving business environment to give a definite boost to economic growth,"" he said.
He also added that expansion of scope of CSR expenditure to include incubation centers and R&D activities will also help with R&D expenditures in automobile sector."

Among BSE 500 stocks, 39 were down. These stocks include PTC India Ltd, Coffee Day Enterprises Ltd, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd and Dish TV India Ltd among others.
Sunil Sharma, chief investment officer, Sanctum Wealth Management said this was a much-needed measure, and clearly demonstrated the government’s commitment to rejuvenate domestic growth. “With fiscal and monetary forces working in tandem, and meaningful big bang reforms being announced, alongside monetary easing, we believe the pervasive negative sentiment that exists today has bottomed and will begin to revive. The markets will also deliver a positive wealth effect. The move in the markets will also deliver a positive wealth effect and will spur further financialisation, and engender efficient capital allocation,"" he added.
According to Vishal Kampani, managing director, JM Financial Group, the new tax rates will help boost corporate earnings during the current fiscal, which will lead to the revival of the consumption story. “The government has already ensured adequate liquidity to NBFCs, HFCs. These steps will facilitate higher economic expansion which will lead to higher tax revenue to meet its fiscal targets. The fiscal stimulus combined with the likely wealth effect from a buoyant stock market will take India closer to its dream of a $5 trillion economy,"" he added."
8,2019-10-09,Eicher,"Some of the biggest commercial vehicle makers remain hopeful of advance purchases of BS-IV M&HCVs in the second half of FY20The CV makers had earlier projected advance buying of BS-IV vehicles to trigger an expected price rise under the BS-VI regime which will kick off from 1 April 2020

Commercial vehicle makers in India have mixed views on a potential spurt in sales of Bharat Stage IV medium and heavy commercial vehicles (M&HCVs) in the remainder of this fiscal year ahead of the implementation of more stringent emission norms.
Some of the biggest commercial vehicle makers—Tata Motors Ltd, Ashok Leyland, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles Ltd and Scania—remain hopeful of advance purchases of BS-IV M&HCVs in the second half of FY20.
Daimler India and the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (Fada) whose members include commercial vehicle dealers aren’t so optimistic.
Mint spoke to about a dozen stakeholders in the CV industry to ascertain their views on the commercial vehicle industry, which stands divided at the moment on the anticipated pre-buying of specifically medium and heavy trucks.
The CV makers had earlier projected advance buying of BS-IV vehicles to trigger an expected price rise under the BS-VI regime which will kick off from 1 April 2020. This, they hoped, would bring in much-needed relief for the industry, experiencing its worst sales slump in two decades.
However, key dealer partners, battling an abnormal build up of M&HCV stocks, don’t expect pre-buying of these trucks anytime soon.
Liquidation of existing inventory of BS-IV trucks by the 31 March deadline is also posing a stiff challenge for the dealers even as they continue to burn cash in the form of interest payments on loans to fund their unsold stocks.
BS-VI compliant M&HCVs are expected to cost 8-10% more than the existing BS-IV models.
In its retail and inventory data from July to August, Fada reported CV inventory build-up of up to 60 days. CV sales are estimated to have fallen about 24% year-on-year during the fiscal first half to 352,331 units. M&HCV sales plunged more than 60% in the September quarter on factory shutdowns, according to data issued by the companies.
Ashish Harsharaj Kale, president, Fada said while good monsoons will definitely drive pre-buying in the light commercial vehicle segment (LCVs), the real problem lies in the M&HCV space. “The pre-buy in M&HCVs will primarily depend upon the price differential (between BS-IV and BS-VI models). While pre-buying of tipper trucks would depend upon new projects awarded to the contractors, I don’t know if any pre-buying will happen in the 16-tonne and above multi-axle or haulage truck segment,"" said Kale, adding pre-buying may only happen if the subdued market demand picks up in November and December.
Also, unlike cars and two-wheelers, the festive season does not impact the M&HCV segment, Kale said.
“A truck operator will buy a new truck only if he sees guaranteed business or will have a new contract for 6-12 months of next fiscal,"" said Shamsher Dewan, vice president, Icra Ltd. Dewan estimates the M&HCV segment to comprise multi-axle or haulage trucks (45-50%), tipper trucks (25-30%) and tractor-trailers (25%). Of these, while construction activity drives demand for tipper trucks, freight movement impacts the haulage trucks, which was also affected by axle load norms introduced in July last year.
Under the new axle load norms, the government raised the permissible gross vehicle weight of over 16 tonne heavy trucks by about 12-25%, creating excess carrying capacity for fleet operators.
Vinod Aggarwal, managing director and chief executive, Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles, said he expects pre-buying on productivity push by large fleet operators as new trucks offer more carrying capacity besides better ergonomics. “Why would fleet operators who see business in H1FY21 not buy more affordable BS-IV trucks in Q4FY20?"" he asked."
