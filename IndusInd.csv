New Delhi: IndusInd Bank on Monday said it has raised $500 million (about Rs3,193.75 crore) term loan from overseas lending bodies to expand its business.
The private sector bank has concluded the syndicated term loan facility from a group of overseas investors, it said in a regulatory filing. The fundraising, along with the funds raised during the ongoing financial year from multilateral institutions Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), will help the bank expand its lending to clients, it said. 
The tenor of the loan is for three years and will be used for general banking purposes, it added. Earlier in June, IndusInd Bank had raised $225 million (about Rs1,445 crore) from the US government funding agency OPIC for lending to small and medium enterprises.

Mumbai: Indusind Bank Ltd on Thursday reported a 24.73% jump in its December quarter net profit on the back of higher net interest income and other income.
Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs936.25 crore against Rs750.64 crore a year ago. According to eight Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank was expected to post a profit of Rs945 crore.
Net interest income (NII), or the core income a bank earns by giving loans, increased 20.04% to Rs1,894.81 crore versus Rs1,578.42 crore last year. Other income was at Rs1,186.76 crore, up 16.72% from Rs1,016.80 crore a year ago.
Provisions and contingencies rose 8.9% to Rs236.16 crore in the quarter from Rs216.85 crore a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, they fell 19.61% from Rs293.75 crore.

87,2018-01-12,IndusInd,"A look at IndusInd Bank's core income and asset quality indicates that the lender is finally huffing and puffing after an impressive run in the past quarters

IndusInd Bank Ltd won the award for consistency yet again, reporting net profit growth of 25% and net interest income (NII) growth of 20% for the December quarter. The fact that it met Street estimates on profit growth should have been enough to keep already happy investors joyful.  
IndusInd Bank Ltd won the award for consistency yet again, reporting net profit growth of 25% and net interest income (NII) growth of 20% for the December quarter. The fact that it met Street estimates on profit growth should have been enough to keep already happy investors joyful. 
But the stock fell 2% after the results, indicating that investors have some misgivings. A look at its core income and asset quality indicates that the lender is finally huffing and puffing after an impressive run in the past quarters.
The growth in NII, the core income a bank earns, would seem impressive compared with peers but for IndusInd Bank it was the slowest in 10 quarters. For a lender which has been beating its peers hollow on balance-sheet growth, this is not good news.
Add the decline in operating profit growth to 22% from an average 30% in the recent past and investors are justified in becoming jittery.
Another uncomfortable development is the surge in bad loans in recent quarters. For the December quarter, IndusInd Bank saw a jump of 54% in its gross bad loans from a year ago. This is historically the highest year-on-year jump in bad loans for the lender.
This rise is over the 49% increase in bad loans in the September quarter. This has worsened the bad loan ratio to 1.16% from 1.08% a year ago.
Considering that the bank would soon take a microfinance portfolio through its acquisition of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd, it would have to contend with a further increase in bad loans, given that microfinance asset quality is still shaky. 
Fresh slippages haven’t abated and were Rs408 crore for the third quarter, a large number for two straight quarters now.
Romesh Sobti, managing director of the bank, said that bad loan accretion is broad-based and not restricted to only a few large accounts. 
The bright side is that credit growth is still an impressive 24% and has hardly slowed down. The fact that IndusInd Bank’s corporate loan growth too continues to be high is another big plus. 
So long as it maintains its credit growth and fixes its emerging asset quality issues, IndusInd Bank can still justify its valuations. The stock currently trades at more than three times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2019."

Mumbai: Private sector lender IndusInd Bank Ltd on Tuesday said it has no direct or indirect exposures to firms floated by scam-tainted Nirav Modi. 
The bank, one of the most active lenders in the gems and jewellery sector, however has a “small"" exposure to Gitanjali Gems, promoted by Modi’s uncle Mehul Choksi which is also an accused in the Rs11,400-crore fraud.
“IndusInd Bank has no direct credit exposures to Nirav Modi nor any indirect credit exposures on the basis of the letters of undertaking (LOUs) issued by Punjab National Bank (PNB),"" the lender said in a statement. “As regards Gitanjali Gems, the bank has a small, two- digit exposure, not linked to any LOUs,"" it added without revealing the amount. 
The statement comes more than a week after PNB disclosed that conduct of its officials at the Brady House branch in the financial capital had resulted in a potential fraud of $1.77 billion. The IndusInd statement said the fraud has taken place due to non-adherence of procedures and norms laid down. It termed this as a “stray incident"" which will not have any contagion effect on its overall gems and jewellery lending business."

Mumbai: Deutsche Bank AG has called off talks to sell its retail and private wealth businesses in India to IndusInd Bank Ltd., people with knowledge of the matter said.
The German lender is considering keeping the operations after former chief executive officer John Cryan stepped down this month, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. The two businesses have a portfolio size of about Rs30,000 crore ($4.6 billion), according to one of the people.
Deutsche Bank is now considering increasing its investment in India, another person said. Bloomberg News reported Deutsche Bank’s plans to sell the units in January, which was part of a move to focus more on its home market.
If new CEO Christian Sewing — who managed Deutsche Bank’s consumer banking operations — does invest more in India, he would be revising a five-year turnaround plan unveiled by Cryan in late 2015. S&P Global Ratings has indicated it may downgrade Deutsche Bank, saying the lender’s leadership change may signal a “prolonged, deepened or more costly restructuring"" that could weigh on the bank’s credit rating.
Deutsche Bank hasn’t made any final decisions on its future India strategy, one of the people said. A Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. A representative for Mumbai-based IndusInd Bank said she couldn’t immediately comment.
Asia’s No. 3 economy is the only country outside Europe where Deutsche Bank has retail operations and more than 12,400 employees.
Income before taxes from the India business stood at €305 million ($378 million) in 2017, putting the country among Deutsche Bank’s top four income-generating regions that include Germany and Singapore, exchange filings show. The bank has a credit exposure of about €15.2 billion in India, the second highest in Asia Pacific after Japan.
Deutsche Bank, which started its India operations in 1980, has previously divested parts of its business in the country. In 2010 it sold the mortgage business and five years later it offloaded its local asset management unit. Bloomberg"

New Delhi:Private sector IndusInd Bank on Thursday posted a 27% rise in its net profit at Rs953.09 crore for the quarter ended March 2018 on higher income mainly from interest. 
The bank made a net profit of Rs751.61 crore in the corresponding period of 2016-17. Total income during the quarter rose to Rs5,858.62 crore, as against Rs5,041.31 crore in the same quarter of 2016-17, the bank said in a regulatory filing. 
It earned an interest income of Rs4,650.11 crore in January-March period of 2017-18, up by 21.4% from Rs3,830.01 crore earned in the same period a year ago. 
While, the income from investments rose to Rs830.51 crore for the quarter under review, from Rs644.05 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. 
However, there was slight deterioration in bank’s asset quality with the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) standing at 1.17% of the gross advances as on 31 March, 2018, as against a ratio of 0.93% a year earlier. 
Net NPAs were 0.51% of the net advances at the end of fiscal ended March 2018, from 0.39% year earlier. In value terms, gross NPAs were seen at Rs1,704.91 crore in the year ended March 2018 against Rs1,054.87 crore in 2016-17, while net NPAs or bad loans were to the tune of Rs745.67 crore, from Rs438.91 crore.

IndusInd Bank Ltd had one of those pristine loan books that investors covet, while bank after bank revealed worrisome decay in their portfolios. Not anymore.
The private sector lender on Thursday reported a doubling of slippages for the January-March quarter. Further, it said it had reported only half of the bad loans it had in 2016-17.
That a divergence in bad loan reporting should come from a clean lender like IndusInd Bank shows two things. 
Firstly, for the lender itself, the divergence is not very large and does not show any intent of covering up asset quality.
Secondly, other banks, both in the private and public sectors, which have a bigger corporate book, will probably begin to show scary divergences as they detail their results in the coming weeks.
IndusInd Bank has fixed the divergence over the last year and the management stressed that credit costs are well within its guidance. Core performance continues to shine and the bank met Street estimates for both net profit and net interest income. 
Given this, investors didn’t run down the stock much, as it ended merely 0.5% down mainly because of the divergence. At current levels, the stock is priced to perfection, trading at a multiple of five times its book value for 2017-18 and nearly four times that of 2018-19. 
Any more surprises and IndusInd Bank would lose the shine it has always had."

IndusInd Bank Ltd didn’t spring any surprises in its first quarter, nasty or otherwise. After a less flattering fourth quarter, where the private sector lender reported a surge in slippages, the bank is back to its historically impeccable asset quality. Its bad loan ratios were steady and slippages were  ₹  475 crore, half of that from a year ago. Its gross and net bad loan ratios at 1.15% and 0.51%, respectively, should confirm the consistent performer label that investors have given it. 
IndusInd Bank Ltd didn’t spring any surprises in its first quarter, nasty or otherwise. After a less flattering fourth quarter, where the private sector lender reported a surge in slippages, the bank is back to its historically impeccable asset quality. Its bad loan ratios were steady and slippages were  ₹  475 crore, half of that from a year ago. Its gross and net bad loan ratios at 1.15% and 0.51%, respectively, should confirm the consistent performer label that investors have given it.
Indeed, IndusInd Bank shares is priced to perfection at 4.2 times its estimated FY19 book value and analysts attribute the premium to mainly its asset quality even as it continues to grow in double digits.
The fact that IndusInd Bank’s corporate loan book grew at an impressive 30% should be a sign that loan growth is finally coming out of the woods. 
This portends a much-awaited recovery phase for other banks as well and most are likely to report a quickening of their loan growth.
For IndusInd Bank, its traditional loan growth driver—commercial vehicle loans— has held up, growing at 14%. Overall vehicle finance book grew at a healthy 28%.
Considering the strong loan book expansion, the lender’s core income also grew at a robust pace of 20%. All this helped IndusInd Bank report a net profit that was in line with Street estimates. 
So, why did the stock fall marginally after the results were announced?
The dampening effect on an otherwise strong earnings was the narrowing of the net interest margin. The bank’s margins narrowed to 3.9% from 4% a year ago. Margins are likely to remain under pressure for this year given that funding costs may increase due to tightening liquidity for banks.
Further, pristine bad loan ratios are not just a function of lower slippages but also of a strong loan growth. Another metric of asset quality is the extent of insurance through provisions a lender makes. IndusInd Bank’s provisions grew 13% to  ₹  350 crore."

New Delhi: Alteria Capital Advisors Llp, a venture debt firm launched by former executives of InnoVen Capital, has made the second close of its maiden fund, securing a commitment of roughly  ₹ 625 crore ($85 million) from its largest backers.
Separately, Alteria also invested  ₹ 8 crore in scooter-sharing firm Vogo as part of the start-up’s Series A round led by Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd), Stellaris Venture Partners and Matrix Partners last month.
Alteria Capital, which was started in October last year, secured commitments from anchor investors such as IndusInd Bank and Small Industries Development Bank of India.
Alteria raised  ₹ 356 crore in March as part of its first close. The company said it expects to complete the final close of its maiden fund over the next few months.
Mumbai-based Alteria Capital has a total corpus of  ₹ 800 crore with a so-called green-shoe option of another  ₹ 200 crore. 
The fund backs both early- and late-stage start-ups, with cheque sizes ranging from  ₹ 2 crore to  ₹ 100 crore. 
It typically backs ventures in consumer internet, technology, healthcare, education and logistics. 
Alteria’s latest investment in Vogo is part of the earlier Series A round that was completed in August. 
Mint reported in April that Vogo was in talks to raise funds from Ola, Stellaris and Matrix. 
“Short distance commutes in India are a big problem and the last few years have shown that Indian customers are willing to pay for appropriate value and tech-driven convenience. Anand and the team at Vogo have shown excellent promise in providing Indian consumers an inexpensive, convenient solution for their first and last mile commute requirements and we are excited to partner with them on this journey,"" said Vinod Murali, co-founder and managing partner at Alteria Capital. 
Alteria is one of a handful of venture debt funds operating in India. 
Venture debt has gained traction in India only over the last few years, while it is already popular in the US and Southeast Asia. 
Venture debt helps founders raise capital without selling their shareholding. Such deals are structured largely as debt and only a small percentage of the investment—usually 15%—is in equity. 
Hence, venture debt deals happen alongside venture capital investments. 
Big start-ups such as Byju’s, Yatra.com, OYO and Swiggy have raised crores in debt, alongside venture capital. In 2017 alone, $81 million was invested in 30 venture debt deals in Indian companies, according to private capital tracker Venture Intelligence, Mint reported in January. 
Alteria Capital, a category II Alternative Investment Fund, is the newest player in the venture debt market and competes with Temasek-backed InnoVen Capital, Trifecta Capital and IntelleGrow, among others. 
Alteria’s current portfolio includes food startup Fingerlix (Maverix Platforms Pvt Ltd), learning platform Toppr Technologies Ltd, the maker of organic cold-pressed juices and healthy drinks RawPressery and fashion company Universal Sportsbiz Pvt Ltd (which operates the Wrogn, Imara & Ms Taken brands). 
The fund is promoted by Murali and Ajay Hattangadi, former executives of Temasek-backed InnoVen Capital that was earlier known as SVB India Finance."

New Delhi: Wednesday’s rebound on Dalal Street proved short-lived. The global rout, triggered by an overnight tumble on Wall Street, has reached Indian shores and the Sensex fell over 1,000 points today while the Nifty hit 10,138 at the day’s low.

The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure, with BSE midcap index ending 2.3% lower and smallcap index 1.1%. 
10 things to know about the Nifty, Sensex selloff today:
1) Overnight, on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended with a loss of 3.29%, Nasdaq Composite 4.08% while the Dow shed 2.2% amid a rout in technology shares like Amazon, Apple and Facebook. It was the fifth straight loss for US markets, the longest slide since Donald Trump’s election win.
2) The US market tumble was so bad that it attracted the attention of US President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,"" Trump said. “I think the Fed has gone crazy.""
3) Hawkish commentary from policymakers of the Federal Reserve, which has hiked policy rates thrice so far this year, has sent US long-term bond yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared to bonds. The rise in US Treasury yields has been boosted by good US economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. 
4) A spike in US bond yields and a strengthening US dollar has led to a selloff in emerging markets, including India. On the other hand, gold prices strengthened today, both domestic and overseas, amid a rout in equity markets. 
5) For example, foreigners have pulled out over $10 billion from Indian stock and bond markets so far this year. 
6) The outflows from the Indian market, rising oil prices and the current account deficit, a tumbling rupee, and a rout in NBFC shares following multiple defaults by infrastructure financier IL&FS have erased all the gains the Sensex and Nifty had posted so far this year.
7) To add to the woes of the Indian stock markets, the rupee has been posting new lows against the dollar, approaching the 74.50 mark a dollar today.
8) The slide in the rupee comes despite many measures announced by the government to shore up the currency. The government had earlier increased import duty on many items while the RBI had allowed Indian companies to raise more money abroad and eased norms for foreign investment in local bonds, though those efforts haven’t stopped the rupee’s slide.
9) The risk of a widening current account deficit has left the rupee vulnerable to the rout in emerging markets amid surging oil prices, trade tensions and rising US interest rates. So far this year, the rupee is down over 14% against the US dollar and is seen sliding to 75 per dollar by year-end, according to the median view of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
10) The rout in global equity markets has sent the price of oil lower. Brent for December settlement was $1.52 lower at $81.57 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, after falling $1.91 on Wednesday. G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research and Advisory, said oil prices are down around 5% from recent highs and this will benefit Indian markets. He is optimistic about a recovery in the Indian markets after global markets settle down. The Indian markets had fallen sharply even before the current global equity rout and the oil price fall will provide a cushion to the Indian markets on the downside, he added."

IndusInd Bank Ltd’s investors have had their worst fears come true after the lender declared it had to provide against an exposure to the troubled Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS). That raises the question whether other banks, some with far higher exposure to the tottering infrastructure behemoth, will also be making such provisions. Notwithstanding the fact that the exposure continues to be a standard account, IndusInd Bank prudently decided to set aside  ₹ 275 crore for a potential hit.  
IndusInd Bank Ltd’s investors have had their worst fears come true after the lender declared it had to provide against an exposure to the troubled Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).

Notwithstanding the fact that the exposure continues to be a standard account, IndusInd Bank prudently decided to set aside  ₹ 275 crore for a potential hit. 
Had it not been for this provision, IndusInd Bank would have reported a 25% growth in its profit and stuck to its historic path of being the lender with an enviable track record of profitability.
The IL&FS exposure has thus cost the bank in terms of lower profit growth and a doubling of its provisions in the September quarter, both of which were not taken kindly by investors. The private sector bank’s stock fell 1.5% in response to the results on Monday.
The bank has not made the total exposure public but if we assume that IndusInd Bank being prudent has made the 20% provision required towards a loan gone bad, the exposure totals to over  ₹ 1,300 crore. 
That is far lower than what other lenders, especially public sector banks, have to the vexingly structured infrastructure company IL&FS.
Nomura Securities in a report estimated the banking sector’s exposure to IL&FS to be about  ₹ 57,000 crore.
Excluding the unsavoury IL&FS exposure, the lender continues to report a strong set of quarterly numbers. Its advances growth was a robust 32% led by both corporate and consumer verticals. The bank’s asset quality saw improvement with gross bad loans reducing to 1.09% of the total loan book. 
Of course, a lot of the improvement in bad loan ratios is also due to strong loan growth. But slippages too fell from the year-ago period as well as sequentially. In other words, the lender’s already pristine asset quality has seen further improvement.
IndusInd Bank’s core metrics such as net interest income and net interest margin too met the Street expectations.
What the lender’s profitability will be in the coming quarters depends on how long IL&FS is able to service its loans, and indications so far are mixed on this. Moreover, if other lenders decide to be as prudent as IndusInd Bank, provisions are set to mount for them. It is no surprise that investors of bank stocks are a worried lot currently.
Trading at a multiple of three times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2020, IndusInd Bank is no longer the most expensive banking stock"

In its results press release, the lender had said that it has provided  ₹ 275 crore towards to IL&FS though the exposure has not turned bad.
The fears of investors are not completely unfounded as the IL&FS exposure is not the only one troubling the bank. IndusInd Bank has increased its exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) over the last one year.
The chart above shows how the lender’s exposure has grown over two years.
Its total exposure to NBFCs stood at  ₹ 10,767 crore as of September, an 81% rise from the year-ago period. This rise has primarily been led by NBFCs, excluding housing finance companies, which are typically considered safer than other financiers.
This exposure includes not just loans disbursed and investments into debt instruments, but also sanctioned limits that may not have been drawn. That said, NBFCs are battling a liquidity crunch and the risks to IndusInd Bank’s asset quality have risen mainly from its exposure to these firms."

64,2019-01-10,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank's progressive provisioning indicates that the recovery from the IL&FS fiasco is unlikely to be smooth

After a bumpy second quarter, IndusInd Bank Ltd seems to be firmly back on its historic steady growth path. 
After a bumpy second quarter, IndusInd Bank Ltd seems to be firmly back on its historic steady growth path.
The private sector lender reported a net profit of  ₹ 985 crore in the third quarter, far higher than the  ₹ 810.50 crore estimated by a clutch of analysts that Bloomberg surveyed. 
The smudge on the bank’s pristine earnings record had come in the September quarter results, wherein the lender had to provide for exposure to the beleaguered infrastructure behemoth Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).
That overhang is still there as IndusInd Bank provided another  ₹ 255 crore towards this exposure. The lender has a total exposure of  ₹ 3,000 crore to the IL&FS group. 
IndusInd Bank’s progressive provisioning indicates that the recovery from the IL&FS fiasco is unlikely to be smooth.
Life beyond IL&FS seems to be better off for the lender. 
IndusInd Bank’s loan growth continued to be along its historic performance. For the December quarter, the lender’s loan book expanded 35%, with corporate loans growing 34%. 
Analysts believe that IndusInd Bank, which has acquired microlender Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd, would now focus on corporate loans that are margin-friendly, of course without compromising on asset quality. The merger deal entered into three months ago took effect on 1 January.
The quality of IndusInd Bank’s loans continues to be enviable with the gross bad loan ratio remaining around 1.1%.
The lender has also managed to reduce exposure to troubled sectors such as infrastructure and real estate. The credit profile of its corporate book should also instil confidence in investors on incipient stress. A big chunk (14%) of its rated loan portfolio is in the top AAA-rated bracket. Even BBB-rated loans are nearly 13%, but most of these are secured and collateralized. 
That said, slippages have jumped in the third quarter. The trouble from IL&FS is still there as well. 
The IndusInd Bank stock’s valuations seem to have adjusted to the threat from IL&FS. The stock has lost 14% since mid-August and now trades at a multiple of less than three times its estimated book value for FY20."

62,2019-02-17,IndusInd,"Under the pact, the group will pay the principal and interest amounts to the lenders as per the scheduled due datesSome of the key lenders include Templeton MF, DHFL Pramerica MF, Indiabulls MF, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank

NEW DELHI :
Anil Ambani-led Reliance Group has reached a 'standstill agreement' with more than 90% of its lenders under which they will not sell any of the shares pledged by promoters till September.
Under the pact, the group will pay the principal and interest amounts to the lenders as per the scheduled due dates, while it has also appointed investment bankers for part placement of the group's direct 30% stake in Reliance Power to institutional investors, officials at the lenders and Reliance Group said.
The investment bankers will begin roadshows for the share placement soon, they added.
Some of the key lenders include Templeton MF, DHFL Pramerica MF, Indiabulls MF, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank.
When contacted, a Reliance Group spokesperson said, ""We are grateful to our lenders for believing in the intrinsic and fundamental value of our companies, and granting their in principle approval to standstill arrangements.""
Officials said the agreement has been reached with more than 90% lenders of Reliance Group at the promoter group level.
Under this in-principle standstill understanding, these lenders will not enforce security and will not sell any of the promoters’ pledged shares till September 30, 2019 on account of lower collateral cover or reduced margin due to the recent unprecedented fall in share prices.
Reliance Group will pay the principal and interest to the lenders as per the scheduled due dates specified in the loan agreements.
Regarding the proposed placement of shares, the bankers said the value of the promoter stake in Reliance Power, before the unprecedented fall in share prices, was more than  ₹2,500 crore, and would clear more than 65% of total promoter borrowings.
Reliance Infrastructure Ltd holds 40% equity in Reliance Power, and even after placement of its holding by the promoters, majority stake and control remains with the Reliance Group, the bankers said.
Officials said there are total nine lenders at the promoter level while the total borrowing from mutual funds is about  ₹1,000 crore, as against some other groups where the number of such borrowers and the quantum of loan are much higher.
Some of these mutual fund lenders have said earlier their loans are adequately covered and they are engaging with Reliance Group for future course of action.
DHFL Pramerica MF and Indiabulls MF with combined exposure of less than  ₹100 crore are being paid off in full before March 31, 2019, officials said.
The latest standstill agreement follows a public spat between the group and two other lenders, Edelweiss and L&T Finance groups, who had sold shares of some listed Reliance Group entities alleging default in payments, but were accused of indulging in ""illegal and unwarranted"" activities to hammer down the share prices.
While the group's loan exposure to L&T Finance is nil now, the same is about  ₹150 crore in case of Edelweiss, against which Reliance Power has also complained to capital markets regulator SEBI and has filed a case in the Bombay High Court as well.
Both Edelweiss and L&T Finance have strongly refuted the allegations. 
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in Bombay High Court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case.

The assertion comes in the backdrop of media reports that PNB had approved  ₹2,050 crore of emergency funding to Jet Airways, for which lenders are considering a resolution plan under Project Sashakt.
In a filing to exchanges, Jet Airways had earlier clarified it has not received any fresh loan from PNB.

The resolution will come with the participation of the stakeholders and we are working on it,"" the bank's managing director and CEO, Sunil Mehta, told reporters when asked whether the lender was considering fresh funds to the loss-making Carrier on a standalone basis.

54,2019-04-17,IndusInd,"Banking stocks led the rally, with the Nifty Bank index rising 1.5%ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank surged 4% each while Axis Bank and HDFC were among the other top gainers

Benchmark stock market indices Sensex and Nifty today closed at record highs, led by gains in banking stocks and IT heavyweight TCS. The Sensex rose as much as 458 points intraday to 39,364, before ending at 39,275, up 369 points. Broader benchmark index Nifty, which hit a fresh high of 11,810 intraday, settled 0.90% higher at 11,787. Banking stocks led the gains with Nifty Bank index rising 1.5%. Earnings, investment flows and elections are likely to be the key drivers for Indian markets this truncated week. Indian markets would remain closed on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday. Voting for the second phase of Lok Sabha elections will take place on April 18. The global cues remained positive with Asian and European markets higher today.
Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets:
1) The earnings season got off to a good start with market heavyweight TCS reporting yet another quarter of strong results and the management expects continued strong growth in the new fiscal year starting April 1. TCS shares ended 1% higher, extending their Monday's 5% gain.
2) ICICI Bank surged 4% on reports that Goldman Sachs has raised its target price to  ₹492, from  ₹451. IndusInd Bank (4%), Axis Bank (1.6%), and HDFC Bank (0.80%) were among the other top gainers in the banking pack.
3) Infosys shares continued to drag after its margin and growth guidance disappointed the Street. Infosys shares ended 0.40% lower, after falling nearly 3% on Monday.
4) Wipro shares ended 2.3% lower ahead of its earnings announcement later in the day. RIL and HDFC Bank are also set to report quarterly numbers later this week.
5) Polycab India made a blockbuster debut today on bourses, with shares listing at 20% premium. Shares of Polycab India Ltd was listed on the stock exchanges at  ₹644.45, up 19.8% from its issue price of  ₹538 per share on Monday. The IPO had got a massive response, with subscription of over 50 times.
6) Elsewhere, SpiceJet shares extended gains to the fourth day as investors bet that the airline will be able to increase capacity amid Jet Airways's financial woes. SpiceJet shares rose 11% today. Jet Airways shares fell 7% after reports, citing sources, said that the management of airline has proposed to suspend all operations of the debt-laden airline at its board meeting today.
7) ""Indian markets had a dream run over the last few weeks on the back of dovish and accommodative global central banks and unprecedented foreign flows. The sentiment got a fillip once the Meteorological Department forecast near normal south-west monsoon,"" said Devang Mehta, head of equity advisory at Centrum Wealth Management.
8) ""The Street is also anticipating further rate cuts to reverse the economic slowdown and sensing a return of consumption demand, post the election results. The banks continue to have a lion’s share in the ongoing rally and the onus to lead the earnings for Nifty will lie with the corporate banks,"" Mehta said. ""With two good primary market listings (Metropolis Healthcare and Polycab India) in two days and upbeat mood, all eyes are now set on the ongoing fourth quarter earnings season.""
9) Expectations are rising that the RBI could deliver yet another rate cut in June to boost the economy. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at a measly 0.1% in February. Consumer inflation rose at a faster pace than anticipated in March, but remained below the central bank's target for an eighth straight month, increasing the chances for a key interest rate cut in June.
10) Crude oil price remains a key risk for Indian markets as any substantial movement beyond $70 per barrel is not conducive for the Indian economy, analysts say. Brent crude prices are hovering near five-month high of around $71 a barrel."
53,2019-05-02,IndusInd,"Top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and others offer FDs starting from 6 months up to above 5 yearsRemember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

The decline in Indian markets came despite Asian stocks bouncing from a 3-1/2-month low.

49,2019-05-16,IndusInd,"Top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and others offer FDs starting from 6 months up to above 5 yearsRemember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."
48,2019-05-22,IndusInd,"The private sector lender reported a 62% decline in net profit at  ₹360 cr for the quarter ended 31 March, compared with a profit of  ₹953 cr a year agoProvisions rose to  ₹1,560 crore in the March quarter from  ₹606 crore in the December quarter

Private sector lender IndusInd Bank Ltd on Wednesday reported a 62% fall in fourth quarter net profit, hurt by higher provisions for bad loans. Net profit fell to  ₹360 crore for the quarter ended 31 March, compared with  ₹953 crore a year earlier.
Provisions for bad loans increased to  ₹1,560 crore in the March quarter from  ₹606 crore in the December quarter and  ₹335 crore in the March quarter of the previous year.
IndusInd Bank classified infra assets worth  ₹3,004 crore of the IL&FS group as non-performing assets (NPAs) during the quarter.
The bank made a total provision of  ₹1,273 crore against its exposure toward IL&FS with provision towards the holding company at 70% and to operating companies/special purpose vehicles (SPVs) at 25%.
The management is confident of 90-100% recovery from the special purpose vehicles.
“By June the board will announce the results of bids for different special purpose vehicles. We are basing our estimates on the basis of those who had bid. We have some knowledge of those who had bid, who are our clients. It seems that these bids are higher than the total bid of that particular special purpose vehicles together,"" said Romesh Sobti, managing director and chief executive officer, IndusInd Bank.
Asset quality deteriorated, with both gross as well as net non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans increasing in the March quarter. Gross NPAs as a percentage of total loans increased to 2.1% in March quarter, against 1.13% in the December quarter. Similarly, net NPAs, which take provisioning into account, also increased to 1.21%, from 0.59%.
However, the bank reported a 10% increase in net interest income to  ₹2,240 crore in the March quarter. The loan book grew 29% to  ₹1.86 trillion and the deposit book 29% to  ₹1.94 trillion. Net interest margins for the year ended 31 March 2019 stood at 3.8% compared to 3.99% in the previous period.
IndusInd Bank shares fell over 2% after the results were announced but recovered in afternoon trade.
“IndusInd Bank delivered a poor set of results as the bank opted for lumpy, accelerated provisioning (>50%) on one of its infrastructure conglomerate exposures (amounting to 1.8% of total loan book). The bank also disclosed a vulnerable portfolio stacking up at 1.9% of its loan book, which, to our minds, leaves scope for an upward revision subsequently. We continue to maintain a neutral stance on IndusInd Bank as we are less than totally convinced about the disclosures around rising granularity on both sides of the balance sheet,"" said A.S.V. Krishnan, vice-president, SBICap Securities."

46,2019-06-17,IndusInd,"Investors are like doctors and a small cut on the balance sheet would prompt them to check for trouble elsewhereWith their trust on asset quality blown by Yes Bank Ltd recently, investors are not willing to bestow faith on IndusInd Bank yet

There were pristinely priced private sector bank stocks and then there was IndusInd Bank Ltd.
Just about a year back, the lender’s stock was priced to perfection, and a darling of both foreign and domestic investors. At that time, it traded at nearly four times its estimated book value for FY19, which was higher than larger-sized HDFC Bank Ltd. The latter, seen as the benchmark for the sector, traded at 3.5 times FY19 book value then.
But IndusInd Bank has fallen out of favour now. Its shares have lost more than 28% in the past year and the lender now trades at a far more modest valuation multiple of 2.7 times estimated book value for FY20. In comparison, HDFC Bank trades at 3.9 times its estimated FY20 book value.
Some analysts see more downside. Last week, UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd downgraded IndusInd Bank to sell from neutral, and even cut its target price by a steep 17%. The step by UBS comes a month after the bank reported one of its worst performances in the March quarter. Its exposure to stressed infra financier, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), had caused a 62% drop in net profit.
Investors are like doctors and a small cut on the balance sheet would prompt them to check for incipient trouble elsewhere on the books.
In IndusInd Bank’s case, UBS found out that the lender could be at risk given its retail deposits are just 20% of its external liabilities. “It is a structural issue and often manifests in credit quality surprises,"" the firm said in its note.
UBS was also bothered by the fact that 1.9% of the lender’s loan book comprises loans to conglomerates that are no longer able to pay back lenders.
The bank’s chief Romesh Sobti said the lender has provided for all possible stress in the March quarter.
With their trust on asset quality blown by Yes Bank Ltd recently, investors are not willing to bestow faith on IndusInd Bank yet.
Ergo, the question asked is whether there are more skeletons in the bank’s closet. IndusInd Bank’s total fund-based exposure to non-bank lenders including housing finance companies is 4.38% as of March. This could be a potential pain point as well.
Since credit costs are going to be high, the bank no longer deserves a lofty premium on its stock, according to analysts. Analysts at JM Financial noted that much of the bad news is already priced in the stock and the management has assured investors on earnings. To be sure, the stock still has numerous buy ratings, according to Bloomberg data.
That said, some analysts are concerned that the current valuations too could be challenged, depending on how slippages pan out."

IndusInd Bank on Wednesday said 4 July, 2019 will be the effective date of the merger with Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL). M R Rao, current CEO of BFIL, will become the CEO of IndusInd Financial Inclusion Ltd (IFIL).
The boards of IndusInd and BFIL decided that on 4 July the NCLT Order will be filed by the lender, BFIL and IFIL with the Registrar of Companies. on 10 June, 2019, NCLT sanctioned the scheme of arrangement about BFIL, IndusInd and IFIL and their respective shareholders and creditors.

44,2019-06-24,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank promoters will infuse  ₹2,700 crore to get their stake back to 15%The fourth of the money will come immediately after the merger, while the rest will come over the next 18 months

Mumbai: The Hindujas will pump another  ₹2,700 crore into IndusInd Bank through a warrant issue to ramp up the promoter holding after the merger of Bharat Financial, a senior official from the private sector lender has said.
The merger between the bank and the micro-lender, which will be effective July 4, is accretive from a profit, margin and return on equity perspective.
Our promoters will infuse  ₹2,700 crore to get their stake back to 15%, strategy head at the bank Sanjay Mallik told PTI over phone.
He said a fourth of the money will come immediately after the merger, while the rest will come over the next 18 months.
The promoters will be subscribing to the warrants at a premium of  ₹1,709 a share as against the Friday's close of  ₹1,448.70 on the BSE, Mallik said.
He explained that dilution of their stake to about the 13% levels due to the merger with micro-lender is making it possible for the promoters to subscribe to the warrants and increase their holding to 15% which is the cap set by regulator.
Merger of Bharat Financial into IndusInd Bank was announced in October 2017, as part of which a shareholder would get 639 shares of IndusInd Bank for every 1,000 shares of the micro-lender.
Apart from the promoters infusion, the banks capital base will also benefit through the  ₹4,200-crore networth of the merged entity , Mallik said.
The merger and subsequent promoter infusion will push the capital base by USD 1 billion, he said, adding the capital buffers will increase by 3 percentage points through this.
The fund infusion willexpand the net interest margin by over 0.30%, and also help from a return on assets and return on equity perspectives, he said.
The margin of the micro-lender is at least three times of the bank. Considering that Bharat Financial will constitute 7% of the bank balance sheet post-merger, our margins will go up by 0.30-0.40%, Mallik said.
Mallik said the merger will help the micro-lender save up to 3 percentage points on its cost of funds because of the access to cheaper deposits after the merger.
He said nearly all of the 20 financial institutions from where Bharat Financial had borrowed money as part of its independent operations have been paid their dues.
He, however, was quick to add that this is simple math and should not be seen as a guidance.
The bank had reported at 3.9% net interest margin for the March quarter.
The bank will announce the consolidated numbers for the June quarter on July 12.
He said similarly, the return on assets will also benefit, pointing out that the ratio stands at 1.9% for the bank, whereas the same for Bharat Financial is at 4.5% with 27% return on equity, which is much higher than the banks 17.5%.
Bharat Financial will be a hundred percent subsidiary of the bank and will be the banks business correspondent, which will continue with its earlier activities, employees and relationships, he said.
Additionally, the merger will help the bank extend all the universal banking services to the largely rural clientele of the micro-financier to fulfill their aspirations.
Mallik said least amount of integration efforts are required for the merger, because the two businesses are complementary and distinct from each other and added that a lot of practices of IndusInd are already known to Bharat Financial because the micro-lender has been functioning as a business correspondent for the bank for long."
43,2019-06-24,IndusInd,"Bhatia, managing director, global corporate and investment banking, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, focuses on the outlook for foreign capital inflowsWe have seen RBI and govt have a commonality of views. Therefore, they will ensure confidence returns, says Asit Bhatia

Asit Bhatia, managing director, global corporate and investment banking, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, focuses on the outlook for foreign capital inflows in the Indian capital markets, private equity and strategic investor interest after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s return to office. Edited excerpts from an interaction with Mint:
What’s your view on the liquidity crunch and interest rates?
There are factors related to the ongoing non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) crisis that have adversely affected the confidence of market participants. The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have been working in sync to ensure there is enough liquidity and confidence is re-established. We have seen that RBI and the government have had a commonality of views and direction. Therefore, I believe they will ensure that confidence returns. The overall (weak) inflationary environment also gives RBI a lot more room to lower interest rates to help spur growth.
What can the Centre do to stimulate growth?
There were uncertainties ahead of the general elections. However, with the NDA government having an absolute majority, we believe it will now focus on growth. Over the past few years, India Inc. has not really invested in growth. Capital raising has been mostly for repairing balance sheets. Some strong companies have bought stressed assets through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The Centre will need to kickstart growth through more public spending, which had stopped in the last year or so. This will eventually fuel growth and create employment.
What is the outlook for foreign capital flows?
After a lull in 2018, FII flows have been very strong in 2019 leading to a market rally. We, in India, get disappointed with 6-7% growth, but this is one of the highest growth rates in the world. What probably concerned foreign investors briefly were uncertainties ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. With a strong mandate to the government, there is an expectation of a clear vision and direction. I believe that the budget will provide a roadmap on the way forward. As far as strategic capital is concerned, it will start now in earnest because long-term investors look for stability, which we have. Over the past few years, we have seen pockets of investment, mostly in consumer tech. However, we are still not seeing meaningful traditional FDI coming in, mainly because investors were in a wait-and-watch mode. The wait is now over.
Are there new sources of private equity?
In the past few years, we have seen active interest from Chinese and Japanese investors. We are also seeing new investors coming. There is so much liquidity in the global system, and investors see attractive opportunities in India. Also, there are innovative ideas coming in from several credible new-age startups. We are seeing some unicorns out of India. All of this is the right ground for private equity money to play.
How were the first six months for investment banking business?
We have had a fantastic first six months. Besides the two block deals for Standard Life to sell stake in HDFC Life, we led the Blackstone Embassy REITs. We also helped State Bank of India, IndusInd Bank, and GMR Airports raise money via dollar bonds.
We have been active even in M&A. We advised Unilever on its acquisition of GSK’s consumer health drinks business and worked with Tata Global Beverages for its acquisition of the consumer businesses from Tata Chemicals. Our pipeline across M&As and capital markets is very strong. We will work on select quality deals, leverage our global franchise and deliver well for our clients.

41,2019-07-12,IndusInd,"Kotak Securities noted that ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will benefit given their superior provision levelsLenders that start with a high level of PCR may not need to make large incremental provisions towards stressed assets

MUMBAI :
Better safe than sorry has never been more relevant to Indian banks.
The first quarter results of Indian banks would kickstart today with IndusInd Bank announcing its numbers later in the day.
While investors will monitor several parameters to determine which banks are safer and which would be sorry, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) is expected to be a deciding factor.
After all, insurance against risks is the best way to ensure future profits.
In its financial stability report, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted that there is a wide disparity between banks with regards to PCR. “PSBs, in particular, showed a range of 42% to 74% in PCRs,"" the report said.
Analysts believe that banks having superior PCR would be better placed to tide over any future stress and therefore are more likely to show improved profitability for the June quarter.
Kotak Securities noted that private banks mainly into corporate lending such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will benefit given their superior provision levels.
For the March quarter, ICICI Bank’s PCR was 80.7% while that of Axis Bank was 77%.
“We believe large banks with a strong liability franchise and higher provision coverage are well-placed vis-à-vis others, and therefore should attract premium valuations,"" said analysts at Reliance Securities in a recent note.
Lenders that start with a high level of PCR may not need to make large incremental provisions towards stressed assets.
RBI’s report noted that public sector banks have seen the sharpest improvement in PCR. On aggregate level, public sector lenders saw their PCR rise to 60.6% in March from 48.3% a year ago. The PCR for private banks was lower at 57%.
As for provisions, analysts believe that lenders are likely to increase provisions to beef up the PCR and deal with the fresh stress seen in Q1."

NEW DELHI :
Private sector lender IndusInd Bank on Friday reported a 38.3% jump in net profit at  ₹1,432.50 crore for the June quarter on account of lower-than-expected provisioning and growth in core interest income. The bank had posted net profit of  ₹1,035.72 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal year.
The lender’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 2.15% of the total advances at the end of June 2019, as against 1.15% in the year earlier. Likewise, net NPAs, or bad loans, too, jumped from 0.51% in the year ago period to 1.23%.
A rise in NPA ratio led to higher provisioning and contingencies at  ₹430.62 crore for April-June, as compared to  ₹350 crore set aside during the year-ago period.
The management said enough provisions have been made for its exposure to Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), and they expect special purpose vehicle bids to be opened shortly, which will help them recover outstanding dues. The bank had classified  ₹3,004 crore of exposure to IL&FS as NPA during the last quarter, and provided  ₹1,273 crore against this exposure which led to a 62% fall in net profit.
On the operating side, the lender’s net interest income rose from  ₹2,122 crore to  ₹2,844 crore year-on-year (y-o-y). Total income grew to  ₹8,624 crore in the June quarter of 2019-20, as against  ₹6,369 crore in the first quarter of 2018-19.
The bank reported credit growth of 28% y-o-y and deposit growth of 26% as on June 2019. “We expect credit growth to be around mid 20% for the current fiscal year. Net interest margins of the consolidated entity stood at 4.05% in the first quarter and we expect an improvement in margins by 10-15 basis points in the next 2-3 quarters due to fall in cost of deposits,"" said Romesh Sobti, chief executive officer and managing director of Indusind Bank, in a statement.
The bank’s results for the first quarter include the operating performance of former microfinance lender, Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd (BFIL), which was merged with IndusInd Bank. It expects to convert 7.5 million customers of BFIL into savings bank customers this fiscal year. The microfinance book, however, reported flat quarter-on-quarter growth even as assets under management grew by 26%.
“We took a conscious decision to tighten the lending norms in a few states because we think there is some overheating in few states like West Bengal and Orissa, “ said MR Rao, CEO, BFIL."
39,2019-07-14,IndusInd,"The bank has very little insurance against future risks as provision coverage ratio was flat at 43% for the June quarterExcluding Bharat Financial's net profit of  ₹213.02 crore, IndusInd Bank’s profit growth was 18% year-on-year

A 38% surge in June quarter net profit on the back of 34% rise in core income should have been enough to cheer investors of IndusInd bank. But looks like its investors don’t want to leave the lender off the hook yet for its disastrous numbers in the March quarter.
Ergo, the stock’s reaction on Friday to the improved profitability metrics reported by the bank was contrary as it ended nearly 2% lower.
It should be noted that both net profit and total income include that of micro-finance lender Bharat Financial Ltd, which got merged with the bank. IndusInd Bank said the results aren't comparable as a result. Excluding the micro lender’s net profit of  ₹213.02 crore, IndusInd Bank’s profit growth was 18% year-on-year.
So the bank had help from the merger on profitability and clearly its efficiency has increased. The outlook on its deposits is sanguine given the potential of raising deposits albeit small from the microfinance company’s borrower base.
But the story on the loan book is still grim.
To start with, the private bank’s stockpile of stressed assets hasn’t reduced materially and they cannot reduce simply because resolution has been slow. This is true in the case of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) and exposures to certain non-bank finance companies. The bank has very little insurance against future risk as its provision coverage ratio remained flat at 43% for the June quarter. Analysts were disappointed that the lender did not choose to increase provisions from the amplified profits.
Granted that incremental slippages have dropped sharply but as the adjoining chart shows, its gross bad loan ratio is still elevated at 2.15%. Swallowing a microfinance lender brings its own set of risks too on the delinquency side.
To be sure, Bharat Financial’s disbursements dropped marginally in the June quarter as the microlender became cautious in some states sensing a rise in risk.
Stress on IndusInd Bank’s own loan book is likely to increase and analysts believe the lender won’t be able to deliver on its guidance of 60-65 basis points on credit costs for FY20.
The stock trades at a multiple of 2.44 times its estimated book value for FY21, cheaper than larger peers such as HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, but dearer than ICICI Bank and Axis Bank."

36,2019-07-24,IndusInd,"IndusInd’s purchase of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd. will help it to improve profitabilityIndusInd Bank has risen 1,500% since Sobti became CEO in 2008

IndusInd Bank Ltd., India’s best performing lender in the past decade, is counting on its acquisition of a microfinance firm to help it improve profitability, while shrugging off risks from the country’s spreading shadow bank crisis.
IndusInd’s purchase of Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd. will help it to “move the needle"" on profitability parameters including return on assets and lending margins, Chief Executive Officer Romesh Sobti said. Acquiring the nation’s largest micro financier gives the bank presence in more than 115,000 Indian villages that will increase its cross-sell, lending and low-cost deposit mobilization efforts, Sobti said, in an interview in his office.
Mumbai-based IndusInd, which has risen 1,500% since Sobti became CEO in 2008, lost some of its sheen after analysts including those at Credit Suisse AG and UBS Group AG flagged the lender’s exposure to beleaguered Indian shadow banks including Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. However, higher capital buffers and lower bad loans helped the bank sidestep the fate of rival Yes Bank Ltd., which had lent to the non-banks, and saw its market capitalization halve.
“IndusInd’s exposures are way lower than what is projected in those reports and is backed by adequate collateral,"" Sobti said. “We are not expecting any spike in bad loans and are currently focusing on using the doorway offered to rural India through Bharat Financial.""
IndusInd has been more selective in lending to non-bank finance companies off late. The bank’s net bad loan ratio stands at about 1.2% compared with 2.9% at Yes Bank. IndusInd’s return on asset rose to 2.1% in June from 1.9% in the year ago period, filings show.
Still, there’s another risk looming for the bank, according to Morgan Stanley analysts -- Sobti’s retirement in March. The CEO who had quit ABN Amro Bank NV’s local unit to take the top job at IndusInd in February 2008, is credited with the turnaround that led to the surge in it’s shares, making it the best performer on the 10 member Bankex Index. The index climbed 200% in the same period.
“There is no need for concern as the board has been applying its mind to this over last four years,"" Sobti said. “By end of 2019 my successor will be in place, and there won’t be any disruption.""

35,2019-07-28,IndusInd,"Large banks, family offices, development financial institutions are among the investorsFundraise by Alteria Capital signals a sharp rise in appetite for debt financing from startups

MUMBAI :
Alteria Capital, which provides loans to startups, has closed its maiden venture debt fund at a corpus of $140 million ( ₹960 crore), signalling a sharp rise in appetite for debt financing from startups, said a senior executive of the firm.
The fund has raised more than the  ₹800 crore it had set out to raise, with the final close including a greenshoe option, which gives the fund an option to raise more than it had originally planned.
The limited partners (investors in the fund) include several large domestic banks, family offices, and development financial institutions such as IndusInd Bank, Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), Azim Premji Foundation, and Flipkart co-founder Binny Bansal.
Alteria was started in early 2018 by Vinod Murali and Ajay Hattangdi, former executives of Temasek-owned InnoVen Capital, also one of India’s largest venture debt firms.
“Venture debt is now an integral part of funding rounds for startups across stages and sectors. There is a better awareness of how the product can be utilized by startups as well as the expectation on returns for investors into the fund,"" said Murali.
“Since we have the ability to recycle capital, we will end up deploying approximately  ₹1,800 crore from this fund and we are seeing a very strong pipeline of startups across technology, healthcare and consumer segments to absorb this capital over the next couple of years,"" he added.
Alteria announced its first close of  ₹356 crore in March last year, followed by a second close of  ₹625 crore in October last year.
It has already invested  ₹540 crore across 28 transactions, in startups including online learning firm Toppr, student housing living startup Stanza Living, scooter rental platform Vogo and digital lender Lendingkart, among others.
Alteria also seeks to differentiate itself and help its portfolio of companies with an initiative called Activate, through which Alteria leverages its network to connect portfolio companies with large corporations, investors and emerging technologies, Hattangdi said in an interview.
Alteria’s fundraise also signals the increasing popularity of debt among startups, since it helps them avoid excessive dilution of equity, finance working capital or day-to-day business operations, and increases the runway prior to a large equity fundraise.
India’s venture debt market is dominated by three firms—Alteria, InnoVen and Trifecta Capital, which is currently raising a  ₹750 crore second fund. Private sector bank RBL Bank Ltd anchored Trifecta’s first venture debt fund with an investment of  ₹50 crore in 2015.
The venture debt space has also seen the interest of several wealthy individuals including Flipkart co-founder Sachin Bansal, who has made venture debt investments in two scooter-rental startups Vogo and Bounce.
While the venture debt market size last year was about  ₹2,000 crore last year, it is expected to grow this year on the back of more startups seeking funds and increasing ticket sizes.
Mint reported on 24 December that the total deal value is expected to grow 25-30% this year.
Venture debt deals have also seen a rise in follow on rounds, i.e., investors doubling down on existing portfolio companies. Alteria and InnoVen alone have done 10 follow-ons this year."
34,2019-08-02,IndusInd,"The windfall treasury profits come as a relief for lenders staring at a potential surge in bad loan provisions due to a slowing economyThis may not be the first time a bond bonanza helped India clean up bad debt in its financial system

MUMBAI :
One of Asia’s best bond rallies is bolstering Indian banks’ efforts to accelerate clean-up of the world’s worst bad-loan pile.
The benchmark 10-year sovereign bond yield dropped about 50 basis points in July, extending the past year’s decline to more than 130 basis points. It fell another 8 basis points on Friday. Each basis point fall in the yield adds 3.5 billion rupees ($50 million) to banks’ treasury gains, boosting their ability to writedown bad loans, estimates by ICRA Ltd. show.
The windfall treasury profits come as a relief for lenders staring at a potential surge in bad loan provisions due to a slowing economy and a cash squeeze in the nation’s shadow banking system. India’s proposal last month to issue the country’s first overseas bond and bets on deep cuts in policy rates are adding fresh legs to the bond rally.
This may not be the first time a bond bonanza helped India clean up bad debt in its financial system. Two decades back, when the soured-debt ratio at banks was hovering close to 15%, yields on government securities fell sharply, generating mark-to-market gains that came handy in cleaning out the bad debt pile, Romesh Sobti, chief executive officer at IndusInd Bank, said in a recent interview.
“While this time around the drop in the sovereign bond yields is not as dramatic, the quantum of bond holding is way higher,"" Sobti said. “Gains will be handsome enough to enable banks to start cleaning up the books faster.""
Credit markets are already cognizant of this bond boon. The average cost of credit-default swaps insuring the bonds of five Indian lenders against nonpayment for five-years has dropped 35 basis points last month, according to data provider CMAI. This has been the sharpest drop in about five years.
Adding further to the optimism is the government’s plan to infuse 700 billion rupees into state-run banks in the year to March 31 to strengthen their balance sheets and kick-start the nation’s economic expansion. The pace of economic growth slowed for an eighth consecutive month year-on-year in June, according to Bloomberg Economics.
“Public-sector banks as a sector can emerge from the red behind lower provisions and potentially better trading-related gains,"" said Ismael Pili, co-head for Asian bank research at CreditSights Singapore. “At the very least, we should expect earnings support from trading-related income in subsequent quarters."""

31,2019-09-19,IndusInd,"Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank have the largest direct exposure to commercial real estateOther banks like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also have significant exposure to the sector

Mumbai: Rating agency Moody's on Thursday said real estate financier Altico Capital India Ltd's default is credit negative for banks with significant exposure to real estate sector. The default signals increasing tight liquidity among property developers, said the agency.
Moody's also said banks such as Yes bank and Indusind Bank which have the largest direct exposure to commercial real estate would be susceptible to asset quality difficulties if the real estate sector continues to slow. Other banks like ICICI Bank and Axis bank also have significant exposure to the sector.
Banks have indirect exposure to real estate sector through their lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs), which also lend to real estate developers. While the overall exposure of NBFCs and HFCs to the real estate sector is only about 6% of their total assets, some NBFCs and HFCs are more exposed than others, making them vulnerable to a slowdown in the sector.
In response to the tightening liquidity in the real estate sector, the Indian government on 13 September announced that it would create an investment fund to provide soft loans to residential real estate developers to complete partially constructed affordable housing projects.
The government will contribute  ₹10,000 crore to the fund and expects a similar-size contribution from entities including the Life Insurance Corporation of India, Indian banks and development institutions.
According to Moody's, the creation of the investment fund is credit positive for the real estate sector, but its timeline and modalities are not yet known, and is unclear if it will help address the sector's immediate liquidity constraints. In addition, it will not address the broader solvency constraints of real estate developers given its narrow remit of targeting only certain residential real estate projects."

A fall in share prices of Lakshmi Vilas Bank after the RBI initiated prompt corrective action on the lender also put pressure on Indiabulls— on concerns over the planned merger of the two entities.
According to Indiabulls Housing’s FY19 annual report, both Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank are lenders to the company. Others include Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, Axis Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of India, Bank of Maharashtra, Canara Bank and Union Bank of India.
Documents from the Registrar of Companies showed that as of 31 December 2018, IndusInd Bank had a  ₹500 crore term loan exposure to Indiabulls Housing and Yes Bank had  ₹250 crore cash credit exposure to the mortgage lender.
Thereafter, according to an agreement dated 29 January, 2019, Yes Bank granted a term loan of  ₹750 crore to Indiabulls Housing, with a moratorium of 12 months on the principal. Credit rating agency Icra said in a 30 August report that Indiabulls Housing has long-term bank facilities of  ₹47,000 crore.
On Monday, shares of Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank fell 15% and 6.8%, respectively, on the BSE."

Yes Bank shares are at a decade’s low now.
Shares of Lakshmi Vilas Bank (LVB) were also under pressure, down nearly 5%, due to concerns over proposed merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance not going through.

This along with worries over global growth dragged down sentiment. The stock was down 5%.
Hindalco: Weakness in domestic demand combined with global-growth concerns weighed on metal stocks. Shares of the company were trading nearly 4% lower. A possible delay in revival of industrial and manufacturing activity may continue to put pressure on the sectoral index.
Zee Entertainment: Shares of the company recovered from Tuesday’s double-digit fall, trading nearly 5% higher on Thursday.

The increase in US sales offset a possible fall in share prices following 50% year-on-year decline in September domestic sales at 32,376 units. Tata had sold 64,598 vehicles in the same month last year.

IndusInd Bank Ltd., which saw a fifth of its market value wiped out over the past week on concern about its creditors, says the crisis of confidence engulfing India’s financial system is fading away.
Outstanding loans to overstretched borrowers dipped at the Mumbai-based bank last quarter, lenders including IndusInd are working to resolve defaults at Dewan Housing Finance Ltd., and Indian authorities are taking steps to contain future delinquencies at shadow banks, IndusInd’s Chief Executive Officer Romesh Sobti said in an interview in Mumbai on Friday.
“All we need now to turn the tide of caution completely is a resolution of a large delinquent account,"" Sobti said. “Banks are already beginning to look more positively at lending to non-bank financiers and the real estate segment as the worst is behind us.""
IndusInd joins Axis Bank Ltd. and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. in predicting that the Indian financial sector’s woes will ease soon. Most banks have been beaten down for more than a year since the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and defaults by other shadow lenders including Dewan and Altico Capital India Ltd.
Shares of IndusInd have fallen about 20% over the past week amid speculation that it was owed money by Indiabulls. As of Sept. 29, gross exposure to the housing finance company concerned, its units and associate finance companies stands at about 0.35% of the loan book and is backed by adequate collateral, IndusInd said in a Sept. 30 filing without naming any firm.
The bank’s gross bad loan ratio stands at about 2.2% as of June end, compared with more than 9% for the nation’s banking system. IndusInd’s return on assets rose to 2.1% in June from 1.9% in the year-ago period, filings show.
IL&FS group is seeking to resolve most of its debt obligations by March, chief operating officer of the company said this month. Meanwhile, Dewan, the largest mortgage lender to default so far, has prepared a plan to resolve stress on its books. IndusInd, which has exposures to Dewan, IL&FS and Indiabulls, has seen repayments from some embattled borrowers in the September quarter, Sobti said, without providing further details.

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are expected to be volatile on Monday. In the truncated trading week, markets will likely take cues from corporate earnings that kickstart with Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and IndusInd Bank reporting their results for September quarter.
Indian companies are expected to report a decline in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that has sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including a tax cut for corporates.
Asian shares edged higher on Monday after data showed the US unemployment rate dropped to the lowest in almost 50 years, easing concerns of a slowdown in the world’s largest economy.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.25%. Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.29%, while Australian shares were up 0.48%
US Treasury yields inched higher as Friday’s data on the US jobs market suggests the Federal Reserve may not need to cut interest rates further. Sentiment around the US economy deteriorated sharply last week after disappointing data on manufacturing and services suggested the trade war was taking a toll, and more rate cuts would be needed to avert a potential recession in the world’s biggest economy.
The modest increase in US jobs eased some of these concerns, but traders warn that downside risks loom large on the horizon. Unemployment rate in the US fell to 3.5% in September to reach the lowest since December 1969. Non-farm payrolls also grew in September, but slightly less than expected.
The focus will shift to the next round of US-China trade negotiations expected in Washington on 10-11 October to see if the two sides can end a bruising year-long trade war that has hurt global growth and raised the risk of recession.
Back home, shares of Yes Bank are likely to be in focus. According to a Mint report, the private lender is in talks with three top technology companies, including Microsoft Corp., to induct one of them as a strategic shareholder as part of the bank’s strategy to get fresh capital infusion and augment its digital ambitions.
The Essel Group which is the promoter of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) has told its investors that none of ZEEL’s shares were pledged to Russia's VTB Capital Plc, in the structured loan arrangement inked between the firms in September 2017. The development comes after both, VTB Capital Plc and Essel Group, disclosed to stock exchanges on Friday that ZEEL's promoters have created an encumbrance on 10.2 crore shares, translating to a 10.7% stake held by promoter entity Essel Media Ventures Ltd, in favour of VTB Capital.

The yuan weakened about 0.20% in offshore trade to 7.1285 yuan per dollar. There is no onshore trading as Monday is the last day of China's holiday break. The yen, also considered a safe-haven asset edged slightly higher to 106.78 versus the US dollar and gained to 72.20 per Australian dollar.
The US and China have slapped tariffs on each other’s goods as part of a long-running dispute over Beijing’s trading practices, which Washington says are unfair.
Central banks around the world have been easing policy to offset the negative impact from the trade war. The Fed has already lowered interest rates twice this year, but a strong jobs market suggests further rate cuts may not be necessary. Worries about political instability in Hong Kong could hurt market sentiment after China’s army took the unusual step of issuing warnings to anti-government protesters in Hong Kong over the weekend.

18,2019-10-11,IndusInd,"IndusInd Bank stock falls over 6%, showing investors are worried about the sharp fall in loan growth to a multi-year lowThe lender had to face the wrath of investors on Thursday even though it reported a 50% jump in profit for the September quarter year-on-year

When life gives you lemons, you may find yourself in a pickle. This is true for IndusInd Bank Ltd.
The private sector lender had to face the wrath of investors on Thursday even though it reported a 50% jump in profit for the September quarter year-on-year. The bank beefed up its provisions too, taking the coverage ratio to 50% from 43% in the previous quarter.
In other words, it maintained its profitability and also bought insurance for future risk. “We have made accelerated provisions, and that is not because of slippages but to increase the coverage ratio,"" said managing director and chief executive officer Romesh Sobti.
But the stock fell over 6% on Thursday, indicating that investors are worried over the sharp fall in loan growth to a multi-year low.
But investors should have seen the loan deceleration coming since the bank’s book is heavy on commercial vehicle loans. The auto sector’s troubles are bound to show up.
To be sure, the broad market was weak too, with the Nifty ending 0.7% down and the banking index closing 2.7% lower. Even so, IndusInd Bank seems to be hit hard.
Perhaps another factor was the sharp rise in slippages for the September quarter. The pain seems to have stemmed from not just corporate loans but also consumer loans. Here too, auto loans were the culprit and microfinance loans also gave trouble.
The key question now is how much more pain the lender is likely to see. A handful of large corporate groups have emerged as key stress points for banks over the last one month. Developments in the non-banking finance sector, too, have shaken confidence in banks including IndusInd Bank. Surely, a bunch of borrowers have delayed repayments but all of them put together form not even 1% of IndusInd Bank’s loan book. Of this, the lender expects  ₹257 crore worth of repayments over the next few weeks. Sobti sought to allay investor worries further and said these repayments will bring down the stress loan portfolio even more.
IndusInd Bank’s assurances can be taken in good faith but it is important to note that the lender had given similar promises in the first quarter too. Asset quality metrics haven’t stood up to scrutiny in the three months following the June quarter.
In a nutshell, investors can expect further pain on the bank’s balance sheet and the deceleration of the loan book is here to stay for some time.
Since IndusInd Bank’s valuations have been buttressed mainly by its stellar track record on loan growth and asset quality, the stock may not be out of pressure in the coming days. After the 13% drop over the last two months, the stock trades at a modest multiple of twice its estimated book value for FY21."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus on Friday:
TCS: The IT major, in its July-September earnings announced on Thursday, reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year, missing the Street's estimate of 9-9.5%. This may not bode well for the stock. The company along with IndusInd Bank Ltd kick started the earnings season for the September quarter and is likely to set the mood for the Indian equity market.
Yes Bank: The private lender on Thursday said it has appointed Anita Pai as its chief operating officer and Jasneet Bachal as chief marketing officer. Despite the announcement, shares remained in the red due to worries over the bank’s exposure to stressed sectors, mainly housing finance companies (HFCs) and weak financials.
IndusInd Bank: Shares of the bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarter. Though the bank saw a 52% year-on-year jump in net profit, a sharp rise in provisions dragged the stock lower. The net profit number also missed analysts’ estimate. The bank’s exposure to a large HFC has been weighing on the investor sentiment.
Lupin: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has pulled up Lupin Ltd for failing to maintain records of batches of manufactured medicines and their sales at the company’s Tarapur plant. The regulator also pointed out that the batch production and control records at the plant do not include complete information relating to production and control of each batch.
Indiabulls Housing: Shares of the company plunged on Thursday, closing down more than 19% as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank. This has spoiled the non-bank’s plans to get a banking licence amid concerns over tight liquidity and weak asset quality faced by housing finance companies.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: The stock hit an all-time low on Thursday and was locked in the lower circuit limit of 5% at Rs.25.65 on the BSE as the Reserve Bank did not approve its merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. In September, the bank was placed under the prompt corrective action list by the RBI for not meeting certain regulatory thresholds.
Infosys: The IT company will report its second quarter earnings today. Experts believe that this earnings season may not do well due to weakness in demand that has led to a slowdown in the economy along with liquidity crisis that has affected the non-banking financial companies, automobile and real estate sectors.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Thursday was the top gainer among the Nifty 50 stocks as investors cheered Reliance Jio’s announcement that it will end free voice calls. The most profitable operator Jio will now charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks.
SpiceJet: The company on Thursday said no cracks have been found in its fleet of older Boeing 737 NG after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered inspections following a similar move from the US Federal Aviation Administration's to conduct checks for structural cracks on a portion of the 737 fleet operating in the country.
IOB: Indian Overseas Bank said on Thursday it would reduce the interest rates in retail and micro small and medium enterprises by 25 basis points with effect from 1 November. This after the RBI cut the key lending rate by 25 basis points in the October monetary policy meeting."

Shares of banks and Grasim Industries slipped on Thursday after the Supreme Court upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT), which effectively means telecom operators may have to pay the government  ₹92000 crore in past dues.
The order comes at a time when Indian banks grapple with mounting non-performing assets and have seen their valuations erode.
On Thursday, Yes Bank ended 5.8% lower, State Bank of India 4.7%%, Indusind Bank 4%, RBL Bank 3%, Federal Bank 2.8%. BSE Bankex fell 1.2%.
Shares of Grasim Industries, which has an exposure to the telecom sector via its 11.55% stake in Vodafone Idea, slumped 5%.
The order is a huge blow to private telcos, who have been running losses for the past many quarters and show no signs of making money in the near future.
Vodafone Idea slumped 22%, but Bharti Airtel pared losses and gained 3%.
""Bharti Airtel shares are up even though it will be impacted by the SC order; this is because investors are pricing in a two-player market, with the assumption that Vodafone Idea will not be able to survive under the weight of the penalty,"" said analysts at two domestic institutional brokerages requesting anonymity.
AGR is the basis on which department of telecommunications (DoT) calculates levies payable by operators and it has been a bone of contention between the telcos and the government. Telecom operators are liable to pay around 3-5% and 8% of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT.
The matter had been under litigation for 14 years with operators arguing that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisting that AGR should include all revenues earned by an operator, including that from non-core telecom operations."

MUMBAI :
IndusInd Bank board in a meeting on Wednesday finalized a potential candidate for the position of managing director & chief executive officer after Romesh Sobti's term comes to an end in March 2020.
In an exchange filing, the bank said it has submitted an application to the Reserve Bank of India seeking approval for appointing the new CEO. The bank also added that it will disclose the name of the new CEO to exchanges after getting approval from the RBI.
On October 10 Economic Times had reported that the bank is likely to name it's consumer banking head Sumant Kathpalia as the new CEO.
A chartered accountant by qualification, Kathpalia has been with the bank since 2008. Before joining IndusInd Bank, he led the consumer banking business of ABN AMRO. He has also worked with Citibank and Bank of America.
Earlier this month Sobti had said that the decision will be made ""well in time"" as the succession planning has been going on since the past few years. He was hoping that RBI will extend the age limit for managing directors of private sector banks from 70 to 75 years, giving him additional time to continue in the bank. Under the companies Act, registered companies can have chief executives who are over 70 years of age by passing a special resolution.
With the central bank turning down the request, Sobti will have to step down after having served as the bank""s CEO since FY08."

Mumbai: India’s benchmark equity index Sensex opened marginally higher on Friday, staying above the crucial 40,000 mark for the third straight day. Investors await auto sales numbers and macro data due next week. The market will also eye global cues ahead of the release of US jobs data amid fresh concern over US-China trade deal.
At 9.25 am, the benchmark Sensex was up 0.3% at 40245.59 points, while the Nifty 50 rose 0.2% to 11905.25 points.
There was caution in the market after data released Thursday showed that India’s infrastructure output shrank the most since 2005, highlighting the slowdown in the economy. Core infrastructure contracted 5.2% in September compared with a 4.3% growth in the year-ago period.
On Thursday, Indian equities hit at a record high following better-than-expected earnings by most companies. Fifteen of the 26 Nifty companies that have reported earnings so far this season have surpassed analyst estimates, two have matched, while eight have missed projections, according to Bloomberg data.
""We believe in-line September quarter earnings so far and positive outlook by key auto and banking players have lifted the investor sentiment. On the global front, US Fed rate cut of 25bps and better than expected US GDP numbers for the third quarter seem to have provided some relief to the investors’ concern regarding the economic slowdown. However, going forward consolidation cannot be ruled out given the near-peak level of the markets"", said Ajit Mishra, vice president Research at Religare Broking.
Most other Asian indices were in the red tracking the overnight trend in US stock markets. All eyes will be on the US jobs report, which will provide clues about the health of the country’s economy.

Indiabulls Housing: Shares surged more than 15% in early deals as the government cleared a proposal to infuse  ₹25,000 crore in an alternative investment fund to revive stalled housing projects that could potentially benefit 4.58 lakh homebuyers. This offset the company’s weak earnings in the September quarter, which saw a more than 32% decline in consolidated net profit to  ₹702.18 crore.
IndusInd Bank: Buoyed by gains in real estate companies, the stock of the private lender traded nearly 3% higher and was the top gainer among Nifty 50 firms. IndusInd Bank Ltd has a substantial exposure to the real estate sector, one of the worst hit sectors due to the economic slowdown. This has often put the shares of the bank under pressure.

5,2019-12-02,IndusInd,"Eight of 10 economists see MPC cutting repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.9% this weekThe Reserve Bank of India seeks to reverse a protracted growth slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy

The central bank is likely to cut interest rates for the sixth straight time on 5 December despite a surprise spike in inflation, as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) seeks to reverse a protracted growth slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy.
Eight out of 10 economists and treasury heads surveyed by Mint expect RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) to cut the repo rate, at which RBI lends to banks, by 25 basis points (bps) to 4.9%, while maintaining an accommodative stance. Two expect the RBI to cut rates by 15bps.
Economic growth has slowed to 4.5% in the September quarter, its weakest pace since 2013, despite a cumulative 135bps cut in policy rates this year. Indian banks, saddled with record bad loans, have failed to transmit the rate cuts to borrowers.
Output of capital goods, which indicates investment activity in manufacturing, contracted 20.7% in September against a 6.9% expansion in the year-ago period. After the October MPC meeting, governor Shaktikanta Das said the central bank will maintain its accommodative stance as long as it is necessary to revive growth, even as it ensures that inflation remains within target.
“Completely in line with our expectation, GDP in Q2 printed a 26 quarter low with most sectors showing a decline. Core GVA (gross value added) excluding agriculture and government services has printed a low of 3.4%. This further emphatically underscores the need of policy focus shifting to reviving growth. We continue to expect RBI to execute another rate cut in December of 25bps,"" Shubhada Rao, chief economist at Yes Bank, said in a research note.
Despite the monetary stimulus thus far and a slew of government measures to boost the economy, economists do not expect an immediate recovery in growth momentum. Non-food credit growth has also slowed to 7.9% from a year earlier in the first week of November from 8.9% in October.
Inflation has also started accelerating with consumer price inflation quickening to 4.62% in October, breaching the 4% target for the first time since July 2018.
In its October policy, RBI projected CPI inflation at 3.5-3.7% for the second half of fiscal year 2019-20 and GDP growth at 6.1%. Many economists expect RBI to revise inflation forecast upwards to 4-4.5% and GDP growth forecast downwards to around 5-5.5% for the current fiscal year. “We expect RBI to cut the repo rate by 25bps to 4.9% next week (5 December), while downgrading growth and revising higher its inflation projections. We expect incrementally the focus to now shift to government measures on specific sectors and to revitalise the financial sector,"" Nomura Global Markets Research said in its recent report.
“The RBI will mark down its growth forecast further in light of the fact that the first half growth has been below 5% and underlying growth drivers remain weak. While the headline inflation has crossed over the target and is expected to stay elevated, it is mainly due to transitory food inflationary pressures. Inflation forecast would be revised upwards, with average headline inflation expected to be around 4.8% over the rest of this fiscal. The mandate of the MPC however, allows it flexibility on the headline inflation in such a scenario,"" said Gaurav Kapur, chief economist, IndusInd Bank.
However, economists remain divided over whether RBI will cut rates further before the end of fiscal year 2020. Half the economists polled expect RBI to cut rates by an additional 25bps during FY20.
“We reiterate our call of another 50bps of repo rate cuts through the rest of FY2020. Beyond that, the MPC will likely stay on hold and focus on transmission as the GDP growth gradually reverses to 5.5-6.0% and inflation hovers slightly above the 4% mark,"" said economists at Kotak Mahindra bank in their latest report."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Industries has emerged as the biggest wealth creator during 2014-19 by adding  ₹5.6 trillion of wealth, according to a study.
The top-100 wealth creators generated  ₹49 trillion during 2014-19, the highest-ever quantum of wealth added, according to Motilal Oswal's Annual Wealth Creation Study 2019.
""After a gap of 7 years, Reliance Industries has once again emerged the biggest wealth creator over 2014-19. A total of  ₹5.6 trillion wealth created by Reliance is the highest-ever so far by a huge margin,"" it added.
According to the study that was released on Wednesday, Reliance Industries, Indiabulls Ventures and IndusInd Bank are the biggest, fastest and most-consistent wealth creators, respectively.
Indiabulls Ventures is the fastest wealth creator for the second time in a row, with stock returns at a whopping 78% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
The study added that Bajaj Finance has the unique distinction of being in the top-10 biggest as well as fastest wealth creators.
Also, IndusInd Bank is the most-consistent wealth creator by recording the highest CAGR of 49% over the 10-year period of 2009-19.
During 2014-19, Sensex's CAGR was only 12% but the pace of wealth creation was at 22% CAGR.
""This reinforces the point that wealth creation happens in all kinds of market conditions,"" it said.
The study by the financial services company further added that the financial sector has emerged as India's biggest wealth-creating sector over 2014-19 for the third consecutive year.
The surge in wealth creation in the sector has been led by private banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
Public sector undertakings' (PSUs) wealth creation performance remained weak during 2014-19. The number of PSUs in the top-100 wealth creators is only nine, namely IOC, BPCL, HPCL, Power Grid Corporation, Petronet LNG, Indraprastha Gas, LIC Housing, Bharat Electronics and NBCC.
The total wealth destroyed during 2014-19 is  ₹8.6 trillion. Similar to last year's study, the financial sector has the unusual distinction of being the biggest wealth creator thanks to private banks and NBFCs and also the second biggest wealth destroyer thanks to state-owned banks.
The Motilal Oswal's Annual Wealth Creation Study 2019 analyses the top-100 wealth-creating companies.
Wealth created is calculated as change in the market capitalisation of companies between 2014 and 2019, duly adjusted for corporate events such as mergers, de-mergers, fresh issuance of capital, and buyback, among others."
1,2019-12-19,IndusInd,"The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorizationIn a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company

MUMBAI :
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance Ltd on Thursday said that it has invoked shares of Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL), which were pledged by Karvy Stock Broking Ltd to raise funds from the lender.
In a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company.
KDMSL, incorporated in 2008, is a Hyderabad-based step-down subsidiary of Karvy Stock Broking and provides business and knowledge process services. The company started off with back-office services and has over the years added various other services to its portfolio to cater to the banking, telecom, and e-commerce sectors.
“The shares of KDMSL were pledged with the company for securing the outstanding dues of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, the borrower company. The company has invoked the pledged shares of KDMSL for recovery of its dues,"" the stock exchange filing said.
Bajaj Finance is amongst the group of lenders with the largest exposure to Karvy Stock Broking, which raised money from the lenders by pledging shares belonging to its clients.
On 22 November, Sebi barred Karvy from acquiring new clients and from using power of attorney, thereby barring it from trading on behalf of clients, after the broker allegedly transferred clients’ money for other purposes and indulged in trade not authorized by them.
The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorization.
These securities were used to raise funds from banks, some of the securities were sold off and the proceeds were transferred to its real estate arm – Karvy Realty Ltd.
Since then some of the lenders including Bajaj Finance have been engaged in a legal tussle over these pledged shares.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on 14 December declined to give any relief to the four lenders -Bajaj Finance Ltd, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Mint reported. The lenders had lost control over pledged shares after they were transferred by National Securities Depository Ltd into clients’ accounts.
The four lenders including Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank had extended  ₹345 crore,  ₹642 crore,  ₹208 crore and  ₹159 crore to the broking firm against pledge shares worth  ₹2873 crore as of 16 September 2019. These pledged shares came down to  ₹2319 crore in November 2019."
0,2019-12-20,IndusInd,"The auto sector pain has indeed been the culprit behind the sharp slowdown in loan growthIt is clear that IndusInd Bank’s investors will allocate more brownie points for the stock once both growth and asset quality concerns reduce

IndusInd Bank Ltd has had a difficult first half in FY20. The bank’s shares have shed more than 15% since April, reflecting the deceleration in the bank’s balance-sheet growth.
The auto sector pain has indeed been the culprit behind the sharp slowdown in loan growth.
Will the lender bounce back to its heydays of high growth?
While the 30-35% growth rates seen in earlier years are unlikely soon, the bank is expected to arrest some of the slowdown. Analysts are confident that IndusInd Bank can salvage its loan growth considerably. This faith comes after the lender made a presentation detailing strategy for each vertical to analysts earlier this month.
IndusInd Bank is targeting 18-20% growth in vehicle finance, which forms more than a quarter of its loan book. But it also wants to grow its non-vehicle loan book at 24% over the next three years on a compound annual growth rate basis.
Here, the microfinance book will play a key role. The private sector lender’s merger with Bharat Financial Inclusion Ltd took effect in July this year and it has had a mixed impact on IndusInd Bank’s balance sheet. Bad loans have gone up as a proportion of the loan book in contrast to the bank’s long-standing record of having low bad loan ratios. For the September quarter, gross bad loans made up 2.2% of its loan book.
But the microlender was swallowed with an intent to not just diversify but also grow the loan book. Analysts believe this segment would be a key growth fillip in the coming quarters.
Further, the bank wants to boost its fee income too by targeting selling to high net-worth individuals. All the above factors would contribute to an increase in the bank’s operating profit.
But analysts have not taken their eyes off asset quality. Here the picture is mixed. The corporate stress watch-list stands at about 1% of the lender’s loan book. This could reduce, said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.
“The resolution of two IL&FS-SPV exposures of  ₹800 crore could meaningfully cut NPAs by Q4. Vodafone exposure remains a concern, though it assigns a lower default probability as of now,"" the brokerage firm said in a note. IL&FS-SPV stands for special purpose vehicles of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd.
But some such as HDFC Securities Ltd are still concerned over slippages. “We are a bit wary of IndusInd Bank’s exposures to stressed groups and companies. We model slippages of 2.3% and (loan loss provisioning) LLPs of 1.4% over FY20-22,"" the brokerage firm said in a note.
It is clear that IndusInd Bank’s investors will allocate more brownie points for the stock once both growth and asset quality concerns reduce. Until then, the multiple of about twice its estimated book value for FY21 appears reasonable."
