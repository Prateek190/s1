New Delhi: Country’s largest bank SBI netted a windfall of Rs1,771.67 crore, more than its second quarter profit, from customers for non-maintenance of monthly average balance in savings accounts in eight months of 2017-18, finance ministry data showed. 
New Delhi: Country’s largest bank SBI netted a windfall of Rs1,771.67 crore, more than its second quarter profit, from customers for non-maintenance of monthly average balance in savings accounts in eight months of 2017-18, finance ministry data showed.
State Bank of India has close to 40.5 crore savings account customers. The SBI, after a gap of six years, had reintroduced the monthly average balance (MAB) charges from 1 April 2017. After criticism by customers, it reduced those charges with effect from 1 October.
“On an average balance of Rs3,000 in metro, SBI earns Rs6 only per month whereas for a minimum balance of Rs1,000 in rural, bank earns Rs2 per month which is meagre when compared to the services offered and corresponding costs incurred by the bank (free cheque book, 8 free ATM transactions, free branch transactions),"" the state-owned lender said in a statement.
The finance ministry data showed the bank charged Rs1,771.67 crore from customers on account of non-maintenance of minimum average balance between April and November 2017.
Another large public sector bank, Punjab National Bank collected only Rs97.34 crore for non-maintenance of balance. The other government banks which collected in excess of Rs50 crore as penalty from customers were Central Bank of India, Canara Bank, IDBI Bank and Indian Bank.
The charges collected by SBI for non-maintenance of minimum balance exceeds the bank’s July-September quarter net profit of Rs1,581.55 crore. The amount was also nearly half of the Rs3,586 crore the bank earned as net profit from April to September.
“We would like to clarify that savings bank accounts such as Prime Minister’s Jan Dhan Yojna (PMJDY), Small accounts and Basic Savings Bank Deposit (BSBD) accounts, Pensioners, minors and all social beneficiary accounts are exempted from MAB requirement and no charges ever have been recovered,"" SBI said."
1078,2018-01-02,State Bank,"Electoral bonds for political funding can be purchased from SBI for 10 days in January, April, July and October and will be available in multiples of Rs1,000, Rs10,000, Rs1 lakh, Rs10 lakh and Rs1 crore

New Delhi: The union government on Tuesday announced details of political funding that can be routed by donors to parties through electoral bonds, a scheme announced by it in Union Budget 2017. 
New Delhi: The union government on Tuesday announced details of political funding that can be routed by donors to parties through electoral bonds, a scheme announced by it in Union Budget 2017.
Electoral bonds will allow a political donor to purchase bonds from authorized banks. These can be redeemed only through the registered accounts of a political party in a prescribed time frame.
In line with the Election Commission’s recommendation, the government in last year’s budget session also capped anonymous cash donations to political parties at Rs2,000.
On Tuesday, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the electoral bonds, which are interest-free banking instruments, can be bought from specified branches of State Bank of India in multiples of Rs1,000, Rs1 lakh, Rs10 lakh or Rs1 crore.
The life of the electoral bonds will be 15 days and they can be encashed only by registered political parties through a designated bank account.
 “The scheme has been placed before Parliament. Till today, people did not get explicit information on how much funds political parties got from which source and how they spent it. In 2001, we introduced a change to enable funding through cheque. But the share of anonymous funding is still high. The electoral bonds scheme is meant to change this,"" Jaitley told reporters.
“Whoever wants to donate electoral bonds, can buy them from any of the notified branches of SBI. The validity of the bonds is kept at 15 days so that this does not become a parallel currency. Every political party will have to file returns to the Election Commission on how much funds have been received,"" he said, adding that this was the “beginning"" of reforms in political funding and hinted at more measures later.
The electoral bonds will be available for purchase for a period of 10 days each in the months of January, April, July and October, as specified by the government. Additionally, a 30-day period will be specified by the central government in the year of general elections.
Analysts said the move could end up bringing in more opacity in political funding and could be misused, given the lack of disclosure requirements for individuals purchasing electoral bonds.
“There are only three new pieces of information in what was announced today: the designated bank, life of the bonds and denominations. These do not help. Electoral bonds continue to be designed to make political and electoral funding even more opaque. It will bring more and more black money into the political system,"" said Jagdeep Chhokar, founding member of the New Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)."
1081,2018-01-02,State Bank,"SBI reduces interest rates on loans linked to the base rate by 30 basis points to 8.65%

Mumbai: Loans to existing borrowers are set to get a little cheaper with the State Bank of India (SBI) reducing its base rate by 30 basis points on Monday, a move that is likely to be followed by other banks.  
Mumbai: Loans to existing borrowers are set to get a little cheaper with the State Bank of India (SBI) reducing its base rate by 30 basis points on Monday, a move that is likely to be followed by other banks. 
The move is also unlikely to benefit new borrowers whose loan rates are linked to the so-called marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR). One basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
SBI’s revised base rate now stands at 8.65%. The lender has kept MCLR for January unchanged at 7.70-8.10%.
After the base rate cut, for a home loan of Rs30 lakh with a 20-year tenure, the equated monthly instalment (EMI) will come down to Rs877 per lakh from Rs897 per lakh.
“The 25 basis point reduction in retail term deposit rates in November gave us room to reduce base rate,"" said P.K. Gupta, managing director at SBI. He added that the base rate reduction is expected to benefit eight million customers, most of whom are home loan borrowers.
Since April 2016, banks have moved to the MCLR system as the base rate regime was found to be rigid and weak in terms of passing on rate cuts effected by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Though some borrowers have migrated to MCLR, many, especially in the retail segment, continue to use the base rate, banking analysts said.
“Usually, whenever SBI reviews lending rates, we have other banks, especially private sector and larger public sector ones following the direction. Around 30-40% loans in the industry are still linked to base rate. If other lenders don’t cut the base rate, borrowers may opt for MCLR,"" said Udit Kariwala, a senior analyst at India Ratings and Research.
Many borrowers have already moved to MCLR, countered Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities.
The impact of SBI’s move will be “small"", he added.
Indeed, lending rates are unlikely to trend downward unless there is a sharp revival in credit growth and higher loan volumes make up for lower rates. Deposit rates, too, have to come down to facilitate lower lending rates.
“The way government bond yields have moved and the fact that policy rate is not expected to come down because of inflation worries, I think the ability of banks to cut loan rates at this point of time looks constrained. Additionally, for banks to cut loan rates, reduction in deposit rate is required. This again looks unlikely because systemic liquidity has dried up,"" said Rajiv Anand, executive director, retail banking, at Axis Bank.
Retail inflation surged to a 15-month high of 4.88% in November. Rising oil prices and fears that the government may breach its fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of gross domestic product has prompted analysts to predict that RBI will hold interest rates for the rest of this financial year.
SBI’s move to cut the base rate comes at a time when a committee set up by RBI in October recommended linking bank lending rates to a market benchmark in a bid to hasten monetary policy transmission as well improve transparency in rate setting by lenders.
The panel, headed by Janak Raj, principal adviser, monetary policy department, recommended that all floating rate loans advanced from April be referenced to one of three external benchmarks—a risk-free curve involving rates on treasury bills, certificate of deposits rates or the central bank’s policy rate.
The panel pulled up banks for “arbitrariness"" in calculating the base rate and MCLR, the two existing benchmarks to which retail lending rates such as car loan and home loan rates are fixed. The spreads charged over these internal benchmarks “has undermined the integrity of the interest rate setting process"", it said."

1070,2018-01-09,State Bank,"SBI says the proposed bond raising programme aims at funding infrastructure and affordable housing

New Delhi: Country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday said it proposes to raise Rs5,000 crore through long term bonds to fund affordable housing. 
New Delhi: Country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday said it proposes to raise Rs5,000 crore through long term bonds to fund affordable housing.
The proposed bond raising programme aims at funding infrastructure and affordable housing, SBI said in a filing to stock exchanges.
The bank will seek approval of the board for issuance of long term bonds of Rs5,000 crore for financing of infrastructure and affordable housing in domestic and overseas market, it said.
The bank, however, did not specify whether the borrowing would be in rupee denomination or dollar. The executive committee of the central board is scheduled to have a meeting on 17 January, it added.
Yesterday, the bank announced plans to raise up to $2 billion (over Rs12,600 crore) by issuing bonds in US dollar or other convertible currency over two fiscals to fund overseas expansion.
It said the fund-raising will take place through a public offer and/or private placement of senior unsecured notes in US Dollar or any other convertible currency during 2017-18 and 2018-19.
Last month, the bank’s board had approved raising Rs8,000 crore through various sources, including masala bonds, to meet Basel III capital norms.
Masala bonds are rupee denominated specialised debt instruments that can be floated in overseas markets only to raise capital. The bank said it has time till March 2018 to raise the funds. Banks in India have to comply with the global capital norms under Basel III by March 2019. Internationally agreed time frame for the same is January 2019."
1072,2018-01-09,State Bank,"NCLT also accepted the appointment of Navneet Kumar Gupta as the new interim resolution professional for Bhushan Energy in place of Sawant Goliawala, partner Deloitte

New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Monday admitted State Bank of India’s plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against Bhushan Energy Ltd. 
New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Monday admitted State Bank of India’s plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against Bhushan Energy Ltd.
The total amount in default as on 31 October was around Rs494 crore, the SBI petition said. 
NCLT also accepted the appointment of Navneet Kumar Gupta as the new interim resolution professional (IRP) in place of Sawant Goliawala, partner Deloitte.
“In any case there is any violation, the IRP would be at liberty to make appropriate application to this tribunal with a prayer for passing an appropriate order,"" the order passed by the tribunal on Monday said.
In December, the NCLT bench had asked SBI to consider the appointment of a new IRP after Bhushan Energy objected to appointing Goliawala citing conflict of interest.
Insolvency code requires a high degree of independence and integrity, Bhushan Energy had pleaded. Since Deloitte was also involved in a tariff negotiation between Bhushan Steel and Bhushan Energy, Bhushan Energy had expressed its apprehension with respect to Goliawala’s neutrality. The IRP, in such a scenario, would not be free of ‘external and professional influence’ as the partners have pecuniary interest in the matter, Bhushan Energy had said.
Bhushan Energy had earlier objected to the insolvency proceedings initiated by SBI, calling it “premature"".
“The possibility of resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code widened up as a large number of players may apply with much more ambitious and varieties of resolution plans… Therefore, it is not possible to accept that the aforesaid argument that the petition is in anyway premature,"" the order said. 
Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, debtors and creditors must agree to a time-bound resolution of debt to avoid insolvency.
Incorporated in 2005, Bhushan Energy is based in Dhenkanal, Odisha. It is a subsidiary of Bhushan Steel which is one of the 12 NPA accounts notified by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this year. Bhushan Steel has a gross debt of over Rs42,000 crore."
1075,2018-01-09,State Bank,"SBI says it is in the process of reviewing the requirement for minimum balance in savings account and the charges applicable for non-maintenance, and will soon make the announcement

Mumbai:  State Bank of India (SBI) is in the process of comprehensively reviewing the requirement for minimum balance in savings account and the charges applicable for non-maintenance, and will soon make the announcement, said managing director Praveen Kumar Gupta. 
Mumbai:  State Bank of India (SBI) is in the process of comprehensively reviewing the requirement for minimum balance in savings account and the charges applicable for non-maintenance, and will soon make the announcement, said managing director Praveen Kumar Gupta.
“That is something we have been looking at continuously. As I said, we brought it back in April and we reviewed in October, now also we are in the process of reviewing it,"" Gupta said at the sidelines of an event on Friday.
When asked if reduction of monthly average balance (MAB) is on the cards, Gupta said SBI has got some feedback on the same and the bank will take a view on the same in the review.
In April 2017, SBI had re-introduced the requirement for maintenance monthly average balance and penalties for non-maintenance after six years. The MAB for accounts from metro areas was set at Rs5,000 and those from urban areas at Rs3,000.
The bank collected Rs1,771.67 crore from customers on account of non-maintenance of minimum average balance between April and November 2017, according to finance ministry’s answer in Lok Sabha on 29 December.
SBI has around 420 million savings bank accounts, of which around 130 million are exempted from MAB requirement. Exempted accounts are those related to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, basic savings bank deposit account, and pensioners and minor accounts, among others.
The bank subsequently lowered the MAB following criticism from the customers. Effective October, MAB for accounts in metro and urban MAB was revised to Rs3,000. It also slashed charges from 20-50% for non-maintenance of MAB across all population groups and categories. Accordingly, charges for semi-urban and rural centres were in the range of Rs20-40 and for urban and metro centres Rs30-50."

New Delhi: Country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) expects financial bidding process for resolution of 12 big stressed accounts to be over by the end of this month, said the bank’s top official.
SBI is the lead banker in 6 out of 12 large non performing assets (NPAs) with total outstanding loan of Rs1.75 trillion. “Financial bids of Electrosteel and Monnet Ispat have already come. We hope to receive bids for remaining cases during this month itself,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar told PTI.
Other cases which are pending before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) are Essar Steel, Bhushan Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel, Lanco Infra, Alok Industries, Amtek Auto, Era Infra, Jaypee Infratech, ABG Shipyard and Jyoti Structures. 
RBI’s internal advisory committee (IAC) in June identified 12 accounts, each having more than Rs5,000 crore of outstanding loans and accounting for 25% of total NPAs of banks. NPAs of public sector banks have increased to Rs7.33 trillion as of June 2017, from Rs2.78 trillion in March 2015. 
Besides, RBI also came out with 28 large stressed accounts in the second list. In August, RBI had asked banks to either resolve these stressed accounts or refer them to NCLT by 31 December. As part of the second list, bankers decided to take all cases but Anrak Aluminium, Jayaswal Neco Industries, Soma Enterprises and Jaiprakash Associates for resolution.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it would decide at a later stage the application of RBI seeking its nod to file insolvency proceedings before NCLT against the promoter company Jaiprakash Associate Limited (JAL).
The apex court directed realtor JAL to give details of its ongoing housing projects in the entire country while reiterating its direction that its directors shall not alienate their personal properties. A bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra also directed amicus curie Pawan Shree Agrawal to set up a portal to take note of the grievances of the home buyers of JAL.
IBC has defined a time-frame for the resolution and there is a 14-day time period for admission or rejection of a case by NCLT. After a case is accepted by NCLT, the creditor gets 30 days to hire insolvency practitioners and then the entire process is to be completed in 180 days which takes into account various possibilities including revival of projects or liquidation."

New Delhi: ICICI Bank on Tuesday moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Essar Power Jharkhand Ltd for recovery of a default amount of over Rs3,068 crore as of 15 December 2017. 
The bank had dispersed a principal amount of Rs3,033 crore as loan to Essar Power Jharkhand and a notice for recovery was served on 1 August 2016. A bench comprising Chief Justice M.M. Kumar and justice S.K. Mohapatra issued a notice to Essar Power Jharkhand in the matter. 
“Essar Power Jharkhand Ltd is the only incomplete project in Essar Power Ltd’s portfolio, and was setting up a 1,200 MW thermal power project in Jharkhand state.

According to two persons aware of the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, IDBI Bank and State Bank of India (SBI) have now approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
The background to the development is as follows: Banks, including IDBI Bank and SBI, had lent money to some companies in the Rajasthan-based Binani group, after Binani Cement issued corporate guarantees worth Rs2,000 crore for these loans. Now, Binani Cement itself has landed in bankruptcy court after defaulting on various loans, even though the subsidiaries continue to be healthy. 
However, with the guarantor undergoing insolvency proceedings, creditors to the subsidiaries want Binani Cement to pay them the amount equal to the corporate guarantees. The IRP rejected their claim, on the grounds that these were corporate guarantees, not loans, and that the guarantees were not invoked until bankruptcy proceedings began.
NCLAT is expected to hear the matter in the third week of January, the people cited earlier said.
“The said corporate guarantees were given by Binani Cement for some of the group subsidiaries in India and overseas,"" said one of the two persons. “This is a unique situation because the subsidiaries in question continue to remain standard accounts, while the guarantor itself has become an NPA and is facing insolvency proceedings,"" the person added.
In July, the NCLT’s (National Company Law Tribunal) Kolkata bench had admitted the insolvency petition against Binani Cement. Bank of Baroda (BoB) had referred the company to the NCLT after it failed to repay around Rs100 crore, following which Vijaykumar V. Iyer of Deloitte India was appointed as the IRP. In total, the company owes close to Rs3,042.93 crore to a consortium of lenders. Currently, Edelweiss ARC, which has bought over a chunk of the debt from bankers, is the leader of the consortium.
Requests for comment sent to Iyer, IDBI Bank and SBI remained unanswered until press time. An email sent to Edelweiss group was also not answered.
“Apart from two IDBI and SBI other lenders, Exim Bank of India also holds guarantees from the company,"" the second person said. However, it was not immediately clear whether Exim Bank had also moved the NCLAT in this regard. Requests for comment sent to Exim Bank remained unanswered till press time.
According to both persons cited above, the decision by the Kolkata bench of NCLT in Binani Cement’s case was guided by a previous order from the NCLT’s New Delhi bench in a separate but similar manner. 
In that case, the bench had dismissed Axis Bank’s plea to stake a claim of Rs397 crore in the ongoing corporate insolvency proceedings against EduSmart Services. EduSmart was a corporate guarantor for its parent company Educomp Solutions, which had borrowed from Axis Bank. 
Axis Bank had filed a plea in NCLT’s Delhi bench after Educomp’s resolution professional rejected the bank’s claim filed under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). “Axis Bank also has approached the NCLAT in this regard,"" said the first person. 
An email sent to Axis Bank by Mint remained unanswered. Meanwhile, according to a report in DNA, the deadline for bidding for Binani Cement has been extended from 5 January to 15 January. The report said Binani Cement has received initial interest from 22 potential bidders. 
Binani Cement is part of the Braj Binani Group and is a subsidiary of Binani Industries Limited (BIL), which is the holding company of the group, and which has presence in five key businesses areas including cement, fibreglass, infrastructure and energy."
1066,2018-01-15,State Bank,"Sharadindu on regulator's plan to open up government NPS to private sector pension fund managers, how a delay in getting fresh licences impacts fund managers, and more

SBI Pension Funds Pvt. Ltd is the largest pension fund manager with an asset under management of nearly Rs85,000 crore that includes both the government and private sector. SBI Pension Fund, along with two other public sector pension fund managers, is also entrusted with the responsibility to manage the government sector corpus of the National Pension System (NPS). But that’s going to change as the regulator is looking to open up government NPS to the private sector pension fund managers as well. Kumar Sharadindu, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Pension Funds talks to Mint Money on the impact of this decision and also how a delay in getting fresh licences impacts fund managers. 
SBI Pension Funds Pvt. Ltd is the largest pension fund manager with an asset under management of nearly Rs85,000 crore that includes both the government and private sector. SBI Pension Fund, along with two other public sector pension fund managers, is also entrusted with the responsibility to manage the government sector corpus of the National Pension System (NPS). But that’s going to change as the regulator is looking to open up government NPS to the private sector pension fund managers as well. Kumar Sharadindu, managing director and chief executive officer of SBI Pension Funds talks to Mint Money on the impact of this decision and also how a delay in getting fresh licences impacts fund managers.
The auction for new fund managers was held in 2016 but the fund managers are yet to get fresh licences. How does this impact the fund managers? 
The existing licences of pension fund managers were valid till November (2017). These have lapsed, but as per the clause in the earlier RFP (request for proposal), the licences are valid until the regulator agrees on new licences. So we continue to operate under existing norms, which means we continue to charge a fund management fee of 0.01%, which is unsustainable. Also, half of this is paid to the regulator as annual fee. Unlike the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which caps the annual fees, there is no such cap in the pension sector. This puts further pressure on pension fund managers.
We are now given to understand that the regulator is in talks with the Ministry of Finance to sort out some issues and clarify on the foreign direct investment (FDI) norms. But if you look at Irdai (Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India), it issued clear guidelines on FDI internally without seeking government’s approval. The pension sector could also have done the same.
Hopefully we will get clarity on the matter soon. I am not sure what steps PFRDA (Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority) will take to issue fresh licences. We are yet to be informed.
A common gripe of pension fund managers is that the charge of 0.01% is unsustainable. But when the auction was held in 2016 with a maximum ceiling fixed at 0.1%, you bid the lowest fund management fee at 0.07%. So is 0.07% sustainable? 
The whole idea of a low-cost pension scheme is predicated on economies of scale. And we have been able to achieve scale. We manage close to Rs84,680 crore of assets although the majority of it is from the government sector. But even then, at a charge of 0.07%, I feel confident that we will be able to break even in a year’s time and perhaps even make operating profits. We are the largest pension fund manager and I feel 0.07% charge is sustainable for the private sector. It’s not a huge ask to raise it from the existing fund management charge of 0.01%. We need to invest in infrastructure, compliance, governance and skill-sets and for that we need to be in operating profits.
We have been in the business for the last 10 years and despite being the largest, we have operating losses. Despite the constraints, we have delivered good returns. But we need to keep performing like this with enhanced resources, and at this point, I feel it is not being appreciated enough. Though the chairman of PFRDA has admitted that pension fund managers can’t go on making losses, as eventually it will come at the cost of subscribers. There is a notion that only equity funds need to be managed actively. The bulk of our investments is in government and corporate bonds and they also need to be managed actively. The amount of tracking required in bonds is huge and for that one needs to invest in infrastructure and skills.
You, along with two other public sector pension fund managers, also manage the government NPS corpus, which is huge and also gives you economy of scale. But now it’s expected that the government sector will be opened to private sector fund managers and government employees will be able to choose from them. How are you bracing for this?
More competition is always welcome, but you need to understand that it was not the public sector pension fund managers who decided to manage the government NPS corpus exclusively. The government asked for that. And over the last 10 years, pension fund managers have invested money in infrastructure. So the question is, how do you compensate the public sector pension fund managers for all the money that’s been invested?
It would be better if the rules are applied prospectively. So the existing corpus continues to be managed as is. Currently, the employees don’t get to decide their pension fund manager; the rules have been laid out for the percentage allocation to each fund manager as well as the asset allocation. It will be better to leave the existing corpus as it is and open up choice for future contributions. If employees are allowed to choose the pension fund managers for their existing corpus, it will be a disaster owing to low liquidity in the bond market. Bulk redemptions to switch pension fund managers will make the three pension fund managers sell large quantities, thereby getting very low (distress) prices. Hence, large redemptions will cause huge losses to the employees deciding to remain.
Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) charge much lower than the current fund management cost of NPS. Doesn’t this in some way make NPS less attractive?
But where is the comparison or the competition? ETFs are investment products, primarily with equity as the underlying security, and are subject to performance of only the share market. 
Depending on the purpose of investment, one can invest into various financial products, including retirement products. So, yes, in that sense, it’s a complimentary product. 
NPS is purely a retirement product. The product design enables you to save for the long term and also choose an asset allocation. ETFs, being equity-based products, are high-risk products. But under NPS, the risk of equity investment is counterbalanced by debt funds. The expectation of someone investing for retirement is, safety of capital with a decent return, and NPS fulfils that expectation.
Don’t you think that the multiplicity of costs in NPS confuses subscribers? There are other market-linked products, like mutual funds, that have one expense ratio that subsumes all costs.
The architecture of NPS has multiple stakeholders with specific functions and each of them has a specified cost structure. Because of multiple stakeholders and the specified roles they play, I don’t think it’s possible to have one expense ratio. Also, unlike an asset management company that’s at the helm and is responsible for paying various entities, there is no one at the helm in the architecture of NPS. Having said that, it’s important to note that the additional costs are mainly fixed costs and make only a marginal difference. 
At a time when eNPS is becoming popular, is there any merit in increasing NPS distribution cost from Rs125 to Rs200 for on-boarding, and also add a persistency charge to it?
eNPS is a great initiative for the do-it-yourself population, which is largely confined to urban areas. But NPS is meant for all, and there are many who prefer face-to-face interaction or don’t have the means to be online. The hike is incremental. At Rs200 the idea is to make sure that distributors don’t make losses and remain interested in the job."
1065,2018-01-16,State Bank,"Following the implementation of RERA, there is more regulatory control and a stable view on cash flows, SBI chief general manager Vaijinath M.G., who heads the bank's real estate and housing business unit

Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) is bullish about lending to residential housing developers as it expects the new real estate law to spark growth in the sector, a senior bank official said. 
Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) is bullish about lending to residential housing developers as it expects the new real estate law to spark growth in the sector, a senior bank official said.
Following the implementation of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, (RERA), there is more regulatory control and a stable view on cash flows, said SBI chief general manager Vaijinath M.G., who heads the bank’s real estate and housing business unit.
“More and more balance sheets of real estate developers (residential properties) are expected to become fundable in the days to come. For SBI, that is an opportunity area for credit growth and we are well set within the bank to take up this business,"" Vaijinath said.
The real estate and housing business unit comes under SBI’s home loan vertical, given the synergies in this business, he said. At the end of September, SBI had an outstanding home loan portfolio of Rs2.9 trillion, the largest in India.
Apart from developing new loan products and opening a help desk for builders, SBI has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations Of India (CREDAI), and a Maharashtra government-owned body for funding projects by the state slum rehabilitation authority, he said.
“Earlier, even if we wanted to lend, a lot of builders were ineligible because there was lack of transparency on the usage of funds, approvals and compliances and completion time,"" he said.
With greater predictability in project completion, SBI is keen on financing affordable housing projects, which are in high demand. He added that unlike earlier when developers would build keeping investment potential of houses in mind, most home buyers now are end-users. Accordingly, builders are re-orienting themselves towards this category.  
The exuberance of acquiring land and moving money across projects is a thing of past, said Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras. “With RERA, they have to maintain an escrow account and use the funds for construction purpose only. Additionally, the current market is of buyers who are also end users. Both these factors are comforting as far as lending is concerned. Post-RERA, market has stabilized to a large extent, and this has created a level-playing field for banks to lend,"" Kapoor said.
According to SBI’s Vaijinath, the fact that borrowers are end users of houses is positive for the bank’s asset quality. “Home loan delinquencies are already very low because there is greater willingness to repay as the borrowers fear that the default may result in them losing the house. Nearly 90% of our home loan borrowers are first-time buyers,"" he said."
1064,2018-01-17,State Bank,"SBI says its board has approved a plan to raise Rs20,000 crore for financing affordable housing and infrastructure projects through long-term bonds

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday said its board has given nod to raise Rs20,000 crore for financing affordable housing and infrastructure projects through long- term bonds. 
New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday said its board has given nod to raise Rs20,000 crore for financing affordable housing and infrastructure projects through long- term bonds.
“The executive committee of the Central Board in its meeting held today has inter alia approved, the proposal for issuance of long term bonds of Rs20,000 crore for financing of infrastructure and affordable housing in domestic and overseas market in FY 2017-18 and FY 2018-19,"" the country’s largest bank said in a BSE filing.
The bank did not specify whether the borrowing would be in rupee denomination or foreign currency. 
Earlier this month, SBI had announced plans to raise up to $2 billion by issuing bonds in the US dollar or other convertible currency to fund overseas expansion. It had said that the fundraising would take place through a public offer and/or private placement of senior unsecured notes in US dollar or any other convertible currency during 2017-18 and 2018-19.
Shares of State Bank of India (SBI) closed 3.44% higher at Rs306.35 apiece on BSE on Wednesday. 
Although the real estate sector is facing multi-year slowdown, the affordable housing segment has gained momentum after the government provided infrastructure to it in the last year’s budget.
The government is also providing interest subsidy to buyers on the low cost homes under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. Recently, HDFC Capital Advisors, an arm of mortgage leader HDFC, closed its second affordable housing fund, creating a $1 billion corpus."

Mumbai: In a surprise move, the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, which has been facing earning pressure in the past quarters, on Wednesday hiked its lending rates by a marginal 0.05 percentage points. 
Mumbai: In a surprise move, the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, which has been facing earning pressure in the past quarters, on Wednesday hiked its lending rates by a marginal 0.05 percentage points.
The move to increase the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) comes days after the nation’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) had lowered its rates under the older base rate system by a steep 0.30 percentage points.
“The bank has decided to increase the MCLRs by 0.05 percentage points across all tenors,"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing late in the evening.
The hike is effective from Thursday, the bank added. The one-year MCLR, at which rate its home loans and other important products are priced, will now stand at 8.30%, the bank said. The lender, which has been witnessing mounting asset quality and bottom-line pressures for the past many quarters, however, did not give any rationale for the move.
The rate action comes amid a hardening of bond yields over the past few months, which is bound to make banks report huge mark-to-market losses, which domestic rating Icra had pegged at around Rs15,000 crore in the December quarter.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also virtually told the banks that it would not allow any special dispensation to safeguard their bottom lines. The MCLR replaced the earlier base rate system in April 2016, to better translate policy actions and cost of funding faster into the pricing of loans. 
Banks calculate the rate on a pre-disclosed formula and rates are reviewed on a monthly basis. It can be noted that there have been deposit rate hikes by a few lenders in select tenors. Also, the review comes amid a virtual doubling in the credit growth to the double digit figure after a dull FY17. 
At its September quarter earnings, the bank had reported a slippage in its net interest margin to 3.45%, affirmed that was in line with the guidance of a 0.20% compression given earlier."
1062,2018-01-18,State Bank,"SBI is of the view that resolution at NCLT will fetch a better valuation for these assets

Mumbai: Several large public sector banks have sold their bad loans to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), but State Bank of India (SBI), the largest of them all, would rather settle them in the bankruptcy court. SBI, the lead bank in a majority of big cases referred to insolvency courts, is of the view that the resolution process at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will fetch a better valuation for these assets. 
Mumbai: Several large public sector banks have sold their bad loans to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), but State Bank of India (SBI), the largest of them all, would rather settle them in the bankruptcy court. SBI, the lead bank in a majority of big cases referred to insolvency courts, is of the view that the resolution process at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will fetch a better valuation for these assets.
“We are not looking to sell assets which are under NCLT to ARCs outside the resolution process,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said. Earlier this month, Union Bank of India and Bank of Baroda (BoB) put up about Rs16,270 crore worth of loans, including those of Bhushan Steel Ltd and Essar Steel Ltd, for sale to ARCs. Both steel companies are in the Reserve Bank of India’s first list of 12 cases undergoing insolvency proceedings. In December, BoB had also sold its foreign currency loan exposure in Essar Steel to foreign funds.  
Recently, Indian Overseas Bank too sold its exposure of Rs1,600 crore in Essar Steel and Rs600 crore in Bhushan Steel to Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd and Assets Care and Reconstruction Enterprise Ltd, respectively. Union Bank and BoB spokespersons did not respond to emails seeking comment.
According to an SBI official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the bank is also worried about the consequences of a change in composition of committee of creditors following the loan sale. When an ARC buys a troubled company’s debt from various lenders, its representation goes up in the creditors’ committee. SBI, this official said, believes this could lead to differences of opinion on issues such as interim financing, and make it difficult to get three-fourth of the lenders to agree to any resolution plan, as required under IBC.
“ARCs per se coming in as a part of committee or creditors will not be a challenge. But if their assumption is different from that of a lender, then there could be hiccups in the resolution process. Also, unlike banks, ARCs don’t have to make provisions against the asset identified by the RBI for IBC process,"" said Udit Kariwala, senior analyst, India Ratings and Research. 
“The IBC process ensures preservation of assets. By selling loans to ARC, banks are only looking at short-term profitability,"" the SBI official cited earlier said. “But most deals happen under the 15:85 rule, where very little cash is paid upfront and banks have to provide for security receipts. So, where is the profit?"" he asked.
 Under the 15:85 rule, ARCs are required to pay banks minimum 15% of the sale value of the asset upfront, while issuing security receipts for the remaining amount. According to the same official, in the case of Jai Balaji Industries, banks like Allahabad Bank and UCO Bank sold their exposure to ARCs at a discount of 63%. The deal happened under the 15:85 rule, where the ARCs gave only 15% of the net asset value as upfront cash and issued security receipts for the rest.
Many banks want to sell their bad loans to ARCs to clean up their books and avoid prompt corrective action (PCA) being invoked by the Reserve Bank of India against them. 
“31st March is a crucial deadline for us. We have to sell some of these assets if we have to avoid potential PCA by the RBI,"" said a senior bank official at Union Bank of India. Under RBI’s new PCA framework, breaching a net non-performing assets (NPA) ratio of 6% invites action, including limits on lending and expansion. 
At least half of the state-owned banks including Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank are currently under PCA. 
As on 30 September, Union Bank of India reported a net NPA ratio of 6.70%, while Bank of Baroda’s net NPA stood at 5.05%. 
Banks which have put these assets on sale, however, are looking at a full exit from these accounts, preferring all-cash deals. “One of the reasons why we do this is to get what we are intending to get. Second, we would be selling these to the maximum extent possible on cash terms. Third, it will release some blocked funds so that we can release and recycle them. The ARC will step into our shoes and then, as far as we are concerned, we are out,"" said senior banker of a leading public sector bank when asked about SBI being concerned about the sale of loans."

Kolkata: Private life insurance company SBI Life Insurance on Thursday announced the launch of a term policy with critical illness cover for 36 diseases.

Mumbai: Shares of state-run banks plunged on Thursday as investors showed their disappointment with the government’s plan to infuse Rs88,000 crore as part of its recapitalisation package for lenders. 
Mumbai: Shares of state-run banks plunged on Thursday as investors showed their disappointment with the government’s plan to infuse Rs88,000 crore as part of its recapitalisation package for lenders.
The Nifty PSU Bank index fell 5.24%, while benchmark indices Nifty and Sensex declined marginally. Among state-run banks, Indian Bank, Bank of Baroda, Union Bank of India, State Bank of India, and Punjab National Bank lost 5-7% during the day.
Analysts said that the bank-wise split of capital infusion belied expectations, leading to heavy selling of PSU bank stocks. 
While the capital infusion is overall positive for the banking sector, it is not exactly in tune with expectations, Jefferies India said. Out of the total money allocated, weaker banks that are under Reserve Bank of India’s prompt corrective action will receive Rs52,300 crore while the more healthier ones will receive the balance which is in contrast with market expectations of bigger and healthier banks receiving a higher share of capital.
“While this may be beneficial for smaller banks which perhaps rarely undertook appropriate due diligence, we worry if such a measure increases sector-specific concentration risks among larger banks, which is essentially one of the precursors of the current asset quality cycle,"" the research firm said in a 25 January note.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, there was a fair amount of speculation since the capital announcement that the government could look to change the functioning of banks in a serious manner when it announced the modalities of capital infusion and beneficiaries. But there was nothing meaningful in the presentation that was released on Wednesday.
“There seems to be only one quantitative restriction where banks have been asked to have at least 10% exposure in any consortium loans. Most of the other conditions laid are a lot more qualitative in nature or a shift in focus towards retail, agriculture or MSME segments,"" it said in a note on 25 January. 
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the announced capital programme to reduce the net non-performing loans (NPLs) by 30% for these banks, which can minimize the difference between reported and adjusted book values.
Though Morgan Stanley expects small banks to do well in the near term given the quantum of capital, yet it feels a return to normalised return on equity (RoE) will take a long time. “This is a good allocation of capital, in our view, as it provides higher amounts of capital to banks with weaker capital and profitability. This should allow these banks to make proper provisions on their bad loans, helping to clear system asset quality. The allocation is skewed towards weaker banks and should help them meet a material portion of uncovered NPLs,"" it added. 
Measures from the Indian government to boost corporate governance in public sector banks aren’t enough to address their fundamental weaknesses and bring about structural improvements, Moody’s said in a report. “We currently do not believe these reforms are meaningful enough to address the structural corporate governance issues facing these entities,"" said Srikanth Vadlamani, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service. 
Fitch Ratings, which has a negative outlook on Indian banks, said that the government’s package should help in part to mitigate the risks that Indian state-run banks face on account of weak asset quality and poor earnings, but unwinding of these risks will take some time, implying that resolution of bad assets and continued high credit costs will hinder the sector’s near-term performance. The rating agency, however, added that it may revise the outlook on Indian banks this year to stable once the government begins infusing the funds."

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) will invite new bids to select interim resolution professionals (IRP) for Videocon Industries Ltd and Videocon Telecommunications Ltd, three people aware of the development said. 
In the last week of December, SBI, the lead lender for both companies, had chosen Alvarez & Marsal, as the IRP. The two companies were in the Reserve Bank of India’s second list of defaulters against whom banks were directed to file insolvency petitions if they couldn’t finalize resolution plans by 31 December. 
SBI, India’s largest lender, initiated insolvency proceedings against the two companies earlier this month. The National Company Law Tribunal has not yet admitted the petitions.
“The consultancy firms who participated in the bidding process earlier had taken up the issue of lack of transparency with SBI, as many had quoted a lower price and had more personnel to deploy to undertake the resolution process,"" the first of the three persons said on condition of anonymity, as his firm is keen on participating in the next round of bidding.  
Questions emailed to SBI were not answered. The bank is in silent period ahead of its quarterly results announcement. 
While a company is undergoing resolution, the powers of its board are suspended. The financial creditor who initiates the insolvency resolution process files an application proposing the appointment of an interim resolution professional. This person becomes the interim professional agency if no disciplinary proceedings are pending against him. The IRP must collect financial information about the firm, form a panel of creditors, collate claims from creditors, and manage the company’s operations until the committee of creditors appoints a resolution professional. 
An email sent to Alvarez & Marsal did not elicit any response. Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot said he was not aware of the development.  
SBI had invited the bids for selecting the IRP in the last week of December. On 1 January, Business Standard reported that the selection of Alvarez & Marsal had displeased other audit firms who claimed to have submitted lower bids. 
According to the second person, SBI has formed an internal committee to address the concerns around the process through which Alvarez & Marsal was selected as IRP. The committee has invited consultancy firms including the “Big Four"" to understand their grievances and take suggestions, this person said. 
“SBI had set up a panel internally to look into the matter. They called us for questioning as well. Fresh round of bidding will be held but so far, the date has not been notified,"" he said."

Kolkata: The State Bank of India, through its subsidiary SBI Cards & Payments Services Pvt Ltd, will offer credit cards to farmers across the country, a senior company official said on Tuesday. 
Kolkata: The State Bank of India, through its subsidiary SBI Cards & Payments Services Pvt Ltd, will offer credit cards to farmers across the country, a senior company official said on Tuesday.
The project has been initiated on a pilot basis in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, and depending on the success of the pilot run, it will be launched nationally, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said. Around 100 applications for such credit cards had already been received, he added.
Unlike the Kisan Credit Card (KCC), the new credit cards for the farmers will have a credit limit with a credit period of 45 days. Currently, under KCC, beneficiaries (farmers) maintain loan accounts with the banks and the lenders offer them debit cards against this account. 
Kumar said significantly lower interest penalty will be levied on farmers who default on the 45 day credit period, unlike in case of usual credit cards.
He said the farmers could also use the new credit cards to buy non-agricultural goods. “There will be some limits within that credit card,"" Kumar said, adding that around 75-80% limit could be for buying agricultural inputs.
Kumar was in Kolkata to launch mobile shopping app “FarmCart"" and delivery management app “Dealer bandhu"" by Mumbai-based start-up Poorti Agri Services Pvt Ltd, led by N Balasubramanian, former chairman of Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI).
Poorti or Platform for Online Ordering & Rural Transformation of India was officially launched on Tuesday starting with West Bengal as the first state. The initiative will be next introduced to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana."
1057,2018-01-30,State Bank,"SBI Life Insurance's Q3 total income rises to Rs9,720 crore against Rs6,060 crore in the year-ago period

New Delhi: SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd on Tuesday reported 21% rise in its net profit at Rs230.28 crore for the third quarter ended December 2017 on healthy premium income. The company had registered a net profit of Rs190.43 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal 2016-17.  
New Delhi: SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd on Tuesday reported 21% rise in its net profit at Rs230.28 crore for the third quarter ended December 2017 on healthy premium income. The company had registered a net profit of Rs190.43 crore in the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal 2016-17. 
Total income of the life insurer increased to Rs9,720 crore during the quarter against Rs6,060 crore in the same period of the previous fiscal, SBI Life said in a regulatory filing. The net premium income of the company grew nearly 30% to Rs6,780 crore in the October-December quarter of 2017-18, from Rs5,240 crore earned in the same period of 2016-17. 
SBI Life said the increase in net premium income was primarily due to increase in retail new business premium and also due to increase in renewal premium from retail business. The assets under management (AUM) grew by 23% to Rs1,11,630 crore as on 31 December, 2017, from Rs90,720 crore on 31 December, 2016. 
Among other key parameters, the new business APE (annual premium equivalent) grew 41.9% in the third quarter of this fiscal, individual rated premium rose 38.2%, renewal premium grew 31.6% and total premium increased 29.5%. 
“For the third quarter of 2017-18, private market share and total market share in terms of individual rated premium was 24.8 per cent and 14.3%, respectively,"" SBI Life said. Solvency ratio, which is the ratio of available solvency margin to the required solvency margin, stood at 2.06% at the end of third quarter of the fiscal, against 2.09% a year ago during the same period. 
SBI Life Insurance is a joint venture between State Bank of India (SBI) and BNP Paribas Cardif SA, which has a widespread network of 814 branches across the country. The company’s stock was down 1.78% at Rs670.20 on BSE."

1052,2018-01-31,State Bank,"SBI Life Insurance trumps competition in terms of growth, it now has to shoot for quality of business by focusing on protection plans

The country’s largest private life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, reported an impressive 41.9% growth in new business premium for the quarter ended December. 
The country’s largest private life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, reported an impressive 41.9% growth in new business premium for the quarter ended December.
The growth in premiums was driven by retail individual business, the insurer said, adding that even renewal premiums have grown faster in this segment. As a result, its growth in assets under management was also higher at 23% for the nine months ended December compared with 17.6% in the corresponding period last year. 
That, along with improving persistency ratios is a sign that the insurer continues to leverage on the unparalleled access of its parent’s distribution network and that its products are not only getting sold but also held on to. But this is a given, since bancassurance contributes to more than 65% of business.
Acquisition of new business would mean an increase in costs. SBI Life’s total cost as a percentage of its new business premium increased marginally to 12.3% from 12.6%. 
Ever since insurance companies have begun getting listed on stock exchanges, investors have looked for growth potential. Analysts have given a “buy"" rating for SBI Life’s stock since the insurer’s market share has grown to 20% from 13% in the last five years. The December quarter metrics show that the insurer’s profitability has strengthened.
But what of future profitability?
An improving persistency ratio indicates that the insurer’s future growth prospects are safe. SBI Life’s persistency ratio for the 13th month rose to 81.51% from 79.81% a year ago and for the 37th month rose to 68.81% from 67.48%. However, the ratio for the 61st month plummeted to 59.48% from 69.59%. Juxtapose this with the fact that the share of market-linked products has risen to 20% of its total portfolio from just 10% a year ago and prospects for future profitability look less upbeat. 
Bullish equity markets have stoked the sales of market-linked products for most insurers and SBI Life is no exception. But sustainable profits lie in increasing traditional policies and especially protection plans. For SBI Life, traditional policies still form the lion’s share of its product portfolio and the insurer saw a growth of 18% in protection plans.
The stock ended 1.96% lower on Tuesday, even though it trades at just a little over three times its estimated embedded value for fiscal year 2019, much lower than its peers.
While SBI Life trumps competition in terms of growth, it now has to shoot for quality of business by focusing on protection plans."

Mumbai: State Bank of India’s third quarter results are due later on Friday and more than profitability, the Street is awaiting asset quality trends to seek validation whether fresh additions to bad loan category are really slowing in the sector. 
Mumbai: State Bank of India’s third quarter results are due later on Friday and more than profitability, the Street is awaiting asset quality trends to seek validation whether fresh additions to bad loan category are really slowing in the sector.
December quarter net profit is seen at Rs2,059.4 crore, according to a Bloomberg poll of 16 analysts. In the previous quarter last year, the bank reported a profit of Rs2,610 crore and Rs1,582 crore in the September quarter.
The results are not comparable from the year-ago period because SBI merged its five associate banks with effect from 1 April.
Here are four things the Street awaits clarity on.
Bad loans: 
In the fiscal first half, fresh additions to non-performing assets stood at Rs35,275 crore as compared to Rs64,719 crore in the same period year. Analysts expect slippages in the third quarter to come from the bank’s watchlist of stressed loans, which currently stands at Rs21,288 crore. In case, most slippages come from the watchlist, it will be taken positive by the Street.
Provisions: Credit costs or the percentage of provisioning against total advances is expected to rise because of fresh loan slippages and the bank’s strategy to shore up provision coverage ratio. However, provisioning related to cases referred for insolvency proceedings is not expected to lead to sharp rise in credit cost as the bank had made adequate coverage. Additionally, the Street is also taking comfort from the fact that the bank has two additional buffers—stressed standard assets provisions of Rs7,916 crore and counter-cyclical provision buffer of Rs1,250 crore.
Profitability: SBI’s bottomline is seen under pressure because of higher provisioning and lower interest income. According to analysts, while net interest income, difference between interest earned, is seen under pressure because of lower loan growth, cut in deposit rates in the third quarter is likely to be supportive. Non-interest income is also seen down because muted treasury income as yields on government bonds rose sharply in the December quarter.
Loan growth: After a period of sluggishness, system loan growth has started reviving and touched the 10% mark in December. SBI’s outlook on the loan growth trend and projection for current and next fiscal year would be keenly awaited, especially in the light of recapitalisation of public sector bank. The bank had earlier guided for 5-6% loan growth in the current fiscal. In the September quarter, the bank had printed a growth of mere 0.95% with outstanding loans at Rs18.92 trillion."
1047,2018-02-10,State Bank,"State Bank of India sets aside Rs3,400 crore as a mark-to-market provision due to rising bond yields

State Bank of India (SBI), India’s biggest lender by assets, on Friday reported a net loss of Rs2,416 crore for the fiscal third quarter after setting aside funds to cover rising bad loans and losses on its bond portfolio. 
State Bank of India (SBI), India’s biggest lender by assets, on Friday reported a net loss of Rs2,416 crore for the fiscal third quarter after setting aside funds to cover rising bad loans and losses on its bond portfolio.
It had reported a net profit of Rs1,582 crore in the September quarter. 
This was the lender’s first quarter under the chairmanship of Rajnish Kumar, who took over in October. 
In a post-results teleconference, Kumar said that in addition to provisions related to non-performing assets (NPAs), the bank kept aside Rs3,400 crore as a mark-to-market provision on account of rising bond yields. It also made a Rs700 crore provision for the next round of employee wage hikes.
The previous wage revision agreement for employees of state-owned banks expired on 31 October.
 In the December quarter, yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond rose by 66 basis points. Banks have to revalue their bond portfolio at the end of every quarter. In case the value of the securities is lower than the market rate, they are mandated to keep aside funds as mark-to-market provisioning.
The rise in bad loans was because of a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) review which revealed a divergence in reporting of gross NPAs based on fiscal 2017 results. Such divergence—the difference between RBI’s assessment and that reported by the lender—was around Rs23,239 crore at the end of March 2017.
Of the divergence, loans worth Rs2,835 had already been recognized as NPAs in the June quarter, while Rs4,338 crore was upgraded to standard category later. The remaining amount was tagged as bad loans in the three months ending December. Accordingly, total slippages rose to Rs25,836 crore, compared with Rs9,026 crore in July-September.
Kumar said 90% of the slippages had already been recognized as stressed accounts and restructured under various RBI schemes. 
Gross NPAs as a percentage of total loans stood at 10.35% as on 31 December, up from 9.83% reported in the previous quarter. 
In the third quarter, SBI made a loan loss provision of Rs17,760 crore, as compared with Rs9,662 crore a year ago. Provision coverage ratio improved to 65.92% at the end of December, from 58.96% a year ago. 
According to the bank’s management, NPA recognition has peaked and is not expected to rise here on. 
“Many of the resolutions will happen in the June quarter. I don’t want to sound very optimistic on the fourth quarter (March), and neither very pessimistic,"" Kumar said, adding that the bank is working on a strategy to capture growth opportunities. 
“Looking forward, 2019 onwards, we have certain estimates and plans to achieve a certain level of return on assets. That is what is on our horizon. Today I am sitting in February, in 45 days no miracle will happen. But we can hope for much better performance in the next (fiscal),"" he said. 
SBI expects both loan slippage ratio and credit cost, or the percentage of provisioning against total advances, to be within 2% in the next fiscal. Currently, slippage ratio stands at 4.17% and credit cost at 3.18%.
Udit Kariwala, senior analyst, financial institutions, at India Ratings, said that while fresh slippages in the banking sector are slowing, it is not the end of the asset quality pain as large pool loans are still not recognized as stressed.
“Our analysis shows that approximately Rs2 trillion of corporate loans in the banking sector can turn NPA in the next 12-18 months,"" he said.
While net interest income, or the difference between interest earned and expended, rose, a fall in non-interest income, which includes treasury gains and fee income, contributed to the loss. In the third quarter, non-interest income declined by 29.75% year-on-year to Rs8,084 crore, mainly due to lower profit on sale of investments.
SBI clocked a year-on-year loan growth of 2.52%, supported by growth in retail products such as home and auto loans, and also by credit to small and medium enterprises. Outstanding loans as on 31 December stood at Rs19.24 trillion. 
Kumar said that with an economic revival underway, SBI is targeting a loan growth of 10.3% in the next financial year. To support such growth, the bank plans to raise Rs20,000 crore in 2018-19.
According to Ashutosh Mishra, banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd, there will be some negative reaction to SBI’s stock in the next few sessions as such a large divergence was not expected. 
“But overall, it reflects that crystallization of stressed assets on the balance sheet and profit & loss account has taken place and things should improve from the next financial year,"" he said."
1046,2018-02-10,State Bank,"State Bank of India, the country's largest lender, reported fresh slippages of a staggering Rs25,836 crore in the December quarter

The economy’s weak health is holding back its financiers and worse, not letting their old wounds heal quickly either. That is the sobering message from the quarterly results of the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI). 
The economy’s weak health is holding back its financiers and worse, not letting their old wounds heal quickly either. That is the sobering message from the quarterly results of the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI).
SBI reported a loss of Rs2,416 crore for the December quarter, its first ever as a stand-alone entity. The largest lender reported fresh slippages of a staggering Rs25,836 crore, taking it back to its arguably weakest quarter of December 2016.
The slippages soared also because the lender and the regulator had a difference of opinion over what assets should be labelled bad.
The divergence in bad loans in SBI’s case was a colossal Rs23,239 crore that made its fiscal year 2017 (FY17) look uglier than before. About 19% of this divergence has been upgraded since then, the management said. The rest are languishing as non-performing assets.
In a nutshell, existing defaulters are barely showing signs of getting healthy while new borrowers have also begun defaulting.
Consequently, SBI had to make higher provisions, which it did. The resultant total loan loss provisioning of Rs17,760 crore dragged the lender into a loss.
Considering the dreary loan market, interest income was bound to be low but there was no help from non-interest income either. Hostile bond markets hit SBI’s portfolio and it had to take a mark-to-market hit of Rs3,400 crore.
It gets worse.
Despite the year-ago period being hit by demonetization, SBI’s loan book grew by an embarrassing 2.88%. If one adds its investments into corporate bonds and commercial papers, the growth picks up to 4.18%. This goes against the emerging narrative that loan growth is finally picking up.
All this now brings us to the key question: will it get better from here?
While the SBI management sounded sanguine on future asset quality and loan growth, it was far from convincing.
Chairman Rajnish Kumar said that one cannot be overly optimistic about the next quarter. However, he added that FY19 would be far better, of course with the helping hand of the government’s initiatives announced in the budget.
SBI is pinning all its hopes on a friendly resolution of the bad loan pile referred to the courts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The lender’s exposure is roughly Rs78,000 crore and it has provided for 60% of the amount. If it stares at larger haircuts from court rulings, SBI will get hit further.
After the cliffhanger final quarter for the current fiscal year, clarity will emerge on the resolution as deadlines are after April. For the sake of SBI and the economy, the resolution process should not leave them nursing fresh wounds.

New Delhi: Shares of State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday slumped more than 3% in morning trade on the bourses after the company reported weak third quarter results. 
The SBI Group on Friday reported a massive Rs1,886.57 crore net loss for the December quarter of the current fiscal as its bad loans and provisions spiked. It had, in contrast, reported a net profit of Rs2,152.14 crore for the October-December quarter of the last fiscal, 2016-17. 
Reacting to the numbers, shares of the company opened at Rs288 and slumped 3.85% to touch an intraday low of Rs285 in morning trade on the BSE. Similar movement was seen on the NSE as well where the company opened at Rs288.25, then fell to a low of Rs285.15, registering a fall of 3.79% over its previous closing price. 
The nation’s largest lender saw its net bad loans ratio spiking to 5.61% of advances, from 4.24% during the third quarter of 2017-18. The gross dud assets ratio jumped meanwhile from 7.23% to cross the double digits mark at 10.35% during the quarter under review."

Mumbai: India’s regulator unearthed about $3.6 billion of bad loans in the books of the country’s biggest bank, amplifying questions about distress in the financial sector given underreporting by some rivals as well. 
Mumbai: India’s regulator unearthed about $3.6 billion of bad loans in the books of the country’s biggest bank, amplifying questions about distress in the financial sector given underreporting by some rivals as well.
State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday said an audit by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed soured debt was about Rs23,200 crore higher than what the state-run lender reported for the end of March 2017. The biggest private lender HDFC Bank Ltd had a Rs2,050 crore divergence, while ICICI Bank Ltd said—without elaborating—that it isn’t required to make disclosures on the topic even as provisions for bad loans climbed. It had reported a divergence in the previous year.
Indian banks must disclose such discrepancies if the gap between reported numbers and the RBI’s audit findings is more than 15%. State Bank of India’s admission is particularly striking because the lender is often seen as a proxy for the nation’s economy, where the ratio of bad loans has surged to be among the highest in the world. The problem has grabbed so many headlines that Prime Minister Narendra Modi cited it to attack the policies of his predecessor in parliament last week.

“If India’s premier state-run bank is reporting such divergence it shows how deep the rot runs in the nation’s banking system,"" said Hemindra Hazari, a Mumbai-based independent banking analyst who has covered the sector for two decades and publishes at Smartkarma.com. “Cleaning up this mess is going to take much more effort and time than what people expect.""
State Bank of India’s shares fell 1.7% to Rs296.4 in Mumbai on Friday, extending this year’s drop to 4.4%.
Most of the accounts identified by the RBI in its risk assessment were already on the stressed asset list “in one way or another,"" State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar said in a conference call with reporters. The bulk of the divergence—about Rs10,000 crore—came from the power sector, he said.
Divergences occurred earlier as well, though what’s changed is the mandatory disclosure of the gaps, central bank deputy governor N.S. Vishwanathan said last month.
Unnerving divergence
The regulator has also sought to reclassify loans given by a consortium as non-performing for all the lenders involved if it was considered non-performing on the books of one of them, as part of tighter asset classification norms that came into effect from 2016.
“The divergence in asset quality from numbers reported earlier is unnerving,"" said Asutosh Kumar Mishra, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. “While the loan growth is showing early signs of revival, provisions for bad loans will continue to weigh on profit growth in coming quarters.""
State Bank of India on Friday reported a Rs2,420 crore loss for the quarter ended 31 December, its first in at least 17 years. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey had predicted a Rs2,060 crore profit.
The loss was due to hardening bond yields, treasury declines and provisions for payments to employees, chairman Kumar said during the conference call.
“I don’t want to be very optimistic about the March quarter, nor am I pessimistic,"" Kumar said. “We can hope for a much better performance in terms of most performance parameters"" in the financial year starting 1 April, he added. Bloomberg"
1043,2018-02-14,State Bank,"SBI is seeking direction from Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India on whether it needs to file separate IBC cases against affiliates of Videocon Industries given they are jointly liable for loan repayments

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) is seeking direction from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) on whether it needs to file separate insolvency cases against affiliates of Videocon Industries Ltd, given that they are jointly liable for loan repayments. 
Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) is seeking direction from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) on whether it needs to file separate insolvency cases against affiliates of Videocon Industries Ltd, given that they are jointly liable for loan repayments.
Last month, the country’s largest lender had filed separate insolvency proceedings against two group companies, Videocon Industries and Videocon Telecommunications Ltd, but the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) is yet to admit these petitions. They were both part of the second list of big corporate defaulters put out by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The move also reflects the gradual toughening of stance by banks towards delinquent borrowers, a sentiment that is gaining momentum after the new ecosystem to deal with bad debts has been put in place. 
SBI’s dilemma arises from the pooled borrowing structure of Videocon group companies. In 2011, a consortium of banks led by SBI had entered into a loan arrangement with the company under which all the rupee term loans of the companies were pooled. This structure, called obligor/co-obligor, made these 14 companies jointly and separately liable for loan repayments. 
Co-obligor contracts are those where one is bound together with one or more entities to fulfil an obligation. 
According to Videocon Industries’ FY17 annual report, the company is liable to repay the liability of other group companies to the extent of Rs5,082 crore as on 31st March, 2017. The company’s total debt stood at Rs19,506 crore as of March last year.
The group companies that were part of the obligor/co-obligor structure are Videocon Industries, Videocon Telecommunications and 13 other affiliates including Value Industries Ltd and Trend Electronics Ltd.
SBI and IBBI did not respond to emails seeking comment. Videocon Industries chairman Venugopal Dhoot declined to comment.
“The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) doesn’t have provision for a co-obligor structure. Hence, we have invoked the guarantees and may have to refer these group companies to NCLT,"" said a senior SBI official on condition of anonymity as he isn’t authorized to speak to reporters.

SBI is in the process of inviting bids for selecting an interim resolution professional (IRP) for Videocon Industries and Videocon Telecommunications. The lender had earlier named Alvarez & Marsal as the IRP, but other firms, who claimed to have submitted lower bids, were displeased with this choice. According to a 29 January Mint report, SBI has formed an internal committee to address concerns around the process."

Kochi: Country’s largest lender SBI on Friday said it has an exposure of $212 million (about Rs1,360 crore) in respect to letter of undertaking (LoU) issued by Punjab National Bank to Nirav Modi, but does not have any direct exposure to the absconding jewellery designer. 
Kochi: Country’s largest lender SBI on Friday said it has an exposure of $212 million (about Rs1,360 crore) in respect to letter of undertaking (LoU) issued by Punjab National Bank to Nirav Modi, but does not have any direct exposure to the absconding jewellery designer.
“We don’t have any direct exposure on Nirav Modi but we do have some exposure on Punjab National Bank,"" State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters in Kochi today.
He said the bank has lent $212 million to Modi on the basis of LoU issued by PNB.
Kumar, however, said the bank has some exposure to Gitanjali Gems, owned by Mehul Choksi, uncle of Nirav Modi. “Our exposure to Gitanjali is small we and we are not worried,"" Kumar said.
When asked about the lender’s exposure to the entire gems and jewellery sector, he said it is less than 1% of the total domestic loan book. 
“My domestic loan book is Rs16 lakh crore and gems and jewellery sector exposure is less than Rs13,000 crore which is less than 1%,"" he said.
Kumar said the bank is very careful as far as gems and jewellery industry is concerned and has been taking steps to put lot of risk mitigation measures for accounts from the sector.
He said SBI has an elaborate system of risk management and internal audits and the robustness of that system is very well recognised.
“One of the risk management practise which we follow is job rotation. We don’t keep a person for more than three years at one position. There are certain positions which are very sensitive and we monitor those positions very closely,"" Kumar said.
He said the Swift system and the core banking system in SBI are integrated. He said banking is a risky business and risks are of various natures such as credit risks, operational risks, market risks and foreign currency risks. 
“Operational risk is always an unknown risk. Credit risk a calculated risk ... you know during the appraisal about the probability of default,"" he said.
Banks need to manage the risks by creating awareness about the risks, having standard operating procedures, strict compliance of these procedures and having a strong oversight.
“Ultimately, we are human beings who do the transactions and banks run on the trust. But, if there is a breach of trust by any individual, you have to have a process for detections,"" he said.
Review of the risk assessment processes and plugging the gaps should be a continuous process banks need to do. Talking about Axis Bank selling exposure, he said. 
They might have sold to other banks but whether we have bought or any other bank has bought, ultimately the exposure is on the bank which has issued the letter of undertaking."

Mumbai: State-run lenders State Bank of India (SBI) and Union Bank of India said they had an exposure of at least $200 million each to the PNB fraud involving Nirav Modi-helmed companies.
SBI said it had an exposure of $212 million to Punjab National Bank (PNB) with respect to the fraudulent transactions, but did not have any direct exposure to Modi.
“We don’t have any direct exposure to Nirav Modi, but we do have some exposure to PNB,"" said SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar at a briefing in Kochi.
PNB on Wednesday said it had detected a Rs11,400-crore financial fraud as part of which billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and his related firms acquired letters of undertaking (LoUs) from a Mumbai branch to obtain overseas credit from other Indian lenders.
In its complaint to CBI on 29 January, PNB had said it had issued LoUs to Hong Kong branches of Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank.
SBI’s Kumar admitted the lender had some exposure to Gitanjali Gems, among the companies accused of fraud by PNB in its complaint to CBI.
“Our exposure to Gitanjali is small. We are not worried,"" Kumar said. He added that loans extended to the gems and jewellery sector stood at less than 1% of SBI’s loan book of Rs16 trillion.
Separately, Union Bank sent a communication to the exchanges on Friday saying its outstanding exposure to LoUs issued by PNB stood at $300 million.
“The outstanding exposure related to the incident is approximately $300 million and the bank is fully secured by LoUs/LCs/other documents and fully confident of receiving the payment,"" the note stated.
Union Bank said its foreign branches had taken the exposures with PNB as counter-party risk via authenticated SWIFT messages. SWIFT stands for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. The bank added it had purchased buyers’ credit from Axis Bank through “risk participation"" as part of normal global business practice. Axis Bank said on Wednesday it had sold down all transactions which were undertaken against LoUs from PNB.
Kumar said the bank was careful in lending to the gems and jewellery industry and had been taking steps to put in place risk mitigation measures for accounts from the sector. “One of the risk management practices we follow is job rotation. We don’t keep a person for more than three years at one position. There are certain positions which are very sensitive and we monitor those positions very closely""."
1039,2018-02-18,State Bank,"Officials of Hong Kong branches of Indian lenders including Allahabad Bank, SBI, Union Bank, UCO Bank and Axis Bank are part of the fraud which continued for 7 years

New Delhi: As investigations into the Rs11,400 crore scam at PNB (Punjab National Bank) gather momentum, officials at overseas branches of other banks, where the fraudulently issued Letter of Undertakings (LoUs) were encashed, are under scanner, sources said.  
New Delhi: As investigations into the Rs11,400 crore scam at PNB (Punjab National Bank) gather momentum, officials at overseas branches of other banks, where the fraudulently issued Letter of Undertakings (LoUs) were encashed, are under scanner, sources said. 
Officials of Hong Kong branches of Indian lenders including Allahabad Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Union Bank, UCO Bank and Axis Bank are part of the entire fraud which continued for 7 years. 
As per the guidelines, the tenure for the encashment of LoUs for the jems and jewellery sector is usually of 90 days and not 365 days—the maturity period of most of the LoUs linked with the PNB fraud, sources said, adding that the deviation from the usual practice should have raised alarm in the minds of officials working at the Hong Kong branch of other lenders. 
But surprisingly this did not happen till last month when PNB refused to honour LoU fraudulently issued by some of the staff at its Brady House branch in Mumbai, sources said. 
Had someone raised alarm earlier, the quantum of fraud could have been lower, sources said, adding that it is like alert citizen informing police about some nefarious activity to authorities for the further action.
As many as 11 Indian banks have operations in Hong Kong. Branches of Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, Axis Bank, SBI, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Indian Overseas Bank are present in the city state. 
Among the lenders having a branch in Hong Kong, country’s largest lender SBI has already announced an exposure of $212 million to the PNB fraud involving Nirav Modi-promoted companies. At the same time, another public sector lender Union Bank of India’s exposure stood at $300 million, while UCO Bank has to realise $411.82 million. Allahabad Bank suspects it exposure of around Rs2,000 crore. 
Last week, fraud-hit PNB said it will honour its bonafide commitments and entire liability will be known after the investigation. 
The PNB fraud pertains to issuance of fake Letters of Understanding (LoUs) to companies associated with billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi by errant PNB employees, which enabled these companies to raise buyers credit from international branches of other Indian lenders. 
Last month, PNB had lodged an FIR with CBI stating that fraudulent LoUs worth Rs280.7 crore were first issued on 16 January. At the time, PNB had said it was digging into records to examine the magnitude of the fraud. In the complaint, PNB had named three diamond firms—Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds—saying they had approached it on 16 January with a request for buyers credit for making payment to overseas suppliers."

Singapore: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its earnings forecasts and price targets for three of India’s state-run lenders, after the biggest banking fraud to hit the nation.
Analysts including Rahul Jain lowered this year’s earnings estimate for State Bank of India by 1%, Bank of Baroda by 12% and Punjab National Bank by 30%, even after taking account the first tranche of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s $33 billion recapitalization plan in their forecasts. Estimates for 2019 and 2020 were also reduced by similar amounts.
Potential risk aversion and a greater focus on operational controls after the fraud may hamper growth in the near term, the analysts wrote in a note to clients Wednesday.
“We lower our EPS estimates for SBI/BOB largely on the back of share dilution,"" they said. “On PNB we see a larger EPS decline as we lower growth after baking in the full impact of the fraud-related liability.""
A $2 billion fraud at the bank that surfaced days after India’s largest lender posted a surprise loss has led to sharp declines in the National Stock Exchange’s gauge of state-run bank stocks. The index is down about 14% already this month and is on track to erase the sharp rally spurred by the government’s rescue plan announced in October.
In all, Indian banks could take a hit of more than $3 billion from loans and corporate guarantees provided to diamond companies allegedly involved in the fraud at PNB, Reuters reported on Saturday, citing the tax department.
Still, despite the cuts, Goldman still sees upside for state-bank shareholders. Its new price targets offer upside of between 12 and 29%, according to the note.
Private lenders seem to be the major beneficiaries of the state-banks’ woes. Continued strong economic growth is leading to ongoing demand for funding and the private sector is seeking to accelerate its market share gains.
Signs of this are already appearing in the tightening trade-finance market for Asia’s third biggest economy. Banks have put in restrictions on issuing non-funded instruments within the state-owned lenders, which should benefit private banks in the short term, Jefferies LLC analyst Nilanjan Karfa wrote in note on Tuesday.

New Delhi: The sale of first batch of electoral bonds will take place from 1-10 March at designated branches of State Bank of India, the finance ministry said on Thursday.
The government had notified the Electoral Bond Scheme on 2 January this year. As per provisions of the scheme, a person, who is a citizen of India or an entity incorporated/ established in India can purchase electoral bonds.
SBI has been allowed to issue and encash electoral bonds initially at its four authorised branches. The bonds will be sold at main branches of SBI in four metro cities —New Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.
“The first issue of the scheme will be opened in March 2018 in place of January 2018 for the first quarter of 2018. Accordingly, the first sale of electoral bonds will commence from March 1, 2018 for a period of 10 days i.e. up to March 10, 2018,"" the ministry said in a statement.
As per the scheme, announced by finance minister Arun Jaitley in Budget 2017-18, only registered political parties, which have secured not less than 1% of the votes polled in the last election of the Lok Sabha or legislative assembly of the state, will be eligible to receive electoral bonds.
“The bond shall be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with the authorised bank,"" the ministry said, adding that a person being an individual can buy electoral bonds, either singly or jointly, with other individuals.
The electoral bonds are being pitched as an alternative to cash donations made to political parties and bring transparency in political funding.
 An electoral bond will be valid for 15 days from the date of issue. No payment would be made to any payee political party if the bond is deposited after expiry of the validity period. The bond deposited by any eligible political party into its account would be credited on the same day."

London: State Bank of India (SBI) is set for a major restructuring of its business in the UK from April, India’s largest state-owned bank has said. SBI’s UK operations will transform into a subsidiary named State Bank of India UK Limited from 1 April, in compliance with wider ring-fencing of capital requirements by the Bank of England.  
London: State Bank of India (SBI) is set for a major restructuring of its business in the UK from April, India’s largest state-owned bank has said. SBI’s UK operations will transform into a subsidiary named State Bank of India UK Limited from 1 April, in compliance with wider ring-fencing of capital requirements by the Bank of England. 
The move will mean that all retail branches of SBI in the UK will fall under a new UK-incorporated banking entity instead of their previous status as overseas branches of the Indian entity. 
“While there will be no visible change, the brand changes to State Bank of India UK Limited. The 12 retail branches that we have – seven in London and the rest outside London – will become branches of SBI UK Ltd. Apart from that, if we look at the day to day, there will be no dislocation,"" said Sanjiv Chadha, SBI’s Regional Head for UK. 
He explains that while customers would be able to carry on using their debit cards and other banking facilities as before, the move marks a strategic shift for the bank with a greater focus on the UK market. “We will be looking to doing more business in the UK, expanding the products that are designed for the UK market,"" he said. 
The move follows Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) directing foreign banks a few years ago to move from their retail status as overseas branches to independent entities in order to protect depositors in the UK from fluctuations in foreign markets. 
“As a subsidiary, the capital will be ring-fenced and that brings an additional comfort level,"" said Chadha. He highlighted that the restructuring marked a major endorsement for London as a financial capital of the world, despite uncertainties triggered by the 2016 referendum in favour of an exit from the European Union (EU). 
“The UK market is one of tremendous interest and promise to us and that is unchanged regardless of Brexit. London is the best place for us to base our international business in, we find the regulatory climate proportionate and supportive,"" he added. SBI’s expansion in the UK market was welcomed as a vote of confidence by the City of London Corporation, which has a remit to support and promote the British capital as a world-leading financial and business hub. 
“The move is a reflection of the continued strength of UK-India ties, particularly in financial services. SBI has long been a treasured partner of the City, opening an office here back in 1921. As the City of London looks towards its next decade of engagement with Asia, we also look forward to building on our 100-year relationship with India’s largest bank,"" said Catherine McGuinness, Policy Chairman at the City of London Corporation. 
SBI operates seven branches in London and five each in Manchester, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Leicester and Coventry – all cities with a large concentration of Indian diaspora population. The bank says that while the Indian-origin customer base will remain at the heart of its operations, it will use its expansion to cater to the wider UK market as a competitive local bank. PTI"

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Monday said he expects Punjab National Bank (PNB) to clear the bank’s $212 million (Rs1,360 crore) dues in the Nirav Modi case.
Billionaire jewellery designer Nirav Modi is at the centre of the Rs11,400 crore PNB fraud.
“I am very much confident that things will get sorted out between PNB and other banks,"" Kumar said in an interview to CNBC TV18. “As far as our exposure is concerned on PNB, that number is very much confirmed, calculated and advised to PNB,"" Kumar said. He said the exposure of SBI to Gitanjali Gems—one of the companies involved in the PNB fraud—has also been crystallized and there was no issue on that.
“So our numbers, our claim is clear because there are some secondary market purchases, so double counting has to be avoided,"" the SBI chairman and MD told the news channel. When asked if banking sector would see more skeletons tumbling out of the closet, Kumar said it looks like the case is confined to a particular branch of PNB. 
“At least for SBI, I can confirm that there is no such issue, no such problem. And I am sure that by now all other banks also would have reviewed their portfolios and would have arrived at the similar conclusion because if something was wrong somewhere, by now, I presume, it could have come out,""Kumar said. 
When asked if regulator Reserve Bak of India (RBI) has issued any other instruction to banks other than integrating the core banking solution with the SWIFT system, Kumar said he has no further knowledge on the issue. He said RBI has instructed the banks to put in place the safety mechanism with respect to global money transfer software SWIFT and the banks are in a position to comply with that by April.
Kumar also said the PNB fraud is more of operational risk and not related to credit risk. “Whatever has gone wrong, it is about the operational weakness and we have to keep that segregated from the credit risk."" 
Other than SBI, lenders like Union Bank of India(UBI) and Allahabad Bank also have exposure to PNB to grant loans on the basis of letters of understanding (LoUs) that were issued fraudulently to Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi. Allahabad Bank has an exposure of about $366.87 million in the case to PNB through its overseas branch in Hong Kong. UBI has exposure of nearly $300 million through its foreign branches.
On 14 February, PNB had informed the stock exchanges that the bank was defrauded to the tune of $1.77 billion (nearly Rs11,400 crore) by Modi and his associate companies by getting loans through illegal LoUs for over seven years."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday issued notice to Asian Colors Coated Ispat Ltd (ACCI) in a plea by State Bank of India, leader of its lenders’ consortium, for initiating an insolvency proceedings over a Rs3,900 crore default.
ACCI is one of the corporate debtors identified by Reserve Bank of India in August 2017. 
ACCI objected to SBI’s plea on the ground that it had already placed a resolution proposal before a committee of creditors, which was subsequently rejected by them. 
SBI had moved NCLT in January for initiation of insolvency proceeding against ACCI. However, the proceedings before NCLT were stalled as the company had approached the Delhi high court to work out a resolution proposal with a committee constituted by the consortium of lender banks. 
Apart from SBI, the consortium consisted of Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank. 
Justice Rajiv Shakdher had directed ACCI to deposit Rs700 crore as security before making a proposal to the committee of lenders. Since no such deposit was made by ACCI, the committee rejected ACCI’s resolution proposal on 15 February. 
The matter is listed for further consideration on 23 March."

New Delhi: Google (Alphabet Inc.) on Tuesday said it has integrated Google Tez with State Bank of India (SBI), allowing customers of India’s largest lender to transact directly from their bank accounts through the mobile payments app.
SBI is the first public sector bank to have partnered with Google Tez. SBI customers can now create a unique UPI ID (for example, name@oksbi or mobilenumber@oksbi etc) to carry out the transactions.
To be sure, other state-run banks are also listed on the app and money can be sent to these bank accounts but the bank’s UPI ID cannot be generated on the app.
As of now, Google has partnered with four banks to allow users of Tez app to create their bank’s UPI handle and transact directly from their bank accounts on the app. Other than SBI, the three other banks are HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and ICICI Bank.
“Our shared commitment to excellence in customer service and bringing simple and secure payments for all will boost adoption of UPI and is a significant step forward in the digitization of cash,"" said Rajnish Kumar, chairman of SBI.
SBI has a customer base of more than 400 million. It has the largest network of 22,584 branches in India and a network of nearly 59,000 ATMs.
In September, Google launched customized-for-India-app called Tez—which means “fast’ in English, suggesting that speed with which you can make payments will be the key. 
The app which uses UPI platform for enabling transactions is available on the Google Play Store for Android phones and the Apple App Store for iPhones. 
“We are still in very early stages of building a vibrant digital payments ecosystem - that brings together millions of smartphone users, small merchants, large businesses, and financial institutions. This is an important step forward in that journey,"" said Diana Layfield, vice president, head of finance & commerce products, Next Billion Users.
Till now, Tez app has processed over 250 million transactions and has over 13.5 million monthly active users across India, claims Google.
More than 70 banks are already live on UPI. 
The government has been pushing the UPI platform to boost digital payments in India, to reduce use of cash."

New York/Mumbai:  The chief of State Bank of India, biggest Indian lender, called for an industry-wide review of risk controls in day-to-day operations, comparing a $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB) to the 1995 Barings Plc rogue trading debacle that ended the 233-year-old British merchant bank’s independence. 
New York/Mumbai:  The chief of State Bank of India, biggest Indian lender, called for an industry-wide review of risk controls in day-to-day operations, comparing a $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB) to the 1995 Barings Plc rogue trading debacle that ended the 233-year-old British merchant bank’s independence.
“The Punjab National Bank fiasco is something similar to the fall of Barings Bank, where one trader and his misadventure brings down the whole bank,"" Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India, said in an interview at his Mumbai office on Tuesday. “In this case also the system has completely failed at a particular office, in a particular organization, causing huge losses.""
PNB has lost about a third of its market value and is facing rating downgrades since disclosing the scam two weeks ago, when it alleged that a rogue employee provided fake guarantees worth $2 billion to a couple of jewellers, which they used to obtain loans from abroad. While the extent of losses to PNB is yet unclear, the news has triggered a wave of fingerpointing and regulatory tightening across the industry that could chill a nascent recovery in lending.
Shares of PNB sank the most since 2004 on Tuesday and hover near a 20-month low, pacing losses among state-run lenders, after regulators asked all government-owned banks to review bad loans above Rs50 crore ($7.7 million) for fraud. The banks have 15 days to identify and clean up weaknesses in the way they do business, the top bureaucrat overseeing the sector said on Twitter.
“In a way it seems to me as a one-off incident,"" Kumar said of the PNB fraud, adding that while there has been “some impact"" on the rupee the perception of India hasn’t changed much. “But at the same time it also is a pointer that there is need for relooking at the risk governance architecture.""
Kumar predicts that Asia’s third-largest economy will continue to grow strongly, demand for credit will increase and Indian bond yields will “stabilize"" after rising to a two-year high as the global recovery gains strength. Indian gross domestic product (GDP) probably expanded 7% in October to December, faster than 6.3% the previous quarter, according to the consensus estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due 5:30pm in New Delhi on Wednesday.
‘Idiosyncratic’
Loan growth accelerated to about 11% this month before the PNB fraud came to light, almost double the average pace last year as the government pledged to inject a record $32 billion into state-run banks. It had plunged to a 25-year low late in 2016 as lenders grapple with the second-highest bad-loan ratio among big economies.
Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service have placed PNB’s ratings on review for possible downgrade. While Moody’s says the PNB fraud is “ idiosyncratic"" and there’s nothing to prove that such illegal practices are widespread across India’s banking sector, analyst Alka Anbarasu said in an email that PNB will need high provisioning to tide over the problem.
State Bank of India also posted its first loss in at least 17 years last quarter as provisions surged. The lender said an audit by the central bank showed soured debt was about Rs23,200 crore higher than what SBI had reported as of end-March 2017.
“Credit risk is a known devil which at worst you might underestimate,"" Kumar said. “But if you don’t take care of your operational risks, it can hit you very hard on the face when least expected."" Bloomberg"
1029,2018-03-01,State Bank,"State Bank of India (SBI) has increased the interest rate on fixed deposits (FD) by 10-75 basis points across tenors

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday increased rates on term deposits by 10-75 basis points (bps), which may prompt other banks to follow suit, and signals the turning of interest rate cycle. 
Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday increased rates on term deposits by 10-75 basis points (bps), which may prompt other banks to follow suit, and signals the turning of interest rate cycle.
The country’s largest lender increased the interest rate on fixed deposits (FD) for a two- to three-year maturity to 6.50% from 6% a year. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Bankers and analysts attributed the reason for the increase in deposit rates to tight banking system liquidity conditions. The Bloomberg Banking Liquidity Conditions Index showed a liquidity deficit of Rs34,000 crore as on Tuesday. In the past three months, SBI had twice raised rates on bulk deposits. However, this is the first time after demonetisation that the bank has raised term deposit rate on amounts below Rs1 crore.
“It is to do with the demand and supply of money. In the past few months, liquidity has been tightening in the system. If you just look at the commercial paper and certificate of deposit rate, you have seen a movement of 100 bps. Thanks to the liquidity getting tight, market borrowing has become tighter, too. Typically, in the last quarter of the year, demand increases. SBI, in fact, post-demonetisation had dropped their rates. Most banks are aligning themselves to market rates and to demand and supply of money,"" said Shanti Ekambaram, president-consumer banking, Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.
When SBI increases FD rates across tenure, it means the change is here to stay for a longer period, and that other banks are likely to follow. 
“I think liquidity is getting tighter for SBI and other banks, too. The room for other banks to increase deposit rates is also there. Some small banks may not increase rate. However, other majors may follow the trend and increase deposit rates, but it will also depend on their liquidity situation,"" said Pritesh Bumb, an analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.
When banks raise deposit rates, it indicates lending rates will also tighten. “It is a function of tightening liquidity which has happened due to both monetary and fiscal measures. As a result of that, banks require to raise deposit rates. When deposit rates were going down, MCLR (marginal cost of funds-based lending rates) fell. Now when deposit rates rise, MCLR is bound to go up,"" said Rajiv Anand, executive director of retail banking at Axis Bank Ltd.
The rise in SBI deposit rates, and subsequently lending rates also signals the turning of the interest rate cycle despite the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) not making any rate changes in its last two monetary policy reviews.
Indeed, one member of RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) said a series of rate hikes may be warranted because of rising risks to inflation, while others hinted at a change in policy stance if those risks materialize, show minutes of the February meeting released on Wednesday.
“The trend indicates hardening of interest rate on both sides of the balance sheet—deposits as well as loans. As far as lending rates are concerned, there is gradual recognition that external conditions such as inflation from oil and possibly from food till the monsoons may push the interest rates up,"" said Ashvin Parekh, managing partner, Ashvin Parekh Advisory Services Llp."
1028,2018-03-01,State Bank,"RP Info Systems allegedly obtained credit facilities from at least 10 PSU banks, including SBI and two of its erstwhile associate banks, by submitting fabricated documents

Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday registered a complaint against Kolkata-based RP Info Systems Pvt. Ltd, maker of the Chirag brand of computers, for defrauding a group of lenders of at least Rs515 crore. 
Kolkata: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday registered a complaint against Kolkata-based RP Info Systems Pvt. Ltd, maker of the Chirag brand of computers, for defrauding a group of lenders of at least Rs515 crore.
This isn’t the first complaint filed against RP Info Systems. In December 2013, IDBI Bank had filed a complaint with CBI, seeking a probe into fraudulent diversion of funds using fake documents, but the central agency restricted its probe to the extent of IDBI Bank’s exposure to the company, Canara Bank said in its complaint filed on Monday.
A separate statement issued by Canara Bank late on Wednesday said the original complaint on the Rs515 crore fraud was filed in December 2015 by the lead lender of RP Info Systems (Canara Bank did not name the lender). It said after the lead lender withdrew as the consortium leader, it was authorized by the remaining banks, on the direction of CBI, to file a revised complaint, which it filed on Wednesday. Canara Bank said it had financed a Rs40 crore working capital limit to the company, and had reported it as a fraud to the Reserve Bank of India in 2015 itself.
The petition alleged that RP Info Systems obtained credit facilities from at least 10 state-run banks—including State Bank of India and two of its erstwhile associate banks—by submitting “fabricated"" documents.
The company had overstated its inventory and submitted falsified invoices to obtain credit facilities, the bank said. In fiscal year 2013-14, the company wrote off inventory worth Rs397.62 crore and receivables worth Rs499.30 crore, Canara Bank has said in its complaint.
RP Info Systems had claimed companies such as GAIL (India) Ltd and tyre maker Ceat Ltd owed it money, but the two companies had later informed State Bank of India that they had nothing to do with the computer maker, CBI has noted in its first information report (FIR).
Kaustuv Ray, one of the founders and a director of RP Info Systems, said the dispute dates back to 2012-13, and that CBI had already investigated the matter. 
Referring to the complaint filed by IDBI Bank, he claimed that CBI had already submitted its chargesheet and that a trial had begun. RP Info Systems has challenged CBI’s chargesheet and has started to repay its lenders, Ray added.
The Reserve Bank of India has asked all lenders to closely examine if there were cases of fraud among reported non-performing assets. 
Canara Bank claims in its complaint to CBI that all 10 lenders, on behalf of which it has lodged the complaint, had reported their loss to RP Infosystems as fraud to the banking regulator in 2015 or 2016.
However, it is not immediately clear why none of these 10 lenders—which does not include IDBI Bank—hadn’t reported the fraud to CBI even after realizing that the probe initiated by the central agency was restricted to the exposure of IDBI Bank only.
Collectively, 11 lenders, including IDBI Bank, have initiated proceedings against the computer maker for recovery of Rs651 crore, Canara Bank has said in its complaint.
RP Info Systems owes State Bank of India—along with its erstwhile associates State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Jaipur and Bikaner—Rs186.92 crore. It owes Canara Bank Rs81.23 crore and Central Bank of India, Rs82.11 crore. Punjab National Bank had a claim of Rs73.12 crore at the end of the June quarter of 2013, the complaint said.
The complaint names Ray and his erstwhile partner Shivaji Panja among key officials of the company as responsible for the fraud. Panja, who has parted ways with Ray, couldn’t be immediately reached for comments. Ray and Panja previously had diverse business interests which included films, media and tea, besides computer hardware."

1025,2018-03-01,State Bank,"Though these accounts are not directly related to PNB fraud, SBI has shared their details with the investigating agencies probing the $2 billion scam

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) has frozen three bank accounts of Nirav Modi group companies and shared the information related to those accounts with investigative agencies, bank officials said on Thursday. 
New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) has frozen three bank accounts of Nirav Modi group companies and shared the information related to those accounts with investigative agencies, bank officials said on Thursday.
Billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi is at the centre of the $2 billion PNB fraud.
“We have proactively conducted internal scrutiny and came across three deposit accounts of the Nirav Modi group companies in our overseas branches,"" the officials told PTI.
These accounts were with the three overseas SBI branches at Dubai, Bahrain and Antwerp, officials said. The bank found out these accounts after internal scrutiny, the officials said, adding these accounts are not directly related to the PNB fraud of nearly Rs12,600 crore. However, these could help in investigation so the bank shared the details with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED), the income tax department and other relevant agencies.
SBI, which has exposure of $212 million to the Nirav Modi fraud, expects Punjab National Bank (PNB) to clear the bank’s dues in the fraud case. 
“As far as our exposure is concerned on PNB, that number is very much confirmed, calculated and advised to PNB,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar had said in an interview to TV channel CNBC-TV18. “I am very much confident that things will get sorted out between PNB and other banks.""
He had said the exposure of SBI to Gitanjali Gems—one of the companies involved in the PNB fraud—has also been crystallized and there was no issue on that. “So our numbers, our claim is clear because there are some secondary market purchases, so double counting has to be avoided,"" the SBI chairman had said."
1026,2018-03-02,State Bank,"SBI, PNB and ICICI Bank increased their MCLR by 10-20 basis points on Thursday, a day after SBI raised its FD interest rates

Mumbai: Home and auto loans are set to get costlier as banks increase their benchmark lending rates. State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and ICICI Bank Ltd all increased their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10-20 basis points on Thursday. 
Mumbai: Home and auto loans are set to get costlier as banks increase their benchmark lending rates. State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and ICICI Bank Ltd all increased their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10-20 basis points on Thursday.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
After the MCLR system came into effect in April 2016, this is the first time banks have increased the benchmark lending rate, signalling a turn in the interest rate cycle.
SBI increased the one-year MCLR by 20bps to 8.15% from 7.95%, whereas ICICI Bank, the largest private sector bank, raised one-year MCLR by 10bps from 8.20% to 8.30%.
Most banks link lending rates for retail customers in categories such as home loans,personal loans, and auto loans to the one-year MCLR. However, some banks, including ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, have linked home loans to six-month MCLR. ICICI Bank has also increased it six-month MCLR by 10bps from 8.15% to 8.25%.
The increase in rates comes a day after SBI raised interest rates on term deposits by 10-75bps, which bankers and analysts attributed to tight banking system liquidity conditions. Banking system liquidity is consistently in deficit now compared to a surplus a few months ago. In the past three months, SBI has raised rates on bulk deposits twice. However, this is the first time after demonetization that it has raised term deposit rates on amounts below Rs1 crore.
“This is an impact of increase in cost of funds. Banks have increased the cost of deposit, hence, they will definitely pass on the cost in MCLR. The cost of funds increased because system liquidity has tightened to a great extent in the last few months. You have seen that the bond rates have also gone up quite sharply. The movement is not transitory and likely to remain so for at least six months considering the GDP and inflation numbers,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.
Existing borrowers on MCLR-linked loans will not see an impact as per their reset clause. For instance, for a home loans taken on November 2017 linked to one-year MCLR, new rates would only kick in a year later in November 2018. For new borrowers, loans will now get immediately expensive. Most banks have a spread, basically a mark-up, on home loans and other consumer loans."

Rs36.8 crore 
Rs36.8 crore
What is it? The net loss of Fortis Healthcare in the October-December quarter of 2017-18, compared to a net profit of Rs442 crore in the same period a year ago.
Why is it important? After allegations of taking Rs500 crore from Fortis surfaced, its former promoters Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh resigned from the board. The latest quarterly results were awaited to see the auditor’s note on accounts. Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP has said that it cannot give a conclusion on the company’s statement of unaudited financial results, citing insufficient appropriate evidence to form a conclusion.
Tell me more: Fortis’s statutory auditor has raised three main concerns, including ongoing investigations, unsecured advances to vendors and inter-corporate loans, with respect to its earnings in the quarter and nine months ended December 2017. Besides, Fortis has also appointed an external legal firm to probe a few issues, including inter-corporate deposits given by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent company.

What is it? The number of banks, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank, that announced an increase in lending rates on Thursday.
Why is it important? This is the first time since April 2016 when the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) regime came into effect that banks have increased lending rates. And, this has happened without the central bank increasing its policy rates. The rate hike will increase the borrowing costs for new loans, and for existing customers, the new rates will come into effect when the interest rates are reset.
Tell me more: Other banks are likely to follow suit. This is because of two key reasons: one, banks’ profitability has been hit due to the high levels of soured loans and two, increase in bond yields of the government, which the lenders have to bear.
50
What is it? The approximate number of countries that have moved away from self-regulatory professional accountant bodies and created independent audit regulators.
Why is it important? India has now joined that list as the cabinet on Thursday approved the draft rules to set up a body called the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) to monitor auditing and accounting standards in India. NFRA will also have powers to investigate misconduct on part of chartered accountant or CA firms, debar them for up a period of up to 10 years and impose penalty. ICAI, which trains and certifies CAs, gives them licence to practise and regulate them, will continue to exercise these powers on small firms.

What is it? The minimum National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) score needed by an educational institution to admit more foreign students. 
Why is it important? This will help better ranked institutions like Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management to improve their global rankings, as student diversity will increase. Qualified institutions are also free to fix the fee structure for foreign students. 
Tell me more: NAAC, which accredits higher educational institutions, gives score on a rating scale of 1 to 4. A score between 3.26 and 3.50 is given a letter grade of ‘A+’. And a score above 3.5 to 4 would secure a ‘A++’ grade. 
200-300
What is it? The number of species of ornamental fishes that are being imported by India. 
Why is it important? This number is far higher than 92 species of ornamental fishes permitted to be imported. The unscrupulous import has resulted in higher number of invasive alien species (IAS) that is threatening the aquatic biodiversity. Lack of quarantine facilities at the airports is cited as a reason for higher than allowed import of ornamental fishes. 
Tell me more: IAS are species which are introduced outside their natural habitat, and their introduction threatens biological diversity in the new place.

Indore: State Bank of India (SBI) has closed as many as 41.16 lakh savings accounts between April-January in the current fiscal year for not maintaining the minimum balance, reveals an RTI query.
Last April, SBI had re-introduced the penal charges on non-maintenance of average monthly balance after a gap of five years. Later in October, it had revised down the charges to some extent.
“Due to provisions of penalty on non-maintenance of minimum balance, the bank has closed 41.16 lakh savings bank accounts between 1 April 2017 and 31 January 2018,"" the bank replied to an RTI query filed by Chandra Shekhar Gaud from Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh.
Even though the reply was furnished by SBI on 28 February 2018, the bank on Tuesday steeply reduced the penal charges on not maintaining the minimum balance.
The reply was to a specific query on the number of accounts being closed after introduction of charges on non- maintenance of minimum balance from 1 April 2017.
The State Bank has 41 crore savings bank accounts. Of that, 16 crore are under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (basic savings bank deposit) and of pensioner, minors, social security benefit holders which are all exempted from the penalty for not maintaining of the minimum balance.
Between April and November 2017, the bank had netted a windfall of Rs1,771.67 crore, more than its second quarter profit, from customers for non-maintenance of minimum balance, according to the finance ministry data.
On Tuesday, SBI reduced its charges for non-maintenance of average monthly balance by up to 75% from a maximum of Rs50 per month plus taxes at 18% to Rs15.
For urban and metro customers, the average monthly balance is of Rs3,000 per month. For semi-urban and rural centres, the charges have been reduced from Rs40 to Rs12, and Rs10 per, respectively.
The minimum balance requirement for semi-urban area is Rs2,000, while for rural centres is Rs1,000. The bank offers its customers the option to shift from regular savings accounts to BSBD accounts on which no charges are levied."

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday announced up to 75% reduction in charges levied on savings bank account customers for not maintaining the average monthly balance (AMB). However, the lender has retained the amount that has to be maintained as AMB. 
Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday announced up to 75% reduction in charges levied on savings bank account customers for not maintaining the average monthly balance (AMB). However, the lender has retained the amount that has to be maintained as AMB.
The new charges are applicable from 1 April.
For customers in metro and urban areas, applicable charges for not maintaining Rs3,000, which is the AMB, have been brought down to Rs10-15 from Rs30-50 currently. Within a particular category, the bank levies charges depending on the shortfall. For instance, if the shortfall is greater than 75%, charges applicable would be Rs15 as compared to Rs50 earlier.
Applicable goods and service tax (GST) is added to the charges.
SBI has also slashed charges for not-maintenance of Rs2,000 as ABM in bank accounts in semi-urban areas to Rs7.50-12 and Rs1,000 in accounts in rural area to Rs5-10. Currently, the charges are in the range of Rs20-40.
P.K. Gupta, managing director, retail and digital banking at SBI, said the bank has reduced the charges on the basis of customer feedback.
SBI claims the reduction is expected to benefit 250 million customers.
The state-owned lender has around 410 million savings bank accounts, of which around 160 million are exempted from AMB requirement. Exempted accounts are those related to Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, basic savings bank deposit account, and accounts of pensioners and minors, among others.
In April 2017, SBI had re-introduced the requirement for maintaining AMB and imposed penalties for non-maintenance after six years. The AMB for accounts from metro areas was set at Rs5,000 and those from urban areas at Rs3,000. The bank had subsequently lowered the AMB, following criticism from the customers.
SBI collected Rs1,771.67 crore from customers on account of non-maintenance of AMB between April and November 2017, according to the finance ministry’s answer in Lok Sabha on 29 December."
1014,2018-03-21,State Bank,"SBI's move comes a day after RCom approached the Supreme Court for stay on orders of the Bombay HC and NCLT barring it from selling assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday approached the Supreme Court to seek approval for the sale of Anil Ambani led-Reliance Communications Ltd’s (RCom’s) assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.  
New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday approached the Supreme Court to seek approval for the sale of Anil Ambani led-Reliance Communications Ltd’s (RCom’s) assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
While RCom allegedly owes Rs45,000 crore to as many as 35 banks, the total dues to SBI as on 28 February stand at Rs4,027 crore.
This comes a day after RCom approached the top court seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench, barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval. 
The matter will be heard along with RCom’s main petition.
On 8 March, the Bombay high court rejected RCom’s appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission. 
The order was passed in a proceeding initiated by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson for recovery of Rs1,012 crore of arrears from RCom.
SBI has sought stay of the Bombay high court order and claimed that it was preventing the sale of secured assets and stalling the process of recovery of dues of secured lenders.
Separately, in a plea by HSBC Daisy Investments, which had invested Rs1,100 crore in July 2007 in RCom’s Reliance InfraTel unit, NCLT on 12 March directed it not to sell its towers and fibre assets to Reliance Jio till further orders.
HSBC Daisy Investments along with some minority shareholders in Reliance Infratel had approached NCLT, alleging oppression of minority shareholders for not taking their consent for the asset sale.
Anil Ambani on 26 December said that his company had agreed to a new debt resolution plan that will see RCom sell its assets, and did not entail lenders and bond-holders writing off dues or converting it into equity.
Through this process, he hoped to cut RCom’s debt by Rs39,000 crore from the Rs45,000 crore it owed lenders at the end of October.
The matter will be heard next on 22 March.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a Rs1,394.43 crore bank fraud case against Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure Ltd on a complaint by state-run Union Bank of India.
“The CBI registered a case today (Thursday) on a complaint by Union Bank of India against Totem Infrastructure and its promoters and directors Tottempudi Salalith and his wife Tottempudi Kavita of Hyderabad,"" a person familiar with the developments said.
The number of bank fraud cases has been piling up after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) directed banks to file complaints against erring companies. The latest case comes just a day after the investigating agency filed a case of loan fraud against Kanishk Gold Pvt. Ltd on a complaint by State Bank of India (SBI).
Union Bank of India’s industrial finance branch of Hyderabad filed the complaint against Totem for cheating the bank to an extent of Rs313.84 crore.
“Totem Infrastructure took a loan from a consortium of eight banks, including Union Bank, wherein the total outstanding dues stand at Rs1,394.43 crore. This account became NPA (non-performing asset) on 30 June 2012,"" the person added.
The agency said that Union Bank of India had only recently filed a complaint with the agency against Totem Infrastructure.
It was alleged in the complaint by Union Bank that “the company had diverted funds by opening accounts outside the consortium and through payments of wages by showing excess expenditure and inflated stocks. The entire sale proceeds were not allegedly routed through the dealing branches of consortium banks.""
Union Bank of India declined to comment on the matter.
CBI said that it had tracked the promoters down and “have located the accused at a new place of residence and searches are underway"".
Other persons familiar with the case also confirmed that Totem Infrastructure was engaged in infrastructure projects, wherein “they took subcontracts from Larsen and Toubro Ltd, Ircon International Ltd and similar companies.""
In a statement, CBI added that “the said private company (Totem) based at Banjara Hills, Hyderabad, was in the business of EPC (engineering procurement and construction) contractor engaged in road projects, water works, building structures and also undertook works as a sub contractor to various companies.""
Totem Infrastructure did not respond to Mint’s calls or messages.
On Wednesday, CBI registered a case against Chennai-based Kanishk Gold and its promoters Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain for allegedly defrauding State Bank of India (SBI) and 13 other banks to the tune of Rs824.15 crore, while also issuing lookout circulars against the accused.
“The CBI, on Thursday, conducted two fresh searches (locations not disclosed) and questioned Bhoopesh Jain and Neeta Jain in connection with the case and lookout circulars have been issued against those who have been accused,"" the person cited above added.
Lookout circulars are issued by the CBI against the accused in a case, so that they cannot flee the country.
Other than Bhoopesh and Neeta Jain, the CBI also booked Tejraj Achha, a partner at Achha Associates; Ajay Kumar Jain, a partner in Ajay and Co.; Sumit Kedia who is a partner at Lunawath and Associates.
While emails and calls to SBI remained unanswered, Kanishk Gold did not respond to calls either.
Both the scams have come in the wake of the Rs12,636 crore PNB fraud case, where the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate have filed cases under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, respectively. However, both Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi have declined to join the investigation.

Mumbai: A dedicated bankruptcy court on Wednesday rejected an intervention sought by Videocon Industries Ltd against State Bank of India (SBI) amending its original bankruptcy petition. 
Mumbai: A dedicated bankruptcy court on Wednesday rejected an intervention sought by Videocon Industries Ltd against State Bank of India (SBI) amending its original bankruptcy petition.
The Venugopal Dhoot controlled company had alleged that in the guise of minor changes, SBI made several changes to the original petition, meaning the original plea was defective and hence needed to be rejected.
Rejecting the intervention, justice M.K Shrawat of the Mumbai bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ruled that the petition will be heard on its merits.
“I am of the view that litigation should not be thrown out on merely technical grounds and it has to hear on the basis of merits,"" ruled the judge, posting the case for hearing on 23 April.
The country’s largest bank SBI had filed its insolvency petition against Videocon Industries in January at the NCLT. Videocon is in the so-called second list of 28 defaulters that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had directed for resolution under the new bankruptcy code.
Earlier, the counsel representing the Aurangabad-based white goods maker had argued that the bank had only sought permission to change details of the resolution professional, but had instead submitted a heavily amended petition, proving the original plea was flawed. 
Zal Andhyarujina, representing Videocon Industries, further argued that at least 23 changes were made in the original petition including correction of dates of default and number of days across several loan facilities. The counsel further asked the court to either strike down the amendments and reject the petition, or call for a fresh petition to be drawn up by the bank. Counsel representing SBI, insisted the company had yet to present any evidence of prejudice following the corrections.
“There is no change in the amount of the default. Also, the company has not said how it was prejudice due to these amendments,"" argued Saloni Kapadia, counsel representing the Bank further adding that at the time of making changes, the company had consented to make those ‘clerical’ changes. 
Videocon Telecommunications Ltd, a subsidiary of Videocon Industries, which is also facing bankruptcy proceedings, has also sought similar relief against the amendments made by SBI. However, the case is being heard in front of another bench where the order is reserved. 
Earlier in February, Videocon Industries had also moved the Bombay high court where it submitted a writ petition asking for a stay on bankruptcy proceedings initiated by SBI in NCLT. 
Videocon had moved the high court against RBI’s decision not to extend the timeline as requested by SBI and the Joint Lenders’ Forum so as to re-rate Videocon’s restructuring proposal following changes in cash flows after subsequent changes in government import duty policy.
According to Videocon Industries’ FY17 annual report, the company is liable to repay the liability of other group companies to the extent of Rs5,082 crore as on 31 March 2017. 
The company’s total debt stood at Rs19,506 crore as of March last year."

New Delhi: In a partial relief to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), the Supreme Court on Thursday cancelled a March order of the Bombay high court that had rejected the company’s appeal of an order from an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets.
Accordingly, RCom is at liberty to proceed with the sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) that were previously under challenge.
“It is not a block sale. The court has today paved way for sale of the spectrum, MCNs and real estate,"" Punit Garg, executive director of RCom, said in an interview after the court order. Other people aware of the developments have however, maintained that the asset sale is a block deal.
The top court also rejected the plea of Reliance Infratel, a subsidiary of RCom, and the State Bank of India (SBI) challenging an order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that stayed an asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. A two-judge bench headed by justice A.K. Goel asked the parties to approach the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in accordance with law. RCom is likely to move the appellate forum on Friday. 
“As legally advised, and based on the order of the Hon’ble SC as above, RCom is confident of securing appropriate relief from the NCLAT to enable sales of tower and fibre assets to also be completed at the earliest. The claim of the minority investors (which is fully disputed by RCom) can, in any case, be a maximum of approx. Rs200-300 crore from the sales proceeds,"" a RCom spokesperson said. 
RCom had moved the top court on 19 March seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench, barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval. The company was joined by SBI which approached the court on 20 March seeking approval for the sale of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio. 
The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, which are alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement. While RCom owes a total of Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, total dues to SBI as on 28 February stood at Rs4,027 crore. On 8 March, the high court had rejected RCom’s appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission. The tribunal had passed the interim order on a plea by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson for recovery of Rs1,012 crore from RCom.
Ericsson being an unsecured creditor, through its counsel, C.A. Sundaram, said, “It is not that we don’t have any rights. I have the right to recovery. This cannot be a private transaction; one brother selling to another.""
“Am I to be left in the lurch like this? After they sell the assets, they will say that they don’t have money left to pay us,"" he remarked. He added that its rights were being defeated and being a small company, it would suffer irreparably. It was observed by the court that as unsecured creditors, it (Ericsson) could not be deprived of its statutory rights.
This was opposed by Mukul Rohtagi, representing RCom who told the court, “Even under civil law or commercial law, secured creditors are above unsecured creditors"".

London: The State Bank of India (SBI) has announced the launch of its UK subsidiary, SBI (UK) Ltd, with an initial capital commitment of £225 million from its parent entity.  
London: The State Bank of India (SBI) has announced the launch of its UK subsidiary, SBI (UK) Ltd, with an initial capital commitment of £225 million from its parent entity. 
India’s largest state-owned bank, which celebrated the new subsidiary with a special event in London on Monday, becomes the first foreign bank in the UK to ringfence its retail division from its wholesale business. 
SBI said that the ringfencing and subsidiarisation of the retail franchise SBI UK, the bank’s largest overseas operation, offers UK customers “stability and reassurance"" amid continuing uncertainty around the UK’s decision to leave the European Union (EU). 
“We are extremely proud of how far the bank has come from the first time it opened its doors to UK residents in 1921,"" said Sanjiv Chadha, regional head of SBI UK. “The launch of our UK subsidiary shows our commitment to operate in the UK market. Many banks primarily see the UK as the gateway to Europe and are fazed by the impact of Brexit. Our calculus is different. We see London as the ideal launch pad for a global presence and have full faith that, despite Brexit, London will remain the premier international financial centre,"" he said. 
The UK subsidiary of the SBI has been launched with an initial capital commitment of £225 million from its parent entity. The UK’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) wants foreign banks to establish UK subsidiaries to protect depositors in the UK from uncertainties in foreign markets. It is aimed at preventing a repeat of the financial crisis, by ensuring that banks have enough capital to support their business. 
The costly move has caused an industry uproar, leading many existing foreign-owned bank branches to reassess their presence in the UK. However, SBI UK says it has chosen to view the restructuring as an endorsement for London as a financial capital of the world, despite uncertainty triggered by the Brexit. 
Charles Bowman, Lord Mayor of the City of London, said: “The move is a reflection of the continued strength of UK-India ties, particularly in financial and professional services. I look forward to further building on our 100-year relationship with India’s largest bank."" 
SBI UK, as the largest Indian bank in the UK, said it is confident that London will continue to remain the pre-eminent financial capital for institutions seeking a “gateway to a global presence"". 
The new subsidiary, which came into effect on 1 April, means that all retail branches of SBI in the UK will fall under a new UK-incorporated banking entity instead of their previous status as overseas branches of the Indian entity. 
“The UK market is one of tremendous interest and promise to us and that is unchanged regardless of Brexit. London is the best place for us to base our international business in, we find the regulatory climate proportionate and supportive,"" Chadha said. 
SBI operates seven branches in London and five each in Manchester, Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Leicester and Coventry—all cities with a large concentration of Indian diaspora population. 
The bank says that while the Indian-origin customer base will remain at the heart of its operations, it will use its expansion to cater to the wider UK market as a competitive local bank. PTI"

Banks have been instrumental in nation-building by showing the courage to lend to key sectors and it is crucial to make sure they do not ‘lose that courage’, former SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has said. 
Banks have been instrumental in nation-building by showing the courage to lend to key sectors and it is crucial to make sure they do not ‘lose that courage’, former SBI chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya has said.
“If we look at some of our roads and if we look at power generation today, if we look at the ports and the amount of cargo coming in there, all of this was built because the bankers had the courage to lend. Today, we must not do anything for them to lose that courage,"" Bhattacharya said.
Bhattacharya was speaking at the CNBC-TV18’s India Business Leader Awards 2018 presented by Standard Chartered in New Delhi on 6 April where she received the Lifetime Achievement Award. Banks have also been instrumental in opening Jan Dhan accounts and implement the direct benefit transfer scheme for the government, she added.
Her comments come at a time when investigating agencies are probing allegations of financial irregularities in some banks, while the government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are taking several steps to deal with about $10 trillion of toxic assets in India’s banking sector that has affected their ability to finance new projects. 
The steps taken by the government include reforms in bankruptcy law to ensure quick turnaround of failed businesses and wherever not possible, to recover the value of assets before it erodes and redeploy it productively in the economy. 
Banks have already taken several large defaulters to bankruptcy court and are exploring turnaround possibilities. 
Another set of changes to the bankruptcy code is in the making to fine tune the law based on experience since 2016 when the current code became fully operational.
When asked whether banks should now focus more on corporate governance in the next few years, Bhattacharya said that applied to all businesses, including banks.
“Overall in India, we need to see an improvement in corporate governance. Actually, in India, a lot of things have been done on an informal basis. A lot of people have treated their businesses as their own instead of considering that they are trustees of a business. A business is a separate entity. It is not the same as the owner of a business. That is where corporate governance comes in. And that is true of all businesses as well as banks. And banks deal in trust. Trust is the biggest resource that we have. Therefore, we cannot possibly have that trust break,"" she said.
Bhattacharya said this is not the best of times to introduce oneself as a banker, at least in India. 
“But that is something that makes me very sad. Because while we in India have a habit of concentrating on the negatives, we forget the very many positives that are there and what the banking system has done for the country,"" she said"
1005,2018-04-11,State Bank,"Uttam Galva Steels, whose lenders include SBI, Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank, has sought more time from NCLT to file a response to the bankruptcy petition

Mumbai: Debt-ridden Uttam Galva Steels Ltd Tuesday said the State Bank of India (SBI) has rejected its offer for a one-time settlement of dues. 
Mumbai: Debt-ridden Uttam Galva Steels Ltd Tuesday said the State Bank of India (SBI) has rejected its offer for a one-time settlement of dues.
The company, which is undergoing bankruptcy resolution, last month offered to pay Rs2,885 crore out of its total dues of Rs5,650 crore.
Uttam Galva Steels informed the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that it received SBI’s rejection letter on Monday.
The company now plans to file a reply to the bankruptcy petition.
 “We are trying to resolve the matter with SBI as well as the other lenders. We have given one offer that was rejected by the bank,"" J.P. Sen, senior counsel appearing for Uttam Galva told the NCLT bench. “We need more time to talk further with SBI as well as other banks. We are also seeking more time from the tribunal to file our reply in the matter since the rejection letter from SBI has reached us only yesterday night.""
SBI is the largest in a consortium of 18 banks that lent to Uttam Galva. The steel firm also owes Rs850 crore and Rs650 crore to Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank, respectively.
Arguing before an NCLT division bench of B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy, SBI counsel Ameya Gokhale of law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas said, “This company is part of the list issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) where the central banker had mandated to refer for early resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). We have instruction to go ahead with the petition... The company has defaulted on Rs1,486 crore. SBI had provided four separate facilities on which the steel company has defaulted."" 
Uttam Galva is part of RBI’s so-called second list of defaulters against whom the central bank had directed lenders to take action. 
Uttam Galva can file its reply by 12 April, when the bench will hear the matter again.
Earlier, on 24 March, Uttam Galva informed the stock exchange that it had received approvals from BSE and NSE for declassification of world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal as a promoter of the company. 
An email query to the company did not elicit any answer till press time. On Tuesday, Uttam Galva Steels Ltd shares closed at Rs12.95 a share on BSE, 4.7% below its previous closing."
1004,2018-04-12,State Bank,"CBI is focusing on the execution of letters of undertaking fraudulently issued by PNB's Brady House branch in favour of foreign branches of Indian banks

New Delhi: Two deputy general manager (DGM)-level officers of State Bank of India (SBI) posted in Frankfurt in Germany and Mauritius are being questioned on Thursday by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the $2 billion scam in Punjab National Bank (PNB) allegedly involving billionaire jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, officials said.  
New Delhi: Two deputy general manager (DGM)-level officers of State Bank of India (SBI) posted in Frankfurt in Germany and Mauritius are being questioned on Thursday by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the $2 billion scam in Punjab National Bank (PNB) allegedly involving billionaire jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi, officials said. 
They said the agency is focusing on the execution of letters of undertaking (LoUs) fraudulently issued by PNB’s Brady House branch in favour of foreign branches of Indian banks. According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, LoUs in gems and jewellery sector should have a validity of 90 days but this crucial factor was conveniently ignored by Punjab National Bank in issuing such guarantees to the companies of Modi and Choksi. 
For outstanding buyer’s credit, the LoUs are established for about 360 days ab-initio, PNB has alleged. “This should have evoked suspicion in the minds of overseas branches of Indian banks extending buyers’ credit. These branches never raised any alarm on violation of RBI guidelines and continued to provide funding against fraudulent LoUs,"" it has alleged. 
During the questioning of officials of Indian banks posted abroad, the CBI asked these crucial questions. The officials were asked why several discrepancies in the LoUs issued by PNB were not considered by the banks extending credit facilities to the companies of Modi and Choksi without raising alarms. 
The $2 billion scam became public in January after the CBI registered an FIR in the matter, but by that time both the high-profile jewellers had left India with family, they said. It is alleged that Choksi and Modi got LoUs and foreign letters of credit (FLCs) of $2 billion issued in favour of foreign branches of Indian banks based on fraudulent claims. 
The accused PNB officials did not enter the instructions for these LoUs in their internal software to avoid scrutiny. They were sent through an international messaging system for banking called SWIFT, which is used to pass instructions among banks globally to transfer funds. An LoU is a guarantee given by an issuing bank to Indian banks having branches abroad to grant short-term credit to the applicant. 
In case of default, the bank issuing the LoU has to pay the liability to the credit-giving bank along with the accruing interest. The PNB officials allegedly sent these messages to Indian banks—Canara Bank, State Bank of India, Bank of India, Axis Bank, Allahabad Bank—located in Antwerp, Hong Kong, Bahrain, Mauritius, Frankfurt."

Mumbai: Debt-laden Uttam Galva Steels Ltd on Monday offered to repay its creditors in full, after its previous offer to pay back 51% of its dues was rejected last week. The steelmaker also sought time to arrange the funds.
On 12 April, lead lender State Bank of India (SBI) said it rejected the Uttam Galva offer because under that proposal, it would have had to wait until 2042 for the last instalment.

Investors also expects that going ahead its non banking operations will continue to give robust growth in future.
“Kotak Bank has undoubtedly proven its competitive edge over its private sector peers with higher fee income, superior asset quality management and effective management of financial business arms. It continues to witness moderation in SMA-2 balance, which clearly suggests a stable trend on asset quality front. Looking ahead, we expect strong traction in earnings to continue owing to robust growth in loan book, moderate credit cost and healthy margins,"" said HDFC Securities in a 19 January note.

Maintaining that the anonymity of the donors is maintained, the finance ministry in a statement said the random serial number on the bonds is not visible to naked eye and the same is not even noted by the issuing bank, the SBI.

Several other lenders, including PNB, Canara Bank and Axis Bank claimed that cash shortage at ATMs was limited to select pockets. Unusual spurt in demand for currency led to many ATMs and banks running out of cash in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, poll-bound Karnataka and some other states even as the government and the RBI assured the public that there was no currency shortage. 
“Availability of cash in SBI ATM has improved in the last 24 hours. Efforts are being made on a continuous basis to improve the cash availability further in a few geographies.

“Cash withdrawals in H2 are always more than the H1 due to many reasons like festival and procurement season that fall in H2 but in FY18 such a large increase is still not self explanatory,"" the report added.
Further, the report highlights that the income velocity of currency with the public has declined in FY18, an indication that higher denomination currency of Rs2,000 is not adequately circulated.
“We believe, there has been a forced shift in currency composition with more of smaller denomination notes in circulation now, which is positive,"" the report noted. 
On 17 April, Mint reported that various states, including Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telengana, Maharashtra and Bihar, were facing a cash crunch at ATMs.

In a late evening statement on Tuesday, RBI clarified that there is no currency shortage. However, the central bank said that shortage may be felt in some pockets largely due to logistical issues of replenishing ATMs frequently and that it was increasing the production of currency notes. 
The central bank also said it was “asking steps to move currency to areas which are witnessing unusually large cash withdrawals."""

“The decline in ATM withdrawal in the fourth quarter could actually be a seasonal phenomenon apart from the usual reasons floating around like currency shortage. This strongly supports our contention that the current shortage could be superficial rather than real,"" the report said. 
Cash withdrawals in H2 are always more than H1 due to many reasons like festival season and procurement season which always fall in H2 but in FY18 the increase is not self- explanatory. Currency in circulation has surpassed the pre- demonetisation level of Rs17.98 trillion to reach Rs18.29 trillion by March 2018. The report said the sudden surge in currency in circulation is perplexing. 
The quarterly growth in Q4 of FY18 shows that from an average growth of 4.4% of five years between FY12 and FY16, growth has shot up to 8%. “This is despite the fact that economy had achieved remonetization and digital modes have also gained traction in a big way,"" it said. 
Interestingly, in a report SBI Research had said on Wednesday that the cash shortfall was nearly Rs70,000 crore in the system. This comes even as government and the RBI claimed that there was no shortage of currency. 
Based on the nominal GDP growth of 10.8% and 9.8% in FY17 and FY18 respectively, currency with the public would have been  ₹ 9.4 trillion by March 2018, the report had said. However, currently currency with public is only  ₹ 7.5 trillion which shows a gap of  ₹ .9 trillion. But the increase in digital payment compensates some part of the existing gap to the tune of  ₹ .2 trillion. “Therefore, the apparent shortfall is around  ₹ 70,000 crore or even less,"" the report had said."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday said people in smaller towns can withdraw up to Rs2,000 a day from its point of sale (PoS) machines at retail outlets free of charge, a move aimed at easing cash crunch in some parts of the country.  
New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Thursday said people in smaller towns can withdraw up to Rs2,000 a day from its point of sale (PoS) machines at retail outlets free of charge, a move aimed at easing cash crunch in some parts of the country. 
As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, the withdrawal limit from PoS machines at retail outlets in Tier 1 and 2 cities is  ₹ ,000 per card, per day and  ₹ ,000 in smaller towns. “For withdrawals up to  ₹ 2000, @TheOfficialSBI has cash@POS facility @ 4.78 lac POS machines. 
“Customer can use SBI & any other bank debit card to withdraw cash up to  ₹ 1,000 in Tier 3 to 6 & up to  ₹ 1,000 in Tier 1 & 2 cities per card per day presently without any charges,"" Neeraj Vyas, DMD (chief operating officer) of SBI tweeted. 
SBI has a total of 6.08 lakh PoS machines of which 4.78 lakh are enabled to dispense cash to the customers of SBI as well as other banks which offer this facility. There have been reports of ATMs running dry from Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 
While talking to reporters in New Delhi Thursday morning, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the problem of cash crunch being faced in some states will be resolved by tomorrow as currency is being transported to areas which are facing the shortage. 
“It is not a uniform cash crunch problem. It is there in geographies like Telangana and Bihar. We are hoping that the problem will be resolved by tomorrow because cash is in transition and it is reaching these states by today evening,"" Kumar said."

New Delhi: Time is not ripe for large scale privatisation of public sector banks (PSBs) given the current socio-economic conditions in the country, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Thursday. 
Privatisation has not always worked well, and ownership does not matter as there are both good and bad companies in both private and public sectors, he said. 
“On banking, my view is that the social economic conditions in India as of now are not ripe for large scale privatisation of the banks. “May be, you will reach that stage of development in next 50 years if you continue to grow at the pace at which we are growing,"" Kumar said at the Mindmine Summit 2018 here. 
PSBs are much more than commercial entities as they have to fulfil social obligations, and that they have done quite well, he said. 
Certain industry chambers have stated that the government should consider privatising PSBs as over  ₹ 2.6 trillion capital infusion in the past 11 years has had limited impact in improving their health. 
Several experts, including chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian and Former NITI Aayog vice-chairman Arvind Panagariya, had pitched for privatisation of PSBs after a spate of frauds were unearthed in state-owned banks, including the more than RS 13,000- crore scam in the Punjab National Bank (PNB). 
However, Nobel Peace Prize-winning economist Muhammad Yunus has said that he was not in favour of privatisation of PSBs as private banks had not shown any ‘exceptional performance’ in many countries."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Thursday said businesses should adjust to the new one-day default norm under the revised non-performing assets (NPA) framework and ensure timely payment of their loan dues.  
New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Thursday said businesses should adjust to the new one-day default norm under the revised non-performing assets (NPA) framework and ensure timely payment of their loan dues. 
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) deputy governor N.S. Vishwanathan on Wednesday raised concerns over the large number of borrowers failing on the one-day default norm and asked the lenders to take this as a warning indicator warranting action. 
The deputy governor, who is in-charge of the banking regulations department, also said banks should warn their customers that one-day default will lead them to the watch list for resolution. “I think that is perfectly alright. Whatever is the new reality, everybody should adjust to the new ground reality, sooner the better,"" the SBI chairman told reporters in New Delhi. 
When asked if he was supporting the RBI on the 12 February circular on revised NPA recognition norms, Kumar said what Vishwanathan meant is that there is a discipline in the bond market, so in the loan market also similar discipline has to be there. 
“Everybody knows that when the payment is due, so they should manage the cash flow in such a manner that payment is paid on due date,"" Kumar said. In Pune on Wednesday, Vishwanathan said the revised framework tries to reduce the arbitrage options that borrowers are currently enjoying while raising funds through bank borrowing compared to raising funds from the market. 
“If a borrower delays coupon/principal payment on a corporate bond even for a day, the market would penalise the borrower heavily—the rating would be downgraded, the yields on the bonds would shoot up, cost of further financing would increase, suits would be filed by investors etc.,"" said the RBI deputy governor.
 Non-performing assets in the banking sector were over Rs8.31 lakh crore at the end of December 2017."

New Delhi: Currency crunch seen in many parts of the country in past few days showed signs of easing on Thursday with 86% of ATMs coming online, cash being transported to deficit areas and government presses working overtime to print new notes, officials said. 
India’s largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar said the problem will be resolved by Friday.
“It is not a uniform cash crunch problem. It is there in geographies like Telangana and Bihar. We are hoping that the problem will be resolved by tomorrow because cash is in transition and it is reaching these states by today evening,"" SBI’s Kumar told reporters in New Delhi. 
Meanwhile, government officials said that with special arrangements being made to transport cash to areas that during the last three days faced an “unusual spurt in demand"", 86% of the 2.2 lakh ATMs were operational, dispensing cash. 
This was higher than 80% operational ATMs on Wednesday and just 60% working ATMs on Tuesday. The shortage has been blamed on the inadequate availability of Rs2,000 currency notes, which sources in the government said could be because of hoarding ahead of elections. 
Also, ATM cassettes had not been configured to dispense smaller sized Rs200 notes. An official said the government has ramped up printing of currency notes and is operating all the four presses 24x7. The presses this week have been minting Rs500 and Rs200 notes without a break to meet an estimated Rs70,000 crore of currency shortfall in the country. 
On an average, the four presses of Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited (SPMCIL) operate for 18-19 hours daily with a 3-4 hour break. But since the time ATMs ran dry, the presses are operating 24X7, the official told PTI. Such overtime printing was last seen post demonetisation when the printing of new Rs2,000 notes was fast-tracked to meet the liquidity shortage in the market. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had on Tuesday stated that there is sufficient cash in its vaults and currency chests. “Nevertheless, printing of the notes has been ramped up in all the 4 note presses."" Holding accountable those who are hoarding cash, Kumar said the money should be recycled, meaning that if people withdraw money from the bank and the money needs to be deposited back as well. 
“If we (people) hold everything, then whatever supply we (banks) do, it will be insufficient for the country. So it is important that the currency is also recycled,"" he said. Commenting on the issue, telecom minister Manoj Sinha said the hype around currency shortage has been created to mislead the nation. 
“I feel that it is unnecessary hype which has been created. Finance Secretary and RBI have said that there is no cash crunch in 80% of the ATMs and there is enough cash available in RBI chest also. It is a political conspiracy to mislead the nation. People should remain cautious about such conspiracies,"" he said. 
Meanwhile, All-India Banks Employees Association (AIBEA) has threatened to launch an agitation saying bank staff was facing public anger due to the cash crunch. It blamed the government and the RBI for the situation."
989,2018-04-24,State Bank,"While withdrawals in the second halves of fiscal years have always been higher than the first, the SBI report said the increase in FY18 was unusual

Has there been too much withdrawn from automated teller machines (ATMs)? 
Has there been too much withdrawn from automated teller machines (ATMs)?
A report by State Bank of India (SBI) has claimed that cash withdrawals rose sharply the second half of 2017-18. While withdrawals in the second halves of fiscal years have always been higher than the first, the SBI report said the increase in FY18 was unusual.
When we look at the data posted by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), some interesting patterns emerge in terms of cash withdrawals from ATMs. Firstly, if we look at the number of cash withdrawals from ATMs per month, we see that the number of withdrawals is still lower than what it used to be prior to demonetization in November 2016. 
In fact, going by figure 1, it is likely to take a long time for the number of withdrawals from ATMs to hit pre-demonetization levels (as shown by the blue trend line).
Instead, after demonetization, people are withdrawing larger amounts from each ATM visits. While it is hard to draw causality, this is most likely because of memories of shut ATMs and long lines in the period immediately following demonetization. 
In fact, as figure 2 shows, as soon as cash was widely available following demonetization, the average ATM withdrawal amount became higher than in the pre-note ban period. 
And this average withdrawal amount has only gotten higher with time, hitting close to Rs3,500 over the past few months. 
Putting these two together, the total amount withdrawn from ATMs each month shows a rather interesting pattern (figure 3). This amount immediately hit pre-demonetization levels as soon as adequate cash was available in March 2017, and has increased sharply since then. 
In fact, in October and December last year, the total amount of cash withdrawn from ATMs was back at the level dictated by the pre-demonetization trend. 
In this sense, the SBI claim that withdrawals in the second half of 2017-18 were higher than that in the second halves of earlier financial years (barring 2016-17) is correct.
However, if this trend is going to continue, it is going to put further pressure on ATMs—and on the banks and RBI!"

New Delhi: SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd on Thursday reported 13.4% rise in net profit at Rs381.21 crore in March quarter of 2017-18. The company’s net profit was Rs336.05 crore in the January-March quarter of 2016-17.
 The total income of the private sector life insurer however came down to Rs10,052.32 crore in the fourth quarter of last fiscal, as against Rs10,775.70 crore in the year ago period.
For the entire fiscal 2017-18, SBI’s net profit increased to Rs1,150.38 crore, from Rs954.65 crore in 2016-17, SBI Life said in a regulatory filing. The total income last fiscal grew to Rs33,760.54 crore, compared to Rs30,276.42 crore in the previous fiscal. 
The value of new business (VNB) stood at Rs1,390 crore for 2017-18, up by 34%. The embedded value increased to Rs19,070 crore, registering a growth of 15.3% year on year.
New business annualised premium equivalent increased by 26.9% in 2017-18 to Rs8,540 crore from Rs6,730 crore in preceding fiscal, the company said in a statement.
Based on individual rated premium (IRP), SBI Life said its market share increased from 20.7% in 2016-17 to 21.8% in fiscal ended March 2018. While the overall market share (on IRP) grew to 12.3% from 11.1%.

At first glance, SBI Life Insurance Co.’s performance lends an extra shine to the leadership position that it has recently acquired in the market. The fact that the stock has returned 17% on its listing price would mean investors were rather confident it would do well anyway. 
At first glance, SBI Life Insurance Co.’s performance lends an extra shine to the leadership position that it has recently acquired in the market. The fact that the stock has returned 17% on its listing price would mean investors were rather confident it would do well anyway.
For financial year 2017-18, the country’s largest life insurer reported a 30% growth in its new business premium, largely led by retail and a 34% growth in value of new business, while operating expenses declined. Profit after tax accordingly grew 20.5% to Rs1,150 crore for the year.
That may look impressive, but its internal metrics pale in front of competitors ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and HDFC Standard Life. All three insurers have the advantage of access to a wide network of the branches of their respective parents in addition to having commission-based agents and the online channel. While both ICICI Prudential Life and HDFC Life’s networks have pushed protection plans more, SBI Life hasn’t been able to do the same.
That an insurer of SBI Life’s size continues to maintain its rapid growth rate should not be ignored. 
But it pays to look at where the growth is really coming from. 
And here HDFC Standard Life wins hands down. SBI Life’s growth was led by its market-linked products, pushed by its agents given high commissions. Nearly 56% of the new business comes from unit linked plans (ULIP) and they have increased at a compound annual growth rate of 48%. 
To be fair, it is understandable that ULIPs flew off the shelves considering the fact that they fall outside the purview of the long-term capital gains tax that the government imposed on equity investments. But what should worry investors is that the margin-friendly protection plans have a mere 6% share in new business. Granted that they have grown 23% for FY18, but protection plans’ growth over a three-year period is just 12%.
No wonder the insurer’s rivals reported a much better product mix and therefore a finer profitability outlook. 
SBI Life is not able to push protection plans like its competitors and it will need to fix this to safeguard its profitability in future. Until then, the stock is unlikely to break significant ground from its current levels. Analysts have a ‘Buy’ rating on the stock even though, at current levels, it trades at a multiple of nearly four times its embedded value for FY18, richer than ICICI Prudential Life but far cheaper than HDFC Standard Life."

Kolkata: In a blow to Kolkata’s pride, a city which lives in the shadow of its hallowed business heritage, the State Bank of India (SBI) will cease to have its annual accounts board meeting in the city from this year—a break from a tradition which dates to 1806 when Bank of Calcutta, one of the forebears of the country’s biggest lender, was founded. 
Kolkata: In a blow to Kolkata’s pride, a city which lives in the shadow of its hallowed business heritage, the State Bank of India (SBI) will cease to have its annual accounts board meeting in the city from this year—a break from a tradition which dates to 1806 when Bank of Calcutta, one of the forebears of the country’s biggest lender, was founded.
Though SBI is headquartered in Mumbai, its central accounts office continues to be in Kolkata. That drew the entire top brass of the bank to Kolkata every summer to finalise the annual accounts, but not anymore. It was logistically challenging, said two key officials, who asked not to be identified.
The Hindu Business Line reported on Tuesday that the bank had decided to hold this year’s board meeting to finalise its annual accounts in Mumbai.
Historically, the central accounts office was in Kolkata because at the time of formation of Imperial Bank of India in 1921 by the merger of the three presidency banks of British India, Bank of Bengal (which started off as Bank of Calcutta) was the biggest. The two others were Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras, started, respectively, in 1840 and 1843. The central accounts office was set up in Kolkata a few years after the merger.
In 1955, the union government took over the Imperial Bank of India under an Act of the Parliament and renamed it SBI. It was recorded in the same Act that the central accounts office would continue to be in Kolkata though the headquarters would be in Mumbai.
To be sure, nothing in the bank’s by-laws requires the management to hold its annual accounts board meeting in Kolkata. It went on as a tradition—an annual fixture that would unite the bosses with the roots of the bank, though the imposing edifice at 1 Strand Road which was the home of Bank of Bengal since 1825 has long been demolished.
“Don’t read too much into this,"" said Abhik Ray, a historian who works closely with SBI and its archives. “The decision must have been taken keeping in mind the costs and logistical challenges of signing the annual accounts in Kolkata."""

Mumbai: Lenders won’t hesitate to push insolvent firms into liquidation if potential buyers try to suppress prices under India’s bankruptcy process, the head of the nation’s largest lender said. 
Mumbai: Lenders won’t hesitate to push insolvent firms into liquidation if potential buyers try to suppress prices under India’s bankruptcy process, the head of the nation’s largest lender said.
“It is important that we give a message that if potential bidders are trying to suppress the values, then banks are not going to accept it,"" Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India (SBI), said in an interview to Bloomberg Television. Proposed resolution plans must either bring value to the enterprise or a meaningful recovery for creditors, he said.
A dozen of India’s most-indebted companies are making their way through bankruptcy courts, testing how effective a 16-month-old law will be in creating a time-bound resolution process for more than $210 billion in stressed assets overall. Among these, Alok Industries Ltd and Lanco Infratech Ltd are headed for liquidation after bids to buy the insolvent firms were rejected by the lenders’ committee, given they required steep haircuts on outstanding debt, exchange filings show.
Lenders in Asia’s third-largest economy would be keen to find a resolution plan for each stressed firm, if the enterprise is fundamentally viable, Kumar told Bloomberg Television’s Haslinda Amin on the sidelines of the Asian Development Bank’s annual meeting in Manila.
If bidders or the indebted firm “cannot service even 5% or 7% of outstanding credit obligations, then I don’t see any reason for reviving each and every enterprise,"" he said. “If the recovery could be more than 25%, then resolution is always an option.""
SBI is involved in most of the large bankruptcy proceedings that are currently underway.
The Reserve Bank of India last year forced lenders to take some of India’s largest defaulters to bankruptcy court, capping the move with a February decision that gave creditors just six months to restructure overdue accounts or else take them through insolvency. Once the judiciary is involved, the lenders’ committee has just 270 days to back a bidder for the company, failing which the firm will be wound down with its assets stripped-off and sold. Bloomberg"
983,2018-05-08,State Bank,"The consortium of lenders led by SBI has asked Uttam Galva Steels to sign a binding agreement with respect to its repayment offer

Mumbai: Lenders to Uttam Galva Steels Ltd have asked the company to furnish bank guarantees amounting to at least 25% of its outstanding loans, said two people directly aware of the development.  
Mumbai: Lenders to Uttam Galva Steels Ltd have asked the company to furnish bank guarantees amounting to at least 25% of its outstanding loans, said two people directly aware of the development. 
The consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI) has also asked the company to sign a binding agreement with respect to its repayment offer, which would lay down the repayment schedule in a time-bound manner, the people cited above said on the condition of anonymity.
The development assumes importance because the eligibility of ArcelorMittal to bid for bankrupt steel maker Essar Steel Ltd depends on whether Uttam Galva, in which ArcelorMittal was earlier classified as a promoter, repays all overdue loans to the lenders. 
Mint reported on 2 May that lenders to Essar Steel had said ArcelorMittal was liable to repay dues to lenders. 
“This has a direct bearing on ArcelorMittal’s eligibility as a bidder for Essar Steel,"" said one of the two people cited above. 
Spokespersons for ArcelorMittal and Uttam Galva declined to comment. 
Uttam Galva, according to the second person cited above, has not responded to the lenders’ offer. 
Mint had reported on 16 April that Uttam Galva offered to repay its creditors in full after its previous offer to pay back 51% of its dues was rejected last week. 
The steelmaker has sought time to arrange funds. On 12 April, lead lender SBI had rejected the Uttam Galva offer because under the initial proposal, the bank would have had to wait until 2042 for the last instalment.
While making the offer to repay the full amount, Uttam Galva told the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that the company was willing to repay all its debt, but needed additional time to arrange the funds. The firm told the court some overseas investors were willing to invest in Uttam Galva and hence, the company is seeking a small window to arrange the amount. 
Uttam Galva features in the second list of 28 accounts issued by the Reserve Bank of India to the banks for being resolved under the insolvency and bankruptcy code. 
Mint reported on 2 May that lenders to Essar Steel have asked ArcelorMittal to clear the debt outstanding for two defaulting companies—Uttam Galva and KSS Petron—in which it was a large shareholder until recently. 
Loan to KSS Petron, an engineering procurement and construction (EPC) company, was classified as a non-performing asset, in 2015. 
According to the second person cited above, Uttam Galva is yet to make a binding offer to repay its debt. “There is uncertainty around the selection of the highest bidder for Essar Steel. The bidders (ArcelorMittal) are worried that their efforts with respect to arrangement of funds for debt repayment may go waste if the asset does not come to them,"" he said.
 So far, ArcelorMittal has made a presentation to the lenders explaining its eligibility as a resolution applicant during the first round of bidding. 
The lenders have given a week’s time to the bidders—ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius to resolve the issues around eligibility. 
“The notice has been sent out. Seven days have been given to clear off the dues and implement any other cures that have been prescribed,"" a banker with direct knowledge of the development said.
Apart from ArcelorMittal, Numetal Mauritius had submitted a bid for Essar Steel in the first round. The lenders have also asked Numetal to prove its eligibility. 
Numetal’s bid was rejected in the first round as Rewant Ruia is the beneficiary of the trust that backs Aurora Enterprises, which in turn holds 25% stake in Numetal. 
Rewant Ruia is son of Ravi Ruia, vice-chairman of Essar Group. The lenders have told Numetal that if it wants to become eligible, Rewant Ruia will have to move out.

982,2018-05-21,State Bank,"RBI has allowed the banks to spread provisioning for depreciation in the bond portfolio over four quarters. Will SBI take advantage of that? Or, will it take the hit at one go in Q4?

Punjab National Bank (PNB) has reported a record Rs13,417-crore loss for the March quarter (Q4). All eyes are now on State Bank of India (SBI), the nation’s largest lender.  
Punjab National Bank (PNB) has reported a record Rs13,417-crore loss for the March quarter (Q4). All eyes are now on State Bank of India (SBI), the nation’s largest lender. 
It will certainly report a loss on Tuesday, more than what it had posted in the December quarter (Rs2,416 crore) but may not surpass that of PNB. 
Two critical factors will impact the quantum of SBI’s loss in Q4—provision for the erosion in the value of its bond portfolio as well as the bad assets referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for resolution.
When the prices of bonds drop, their yields rise; the banks need to make good the loss in the value of their bond portfolio. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed the banks to spread the provisioning for depreciation in the bond portfolio over four quarters. Will SBI take advantage of that? Or, will it take the hit at one go in Q4?
Similarly, RBI has relaxed the provision norms for the bad loans referred to the NCLT. It had initially wanted banks to provide for 50% of secured loans upfront but later brought it down to 40%. 
SBI has referred at least Rs78,000 crore worth of high-value bad loans to the NCLT. In many cases, the bank had already provided 50% or more but the prospects of recovery in some of the cases have brightened. Will SBI write back part of the excess provision already made?
SBI’s loss will certainly be less than PNB’s but more than that of Canara Bank (Rs4,860 crore).
SBI’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) could rise up to Rs2.2 trillion, around 11% of its loan assets; after provisioning, the net NPAs could be around 6%, far lower than PNB’s 18.38% gross NPAs and 11.24% net NPAs. 
Will SBI see good days after the March quarter? Since 2010, successive SBI chiefs have been making statements, saying the worst has been over on the NPA front. Is the current boss Rajnish Kumar too promising the worst is over? I would not be surprised if SBI ends up reporting a loss in the June quarter too, but it may see happier days from the second quarter of the current fiscal year with NPAs going down, recovery of bad assets and higher fee and interest income.
Kumar is quietly making some key structural changes in SBI. In his scheme of things, profitability is more important than expanding the balance sheet. 
Incidentally, more than half of SBI’s loan book now is made of retail assets where the margin is higher. It is also focusing on fee income, aggressively.
Among other things, Kumar has changed the mandate of the bank’s corporate accounts group (CAG) which has been handling large loans of Rs500 crore and more since mid-1990s. Now, CAG will focus only on companies with at least AA rating where the probability of default is very low. Along with this, the credit review department has been revamped and the multi-tier credit committee has been reconstituted to ensure the quality of loan assets.
Going beyond credit lines, SBI is also forging relationships with large corporations which may not have loan requirement but present other business opportunities such as vendor financing, supply chain management, among others. More importantly, Kumar has curtailed the role of SBI Capital Markets Ltd, its merchant banking unit, in project financing. 
From now on, SBI Caps will focus on investment banking and not team up with the parent for advisory on projecting financing and loan syndication, in which it has traditionally been involved. Doing it directly, the bank will cut down the turnaround time of sanctioning project loans. A well laid-out succession plan, faster promotions and greater emphasis on training complete Kumar’s idea of a new SBI. 
Roughly, one out of every three Indians is an SBI customer. Its 278,000 employees serve them through 24,000 branches and 59,000 ATMs across India. Kumar can win his battle against NPAs and lift the bank to the next orbit only if he gets government support in terms of freedom of not doling out money to certain sectors where recovery is tough for many reasons as well as keeping the morale of his colleagues high, by encouraging them to lend and rewarding them for good work, including giving stock options—a proposal long pending with the government.

981,2018-05-21,State Bank,"Every $10 per barrel rise in oil price results in additional import bill of $8 billion, which will slash GDP by 16bps, increase fiscal deficit by 8bps, CAD by 27bps and inflation by 30bps, notes SBI Ecowrap

New Delhi: Rising crude oil prices may worsen the current account deficit (CAD) to 2.5% of the GDP in the current financial year, says a report by SBI Ecowrap. 
New Delhi: Rising crude oil prices may worsen the current account deficit (CAD) to 2.5% of the GDP in the current financial year, says a report by SBI Ecowrap.
The CAD—difference between inflow and outflow of foreign exchange—is estimated at 1.9% for 2017-18. According to SBI Ecowrap, every $10/barrel increase in oil price results in additional import bill of $8 billion. This in turn will decrease GDP by 16bps, increase fiscal deficit by 8bps, CAD by 27bps and inflation by 30bps, the research report said adding these are just model estimates and actuals could be much different.
“...crude prices are expected to impact imports. This will stretch the 2018-19 CAD to 2.5% of GDP. The exports need further push so that the external metrics remain stable,"" the report said.
The report further said that, for 2017-18, the exports grew at 9.78%. With April 2018 exports exhibiting only 5.17% growth, it appears that the outbound shipments have still not overcome the goods and service tax (GST) implementation issues, it noted.
Crude price rise by $17 in the span of a year has been reflected in the imports, showing a growth of 19.59%. “Crude prices are expected to rise further this year and we expect imports to grow by at least 14%,"" the report said and added that worsening of the trade deficit can impact the rupee further.
Foreign investment inflows have also not been benevolent this year. Between April-May 2018, outflows to the tune of $5 billion have happened. The twin impact of investment outflows and worsening trade balance can hit rupee further. So, the exports (both services and merchandise) need further push to keep the external metrics stable."
978,2018-05-22,State Bank,"SBI is likely to report a net loss for the March quarter because of a hike in provisions to cover rising bad loans and losses on its bond portfolio

Mumbai: India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is seen reporting on Tuesday a quarterly loss for the second time in row. According to a poll of 14 analysts by Bloomberg, the bank is expected to post a Rs1,728 crore loss for the March quarter, or Q4. 
Mumbai: India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is seen reporting on Tuesday a quarterly loss for the second time in row. According to a poll of 14 analysts by Bloomberg, the bank is expected to post a Rs1,728 crore loss for the March quarter, or Q4.
SBI had posted net loss of Rs2,416 crore for the fiscal third quarter.
1. Profitability
SBI is likely to report a loss because of a hike in provisions to cover rising bad loans and losses on its bond portfolio. Non-performing assets (NPAs) are expected to surge because of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) revised norms on stressed asset resolution.
Rising bond yields has strained profitability of most banks as they have to set aside funds in the form of mark-to-market (MTM) provisioning to make up for the losses. Bond yield and prices move in opposite direction.
“RBI circular on spreading of MTM losses over the next four quarters including the investment depreciation related losses for Q3 FY18 could provide some headroom to SBI. We await the bank’s move towards the same,"" Centrum Broking said in a pre-earnings report.
ALSO READ: SBI too will post Q4 loss, but how much?
2. Bad loans
SBI is likely to report a sharp jump in gross NPAs because of new additions from its restructured book, according to analysts. In its 12 February circular, RBI has withdrawn host of restructuring schemes and has set a 180-day timeline for resolution. SBI had over Rs36,900 crore of loans under erstwhile schemes like 5/25 refinancing, strategic debt restructuring (SDR) and scheme for sustainable structuring of stressed assets (S4A) as of 31 December 2017.
Analysts said that SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar’s commentary on asset quality trends and resolution under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is key monitorable. SBI’s exposure fund-based exposure to accounts, which are part of the two lists of RBI and referred for insolvency stood at over 78,000 crore. The bank is holding a total provision of 60% against these accounts.
3. Loan growth
Analysts are expecting SBI to continue to print subdued loan growth mainly because of its cautious stance of corporate lending. However, retail loans are expected to grow in double digits. As of 31 December, SBI’s total loans grew 2.5% year-on-year to Rs19.2 trillion. Given the bank’s focus on profitability instead of balance sheet expansion, Kumar’s commentary on corporate loan opportunities would be watched out to gauge broader sectoral trend. Most large banks are limiting their exposure to only better rated companies. SBI too is working on a similar strategy.
4. Internal changes
Apart from earnings, SBI chairman Kumar is expected to spell out bank’s overall long-term strategy on capturing loan growth and risk management. The bank has already changed the mandate of its corporate account group (CAG) department to focus only on companies with at least AA rating. It has also decided not to work with merchant banking unit SBI Capital Markets on project financing and loan syndication. Kumar, who took over in October, may also share his plans on various subsidiaries of SBI. He is also expected to share his thoughts on health of the Indian banking sector, especially state-owned banks."
977,2018-05-22,State Bank,"SBI reports a net loss of Rs7,718 crore for the quarter ending 31 March, the second highest quarterly loss reported by an Indian bank

Mumbai: State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss on higher provisions but forecast that its asset quality will improve substantially in two years, sending its stock higher. 
Mumbai: State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss on higher provisions but forecast that its asset quality will improve substantially in two years, sending its stock higher.
SBI reported a net loss of Rs7,718 crore for the quarter ended 31 March, the second highest quarterly loss reported by an Indian bank. It had reported a quarterly loss of Rs3,442 crore a year ago.
Investors, however, shrugged off the loss after SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said that the worst is behind the lender and it is poised to capture growth opportunities with better focus on risk management and resolution. The stock surged as much as 6.2%, outpacing a 0.75% gain in the BSE Bankex. SBI shares ended up 3.69% on the BSE on Tuesday. 
The bank forecast that by March 2020, it would bring down its gross bad loan ratio to below 6% from the current 10.91%, and its net bad loan ratio to less than 2.3% from 5.73% now.
“As far as the recognition of non-performing assets is concerned, that has been completed. We are fully compliant with the framework (on stressed loan resolution) issued by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) on 12 February,"" Kumar said in a post-earnings press conference.
This is SBI’s second straight quarterly loss as the bank set aside more money to cover bad loans and losses on its bond portfolio. Change in calculation of employee gratuity also added to the losses. 
Punjab National Bank, reeling under a $2 billion scam, on 15 May reported the highest ever quarterly loss by an Indian bank—Rs13,417 crore in the January-March period. 
Kumar attributed the surge in the stock of gross bad loans to the central bank’s circular, where it withdrew a host of loan restructuring schemes and set a 180-day deadline for resolution of all stressed loans. 
Accordingly, fresh loan slippages rose to Rs33,670 crore in the March quarter from Rs25,836 crore in the preceding three months. Total gross bad loans at the end of 31 March rose to Rs2.2 trillion from Rs1.8 trillion a year ago. 
Kumar said the bulk of the loan slippages were loans which were part of various erstwhile restructuring schemes. With this, the only source of potential stress for the bank is the watchlist, which now stands at Rs25,800 crore. 
Provisions and contingencies surged to Rs28,096 crore in the March quarter from Rs20,932 crore a year ago and Rs18,876 crore in the December quarter. 
Total provisions include the so-called mark-to-market (MTM) provisions to cover losses on its bond portfolio as bond yields surged in the reporting quarter. Bond yield and prices move in opposite directions. 
While RBI has allowed banks to spread MTM provisioning over four quarters, SBI chose to book losses in the March quarter itself, Kumar said. 
However, the bank wrote back some provisions on accounts referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings as allowed by RBI. Kumar said despite that, overall provisioning for these accounts remains at an adequate level of 63% against the total exposure of a little over Rs77,600 crore. 
Kumar said SBI expects the bulk of the resolutions in the first list of NCLT accounts by September and the second list by end of this fiscal. 
“Resolution of NCLT accounts will lead to lower gross NPAs, in addition to better margins,"" SBI said in an analyst presentation."

975,2018-05-23,State Bank,"SBI Q4 results, which saw India's largest bank post a record Rs7,718 crore loss, indicate that the bad loan pain afflicting the banking sector is firmly behind us

The earnings of State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, are a good reflection of how the Indian economy fared and what the outlook is for the coming year. After all, the lender is responsible for more than a quarter of the bank loans given in the country. 
The earnings of State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, are a good reflection of how the Indian economy fared and what the outlook is for the coming year. After all, the lender is responsible for more than a quarter of the bank loans given in the country.
The SBI Q4 results this time around also offered a decent insight on what insolvency procedures have meant for corporations and the country as a whole.
Here are five key things that SBI’s numbers show about itself and the Indian economy as a whole:
Recognize the darkest hour
SBI reported a massive quarterly loss of Rs7,718 crore for Q4 that wiped out the profits of previous quarters to ink a full-year loss of Rs6,547 crore. Even on a consolidated basis, the loss was Rs4,556 crore for the year. This is the second-largest quarterly loss by a bank historically, the highest being by Punjab National Bank. In every sense, fiscal year 2018 (FY18) looks to be the darkest hour for banks as they complete recognition of all the possible toxic assets they hold and own up to their mistakes on risk management. SBI is no different.
The pain is firmly behind us
Yes; SBI reported a nasty gross bad loan ratio of 10.91% or a toxic loan stockpile of a humongous Rs2.2 trillion. This simply states that lenders are recognizing the fault lines on private corporate balance sheets. But the lender reported incremental slippages of Rs33,670 crore, an increase of 30% sequentially. That is not so bad considering that these slippages were basically some bad loans disguised as normal up until now. The removal of all kinds of forbearance on recognition of bad assets by the Reserve Bank of India has made sure this disguise was removed. For FY18, SBI’s slippages were less than the previous year, which means the balance sheet is healing. Stretching it to the economy, it also means incremental pain is less from the private sector.
Hope springs eternal
The highlight of SBI’s earnings was the clear guidance given by the lender’s management. SBI has stated that by March 2020, it would bring down its gross bad loan ratio from the current 11% to below 6%, a slippage ratio of less than 2% and a net bad loan ratio of less than 2.3%. The guidance may not be ambitious but it is nevertheless challenging. The management is confident that economic growth will pick up to provide it opportunities to lend and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will fetch value for assets. SBI’s exposure to the borrowers referred under IBC stands at Rs77,626 crore and it has already got a shot in the arm with the successful resolution of Bhushan Steel Ltd under the code.
Better safe than sorry
Meanwhile, the lender is leaving nothing to chance as it ramped up its provisions yet again. Its provision coverage ratio stands at 66% and that for IBC accounts is 63%. The management is sanguine on the outcome of the cases under the code and expects a resolution to emerge for the first set of 12 cases by September 2019. That means big gains on provisioning.
Fund strong balance sheets through a strong balance sheet
SBI has chosen to cater to only strong corporate balance sheets, explained chairman Rajnish Kumar. It has brought down the number of branches that catered solely to large companies from seven to four and its large corporate vertical will fund borrowers with a rating of minimum AA. It is clear that as various sectors consolidate, SBI will refinance strong balance sheets to fire up an investment climate.
As for the SBI stock, investors forgave the loss and rewarded the lender for its guidance and sent the share price up 3.7% on Tuesday."

Rs7,718 crore 
Rs7,718 crore
What is it? The net loss posted by State Bank of India (SBI) in the three months ended March 2018, almost double of that reported (Rs3,442 crore) in the same period a year ago.
Why is it important? This is the bank’s highest loss ever and the second-largest quarterly loss reported across lenders (after Punjab National Bank). The losses were mainly due to a surge in bad loans and the provisions made against them (Rs28,096 crore in the March quarter, against Rs18,876 crore in the December quarter). Its net and gross NPA (non-performing assets) ratios rose to 5.73% (from 5.61%) and 10.91% in the March quarter (from 10.35%), respectively.
Tell me more: There have been divergences in terms of bad loans, gross NPAs and provisions between the numbers reported by SBI and those assessed by the Reserve Bank of India, the net impact of which is reflected in its current earnings.
10
What is it? The number of people killed after the police opened fire against a group of protesters who were demanding the closure of a copper smelting plant belonging to Sterlite in Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday.
Why is it important? Many local residents have been protesting against the plant and its reported expansion for over three months. Things took an ugly turn on Tuesday and the protestors allegedly began vandalising government property, throwing stones at policemen and torching their vehicles, defying Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code imposed in the town area. Tamil Nadu chief minister E Palaniswami said the police resorted to firing to protect public life and property.
Tell me more: Residents of the town are said to be angry due to the pollution caused by the plant. The chief minister has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident and announced a compensation of Rs10 lakh and jobs to the kin of the deceased, and Rs3 lakh for the injured.
20 years
What is it? The number of years for which Tata Motors produced Indica. On Tuesday, the company announced it would no longer be manufacturing the Indica.
Why is it important? The Indica was a seminal moment in the Indian passenger car journey. It marked the maiden foray of Tata Motors, which was a leader in trucks and buses then, into cars, a diversification it has since widened and deepened. While its diesel roots made it popular in the taxi segment, consumers didn’t warm up to it in the same way.
Tell me more: Tata Motors manufactured 19,042 units of Indica in 2016-17, but this plummeted to 1,686 units in 2017-18.
Rs12.2 crore
What is it? The loan amount that Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings, an investment holding company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries, will reportedly give to Reliance Jio Infocomm to set up a unit in Estonia.
Why is it important? This suggests that Reliance Jio, after disrupting the Indian telecom market with its aggressive pricing, has global ambitions. With its Estonian entry, Reliance Jio would get access to the unified European Union telecom market. Estonia is the first country to offer e-Residency, a government-issued digital ID that gives the freedom to start and run a global business while working from anywhere in the world.
Tell me more: Amidst its global ambitions and going beyond mobile services to enter areas such as the Internet of Things, many senior executives have reportedly quit Reliance Jio recently.

What is it? The number of matches played by Faf du Plessis for Chennai Super Kings, out of a potential 15, in the 2018 Indian Premier League.
Why is it important? Despite not being a regular in this year’s team, the experienced South African batsman anchored the Chennai chase in the first match of the playoffs yesterday against Sunrisers Hyderabad. With 43 runs needed of 18 balls, du Plessis cut loose to register the win for Chennai.
Tell me more: This is Chennai’s seventh appearance in the IPL finals, which is three more than the next best (Mumbai Indians). Delhi Daredevils is the only side to have never made the IPL finals.

The market may take solace that the gross stress has likely peaked, Jefferies said in a note, adding that core profitability should see a cyclical improvement through the second half of 2019.
SBI added Rs33,670 crore of non-performing loans in the March quarter, taking its total to Rs2.23 trillion, or 10.91% of total loans.
Deutsche Bank said it sees better future for SBI and expects core business trends to improve consistently from here on.
SBI is still among the preferred public sector picks because of stronger CASA franchise, better asset quality and capitalisation, CLSA said in a note.
The lender, which accounts for more than a fifth of India’s banking assets, said on Tuesday it aims to grow loans at an annual average of 12% through March 2020, nearly halve its gross non-performing loan ratio, bring down provisioning costs and improve margins.
Credit Suisse and Citi cut their target prices to Rs322 and Rs325 rupees respectively, while Deutsche Bank raised it to Rs330 from Rs320. Jefferies cut its target price to Rs355 from Rs365, while CASA reduced it to Rs340 from Rs360.
Thirty-seven brokerages of the 45 covering the state-run bank rate it “buy"" or higher, six “hold"" and two “strong sell"". Their median price target is Rs350, according to Thomson Reuters data.
SBI’s shares rose as much as 6.2% to Rs269.7, their highest since 1 March, and were headed for a third straight session of gains. The surge was also SBI’s biggest intraday% gain since early November. The Nifty PSU bank index climbed as much as 5%."

New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday said it has attached assets worth Rs14.5 crore of a Gujarat-based firm for allegedly defrauding State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda (BoB) to the tune of over Rs804 crore.
The agency said it has issued a provisional order for attachment of two immovable assets—one located at Nariman Point in Mumbai and the other at Nikumbh complex in Ahmedabad—under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) against M/S ABC Cotspin Pvt. Ltd and its director Ashish Sureshbhai Jobanputra and others.
“The properties have been attached against the amounts remitted outside India,"" the ED said in a statement, adding that they were valued at Rs14.5 crore.
The ED had taken over the case against the Gujarat-based firm taking cognizance of a CBI FIR.
The CBI FIR had alleged that M/S ABC Cotspin Pvt. Ltd and its director entered into a “criminal conspiracy"" with officials of Bank of Baroda in Ahmedabad and SBI in Gondal (Rajkot), and defrauded the two banks to the tune of Rs804.49 crore, the ED said.
The agency said the probe revealed that “the company was availing bill discounting facilities from the two banks against Letter of Credit (LC) of prime banks"", During 2014-15, it said, Jobanputra “without"" making any genuine export got prepared and signed the export documents and presented them to the banks.
“The bank officials also discounted the export bills without proper scrutiny of the bills and without ensuring that shipping bills issued by the Customs authorities are provided for, which is mandatory and are available at the time of discounting.
“They (bank officials) also discounted export bills on the basis of LC issued by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which was restricted,"" it said.
Investigations revealed that ABC Cotspin siphoned off Rs79.49 crore out of India on the pretext of false import that “never"" took place, the ED said. It said that Jobanputra is the “mastermind"" of the fraud and that he along with his family left India soon after conducting these illegal transactions and has now settled in the US. “Enquiries against Jobanputra are also contemplated under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Ordinance, 2018,"" the ED said."

Mumbai: Facebook Inc. is set to launch its WhatsApp payment services to the whole of India as early as next week in an attempt to win market share from rivals Paytm and Google Tez, even though its partners aren’t all ready, said people familiar with the matter.
WhatsApp Pay will partner HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. to process the transfers, and State Bank of India (SBI) will join once it has the necessary systems in place, the people said. Facebook was aiming for a full rollout with four partners but decided to go ahead with just three as its rivals were racing ahead, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.
The entry of WhatsApp into India’s payments space has been likened to WeChat, which reshaped payments in China when it expanded beyond messaging. The pilot version of WhatsApp Pay—started with 1 million users in February—received rave reviews, threatening the market share of incumbents Google Tez and Alibaba-backed Paytm, which lack the benefits of a social network.
“WhatsApp has a great starting point: a monopoly in chat,"" said Vivek Belgavi, leader for financial technology at PwC India. “High engagement makes it a credible competition.""
More than 200 million Indians already use WhatsApp messaging, equivalent to 60% of the US population and a daily active usage that Forrester Inc. estimates to be about 20 times higher than Paytm’s.

Mumbai: The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has hiked retail fixed deposit rates by up to 25 basis points across select tenures, a sign that interest rates are headed northwards.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A fixed deposit of less than Rs1 crore for a period of 1 to 2 years will now fetch an interest rate of 6.65% as against 6.40% earlier. For 2 years to less than 3 years, new deposit rates are fixed at 6.65% as against 6.60% earlier. The rates have been kept unchanged for deposits above Rs1 crore.
The new fixed deposit rates took effect on 28 May.
SBI had last revised its interest rates on 23 March by 10-25 bps for retail deposits of over two years and also in 1-2 years category for deposits of more than Rs1 crore.
The bank is also set to announce its decision on Marginal Cost of funds based Lending rate, or MCLR, on Friday, which is also expected to be revised upwards. The last time SBI had hiked its lending rate was in March when it raised MCLR by 10-20 bps.
Last month, HDFC Bank had revised fixed deposit rates by up to 100 bps.
The increase in SBI FD rates comes ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) monetary policy meeting on 4-5 June. Mint had on 21 May reported that economists have revised their expectations from the policy, with some expecting a hike in the repo rate.
“We have aligned our interest rates with the market. The dividends of demonetisation have faded and we would need deposit growth to pick up from hereon to support an expected increase in credit growth,"" said a senior SBI official requesting anonymity.
For the year ended 31 March 2018, SBI had reported domestic credit growth of 7.5% and deposit growth of 4.2%. The management expects a loan growth of more than 12% by the end of March 2020.
With bond yields rising and liquidity surplus drying up in the bond market, most high rated corporates are shifting to the loan market for their borrowings, the official quoted above said."
969,2018-05-31,State Bank,"SBI Magnum Equity Fund will now be known as SBI Magnum Equity ESG Fund, which will only invest in companies that follow the ESG principle. Here's what it means for investors

SBI Funds Management Ltd, India’s fifth largest fund house, has acquired a conscience, or so it wants us to believe. Effective 16 May, one of its diversified equity schemes, as the fund house puts it, is investing responsibly. SBI Magnum Equity Fund will be known as SBI Magnum Equity ESG (environment, social and governance) Fund, and will be the only fund in the Indian mutual funds industry to invest in companies that follow the ESG criteria. So what makes it unique?  
SBI Funds Management Ltd, India’s fifth largest fund house, has acquired a conscience, or so it wants us to believe. Effective 16 May, one of its diversified equity schemes, as the fund house puts it, is investing responsibly. SBI Magnum Equity Fund will be known as SBI Magnum Equity ESG (environment, social and governance) Fund, and will be the only fund in the Indian mutual funds industry to invest in companies that follow the ESG criteria. So what makes it unique? 
Conscientious Investing... 
A fund manager typically picks up a company based on fundamentals, profit and loss, revenue sustainability, management’s quality and so on. 
Some schemes want to look beyond: does the company practice gender equality? does its manufacturing process damage the environment? Such schemes want companies to be ethical, responsible and to contribute to society not just by manufacturing products and making profits.
“We are committed towards the ESG principle of investing. Although just SBI Magnum Equity ESG fund will follow the principle, we rate all companies we track, on their ESG performance. We have been doing this for the past five years,"" said Navneet Munot, executive director and chief investment officer, SBI Funds Management Co. Ltd.
Although new to India, the ESG concept is popular abroad. As per Morningstar Inc., assets under management of ESG-focused funds went up to $6 trillion by 2014-end, up from $3.7 trillion in 2012. Passively-managed funds like exchange-traded funds (ETF) also track this space and invest in indices that consist of companies that follow the ESG principle. At the end of April 2018, there were 150 ESG-focused ETFs with assets of over $18.6 billion, up from 59 such ETFs in 2015 with assets of $5.92 billion, according to etfgi.com, a UK-based research and consultancy firm specialising in ETFs. 
Jon Hale, director-sustainability research, Morningstar, insists that ESG is not hokus-pokus. He said, “The main thrust of ESG analysis is that it alerts investors to issues that may not yet be recognised by traditional analysts as material to a company’s value."" 
Munot said SBI Magnum ESG won’t pick liquor and tobacco companies, and will also avoid companies that are in the defence and mining space. 
…or just a gimmick?
SBI Funds may have all the right intentions, but it is a long road ahead. 
In April 2007, ABN AMRO mutual fund (now, BNP Paribas Asset Management India Ltd) launched India’s first socially responsible investing (SRI) fund called ABN AMRO Sustainable Development Fund. The 3-year closed-end scheme collected just around Rs58 crore (as per Value Research). After its tenure got over in April 2010, it converted into an open-ended fund, but didn’t find too many takers and was eventually merged into ABN AMRO Equity Fund in August 2011. The fund house didn’t launch a similar scheme. 
For its SRI fund, the fund house had tied up with Crisil Ltd that had devised a methodology to identify companies with a high SRI score by sending detailed questions to companies. Nikhil Johri, who headed ABN AMRO mutual fund in those days told us that here’s where the scheme faulted as not many companies participated in the exercise. 
This is also why Shyam Sekhar, chief ideator and founder, iThought, said it’s premature to launch such schemes in India. “I don’t think Indian fund houses are ready to do this yet. Their ability to take feedback from stakeholders on these issues has never been adequately demonstrated. They have shown little or no initiatives in fulfilling fiduciary shareholder responsibility,"" he said.
Also, an ESG fund may not want to invest in a firm just because it works in a so-called socially acceptable sector. InGovern Research Services Pvt. Ltd, a proxy advisory firm recently did a study on the ESG standards of consumer goods where it rated a total of 16 companies, including Nestle India Ltd, Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, Emami Ltd, and Britannia Industries Ltd. 
While 14% of these companies got a “high scoring"", 36% got a “below average"" score and 14% got a “low"" score. InGovern is yet to publish this report but shared it exclusively with Mint.  
What should you do?
Some experts are hopeful that SBI Magnum Equity ESG Fund will pave the way for others. “Unless a fund house starts such a scheme, talks about it and educates and sensitised investors, how will this market grow?""said Amit Tandon, founder and managing director, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS), a proxy advisory firm. 
Johri, chief investment officer of Trivantage Capital Management India Ltd, a Sebi-registered portfolio management firm that he founded, remains sceptic. “Somehow, investors think that if they involve ESG concept in investments, their returns would be compromised."" 
Existing investors of SBI Magnum Equity ESG Fund should switch to the fund house’s more successful large-cap fund, SBI Bluechip Fund since a diversified fund is what they had asked for. Those who wish to get a taste of ESG concept can stay invested. Remember, it’s a thematic fund and should not be part of your core portfolio."

Why is it important? In Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit official visit to Indonesia, the two countries have signed 15 agreements in sectors including defence, science, health, railways and technology. They also pledged to step up defence and maritime cooperation and have planned to develop a strategic Indonesian naval port in the Indian Ocean. India is in a bind as Indonesia is seeking its support to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council though the former has consistently supported Maldives for this so far. The voting is scheduled for next week.

What is it? The amountthe National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has ordered Reliance Communications (RCom) to pay Ericsson by the end of September.
Why is it important? This is a part of NCLAT’s Wednesday order after the debt-laden firm reached a settlement with the Swedish telecom gearmaker. The order has halted RCom’s 270-day insolvency process and also, allowed RCom’s lenders to complete the sale of the telcom firm’s wireless assets including airwaves and mobile masts to Reliance Jio Infocomm in a deal that is reportedly worth $3.8 billion.

Why is it important? This step is aimed at helping states improve their school education system and will depend on the measures taken by them including teaching-learning outcome and rationalisation in teacher deployment. Surveys by NGO Pratham and that by a state government point to low reading/understanding skills and the inability to solve math problems at the basic level by many children in both government and private schools.

India’s largest lender SBI has increased the lending rate by 10 basis points across all tenors up to three years.

Mumbai:Indian lenders are raising interest rates even before any RBI action as the strongest loan demand in four years amid weak deposit growth pressures funding costs.
State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd and Punjab National Bank are among the nation’s biggest banks that increased their benchmark lending rates last week. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on the other hand, is expected to keep its key rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting when it decides on policy Wednesday.
Higher borrowing costs risk slowing the recent recovery in demand for credit, which was led by retail and working capital loans, said Karthik Srinivasan, group head of financial sector ratings at ICRA Ltd, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. Moody’s cut India’s 2018 economic growth forecast last week, citing tighter financial conditions as a reason.
RBI will hold its repo rate at 6% this week, according to 25 of 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest see an increase to 6.25%. Accelerating inflation is forcing commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and lure savers even though the central bank—wary of upsetting the economic recovery after a new tax was implemented—has chosen to hold off.
RBI is expected to tighten only next quarter, the time of year when Indian companies typically increase borrowing as the government wraps up the bulk of its debt target.

Animesh Bisht, counsel for the bank, argued that the company had defaulted in the payment of  ₹ 234 crore to SBI and three of its associate banks (now merged with SBI). Of this, Videocon Telecommunications owes  ₹ 193 crore to SBI alone in principal and interest.
A consortium of 18 banks has an exposure of  ₹ 1,700 crore to Videocon Telecommunications, which defaulted on loans and bank guarantees in January 2018.
Zal Andhyarujina, counsel for Videocon Telecommunications, argued that the bank’s petition is defective, as it has not furnished the record of default by the company and that it should be dismissed on technical grounds. “The debt that is claimed by the bank is not the debt at all,"" he said. “No notice was given to the company regarding the default and there was no crystallization of the dues by the bank.""

US President Donald Trump signed what he called a “comprehensive document” with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. The signing came more than four hours into the meeting, an encounter aimed at easing decades of tensions between two foes that last year had seemed on the verge of nuclear conflict.

Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Wednesday disposed of a petition filed in January by Videocon Industries Ltd, objecting to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against the company. 
Mumbai: The Bombay high court on Wednesday disposed of a petition filed in January by Videocon Industries Ltd, objecting to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against the company.
The Venugopal Dhoot-controlled company approached the court against the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had referred it for insolvency proceedings, State Bank of India (SBI) which had filed the bankruptcy petition, and the Union government. Videocon is on the so-called second list of 28 defaulters that RBI had directed for early resolution under the new bankruptcy code. Videocon and Dhoot had sought a stay on initiating bankruptcy proceedings.
Since the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has already admitted the bankruptcy petition, nothing is left in the current case, senior counsel Rafique Dada and counsel Shyam Kapadia, appearing for SBI and RBI, respectively, informed the court.
Videocon had challenged RBI’s decision not to extend the timeline as requested by SBI and the Joint Lenders’ Forum to re-rate Videocon’s restructuring proposal following changes in cash flows after subsequent changes in government import duty policy.
A division bench of justices Shantanu Kemkar and Nitin Sambre disposed of the petition. However, the court has kept the contentions of the company open. This means the company can approach the court again if it feels prejudice. 
Law firm Kanga & Co. is advising Videocon and Dhoot, while law firms Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas and AZB & Partners are representing SBI and RBI, respectively. 
According to Videocon’s FY17 annual report, the company is liable to repay the liabilities of other group companies to the extent of  ₹ 5,082 crore as on 31 March 2017. The company’s total debt stood at  ₹ 19,506 crore as of March last year. The company has made an offer to the lenders to sell its assets to pay its domestic debt. 
The tribunal has also approved Anuj Jain as interim resolution professional for Videocon Industries as well as its unit Videocon Telecommunications. 
Videocon Telecommunications was admitted to NCLT on 8 June for defaulting on  ₹ 1,700 crore of debt."

“The government is aiming at mopping up  ₹ 6,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain another  ₹ 2,400 crore from the Bharat-22 ETF follow on offer to be launched on 19 June,"" a finance ministry official said.
The second part of Bharat-22 ETF would also help the government in meeting the minimum public holding norm in PSUs like Coal India Ltd.
The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Larsen and Toubro Ltd. The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs14,500 crore.
The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat-22 ETF stock include Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), Indian Oil Ltd, State Bank of India, Coal India and Nalco.
The other PSUs on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks—SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda—figure in the Bharat-22 index.
The government plans to raise Rs80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs1 trillion raised last year.
On Tuesday, the government had through a public notice said it will divest 12% stake in railway consultancy firm RITES through an IPO which will be launched on 20 June.

960,2018-06-13,State Bank,"Global rating agency Fitch downgrades viability ratings (VRs) of SBI and BoB by one-notch to 'BB+' and 'BB', respectively, citing 'their weakened intrinsic risk profile'

Mumbai:Global rating agency Fitch on Wednesday downgraded the viability ratings (VRs) of State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB), but affirmed their ‘BBB’ long-term issuer default ratings, along with that of Canara Bank and Bank of India (BoI).  
Mumbai:Global rating agency Fitch on Wednesday downgraded the viability ratings (VRs) of State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB), but affirmed their ‘BBB’ long-term issuer default ratings, along with that of Canara Bank and Bank of India (BoI). 
The agency has also retained the stable outlook on these lenders. Fitch has downgraded the VRs of SBI and BoB by one-notch to ‘BB+’ and ‘BB’, respectively, citing “their weakened intrinsic risk profile due to the negative effect of persistently poor asset quality and earnings on their capital position"". 
The agency, which has a negative sector outlook on the domestic banks, however, said the new NPA framework has accelerated bad-loan recognition, and should improve the health over the long term.
“However, heavy losses and capital erosion reinforces our belief that sector core capitalisation will remain weak unless authorities provide more capital than the budgeted USD 11 billion,"" it added. 
Nineteen of the 21 state-run banks have reported losses in FY18, cumulatively wiping out almost all of the USD 13-billion capital injections during the year. 
Eleven of them reported common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios that fell short of the 8% requirement for Basel III capital migration. 
“We expect internal capital generation to remain weak, although many state banks should be able to recover from losses in FY19. 
Credit cost, which rose to 4.3% on average at state-owned banks from 2.5% in FY17 are likely to moderate, but ageing provisions, slippage from watchlist portfolios and the poor growth outlook limits the upside,"" the agency said. 
The long-term ratings of SBI, BoB, Canara Bank and BoI are driven by their support ratings of ‘2’ and support rating floors of ‘BBB-’, Fitch said, adding the support ratings and support rating floors reflect its expectation that the banks are likely to receive extraordinary government support due to their high systemic importance and the government ownership. 
On the VR downgrade of SBI, the agency said, “The one- notch downgrade to ‘BB+’ from ‘BBB-’ reflects the bank’s vulnerable core capitalisation from its prolonged asset quality problems and weak earnings."" 
SBI’s NPA ratio increased further to 11%, while its net NPL/core capital exceeded 50%. Both ratios are better than most of public sector banks, but have increased risk for core capitalisation. 
On the VR downgrade of BoB, it said the one-notch downgrade to ‘BB’ from ‘BB+’ reflects increasing pressure on its capital position from extended financial weakness in terms of NPAs and earnings. BoB’s CET1 ratio at 9.2% is slightly better despite losses and is higher than that of most state-owned peers, but its NPA ratio jumped to 12.3%. 
Canara Bank’s VR of BB reflects the 60 bps improvement in its CET1 ratio to 9.5% in FY18, supported by fresh equity, over and above that infused by the government. On BoI, which has a VR of ‘B+’, the report said this is at the lower end of large public-sector banks and reflects its weak financial position, as evident from three years of consecutive losses and a significant jump in its gross NPAs 16.6% in FY18."

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings on Wednesday downgraded the viability rating (VR) of State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) by one-notch, reflecting weak risk profile due to negative effect of poor asset quality.
Fitch, which has a negative sector outlook on Indian banks, however, affirmed the ‘BBB’ Long-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of SBI, BoB, Canara Bank and Bank of India (BoI) with a stable outlook.
“Fitch has downgraded the Viability Rating (VR) of SBI and BoB by one-notch to ‘bb+’ and ‘bb’, respectively, reflecting their weakened intrinsic risk profile due to the negative effect of persistently poor asset quality and earnings on their capital position. The banks’ core capital buffers also appear more vulnerable to moderate shocks,"" the ratings agency said in a statement. 
As many as 19 of India’s 21 state banks reported losses in the last fiscal, cumulatively wiping out almost all of the government’s $13 billion capital injections during the year, Fitch said. It said the one-notch downgrade of SBI’s VR to ‘bb+’ from ‘bbb-’ reflects the bank’s vulnerable core capitalisation from its prolonged asset quality problems and weak earnings. 
“We believe more fresh capital is needed for growth and to manage heightened balance-sheet stress,"" Fitch said. SBI’s non performing loan ratio increased further to 11% and have increased risk for core capitalisation, it added. 
With regard to BoB it said the one-notch downgrade of BoB’s VR to ‘bb’ from ‘bb+’ reflects increasing pressure on its capital position from extended financial weakness in terms of NPLs and earnings. Its NPL ( non-performing loan) ratio jumped to 12.3%. The bank’s portfolio of watch-list loans is around 2% and can add to asset-quality pressure if NPL resolution slows, Fitch said."
957,2018-06-15,State Bank,"The SBI move comes after US President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal, pledging to reimpose tough sanctions within 180 days

New Delhi: India’s imports of Iranian oil may be hit from end-August after State Bank of India (SBI) informed refiners it will not handle payments for crude from Tehran from November onwards, the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp. said on Friday. 
New Delhi: India’s imports of Iranian oil may be hit from end-August after State Bank of India (SBI) informed refiners it will not handle payments for crude from Tehran from November onwards, the finance chief of Indian Oil Corp. said on Friday.
The move by the state-controlled bank, India’s biggest, comes after US President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran last month, pledging to reimpose tough sanctions within 180 days.
“(Oil) loading will be affected from end-August under the current mechanism unless a new payment route is established,"" Indian Oil’s A.K. Sharma told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Although New Delhi had cut imports from Tehran in 2017-18 due to a dispute over a giant gas field, Iran remained its third-biggest oil supplier. Iran supplied about 458,000 barrels per day (bpd), or about a tenth of India’s more than 4.5 million bpd of imports, in the fiscal year to 31 March 2018.
Indian Oil previously said it would look at buying oil from traditional suppliers mostly in the Middle East to compensate for any cut in supplies from Iran related to US sanctions.
SBI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
India’s refiners currently use SBI and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG (EIH) to buy Iranian oil in euros, according to IOC and other companies.
Reliance Industries Ltd, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, while Rosneft-promoted Nayara Energy has started cutting purchases from this month, people aware of the development had told Reuters.
India, Iran’s top oil client after China, was one of the few nations that continued to trade with Tehran during a previous round of Western sanctions.
The South Asian nation has said it does not follow US sanctions, but companies and banks with links to the US financial system could face penalties if they do not comply.
Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down"" period ending on 6 August, and the rest, notably affecting the petroleum sector, after a 180-day period ending on 4 November.
Iran offers Indian refiners a 60-day credit period on oil sales, which means payment for cargoes loaded from end-August will be due in November.
More discounts?
Analysts feel Iran may have to offer more incentives to protect its oil sales to India.
“Indians may ask Iran for more discount in exchange for early payment for oil purchases instead of a 60-day credit period,"" said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez Oil at consultancy FGE.
Indian state-refiners previously drew up plans to almost double oil imports from Iran, which had offered deep discounts on shipping of crude.
Indian Oil was aiming to lift as much as 180,000 bpd from Iran in 2018-19.
Seeking to safeguard oil imports from Iran and scout for alternate payment avenues, an Indian delegation last week visited officials and bankers in France, Germany, Britain and the European Union’s Brussels base.
“That visit was only exploratory in nature...we are still watching the situation,"" India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Reuters earlier this week.
As well as banks, shipping firms and insurance companies have already begun distancing themselves from Iran.
Indian Oil’s Sharma said his firm received very few responses to inquiries on hiring tankers to import Iranian oil.
“Only NITC (National Iranian Oil Co.) and a few others participated, “ he said, adding freight rates for transportation of Iranian oil have also gone up due to the threat of sanctions."

Mumbai: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday reserved its order till 26 June in the insolvency plea filed by the State Bank of India (SBI) against BSE-listed Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics Ltd, subsidiaries of debt-laden Uttam Galva Steels Ltd.
Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics owe banks  ₹ 3,200 crore and  ₹ 2,200 crore, respectively.
Ziraat Ban, the second-largest state-owned bank of Turkey, has sent a letter to SBI stating that one of their high net worth clients is interested in acquiring the assets of the two Uttam Galva subsidiaries, senior counsel J.P. Sen, appearing for the beleaguered steel makers, said on Friday. 
The bank has communicated this to SBI several times but has not got a reply yet, he said.
“The dues of SBI are to the tune of  ₹ 334 crore and the total dues of all the lenders are to the tune of  ₹ 5,400 crore. However, SBI has not reverted to the communication though it is representing the joint lending forum,"" said Sen. 
Meghna Rajadhyaksha, partner of law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas representing SBI, argued that this seems to be just delaying tactics by the debtor.
“The name of the investor is not mentioned in the letter sent by the Turkish bank to the SBI chairman,"" said Rajadhyaksha. “The offer can be taken up to the (RP) as well once the company is admitted under the insolvency process for resolution.""
After hearing the argument, the presiding officer of NCLT’s Mumbai bench, M.K. Shrawat, reserved the order till 26 June but observed that the parties can explore settlement of the matter till next Friday.
Earlier, on 6 June, another bench of NCLT had adjourned the insolvency plea of Uttam Galva Steel to 16 July, following requests from the company as well as its lenders. 
As the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal is set to hear a petition on the insolvency resolution of Essar Steel Ltd, ArcelorMittal India Pvt. Ltd—which is vying for Essar Steel and which once owned shares in loan defaulter Uttam Galva—has deposited  ₹ 7,000 crore in an escrow account to qualify for the bidding. If NCLAT declares ArcelorMittal eligible, the money in the escrow account will go towards settling Uttam Galva’s debt."

Emails sent to JSW Energy and Adani Power went unanswered at the time of going to press. This is the second time that JSW Energy has expressed interest in Monnet Power. In 2016, lenders to Monnet Power had rejected an offer from Sajjan Jindal-promoted JSW Energy as they were unwilling to take a haircut on their loans.
This is also the second Monnet group company that JSW is interested in. In April, lenders to Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd approved a resolution plan submitted by a consortium of JSW Steel and AION Investments Pvt Ltd.

New Delhi: State-run banks feel that fragmentation of the banking industry is not good, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Monday, while answering a question on possible consolidation in the sector. 
Consolidation is expected to help create more globally competitive banks that can meet credit requirements of the Indian industry, but entails risks in integration and synergies in operations like information technology systems and human resource practices.
Consolidation talks have gained pace after 11 of 21 state-run banks came under the Reserve Bank of India’s prompt corrective action, which places restrictions on lending. 
Also, state-run banks reported huge losses in the quarter ended 31 March that threatened to wipe out the entire government capital infusion into these banks. In the March quarter, 19 of 21 state-run lenders announced losses totalling  ₹ 62,681 crore, as a result of rising provisioning requirements for bad debts as well as increasing number of frauds.
Addressing a press conference after a meeting of bankers with finance minister Piyush Goyal, Kumar pointed out that even after a merger of four state-run banks, they will still fall short of SBI’s size.
Kumar said consolidation has its pros and cons and will require more deliberation among state-run banks. “State-run banks are fragmented as of now. Banks have agreed that this kind of fragmentation is not good."" 
Mint had reported on 4 June about the possibility of the government considering a merger of three smaller banks with Bank of Baroda. 
“I have shared our experience. The possible pitfalls, advantages and challenges of a merger."" 
Last year, SBI had completed a merger of five subsidiaries—State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Patiala and State Bank of Travancore— besides Bharatiya Mahila Bank Ltd with itself."

Mukhopadhyay was hearing an appeal moved by Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics, to defer the NCLT order by four weeks as the two corporate debtors were at an “advanced stage of negotiation"" with a “foreign bank"" to reach a settlement outside the insolvency and bankruptcy code. 
NCLAT, however, gave liberty to the promoters of both companies to negotiate with a third party investor to settle dues, even if insolvency resolution is kick-started by NCLT. 
A.S. Chandhiok, counsel for Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics submitted that a foreign bank was willing to pay the dues on behalf of Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics. 
Arun Kathpalia appearing for SBI said that insolvency application had already been pending for six months before NCLT and had not received any “direct offer"" from any investor to pay the outstanding dues. Thus, no interference by the appellate authority is mandated at this state, he argued.
Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics owe banks  ₹ 3,200 crore and  ₹ 2,200 crore, respectively.
Ziraat Ban, the second-largest state-owned bank of Turkey, has reportedly sent a letter to SBI stating that one of their high net worth clients is interested in acquiring the assets of the two Uttam Galva subsidiaries.
In a separate insolvency proceeding against Essar Steel Ltd, following a direction by the Ahmedabad bench of NCLT, ArcelorMittal Netherlands NV—which once owned shares in loan defaulter Uttam Galva—has deposited Rs7,000 crore in an escrow account with the State Bank of India to settle the dues of Uttam Galva Steels on the condition that it is declared the successful resolution applicant for Essar Steel.
 If NCLAT declares ArcelorMittal eligible, the money in the escrow account will go towards settling Uttam Galva’s debt."
951,2018-06-28,State Bank,"State Bank of India will be closing down small branches or will be merging two-three branches into one at some foreign locations, says MD Pravin Gupta

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) has closed six foreign branches and is in the process of closing down another nine branches as part of rationalisation of overseas operations, said managing director Pravin K. Gupta. 
New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) has closed six foreign branches and is in the process of closing down another nine branches as part of rationalisation of overseas operations, said managing director Pravin K. Gupta.
SBI, country’s largest lender, has operations in about 36 countries with nearly 190 branches. 
“Capital is generally a constraint for most of the bank sites. Obviously, you want to use your capital at the place where it is best utilised. So, as a part of our foreign branch rationalisation, we have closed about six branches already in the last two years. There are nine more branches under the process to be closed down,"" Gupta told PTI in an interview. 
Not all the branches in the foreign locations are full-fledged offices, he said, adding that in countries like Bangladesh and South Africa there are some small branches as well as some retail branches and there is need to rationalise them. Even as the public sector banks have been mandated by the department of financial services to wind-up businesses at unviable locations, SBI itself was looking to rationalise the foreign offices before the order came, Gupta said. 
As per the banking sector agenda approved at the PSB Manthan in November last year, public sector banks (PSBs) were asked to examine all of 216 overseas operations. 
“Branch rationalisation is an ongoing process. I think every branch has to justify its existence. So unless it is commercially viable, it doesn’t make sense for us to be operating particularly in foreign locations,"" he added. 
When asked if closing down branches overseas also means having no operations in those locations, Gupta said SBI will not be exiting such countries. However, it will be closing down small branches or will be merging two-three branches into one. 
Besides, given the evolving regulatory environment back home, Gupta said the need to open lot many foreign offices at this point of time is not viable. “If you see globally, we are already present in the major centres. I don’t think there is any major global centre where we are not present. So the need to go to too many new countries at this point of time is not really felt."" 
By March this year, state-owned banks had closed down 35 overseas branches and representative offices as part of the clean and responsible banking initiative. Wherein, Bank of India, Andhra Bank, IDBI Bank and Indian Overseas Bank closed down Dubai operations, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and Union Bank of India shut their Shanghai offices. Bank of India also closed down operations in Yangoon and Bostwana, while Bank of Baroda and Indian Overseas Bank shut the Hong Kong branch. 
In addition, PSBs have also closed down various representative offices. 
With relation to rationalisation of domestic branches post merger of its six associate banks and the Bharatiya Mahila Bank with itself with effect from 1 April, 2017, the SBI managing director said that as many as 1,800 branches have been rationalised during the whole year. Besides, 250 offices were also closed down that led to huge cost savings. 
“In terms of these 1,800 branches and 250 offices, we have seen about Rs1,000 crore of savings only in the rental income and other expenses. Over the long run, our expectation is that this merger will definitely be beneficial for the bank,"" Gupta said. 
In terms of employees’ merger and posting them at right places, Gupta said it took a little bit of SBI’s time, but due to retirement of a lot of personnel as well as voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), there are currently 16,000 less employees than a year ago. “We are also beginning to see all the savings which could not happen earlier due to duplication,"" he added. 
On being asked about bank’s plans to open more branches domestically, he said there are plans to open about 300-350 branches in the current fiscal, of which almost half are to be opened in rural areas."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) managing director B. Sriram has resigned from the after his appointment as chief executive of IDBI Bank, people aware of the development said. The news assumes significance amid reports that Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is weighing acquiring a majority stake in the debt-ridden IDBI Bank.
The government had last week appointed Sriram as IDBI Bank CEO for a temporary period of three months. His resignation from the SBI board has been forward to Appointments Committee of the Cabinet for acceptance, the people quoted above said, adding that the competent authority would take a final call on the matter.

Sriram took charge of IDBI Bank on 22 June following M.K. Jain demitting office to take over as deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The ACC approved the appointment of B. Sriram as IDBI Bank CEO for three months with effect from M.K. Jain’s demitting office, said an order issued last week by the Department of Personnel and Training.
Meanwhile, LIC is looking to enter the banking space by acquiring a majority stake in IDBI Bank. The deal is expected to provide business synergies despite the lender’s stressed balance sheet.
A possible scenario would be LIC making IDBI Bank a subsidiary on the lines of its housing finance and mutual fund businesses. If the deal goes through, IDBI Bank would shed the character of public sector bank and become a private sector lender like Axis Bank.

In his budget speech for 2016-17, Jaitley had said the process of transformation of IDBI Bank has already started. “The government will take it forward and also consider the option of reducing its stake to below 50%,"" he had said. 
Sriram is the longest-serving managing director of a public sector bank and has wide experience, including in stressed assets management. IDBI Bank had gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of  ₹  55,600 crore at the end of March quarter. During January-March, the lender’s net loss stood at  ₹  5,663 crore.
Sriram worked as the MD (corporate and global banking) in SBI since July 2014. He has served as managing director of State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur. Sriram joined the government-run bank in 1981 as a probationary officer. During his over three-decade-long career, he held several positions and also had a stint at SBI’s Singapore office."

946,2018-07-23,State Bank,"Under the agreement, lenders will appoint a lead bank to formulate a resolution plan for stressed assets

Mumbai: Twenty-four banks led by the State Bank of India on Monday signed the inter-creditor agreement that aims to fast-track the resolution of bad loans. 
Mumbai: Twenty-four banks led by the State Bank of India on Monday signed the inter-creditor agreement that aims to fast-track the resolution of bad loans.
In a stock exchange filing, SBI said that its board has approved the signing of the inter-creditor pact. Seventeen public sector banks, five private sector banks and two other financial institutions have signed the agreement. 
The agreement is part of Project Sashakt, a five-pronged strategy to resolve bad loans, proposed by a committee led by Punjab National Bank non-executive chairman Sunil Mehta. 
The new framework authorizes the lead bank to implement a resolution plan in a time-bound manner. 
The Mehta committee has also proposed the setting up of a national asset management company, which will raise multiple sector-specific investment funds to invest in stressed assets. 
The signing of the inter-creditor agreement is the first step in the implementation of Project Sashakt. 
According to the agreement, lenders with exposure to stressed accounts will appoint a lead bank as its agent to formulate a resolution plan. 
The role of the lead lender varies from determining the proportion of sustainable debt to finalising the resolution plan. 
The terms of the resolution plan has to be approved by 66% of the lenders, and will then be final and binding on all other lenders. The agreement also says that the lead bank will submit the resolution plan to the overseeing committee constituted by the Indian Banks’ Association. 
“Pursuant to the recommendations of the Sunil Mehta committee on resolution of stressed assets and under the aegis of Indian Banks’ Association, an inter-creditor agreement has been prepared which shall serve as a platform for the banks and financial institutions to come together and take joint and concerted actions towards resolution of stressed accounts,"" said a statement from the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA).
When the resolution plan is in the works by the lead lender, a standstill clause will come into force which debars the other lenders from initiating any civil action against the borrower. It, however, does not preclude lenders from initiating any action for criminal offences. 
Lenders not in favour of the resolution plan can either sell their exposure to any bank or non-banking financial company or it can even sell the exposure to the lead bank. 
“The lead lender shall have the right (but not the obligation) to arrange for the buy-out of the facilities of the dissenting lenders at a value that is equal to 85% of the lower of liquidation value or resolution value, in accordance with the following terms,"" the agreement states. 
The dissenting lender also has the option to arrange for a buy-out of loans from other lenders at 125% of the liquidation or resolution value, whichever is higher.
The lead bank will receive a mutually agreed upon fee for its services. The fee will be paid in proportion of its outstanding exposure. 
“Lender, its employees, directors, representatives and agents shall not be liable and shall not be held responsible (except in the case of wilful default, gross negligence, or fraud) for any loss, liabilities or damages whatsoever, to any relevant lender,"" it added. 
The resolution plan will be in conformity with the new framework released by the Reserve Bank of India on 12 February. 
The new framework is applicable to accounts with exposures of over  ₹ 2,000 crore where lenders must implement the resolution plan within 180 days
“If there is a change in the RBI regulations or any other regulations, that will have precedence over the agreement, so that it is in alignment with the regulations at that point in time (and not 12 February),"" said Mehta. “The objective is to look at legacy stressed assets, but also resolution of other stressed assets."" 
Under the inter-creditor agreement, lenders will look at resolving accounts with exposure between  ₹ 50 crore and  ₹ 2,000 crore. 
According to the IBA, nearly 1,200 accounts will fall under the agreement, which will be implemented by end of July."
945,2018-07-25,State Bank,"SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar says the bad loan recognition process is now over. NPAs peaked in March 2018 and every year the banking system will add fresh NPAs, but they will be within the tolerance level

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) expects to recover half of the assets that turned sour in the initial 12 large bad loan accounts that were identified for bankruptcy resolution, chairman Rajnish Kumar said.  
Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) expects to recover half of the assets that turned sour in the initial 12 large bad loan accounts that were identified for bankruptcy resolution, chairman Rajnish Kumar said. 
“The recoveries will be around 50% and most banks are holding provisions in excess of 50%. It may differ from bank to bank, but at SBI, our estimate is that we will be able to write back part of the provisions if everything goes well,"" Kumar said in an interview on Tuesday at Mint’s Mumbai office. 
Barring one, all the accounts are in various stages of resolution at different benches of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). At the time of referring these high-value non-performing assets (NPAs) to the insolvency court—the new platform that India created following the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) being put in place in May 2016 —they accounted for 25% of then  ₹ 8 trillion bad assets in the Indian banking system. Since then, the pile of bad assets has swelled to  ₹ 10.3 trillion as of 31 March.
For the 28 bad accounts that were subsequently identified by the Reserve Bank of India for resolution, Kumar expects the recoveries to be less—in the range of 30-35%. Even then, SBI will be able to write back some provisions as it has already set aside money to cover 76% of these NPAs. This will, in turn, add to its profit.
Unlike a few of his predecessors at SBI who had promised time and again that the “worst is over"" on the bad loans front—and such statements were typically followed by a further expansion of bad assets—Kumar is cautious in commenting on the state of NPAs at the nation’s largest bank. “People don’t believe when you say that the worst is over. We have to prove now that the worst is over. So wait for next two-three quarters,"" he said.
According to him, the bad loan recognition process is over and NPAs peaked in March 2018; every year, the banking system will add fresh NPAs, but they will be “within the tolerance level"". The current credit cost will also be “within the tolerance level and will progressively reduce"", he added.
He is also seeing signs of investment demand recovery. “I don’t have (a) pipeline of investments in (the) private sector. But there is huge investment happening in the roads sector,"" he said. SBI is projecting a 10% credit growth for FY19 and is looking for a mix of 60% retail assets and 40% corporate assets. Till 6 July, there has been a 12.8% credit growth for the industry, against 5.7% in the year-ago period.
Over dependence on government regulations and under-recoveries from end-consumers are the chief reasons for the massive debt pile-up in India’s “regulated"" sectors, said Kumar. The RBI’s financial stability report in June—a biannual health card of India’s financial system—has projected gross NPAs of the industry crossing 12% or, in the worst-case scenario, 13% by March 2019, from a little over 11% in March 2018.
According to Kumar, reliance on government concessions in highly regulated sectors such as power, roads and telecom has mainly led to the souring of loans. At the same time, he also held his own community responsible, citing poor underwriting and risk management by bankers. 
“We cannot have over-leveraging in the system any more. The appraisal and underwriting standards are undergoing a huge change. But there is a greater realization about payment discipline as well as the equity from promoters,"" he said.
“For regulated sectors, I would say external factors are 70% responsible for the bad loans and internal factors (banks’ inability to appreciate risks) 30%. For other sectors, it would be 50:50,"" he said.
Citing the example of the power sector, Kumar said that even though there had been attempts to turn around power distribution companies, things did not work “as expected"". He added that power sector firms are likely to grapple with severe “cash flow issues"" once admitted for insolvency proceedings, as their power purchase and fuel supply agreements are likely to be terminated on being declared insolvent. That is why, he said, the lenders are trying to resolve a few power sector assets outside NCLT. According to recently available data, NPAs in India’s power sector stood at  ₹ 37,941 crore.
Commenting on the suitability of IBC across sectors and assets, Kumar said that for certain sectors, “it should be left to the commercial decision of lenders on what approach they want to take"". For distressed firms in the engineering, procurement and construction sectors, he suggested an arrangement with the existing borrowers can be explored to complete the projects and derive a certain value as the underlying assets in the sector are not great.
 “IBC is one of the most significant reforms that has been carried out by the government,"" he added."

943,2018-07-27,State Bank,"Given the low penetration of insurance in India, SBI Life's scorching growth in new business in the previous year had raised expectations among investors

The success of any insurer depends on how many of its customers stick with it and for how long, besides how many come on board every month. On most of these parameters, the first quarter results of the largest private sector life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, hit the right notes. 
The success of any insurer depends on how many of its customers stick with it and for how long, besides how many come on board every month. On most of these parameters, the first quarter results of the largest private sector life insurer, SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd, hit the right notes.
To start with, SBI Life’s persistency ratios improved across tenures except for the 61st month, which fell—the management explained this was due to a lower share of single-premium products. Compared with its rivals, the company shines on persistency. Add the sharp drop in surrender rates for the quarter, and the life insurer seems to justify the buy rating it enjoys among most analysts.
What is more comforting is that the persistency ratio has improved across all distribution channels. This is significant given that insurance is a push product and a specific channel could upset ratios if the offerings are sweetened to the point of bordering around mis-selling.
Another positive is that the persistency ratio for retail after excluding single-premium products also improved. For instance, the ratio for the 13th month improved to 82.25% and that of the 61st month improved to 45.71% from 44.17% a year ago. Single-premium products tend to lend some volatility to persistency as these fly off the rack if equity markets boom and are surrendered faster if markets are falling.
In a nutshell, SBI Life’s customers stick to it whether they buy through an agent or bundled through bank products. They stick with the insurer despite being asked to pay every year rather than be swayed by the ebbs and flows of markets. This cements future profitability for the insurer.
Are there any misgivings?
Given the low penetration of insurance in India, SBI Life’s scorching growth in new business in the previous year had raised expectations among investors. For the reported quarter though, new business premium grew by 15.3%, which is impressive for the insurer’s size. 
But even now, the company has a long way to go in improving the share of protection in its overall product mix. It has not been able the crack the code on selling protection, as the share was a mere 10% of new business premium. 
The SBI Life stock trades at around 2.5 times its estimated embedded value for FY20, far cheaper than HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and comparable to its immediate rival ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd."

Banks have been increasing interest rates on deposits in line with a general increase in interest rates in the financial system. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) monetary policy committee (MPC) last month increased the policy repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%, the first such hike in over four years, as inflation concerns mounted. The repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks.
The RBI is expected to hike the policy rate later this week. Of the 15 economists surveyed by Mint, 12 expect the RBI to raise its repo rate to 6.5%.
Besides that, credit growth is also picking up, leading banks to offer higher rates to attract deposits. Credit to various sectors, including agriculture, has risen 12.3% year-on-year, data available as of July show, according to Bloomberg."

Mumbai: State-owned lender State Bank of India on Tuesday said its investment banking arm SBI Capital Markets Ltd (SBICAPS) will no longer provide debt syndication and debt resolution services.
SBICAPS and its unit Project Advisory and Structured Finance (PASF) group are currently involved in project advisory, loan syndication, refinancing, debt resolutions, mergers and acquisitions and other investment banking services.
In April, the Reserve Bank of India had pointed out a conflict of interest between the bank and its investment banking arm with regards to the debt syndication and restructuring services, according to an Economic Times report.
“In view of duplication of processes resulting in delays, as also certain regulatory concerns, it is decided that the activities like debt syndication (both greenfield and brownfield projects /refinancing for private sector customers) and Debt resolution mandates taken from private sector companies offered by PASF, SBICAPS, are discontinued. As in the past SBI, will continue to provide support and assistance to all its customers on an ongoing basis,"" the bank said in its statement to stock exchanges.
SBICAPS, however, will continue to provide other investment banking services.
In May, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the bank was looking to bring in a partner in SBICAPS by diluting minority stake, PTI reported. Kumar had also mentioned that the bank was looking at overlaps between SBI and SBICAPS and wanted to make the latter a pure investment bank."

Making money more expensive, the RBI today increased its repo rate, or the rate at which it lends to banks, by 25 basis points to 6.50%, a move that is likely to push your EMIs higher. This is the first time since October 2013 that the rate has been increased in consecutive policy meetings.

With a general rise in the interest rate in the financial system, the EMIs you pay on your home and auto loans have been rising.
Major banks including SBI, ICICI Bank and PNB had hiked lending rates in early June, just ahead of the RBI’s June policy review. With deposits rates going up and liquidity remaining tight, analysts say banks may eventually pass on higher cost of funds to borrowers. India’s largest bank SBI last month hiked interest rates on retail deposits and longer-term bulk deposits.
A high repo rate means that banks borrow funds from the RBI at a higher rate, increasing their cost of funds. Credit growth is also picking up. Credit to various sectors, including agriculture, has risen 12.3% year-on-year data available as of July, according to Bloomberg.
On liquidity in the financial system, RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya in a media briefing after the central bank hiked the repo rate said: “Though the growth in currency-in-circulation has moderated to some extent recently, its expansion remains above the historical trend.""
“Reserve money growth is expected to pick up in the second half of FY18. It’s usually coincident with the start of the festive season,"" he said. 
The RBI will continue to actively manage the system liquidity to achieve the monetary policy objective of aligning the overnight weighted average call rate with the policy rate, he said, while meeting the economy’s demand for reserve money growth.
Despite the rate hike, the RBI maintained a neutral stance, which will give the central bank flexibility to move either way, depending on the inflation trajectory. Economists say that more rate hike could be on the cards this year.
“We are expecting at least one more hike this financial year,"" said Anagha Deodhar, economist, ICICI Securities."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of the current FD rates from some popular banks for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."
936,2018-08-02,State Bank,"This is SBI's highest long-term unsecured loan to any entity and also the largest ever loan sanctioned to NHAI

New Delhi: The decision of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take an unsecured loan of  ₹ 25,000 crore from State Bank of India (SBI) has drawn flak from within the authority and also from experts.  
New Delhi: The decision of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) to take an unsecured loan of  ₹ 25,000 crore from State Bank of India (SBI) has drawn flak from within the authority and also from experts. 
Critics believe the move will impact NHAI’s finances and credit ratings and have serious implications for future.
The move is a deviation from NHAI’s traditional borrowing methods of raising resources through long-term bonds issued to various investors, including the Life Insurance Corporation of India, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation and other qualified investors, tax-free bonds and Masala bonds.
The loan, the agreement for which NHAI will sign with State Bank of India on Friday, is for 10 years, with three years of moratorium on repayments. 
The money will be disbursed within 31 March 2019 and the repayment would be made by NHAI in 14 equal half yearly instalments after the three-year moratorium is over.
The rate of interest would be based on one month MCLR (marginal cost of funds based lending rate— the minimum interest rate of bank below which it cannot lend) and the interest accrued on the amount outstanding will be paid on monthly basis.
“Infrastructure development cannot be undertaken by such unsecured loans. You have to involve people, individually and through foreign investments. The move will have long-term implications if the projects get delayed or the concessionaire exits project midway,"" said a senior NHAI official on condition of anonymity. Raising resources through bonds is the most secure way, he said.
“The move will impact credit ratings for NHAI and also the overwhelming response it has been getting through Masala bonds and asset recycling, as well as the Moody’s rating of Baa3 rating given in 2017,"" said another infrastructure financial expert who also did not want to be identified.
The road ministry, NHAI’s parent body, requires  ₹ 1 lakh crore through internal and extra budgetary resources (IEBR) as investment for development of national highways in 2017-18.
The NHAI move comes in the wake of the government failing to provide the resources and asking the authority to borrow the funds from the market.
Jagannarayan Padmanabhan, director at CRISIL Infrastructure, supported the move.
The internal and extra budgetary support envisaged for the roads sector was to the tune of  ₹ 62,000 crore, according to the budget announcement, he said. This bodes well for the authority as they would be able to deploy this for achieving the ambitious targets set by the ministry. It also gives a positive signal to the stakeholders in the sector about the continued commitment and follow through for implementation of the Bharatmala programme.
The fund infusion is in lines with the government’s policy of going for EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) route to fund infrastructure as the PPP (public-private partnership) mechanism is being reworked. This funding is a necessary step towards that policy, said Jaijit Bhattacharya, president, Centre for Digital Economy Policy Research."

“There are several cases where bankers are being arrested for taking business decisions. This has led to bankers delaying decision-making pertaining to sanction of loans,"" one of the people mentioned above said.
A former SBI official said many employees are reluctant to take up roles in credit department as approvals for loans which later turn sour could be treated as mala fide. “The bank has, for the last few years, had an internal policy to help its employees in legal tussles but now they have enhanced it with the insurance cover,"" he said.

The country’s top lender by assets turned to a loss of  ₹ 4,875.85 crore in the June quarter, from a net profit of  ₹ 2,005.53 crore a year earlier. A Bloomberg poll of 17 analysts forecast the bank to report a profit of  ₹ 237.80 crore.
SBI reported a tax write-back of  ₹ 2,379.28 crore, compared with a tax paid of  ₹ 939.05 crore a year earlier.
In addition to provisions related to non-performing assets (NPAs), the bank kept aside  ₹ 7,098 crore as mark-to-market provisioning towards rising bond yields, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said at a post results conference. It also made a  ₹ 1,897 crore provision towards increased gratuity and revised wages.
In the December quarter, yield on the 10-year benchmark government bond rose by 50 basis points. Banks have to revalue their bond portfolio at the end of every quarter.

The pace of additions of fresh slippages slowed to  ₹ 9,984 crore last quarter from  ₹ 26,249 a year earlier.
Kumar attributed bad loans in the retail sector to the rise in NPAs last quarter. Agriculture loans saw NPAs worth  ₹ 21,830 crore due to loan waivers in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Slippages in corporate loans was, however, lower at  ₹ 3,704 crore.
In the first quarter, the bank doubled its provision to  ₹ 19,228.26 crore in the quarter from  ₹ 8,929.48 crore a year ago.

“In September, we expect one large account where we are awaiting the NCLT order. Once that comes and resolution happens, then we will be in profit. We will also increase provisioning next quarter against the power assets. From December, there will be no looking back and we will turn profitable,"" said Kumar.
The bank’s net interest income rose 24% to  ₹ 21,798 crore at the end of the June, from  ₹ 17,606 crore a year earlier. Advances growth was muted at 7.2% on account of a fall in overseas loan book.

SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said Jet Airways’s account with the bank is ‘standard’, according to CNBC-TV18.
Jet Airways is seeking to bolster its finances after reporting a loss in the year ended 31 March.

Jet Airways, however, did manage to remove the “default"" tag for anywhere between one day and four months during the period.
To be sure, a “default"" status does not imply that the loan has been classified as a non-performing asset. Instead, the loan is classified as a special mention account—where banks put the company on a watch list for varying periods even though it continues to be a standard account.
A spokesperson for Jet Airways said all its loan accounts are “standard and there is no overdue in any of our accounts"". “A tabular statement prepared by CRILC, currently in circulation in some sections of media, placing Jet under default status by some of the banks on certain dates is only due to technical errors, which has subsequently been rectified in the system,"" the spokesperson said in a statement on Monday. “The company further clarifies that over the last several years, there has been no instances of default in meeting its debt obligations."" 
 Lenders who imposed the “default"" status did not respond to emailed queries.
CRILC was constituted by RBI to collect, store and disseminate data about large credit accounts to lenders. It hosts credit information of those with loans above  ₹ 5 crore as reported by lenders.
Jet Airways’ woes began with India’s second-largest lender, Punjab National Bank, according the “default"" status on 23 February and subsequently removing it on 6 June this year, after a gap of about four months, the CRILC document showed.
Indian Overseas Bank accorded the default status thrice; SBI and Yes Bank put Jet under the default status twice. By 6 June, all the banks moved the airline out of default status."

Speaking at industry body Ficci’s banking conference Fibac on Monday, Kumar said while many people ask him, who is responsible for the current pile of non-performing assets (NPAs), it’s not so simple to answer.

“I would say everybody is responsible, be it the bankers, be it the industry or borrowers, be it the government and without inviting contempt of the court, even the judiciary has played a role in this situation,"" he said.
Kumar said that somebody who invested in a business in 1996 based on an assurance on availability of coal by the government, could not have predicted that after 20 years, coal block allocations will get cancelled and their entire investment will be jeopardized. He was referring to the Supreme Court’s judgement in 2014 which cancelled allocation of 214 coal mines awarded between 1993 and 2010. 
He said that although some of the sectors are showing signs of a turnaround, the power sector is still under great stress. “The hope is much less in the power sector. There is need, definitely, to fix the power sector for continued growth of the economy,"" he said.
Meanwhile, he said there are certain problems around the consortium lending process and multiple banking systems. “Up to mid-90s, it used to be consortium banking and later on, because there was a complaint from the industry that it is delaying the process, we went into multiple banking, but that has not resulted into any faster decision-making and it has led to more problems,"" he said.
He suggested limiting the size of the consortium, as it does not make sense to have too many banks for small loans.
“We will definitely reorganize many consortia. That kind of exercise we are looking at. Up to  ₹ 500 crore, I don’t do consortium lending anyway. I can take over (some loans), I can exit (from other consortia),"" he said.
Kumar also raised doubts whether the genuine equity was available in businesses by borrowers and whether borrowers had put enough equity in their businesses. “Wherever I have seen that the equity was available, those enterprises have been able to manage the assets; (in case of) anyone who was just playing on the bank’s money and (therefore) how much interest and stake they had in the business is again a subject matter of debate,"" he added.
He said that going forward, with the learnings from the past, it is very important that banks, while evaluating any financing proposal, have to ensure that the promised equity is available in the business.
“The second issue has been around whether the funds given by the banks have been used for the purpose for which they were meant to. Again, the enterprises where the money have been used for the purpose for which the borrowing was made are in much better position,"" he added.
Kumar explained that banks do not have mindset of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) or the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and lend the money on trust, apart from paperwork.
“There have been several cases with clear breach of that trust. Now, we will trust, but we will verify; probably that verification factor was missing,"" he said."

Mumbai: JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. (ARC) on Monday offered to buy out State Bank of India’s (SBI) loan to Bombay Rayon Fashions Ltd in a  ₹ 900 crore full-cash deal, two bankers aware of the matter said. 
SBI has a  ₹ 2,260 crore exposure to Bombay Rayon, meaning India’s largest bank will have to accept a 60% discount if it agreed to the deal.
“Banks like SBI are ready to sell these accounts at attractive reserve price as they have made higher provisions against these accounts. These banks are now willing to appreciate the expectations of asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) and investors,"" said Eshwar Karra, chief executive officer, Phoenix ARC Pvt. Ltd.
On 2 August, SBI had put up the account on sale, along with its  ₹ 229 crore exposure in Kolkata-based Shivam Dhattu Udyog Pvt. Ltd. Phoenix ARC has offered a  ₹ 77 crore full-cash deal for the latter, indicating a haircut of 66%, said the second banker cited earlier.
JM Financial ARC and SBI declined to comment.
The offer comes ahead of an August- end deadline, after which the accounts must be referred for bankruptcy proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The deadline has forced banks to accelerate finalising resolution plans for stressed accounts.
As of end-June, banks held a 55% stake in Bombay Rayon, with SBI holding 29.28%, Axis Bank 8.04%, Union Bank of India 3.35% and other banks like Bank of India, Punjab National bank, Central Bank of India and Allahabad Bank holding a minority stake. The promotors holds 38.3% stake in the company. 
According to Bombay Rayon’s fiscal 2016-17 annual report, JM Financial ARC had earlier picked up the loan exposure of ICICI Bank in the company. 
Lenders had proposed to restructure the company in the past under different schemes like the Scheme for Sustainable Structuring of Stressed Assets (S4A) and corporate debt restructuring. At the end of March 2017, banks held 28% stake in the company which was raised to 55% by the end of June 2017, after it converted unsustainable debt into equity under S4A. 
On 12 February 2018, RBI withdrew all debt restructuring schemes such as S4A, strategic debt restructuring schemes, CDR and 5:25 refinancing scheme, forcing banks to finalise a resolution plan in six months before it is referred to NCLT."

New Delhi: India’s GDP is expected to grow by 7.7% in the April-June quarter on the back of pick up in leading indicators like cement production, sale of vehicles and bank credit, a report by SBI said. 
New Delhi: India’s GDP is expected to grow by 7.7% in the April-June quarter on the back of pick up in leading indicators like cement production, sale of vehicles and bank credit, a report by SBI said.
SBI has based its assessment on its Composite Leading Indicator (CLI), which takes into account 18 major macro-economic indicators.
“The CLI is signalling that the economic activity for Q1 FY19 has picked up substantially and the GVA (Gross Value Added) growth would be 7.6%,"" it said in its research report ‘Ecowrap’. However, the headline GVA is being possibly pulled down by a weak agriculture growth, it added. 
Major indicators that driving GVA in Q1 FY19 are cement production, passenger traffic, sale of both commercial vehicle and passenger vehicles, non-food credit growth and aircraft movement among others, the report said.
“Finally, how much GDP will be higher than GVA at 7.6% Q1FY19? We believe it could be 7.7%, as a lot of subsidy has been frontloaded in Q1, implying that the gap between GDP and GVA may just vanish in Q1!,"" it said.
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) is scheduled to release quarterly GDP estimate for April-June 2018 on 31 August.
The report further said the quarterly trend of subsidy expenditure suggests that the government has been frontloading larger chunk of overall subsidy amount in the first quarter compared to other quarters and this is happening since 2016-17.
In April-June 2018-19, subsidy expenditure to the tune of  ₹ 1,16,820 crore has been frontloaded. “We believe, by front loading subsidy amount in Q1 may have some impact on Q1 GDP figure and the gap between GDP and GVA might come down to some extent in Q1 as compared to remaining quarters in FY19,"" it said. 
In fact, a trend analysis suggests that first quarter of fiscal may even witness GDP declining below GVA or staying marginally above GVA, it added. As per the CSO, the GDP at 2011-12 prices in the fourth quarter (Q4) of financial year 2017-18 registered growth rate of 7.7% as against 5.6% , 6.3% and 7% respectively, in the first three quarters of the last fiscal."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

The recalibration is a process, in which the cassettes in the ATMs that hold cash are modified to suit the size of the currency.
Madhya Pradesh-based RTI activist Chandrashekhar Gaud had asked the SBI that how many ATMs have been recalibrated for dispensing the new currency notes of  ₹ 2,000,  ₹ 500 and  ₹ 200 denomination.
In a reply sent on 18 August, SBI said that, out of 59,521 ATMs, 41,386 have been recalibrated and an amount of  ₹ 22.50 crore was spent on this work. Thus, it is evident that 18,135 ATMs at present are not able to dispense new currency notes.
On 8 November 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the demonetisation of currency notes of  ₹ 500 and  ₹ 1,000 denominations. After this, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had issued new currency notes of  ₹ 2,000,  ₹ 500 and  ₹ 200 in a phased manner."

New Delhi: The State Bank of India (SBI) is in advanced stages of the resolution process for seven or eight stressed power sector accounts involving a total debt of around  ₹ 17,000 crore, managing director Arijit Basu said on Friday.
If it goes through, this will provide banks with a resolution option that may lead to a smaller haircut compared to the resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
SBI, as the lead bank, is in talks with other banks over the potential resolution, Basu said on the sidelines of the India Banking Conclave.
“There were around 35 projects that were identified by the government and where there was significant stress. Many of these have been resolved. There were issues around power purchase agreements, fuel supply agreements. Subsequently, we looked at 13 accounts where we could put it under a scheme which would entail certain changes in the management and an external investor coming in,"" Basu said.
“In that, for around seven to eight accounts, we have been able to get some consensus with the banks. We have done technical due diligence and financial rating for the sustainable debt. Investors have expressed interest,"" he said. 
Basu added that the 27 August deadline will not trigger a spurt in cases being referred to National Company Law Tribunal, at least those involving SBI.
The Reserve Bank of India had set a deadline of 27 August for settling cases involving defaulting power plants failing which they will be referred for bankruptcy proceedings.

New Delhi: As part of rationalisation post merger of six associate banks with itself, the country’s largest lender SBI has changed names and IFSC codes of nearly 1,300 branches across the country.
Accordingly, the lender has published a list of new branch codes as well as the IFSC codes of these branches.
The merger of six associate banks and Bhartiya Mahila Bank (BMB) with State Bank of India (SBI) came to effect from 1 April 2017 resulting into increase in size and valuation of the bank.
A total of 1,295 branches have been changed across the country as per the SBI list enlisting the old and new IFSC codes after rationalisation/merger with associate banks and BMB, as per the list on its website.
SBI ranks at 53 position among the top banks globally in terms of assets. As on 30 June 2018 the total assets of the bank stood at  ₹ 33.45 lakh crore.

Mumbai: The country’s current account deficit (CAD) is likely to touch 2.8% of GDP in the current financial year on surge in crude oil prices and moderate growth in exports, a report said.
The merchandise trade imbalance is also expected to rise to  ₹ 188 billion in FY19, compared with  ₹ 160 billion in FY18, according to Ecowrap, an SBI research report. 
“Against the backdrop of rising oil price and lukewarm export growth, current account deficit is expected to reach 2.8% of GDP ($75 billion) in FY19,"" the report said. The trade deficit  jumped to  ₹ 18 billion in July 2018 on account of lukewarm export performance amidst higher import bill, it added. 
Oil imports registered an annual growth of 57.4% to  ₹ 12.4 billion, from  ₹ 7.8 billion in July 2017, and the report attributed the rise in the import bill to increase in oil price and rise in quantity of oil imported. Had the oil price remained the same as in 2017, crude oil import bill would have been 31.7% lower in the first quarter of FY19, it estimated.
“Whereas if the volume of crude oil import had remained the same as in previous year, our crude import bill would have been 5.5% lower, thereby showing that price effect reigns supreme,"" the report said.
Amidst the recent devaluation of the Chinese Yuan, the country’s imports from China increased in May and June this year, after witnessing a decline in April. The trend of the manufacturing goods imports remains the same and within manufacturing, imports of electronic goods have declined on annual basis so far this fiscal year, according to the report.
“Thus, the argument that depreciation of the Chinese currency is responsible for increased imports from the country does not seem appropriate,"" it said.
The huge increase in trade deficit is more linked to the average export performance so far in FY19, it said. The CAD is still expected to be majorly financed by non-debt creating (FDI and FPI) capital inflows, according to the report, which constitute around 44% of the total capital flows.
The debt creating inflows which increased in the last fiscal year are expected to remain on the higher side this year as well, which will imply pressures on rupee in case there is a sudden reversal of capital flows, it said.
The financial account surplus is expected to come around  ₹ 59 billion, lower than the previous fiscal ( ₹ 91.4 billion) due to foreign portfolio outflows which have already amounted to  ₹ 9.3 billion till June 2018, it added.
Portfolio outflows have happened this year since the US economy and dollar started strengthening. “This is expected to turn the country’s overall balance of payment into deficit mode after six years, thereby implying forex reserves depletion of  ₹ 16 billion (0.6% of GDP) in FY19,"" the report said."

Rowe Price is still in talks with the government and we are seeking to withdraw the petition with the liberty to file it again if it was required,"" said De Vitre. 
The division bench of the court comprising Justices B.R. Gavai and M.S. Karnik subsequently allowed the asset management company to withdraw the petition and disposed of the case.
When UTI Mutual Fund was established, the four stakeholders were brought on board as temporary custodians. It was agreed that over time, the shareholders will exit the company through an IPO. Between 2003 and 2005, the Indian shareholder had infused  ₹  312 crore to pick up 25%, each, in UTI. Subsequently in 2009, T. Rowe Price had picked up a 26% stake in the AMC for  ₹  162 crore. 
On 13 August, the US-based shareholder of UTI Mutual Fund had sought more time saying that it was in talks with the government for an out-of-court settlement.
A Sebi order in March 2018, intended to avoid potential conflict of interest and strengthen the governance structure of mutual funds, had said that no shareholder of an AMC can own more than a 10% stake in another AMC, and those who own such stakes need to bring them down by March 2019. Such shareholders will also not be allowed to be on the board of both AMCs.
T. Rowe had also sought an extension for Leo Puri so that he could continue as managing director and CEO of UTI Mutual Fund to ensure that the proposed initial public offering goes through without hindrance. Appointed in 2013, Puri’s term had ended on 13 August, and he decided to quit.
“The issue of Puri’s extension doesn’t arise any more and there is enough time till March 2019 to comply with the Sebi guidelines,"" said a person close to the development. “The government and T. Rowe are discussing to iron out other issues as well, and talks are in an advanced stage."" 
When contacted, Mona Bhide, managing partner of Dave Girish and Co, the adviser to UTI AMC, ABH Law founding partner Munaf Virjee, who is representing T. Rowe, and Mihir Mody, partner of law firm K Ashar and Co, who is advising Sebi, refused to comment.
When contacted, T. Rowe Price said: “We did not plan to pursue this petition if appropriate action were taken by the government, the regulator, and the four PSU shareholders. We now have increasing confidence that they are taking steps to comply with Indian law and regulations regarding divestment of the PSU shareholders’ stakes in UTI Mutual Fund and toward an eventual IPO of the firm."""
905,2018-08-29,State Bank,"As of 30 June 2018, wilful defaulters owe over 15,300 crore to PNB and more than 34,200 crore to SBI

New Delhi: The Central Information Commission (CIC) has asked the Union government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to disclose the names of wilful defaulters of  ₹ 50 crore and above and the action taken against them, saying every taxpaying citizen has a right to know about it.  
New Delhi: The Central Information Commission (CIC) has asked the Union government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to disclose the names of wilful defaulters of  ₹ 50 crore and above and the action taken against them, saying every taxpaying citizen has a right to know about it. 
The direction came recently from central information commissioner M. Sridhar Acharyulu while hearing a plea seeking information. Acharyulu pointed out that defaulters of small amounts like farmers are defamed in public, while defaulters above  ₹ 50 crore were given a long rope, news agency PTI reported on Wednesday quoting the written order. 
Defaulters above  ₹ 50 crore were given high concessions in the name of one time settlements, interest waivers and several other privileges and their names are hidden from exposure to secure their reputation, the PTI report said quoting the order.
RBI and banks have been making serious efforts to recover dues from wilful defaulters and to bring them to book. The central bank has shown some reluctance in disclosing the names of wilful defaulters , but banks such as Punjab National Bank (PNB) name and shame wilful defaulters as part of recovery efforts.
State-owned banks have in the last three financial years and the first quarter of FY19 recovered  ₹ 1.61 trillion from wilful defaulters, according to official data. 
As of 30 June 2018, wilful defaulters owe over  ₹ 15,300 crore to PNB and more than  ₹ 34,200 crore to the State Bank of India, minister of state for finance Shiv Pratap Shukla had informed Parliament in July.
The CIC order said that Right to Information Act makes it mandatory for government department to publish all relevant facts including the rationale while making policies or announcing decisions that affect the public. 
Acharyulu also said that the finance ministry, the ministry for statistics and programme implementation and RBI have a “duty"" to inform people from time to time about their policy on dealing with wilful defaulters of  ₹ 50 crore and above, the order said. 
Emails sent to the finance ministry, the ministry for statistics and programme implementation and RBI remained unanswered till the time of going to press.
The order also directed the ministries and RBI to give reasons for the failure in disclosing these details, the criminal actions initiated against wilful defaulters or reasons for not doing so. “If they cannot submit any part of that information, they may chose to explain why should they not be directed to publish the details of the information sought including the names of wilful defaulters, before 20 September 2018,"" the PTI report said quoting the CIC order.
Banks refrain from extending further credit to wilful defaulters, while capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) bars wilful defaulters from raising capital from the market. Under the bankruptcy code, defaulting promoters are not allowed to win their companies back unless they pay back dues to lenders first. The government also introduced legislation to attachment and confiscation of fugitive economic offenders’ properties. It has also asked banks to review all bad loans above Rs50 crore to find instances of fraud and wilful default and collect passport details of such promoters."
904,2018-08-30,State Bank,"Before the UTI AMC IPO, the government will ask LIC, SBI, PNB and Bank of Baroda to cut their stakes in UTI Mutual Fund from 18.25% to 10% each

Mumbai: T . Rowe Price, the largest shareholder of UTI Asset Management Co. (UTI AMC), called a truce with the government and the markets regulator after the finance ministry agreed to issue a no-objection (NOC) letter for UTI AMC’s initial share sale, and direct state-run financial institutions to cut their stakes in the local asset manager, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: T . Rowe Price, the largest shareholder of UTI Asset Management Co. (UTI AMC), called a truce with the government and the markets regulator after the finance ministry agreed to issue a no-objection (NOC) letter for UTI AMC’s initial share sale, and direct state-run financial institutions to cut their stakes in the local asset manager, two people aware of the development said.
The US fund manager withdrew its writ petition against the government, the Securities and Exchange Board of India and other UTI AMC shareholders on Tuesday after it was satisfied with the assurances given by finance ministry officials at a meeting in early August, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
Accordingly, the government will ask Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) to slash their stakes in UTI AMC from 18.25% to 10% each, within a deadline. T. Rowe Price owns 26% in UTI AMC, but the four government institutions together command a majority on its board.
T. Rowe Price approached the Bombay high court on 8 August, seeking its intervention to force the four state-run institutions to reduce their stakes as mandated by the stock markets regulator, and order the continuance of its chief executive, Leo Puri. On 28 August, it withdrew the petition.
“The government has said this time that it will work out a plan favourable for all stakeholders and the AMC. The government will direct the four public sector sponsor-cum shareholders (who have their own separate in-house AMC businesses) to reduce their stakes in UTI AMC in the next three months, definitely by end of March 2019,"" said the first person.
According to the second person, UTI AMC is likely to come out with a  ₹ 5,000-crore IPO.
A T. Rowe Price spokesperson said in an email: “We now have increasing confidence that they (the government) are taking steps to comply with Indian law and regulations regarding divestment of the PSU shareholders’ stakes in UTI (AMC) and toward an eventual IPO of the firm. We believe these developments are in the best interests of UTI and its stakeholders, including its 11 million unit holders. We will continue to work with all parties to sustain progress and reach a successful resolution of these matters in the near term.""
Emails sent to spokespersons for UTI AMC, the finance ministry, LIC, SBI, PNB and BoB remained unanswered.
At the end of the June quarter, UTI AMC had average assets around  ₹ 1.53 trillion, ranking sixth in India’s  ₹ 23.4 trillion asset management industry with 42 fund houses, states Association of Mutual Funds in India data. LIC, SBI, PNB and BoB have their own AMC businesses in India, while T. Rowe Price has asset management business in the US. 
“The four sponsors will monetize their stakes either through the proposed IPO or through a private placement route before March 2019. This will also help UTI AMC and the four sponsors comply with Section 7B of mutual fund regulations stipulated by Sebi,"" said the second person.
The four state-owned sponsors could together sell at least 34% stake in a UTI AMC IPO, while T. Rowe Price could sell some of its stake and give up its veto powers on the company board, the second person said.
“The total offer to the public in the IPO could be around 40% at an estimated size of Rs. 5,000 crore, if we go by the calculation done by ICICI Securities Ltd. which was appointed by UTI AMC as a banker for its proposed IPO,"" said the second person.
The T. Rowe Price spokesperson said the American company did not plan to pursue the writ petition if appropriate action were taken by the government, the regulator, and the four state-owned shareholders.
An IPO could help UTI AMC raise capital and comply with Sebi norms.
“This is a well-deserved victory for UTI AMC and most importantly, it will give the AMC a professionally managed, independent board, which is crucial for its growth in the face of the competition going on in the industry right now,"" said the second person.
It was in July 2007 that UTI AMC got its first board approval for an IPO. In January 2008, the AMC, the second largest then, filed a draft prospectus with Sebi, proposing to offer 48 million shares to raise Rs. 1,800-2,400 crore. Just two months later, it deferred the plans as stocks tanked, hurting its valuations. 
In September 2008, US-based investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed, sending world markets into a tailspin, forcing UTI AMC to shelve its IPO plans.
In November 2009, T. Rowe Price Global Investment Services Ltd bought a 26% stake in UTI AMC for $140 million (around  ₹  652 crore), valuing UTI AMC at about 3.25% of its average assets under management at the time.
In February 2011, U.K. Sinha, the then chairman of UTI AMC quit and till November 2011, UTI AMC saw a steady erosion in its assets and investor base. In the absence of a new chairman, the AMC was restrained from launching any new schemes, as per Sebi norms. Finally, in July 2013, Leo Puri was appointed as the managing director and CEO of UTI AMC.
In December 2016, UTI AMC appointed ICICI Securities Ltd to advise it on an IPO and by March 2016, the AMC secured enough shareholder backing for the IPO proposal, subject to the government’s NOC.
In May 2017, UTI AMC said it was very close to launching an IPO, while ICICI Securities valued the AMC at  ₹  8,000-10,000 crore. Except for LIC, all shareholders voted in favour of an IPO.
In March this year, Sebi altered mutual fund norms to avoid potential conflicts of interest and strengthen the governance structure of mutual funds. Sebi said no shareholder of an AMC can own more than a 10% stake in another AMC and those who own such stakes need to bring them down by March 2019. Such shareholders will also not be allowed to be a part of the board of either of the AMCs, said Sebi in a circular.
Last month, T. Rowe Price wrote to Sebi, seeking its intervention in the affairs of UTI AMC, extend Puri’s term for a year and direct other shareholders to cut their stakes. Sebi kept quiet.
Finally, earlier this month, T. Rowe Price filed a writ petition against the four PSU sponsors, making the finance ministry and Sebi parties to the dispute in the Bombay high court.
On 12 August, Puri stepped down at the end of his five-year term."

As of June-end, SBI had 28.9 crore ATM-cum-debit cards, of which a large number are already chip-based, PTI said in a report. Several other banks, too, are replacing magstripe cards with EMV-equipped cards.
Is your debit card a magstripe card?
It is easy to identify if your debit card is a magstripe card. If your debit card has no chip located on the face (centre-left position) of the debit card, then it is a magstripe card, according to SBI. EMV chip debit cards, on the other hand, have a chip located on the face (centre-left position) of the card.

As a safety measure, SBI, on its website, said that it will not unblock any magstripe debit card which is blocked once. It has urged affected cardholders to apply for new EMV chip debit cards."

Emails sent to SBI, Kotak Investment Banking and CPPIB remained unanswered until press time, while spokespeople for Temasek and KKR declined to comment.
The 4% stake sale is part of the pre-offer valuation exercise of SBI General Insurance before its planned initial public offering (IPO) by the end of March this year.
In a similar pre-IPO round, SBI Life Insurance divested 3.9% stake to KKR and Temasek for close to  ₹  2,000 crore in 2016, valuing the company at  ₹  45,000 crore before its planned IPO that took place in September 2017.
Compared to the SBI Life transaction, the deal size this time is smaller than that of the SBI Life transaction and the auction is expected to attract a wider participation this time from a diverse group of bidders and may also include smaller investors including domestic private equity funds, said the second person mentioned above.

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday said it has withdrawn the process of sale of Essar Steel debt to an asset reconstruction company (ARC) following an order by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). 
Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday said it has withdrawn the process of sale of Essar Steel debt to an asset reconstruction company (ARC) following an order by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT).
“In view of the NCLAT order pronounced today, SBI withdraws the process of sale of debt of Essar Steel India Ltd and will proceed as per the order of the NCLAT,"" an SBI spokesperson said.
According to an SBI official who did not wish to be named, owing to the delay in resolution of Essar Steel, the lender had decided to offload its over  ₹ 12,000-crore exposure to the distressed steelmaker. He added that the bank had decided to advertise in newspapers on Friday, its intent to sell the loan to an ARC but the advertisements were pulled out following a late-night decision to wait for the NCLAT order.
“The bank expects the insolvency resolution process to move ahead now and therefore it has decided to not sell its exposure,"" the official added.
Another public sector lender Bank of Baroda (BoB) is in the process of selling its domestic loan exposure in Essar Steel Ltd worth  ₹ 1,200 crore to Hong Kong-based loan and bond trading firm SC Lowy.
The NCLAT on Friday said Numetal’s second bid is valid and added that ArcelorMittal must clear dues of Uttam Galva Steels Ltd and KSS Petron of more than  ₹ 7,000 crore within three days be eligible for taking over Essar Steel. The appellate tribunal asked the committee of creditors (CoC) to consider both the plans after the payment is made by ArcelorMittal.
The appellate tribunal has also allowed lenders to further negotiate bids for Essar Steel. Essar Steel, which owes lenders  ₹ 49,000 crore, was admitted to NCLT in August 2017. The company’s resolution has been stuck in last-minute litigation as both bidders Numetal and ArcelorMittal had approached the NCLAT. The resolution professionals had disqualified both bidders under Section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) which bars defaulting promoters from bidding for their own firms.
Numetal was disqualified from bidding because Rewant Ruia, son of promoter Ravi Ruia, is a beneficiary of a trust that backed Aurora Enterprises, which in turn held a 25% stake in Numetal; VTB is the largest investor in Numetal with a 40% stake. Meanwhile, ArcelorMittal was disqualified because bank loans to its associate companies Uttam Galva Steels Ltd and KSS Petron had turned non-performing."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple. 
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
 The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.
Here are some of the lowest personal loan interest rates offered by various banks"
895,2018-09-11,State Bank,"The largest gain will be in Maharashtra (around ₹3,389 crore), followed by Gujarat at ₹2,842 crore, according to the SBI report

Mumbai: The continuing plunge in the rupee, coupled with rising crude oil prices, will give the states a windfall in tax revenues to the tune of  ₹ 22,700 crore over and above the budget estimates for the current fiscal, according to a report. 
Mumbai: The continuing plunge in the rupee, coupled with rising crude oil prices, will give the states a windfall in tax revenues to the tune of  ₹ 22,700 crore over and above the budget estimates for the current fiscal, according to a report.
The rupee fell to a new lifetime low of 72.73 against the dollar, falling 28 paise on Tuesday, on strengthening American currency as crude prices went past the $78 a barrel mark. This also pulled down the markets with the Sensex crashing by over 509 points, or 1.34%, to close at 37,413.13. 
“The increase in petrol and diesel prices is likely to give the states a windfall gain of around  ₹ 22,700 crore over and above the budget estimates for the current fiscal,"" SBI Research said in a note. An increase of $1 a barrel in crude price translates into a  ₹ 1,513 crore revenue gain on an average to all major 19 states, according to the report.
The largest gain will be in Maharashtra (around  ₹ 3,389 crore), followed by Gujarat at  ₹ 2,842 crore. Since March, petrol and diesel prices have increased by  ₹ 5.60 and  ₹ 6.31, respectively, in Delhi. Petrol price has now crossed  ₹ 89 per litre in Maharashtra, the highest among states. Maharashtra charges the highest VAT at 39.12% on a litre of petrol, while Goa charges the lowest at 16.66% per litre.
This windfall gain was likely to push down states’ fiscal deficit by 15-20 basis points if other things remained unchanged, the report said. “We also estimate that since states have an incremental revenue over the budgeted one, they could cut on petrol prices by an average  ₹ 3.20 per litre and diesel by  ₹ 2.30 a litre, without affecting their revenue arithmetic,"" according to the report.
Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka have fiscal headroom to lower petrol prices by at least  ₹ 3 and  ₹ 2.5 on diesel. If states impose VAT on the base price (crude, transportation cost and commission), diesel prices can drop by as much as  ₹ 3.75 and petrol price by  ₹ 5.75 a litre. However, this will result in a revenue loss to states of around  ₹ 12,000 crore (net of  ₹ 34,627 crore loss and  ₹ 22,700 crore gain from oil bonanza).
The calculation is based on the assumption that for 2018-19, crude averages at $75 a barrel and the exchange rate at  ₹ 72, SBI Research said."
893,2018-09-14,State Bank,"Vijay Mallya, in an open letter, had defended himself and said the SBI and other banks had lent him money despite knowing about his company's financial situation

New Delhi: India’s biggest lender the State Bank of India (SBI) said Friday there was no laxity on its part in dealing with loan default by now defunct Kingfisher Airlines of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya.  
New Delhi: India’s biggest lender the State Bank of India (SBI) said Friday there was no laxity on its part in dealing with loan default by now defunct Kingfisher Airlines of fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya. 
The comments by the SBI came after reports suggested that the bank, which was the lead lender to Kingfisher Airlines, was in February 2016, advised to move the Supreme Court to stop Mallya from fleeing the nation but the lenders moved the apex court only after the tycoon had left the country four days later. Mallya left the country on 2 March 2016 while 13 banks moved the apex court four days later seeking its intervention to prevent the businessman from leaving the country. 
“State Bank of India (SBI) denies that there has been any laxity on its part or its officials in dealing with loan default cases, including Kingfisher Airlines. The bank has been taking proactive and strong measures to recover the defaulted amounts,"" it said in a statement. 
Mallya has been facing legal proceedings for defaulting on loans of more than  ₹ 9,000 crore from a consortium of 17 banks. However, Mallya, in an open letter, had defended himself and said the SBI and other banks had lent him money despite knowing about his company’s financial situation. He claimed he was being made the “poster boy"" for bank defaults, though the banks were also culpable. 
The Supreme Court had posed some questions to the banks that approached it. It wondered why loans were given to Mallya when he was already a defaulter and was facing proceedings in the court of law. Mallya had already announced his intention to shift to the UK in a statement issued after his deal with Diageo to step down from the chairmanship of United Spirits, a company he sold to the UK major three years back. He was to get  ₹ 515 crore or $75 million from Diageo as severance package. 
SBI had in the first week of March 2016 moved the Debt Recovery Tribunal in Bangalore claiming the first right on the payment by Diageo to Mallya and seeking to impound his passport. However, the DRT reserved its order and set the next hearing for 28 March 2016, a good 21 days later."

In another development, SBI has been urging its customers, who hold magstripe debit cards, to switch to chip-based debit cards. “Do not take a chance; get enhanced security for your debit card by applying for the SBI EMV Chip Debit Card without any fee at your branch or through OnlineSBI,"" said SBI in another tweet.
According to RBI guidelines, those holding magstripe debit cards are required to change your EMV chip debit cards by the end of this year.
It is easy to identify if your debit card is a magstripe card. If your debit card has no chip located on the face (centre-left position) of the debit card, then it is a magstripe card, according to SBI. EMV chip debit cards, on the other hand, have a chip located on the face (centre-left position) of the card.
EMV chip card technology helps protect against card fraud (skimming). It is the latest global standard for debit card payments, featuring debit cards with embedded microprocessor chip that stores and protects cardholder data.

The NCD issuance is part of IL&FS’s  ₹ 9,000 crore capital raising programme for the current fiscal year.
Two persons directly aware of LIC’s investment plans confirmed this on condition of anonymity.
Debt-laden IL&FS, which is promoted by LIC, State Bank of India and a few other private and state-run lenders, is holding a crucial board meeting on Saturday to decide on capital raising needs, especially to avoid more defaults on repayments and rating downgrades.
The first of the two people cited above said that LIC is also willing to subscribe to a large part of the  ₹ 4,500 crore rights issue to be launched by IL&FS a few weeks later.
“IL&FS is looking to raise a total of at least  ₹ 9,000 crore through rights issue and loans. SBI Capital Markets Ltd is working as the investment banker-cum-advisor for IL&FS’ capital raising programme,"" said this person.
Emails sent to LIC, SBI Capital Markets and IL&FS on Thursday remained unanswered.
LIC holds 25.34% in IL&FS, while HDFC Ltd has 9.02%, Central Bank of India holds 7.67% and State Bank of India owns 6.42%. ORIX Corp. of Japan and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority have 23.54% and 12.56% stake in IL&FS, respectively.
The liquidity infusion by LIC, through NCD purchases and rights issue subscription, will be crucial for the country’s largest infrastructure development and finance company, which is in the process of building the country’s longest tunnel—the Chenani-Nashri tunnel (9.2 km) in Jammu and Kashmir—but is struggling to repay its debt.
According to its annual report, around  ₹ 5,756 crore worth of debt is coming up for repayment in the next one year for IL&FS.
As of 31 March, IL&FS’ total outstanding loans stood at  ₹ 91,091.31 crore, according to the annual report. This is about 14% more than its fiscal 2017 end borrowings outstanding at  ₹ 80,017.72 crore. Most of the debts arise from loans given by the group’s subsidiaries IL&FS Financial Services Ltd, IL&FS Energy Development Co. Ltd, IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd and IL&FS Maritime Infrastructure Co. Ltd. IL&FS has 24 direct and 135 indirect subsidiaries.
Of the total outstanding debt,  ₹ 57,322.15 crore is in bank loans (term loans and cash credit from banks) alone, mostly from state-run banks.
IL&FS Transport Network, the holding firm of the group’s road assets, alone has consolidated debt of Rs35,000 crore. IL&FS Financial Services has Rs17,000 crore of debt, classified as standard asset for most banks, according to a Nomura India report.
On Friday, The Economic Times reported that IL&FS will sell its corporate headquarters in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex to raise funds. It is expected to fetch Rs1,300-1,500 crore, said the report.
IL&FS recently defaulted on inter-corporate deposits and commercial papers (CP), which prompted the Reserve Bank of India to initiate an audit into the group and resulted in a number of rating downgrades. On 6 September, IL&FS Financial Services, IL&FS group’s lending arm, was barred from accessing the CP market till the end of February 2019 as it failed to repay some of its maturing CPs on their due dates, according to company filings on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The company said in its filing CPs which was due on 28 and 30 August could not be paid on the due date. These were settled in full on 31 August.
“In compliance with the Reserve Bank Commercial Paper Directions, 2017, the company will not access CP market up to 28 February, 2019,"" read the exchange filing by the company.
On 4 September, Moneylife reported that IL&FS has defaulted in repaying a short-term loan of Rs1,000 crore to Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi).
“At the same time, a subsidiary of IL&FS too has defaulted in repaying loan worth about Rs500 crore to the development financial institution,"" said the Moneylife report.

A home loan is probably the biggest loan that one takes. Not only in terms of the loan amount, but also tenures, which can be 15 years or more. The total final amount that one pays can be double of what was borrowed. But a home loan is among the cheapest loans available, and usually it is the only way a person can buy a house.

The total final amount that one pays can be double of what was borrowed. But a home loan is among the cheapest loans available, and usually it is the only way a person can buy a house.
A home loan is called a ‘good’ loan because it helps you acquire a tangible asset that can appreciate over the long term. It makes sense to buy a house if you plan to live in it. This is also the reason, apart from the fact that many housing projects in India continue to be delayed by many years, why financial advisers say that one should buy a ready-to-move-in house.

SBI Life and Citigroup declined to comment. “No firm decision has been made regarding the size, timing or nature of such reduction in stake,"" a spokesperson for BNP Paribas Cardif said. Kotak Mahindra did not respond to an email seeking comment.
SBI Life went public in September 2017 in an initial public offering (IPO) that saw the two promoters collectively sell 12% stake, with SBI selling 8% and BNP Paribas Cardif selling 4%. The total IPO size was worth  ₹  8,400 crore, with SBI raising around  ₹  5,600 crore and BNP Paribas Cardif around  ₹  2,800 crore. The IPO was subscribed 3.57 times at a price of  ₹  700 per share, valuing the company at  ₹  70,000 crore. On Wednesday, shares of SBI Life closed at  ₹  616.65.
SBI Life, in December 2016, sold a 3.9% stake to investors KKR and Co. LP and Temasek Holdings Pvt Ltd for around  ₹ 1,794 crore. The transaction valued the insurer at  ₹ 46,000 crore.
BNP Paribas Cardif’s SBI Life stake sale plans add to the frenetic deal activity in the insurance sector this year.
Last month, a consortium of WestBridge Capital, Madison Capital and billionaire stock market investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala acquired Star Health and Allied Insurance for close to $1 billion from a clutch of private equity firms.
On 5 September, Mint reported that a proposed 4% stake sale in SBI General Insurance Co. has drawn interest from at least three global private equity investors, including KKR and Co., Temasek Holdings and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB).
Home-grown private equity firm True North has been in talks to acquire a 40% stake in Royal Sundaram General Insurance Co. Ltd, according to media reports.
State-owned IDBI Bank Ltd is looking to sell its 48% stake in insurance joint venture IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co. Ltd to raise capital. However, with Life Insurance Corp of India (LIC) in the process of buying a 51% stake in the bank, the deal is likely to be put on the back burner, Mint reported in August."

“In the short term, the rupee is suffering from the market sentiment,"" Shukla said in an interview. “Right now it’s contagion. Everything is being painted with the same brush. I don’t think beyond 70 is a number that the Indian rupee should trade at.""
The rupee is this year’s worst-performing Asian currency, dropping 12% to set a succession of record lows. It reached an all-time low of 72.9750 per dollar this week. The currency may eventually strengthen back to 68, Shukla said, without giving a time frame.
India’s government has been seeking to stem the selloff, last week announcing a number of measures to stem the rupee’s slide. These included relaxing overseas borrowing restrictions on local manufacturers, reviewing whether to ease a cap of foreign ownership of corporate bonds, and considering limiting “non-essential imports.""
Worsening Deficit
These efforts have so far failed to halt the currency’s decline as buoyant fuel costs have pushed up India’s import bill and worsened its current-account deficit.
Relief may be in sight here, Shukla said. The surge in crude will encourage shale producers to re-enter the market, helping to cap the oil price at $80 to $85, he said.
The Reserve Bank of India may also tighten policy again to bolster the currency when it meets next month, he said. The central bank raised interest rates to the highest in two years in August.
The rupee’s plunge is evoking memories of slide of around 20% from February to August 2013 during the so-called taper tantrum. India’s fundamentals have improved since then and it has a bigger war chest of foreign-exchange reserves, Shukla said.
“Smart institutional money will come back,"" he said. “At some point, this whole fall will be stemmed and we will see money coming back."""

New Delhi: Assuring lending support to non-banking financial companies, SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Sunday said there was no concern on liquidity of such firms, amid ongoing debt crisis in IL&FS Group.
Shares of housing finance companies came under sudden heavy selling pressure on Friday as investors raised concerns over rising cost of borrowing for the companies amid crisis at IL&FS.
Experts attributed the fall in NBFCs’ scrips to tightness in money market and a lack of clarity on IL&FS exposure.
“Some comments are being attributed to SBI about the Bank being wary of lending to NBFCs. The rumours are baseless. SBI lends support to NBFCs in private and public sector within the regulatory policy framework and will continue to do so,"" Kumar said in a statement. 
In fact, the recent regulatory guidelines on the co-lending model opens up further opportunities for collaboration between SBI and non-deposit taking NBFCs to increase lending to priority sectors, he added.
“There is no concern on liquidity of NBFCs in view of their liquid cash position and availability of committed lines,"" said the top official of the country’s largest lender. 
Earlier this month, it came to light that IL&FS group defaulted on a short-term loan of  ₹ 1,000 crore from Sidbi, while a subsidiary has also defaulted  ₹ 500 crore dues to the development finance institution.
While IL&FS has nearly  ₹ 35,000 crore consolidated debt, IL&FS Financial Services has  ₹ 17,000 crore of debt, which sits as standard asset for most of the lenders, according to a Nomura India report.
 The group has seen its various long-term and short-term borrowing programmes downgraded to ‘default’ or ‘junk’ grades by credit rating agencies, even as the regulators are also probing alleged delay in disclosure about certain loan defaults. Among others, capital markets regulator Sebi, the Reserve Bank, the Corporate Affairs Ministry and the Finance Ministry have received complaints about alleged wrongdoings at Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) and its various group entities, including the listed ones.

He said that SBI’s role as a leader in the industry is to help in stabilizing the financial markets. “Individually, what we will do, what we will not do is something that has to be examined by SBI and its board,"" said Kumar. He added that SBI’s board of directors will take a decision based on the larger interest of the industry as well as SBI’s own shareholders.

Last Friday, the BSE’s benchmark Sensex crashed nearly 1,500 points over a rumoured default by mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) and uncertainty surrounding the future of IL&FS. Shares of other home financiers also slumped but recouped some of their losses after DHFL denied that it had defaulted on payments.
 On 23 September, Kumar had also stepped in to reassure investors, saying there was no concern related to liquidity at mortgage lenders. Friday’s slump in the stocks of home financiers was attributed to fears of liquidity tightness and potential systemic risk arising from exposure to IL&FS."

But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

MCLR is the benchmark lending rate used to lend by banks and RPLR is used by non-banking finance companies. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point (bps). 
Mumbai: Ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) bi-monthly monetary policy announcement, top banks and housing finance companies, including State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Punjab National Bank and Housing Development Finance Company (HDFC) have increased their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) and retail prime lending rate (RPLR) by 5-10 basis points. MCLR is the benchmark lending rate used to lend by banks and RPLR is used by non-banking finance companies. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point (bps).
Rising interest rate regime
SBI, the country’s largest lender, increased its one-year MCLR from 8.45% to 8.50%. For an amount of  ₹ 30 lakh, the bank will now provide home loan at 8.70-8.85%, up from 8.65%-8.80%. 
ICICI Bank Ltd has increased its six-month MCLR from 8.50% to 8.60% and one-year MCLR to 8.65% from 8.55%. The bank offers home loan on both six-month and one-year MCLR. The spread on the home loan from the bank ranges between 30-90 bps depending on the type of loan, type of borrower and the loan amount. A spread is a margin that is above MCLR, which adds up to your overall home loan amount. 
HDFC is providing home loan at 8.80-8.85% for loan amount up to  ₹ 30 lakh, up from 8.70-8.75%.
In the last two policy reviews, the central bank increased repo rate by 25 bps each. According to banking analysts, RBI is likely to increase the rate during the Friday review as well. “We expect a 25 bps hike in repo rate in October policy and it may not be the last in the financial year. We rule out a hike of 50 bps, as it may spook the market. However, there is an outside probability of change in neutral stance too, as three successive rate hikes, with a neutral stance could contradict RBI’s message,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India, in a note.
What should you do?
If you are planning to take a home loan, you need to know that there are two types of loan options—fixed rate loan and floating rate loan. In a fixed rate loan, the bank gives you a fixed rate for a particular tenure. In case of floating rate loan, the interest rate will change depending on the interest rate cycle. Financial planners suggest that one should opt for floating rate loans. 
“No one can time the interest rates while taking a home loan. Moreover, housing loan lasts for a longer duration loan—over 20-year period. Hence, since there will be changing interest rate cycles, it is better to have a floating rate,"" said Suresh Sadagopan, a Mumbai-based financial planner. 
“Again, if you look at a typical home loan borrower, most of them end up prepaying the loan. Hence, there is no need to block it at a fixed rate loan,"" he added.
Remember that usually fixed rate loans are priced higher than home loan rates. Also, when it comes to prepayment, you may have to pay a prepayment penalty for a fixed rate loan. In case of floating rate loans, there is no prepayment penalty.
Besides the interest rate, you also need look at other charges when you opt for a home loan. 
Home loans usually have charges such as processing fee, administrative cost and franking charges. You need to factor in these costs and the interest rate before taking a loan.
As a borrower, you can also negotiate with a bank or housing finance company to waive off the charges if you have a good credit score. If you are an existing home loan borrower, you need to check your interest rate. If it is too high, try to convert into a lower rate through balance transfer. 
“It will make sense only if the new interest rate is lower by over 75 bps. However, if your home loan rate difference is say around 100 bps, in a competitive scenario, these do get corrected. If you are looking to do a balance transfer of your home loan, other than interest rate also check for the charges,"" said Sadagopan. 
Usually balance transfer works if your remaining home loan tenure is over 10 years."
874,2018-10-03,State Bank,"New borrowers will have to pay a higher interest rate on their home loans taken from State Bank of India

Ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) bi-monthly monetary policy review later this week, the State Bank of India has increased the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points, effective 1 October, across various tenures.  
Ahead of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) bi-monthly monetary policy review later this week, the State Bank of India has increased the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points, effective 1 October, across various tenures. 
RBI has raised the benchmark repo rate by 50 bps in total in the past two policy meetings, and another hike is being widely expected in its 5 October announcement. 
Typically, home loans are pegged to one-year MCLR. This is the fourth time in calendar year 2018 that SBI has increased one-year MCLR, which has gone up from 7.95% at the beginning of 2018 to 8.50% now, an increase of 55 bps. One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. 
While new borrowers will have to pay a higher interest rate on their home loans, existing home loan borrowers may continue paying the same rate until the reset clause kicks in. Every loan has a reset clause, which specifies the period after which the prevailing interest rate can be changed. 
What is MCLR? 
Till 31 March 2016, all floating rate loans were benchmarked with base rate, which was the lowest rate at which a bank could lend. However, there were concerns that when the overall interest rates were going down, the reduction was not getting passed on to the consumers adequately. Hence, a new and more transparent system was brought in. 
From 1 April 2016, all new floating rate loans, like home and car loans, are linked to MCLR. This rate is based on four components—marginal cost of funds, negative carry on account of cash reserve ratio, operating costs and tenor premium. 
MCLR is linked to actual deposit rates. Hence, when deposit rates rise, it indicates the banks are likely to hike MCLR and lending rates are set to go up. When deposit rates go down, the MCLR also goes down subsequently. The way MCLR is calculated, it is more sensitive to RBI policy rate changes and hence transmission is faster.
MCLR is the minimum rate at which commercial banks can lend. Most banks charge a spread to most customers over MCLR, based on the credit and risk profile of the customer and the type of loan that the person is availing. To attract good customers, some banks have also started offering loans at MCLR to customers with a good credit score. 
Base rate vs MCLR 
If you have taken a loan before April 2016 from a bank, which would be a loan based on base rate, you have the option to move from base rate to MCLR. With effect from 1 October, SBI has also increased its base rate from 8.95% to 9%. 
Just like MCLR-based loans, base rate-based loans too charge a spread over the base rate. So while the base rate is higher than MCLR, you need to ascertain the effective rate after the switch in comparison to what you are paying at present. You will also need to take into account the conversion fee to move from base rate to MCLR. While it can be negotiated, banks usually charge 50 bps of the outstanding amount or a flat fee as conversion fee. 
If the difference in the interest rate on older base-rate based loan and the effective rate after switching to MCLR is significant, say over 25 bps, and you have many years of repayment ahead, you might want to make the switch. However, if the difference in the two effective rates is marginal or you have a short repayment time left, you might not want to switch. 
If you are a new borrower, shop around to see which lender is offering the best interest rates. If you have a good credit score, you could negotiate and get a rate as low as MCLR itself, particularly for home loans."

Mumbai: GMR Infrastructure Ltd (GIL) on Monday said it has settled an ongoing arbitration with the private equity (PE) investors in its airport business GMR Airports Ltd (GAL), a move that is expected to clear the decks for GAL’s initial public offer (IPO).
The Bengaluru-based infrastructure firm has agreed to pay  ₹  3,560 crore to PE firms SBI Macquarie, Standard Chartered Private Equity, JM Financial Old Lane and others in lieu of their entire holding of compulsorily convertible preference shares in GAL. In addition, the PE investors will also acquire a 5.86% stake in the airport business valuing GAL at  ₹ 21,000 crore.
Mint reported on 21 August that the GMR Group is in talks with private equity fund AION Capital to raise around $500 million to buy out existing PE investors before its planned IPO toward the end of this year. While Aion did not respond to requests for comment, two people aware of the ongoing discussions said the PE fund is in the process of signing a binding agreement with GMR, the country’s largest private airport operator.
“The transaction is likely to close in the next 10 days which will also offer full exit to the investors of GAL,"" the first person mentioned above said. The three PE firms had invested  ₹  1,478 crore in GAL during fiscal year 2011 and 2012 through compulsorily convertible preference shares (CCPS). 
As per the investment agreement, signed during FY11 and FY12, GMR was to provide an exit to the investors either through an IPO, likely later this year, or a buyback in 2015. During the same year, due to lack of exit, the investors initiated arbitration proceedings against the infrastructure company administered by the Singapore International Arbitration Centre.
The settlement brings a three-year long arbitration process to an end. “Pursuant to the settlement agreement, all parties decided to withdraw the ongoing arbitration and pursuant to binding agreements giving effect to the terms of the settlement the Investors (along with certain of their affiliates) would acquire 5.86% equity of GAL at a 100% valuation of  ₹  210 billion and receive a payment of  ₹ 35.60 billion in lieu of their entire CCPS,"" or GIL said in a stock exchange filing.
The payout to PE investors will be funded by GIL through the sale of its airport-related equity holdings to the airport business. The sale will include GIL’s entire shareholding in Cebu airport and Clark EPC project for operations and maintenance in the Philippines at a valuation of $236 million and $5 million respectively. GIL will also sell its 40.1% stake in Delhi Airport Parking Services Ltd for $2 billion. 
GIL’s equity holding in Cebu airport and Clark EPC stands at 40% and 5% respectively. 
The acquisition will be funded by GAL through a fresh issue of non-convertible debentures worth  ₹  2,005 crore. Duff and Phelps was the valuation advisor. GMR Infrastructure Ltd had a consolidated net debt of  ₹  17,049 crore at the end of 31 March, according to Bloomberg.

The move is expected to give an additional liquidity cushion to NBFCs who will benefit by selling these loans on full-cash basis.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, India’s largest bank also said it is looking for opportunities in both priority and non-priority sectors. 
A senior official at SBI said the bank typically purchases loans from NBFCs to meet the shortfall in priority sector lending. These loans, he said, are to housing, small and medium enterprise (SME) and agriculture sectors. 
“We purchase these loans in cash and the deal is to buy 90% of the loan while the rest remains on the books of the NBFC,"" he said under condition of anonymity, adding that this year, the bank is looking to reduce the exposure below 90%.
The official added that he expects NBFCs to benefit from these deals at a time they are finding it difficult to raise money from the markets.
“The bank had initially planned for a growth of  ₹  15,000 crore through portfolio purchase during the current year, which is now being enhanced. As per bank’s internal assessment, there may be an opportunity to buy additional portfolio in the range of  ₹  20,000-30,000 crore,"" the statement said.
At the end of FY18, SBI’s total priority sector loan book stood at  ₹  4.66 trillion, of which 10.21% were non-performing loans, according to its FY18 annual report. 
Mint reported on 8 October that the National Housing Bank (NHB) has increased the refinancing limit to  ₹  30,000 crore from the existing limit of  ₹  24,000 crore in order to address the liquidity crisis in the housing finance industry. It would increase the availability of funds for housing finance companies, the government said in a statement.
The extension came at a time the shortage of liquidity has triggered fears of defaults by housing finance companies, hammering their shares. The refinance window is aimed at providing funds to housing finance companies at cheaper interest rates.
Starting July, the NHB has disbursed  ₹  8,835 crore of the  ₹  24,000 crore refinancing window to housing finance companies. The NHB is the regulator of housing finance firms and is tasked with providing them financial assistance.
The liquidity crisis surfaced after Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), which had funded long-term infrastructure projects through short-term funds, defaulted on payment obligations and was downgraded by credit agencies over the past two months. On 17 September, rating agency Icra downgraded IL&FS’s credit rating to default, after it failed to meet repayment obligations of  ₹  12,000 crore in short-term and long-term borrowings. 
RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya on Friday advised financial firms against relying on short-term sources for funding long-term projects, saying it appears to have led to a form of “maturity rat race in the financing of the financial sector"". Economic affairs secretary Subhash Chandra Garg said this measure should alleviate liquidity concerns to a great extent.

869,2018-10-11,State Bank,"Among the Sensex stocks, IndusInd Bank, Infosys, Tata Steel and SBI were down between 3% and 5%.

New Delhi: Wednesday’s rebound on Dalal Street proved short-lived. The global rout, triggered by an overnight tumble on Wall Street, has reached Indian shores and the Sensex fell over 1,000 points today while the Nifty hit 10,138 at the day’s low. The bloodbath on Dalal Street follows a rout in global equity markets after Wall Street suffered its worst drubbing in eight months, erasing hundreds of billions of dollars of wealth. The Sensex ended 759 points lower, barely managing to hold the 34,000 level. The Nifty settled at 10,234, down 2.1%. Among the Sensex stocks, Infosys, M&M, Vedanta, Tata Steel and SBI fell between 3% and 6%. The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure, with BSE midcap index ending 2.3% lower and smallcap index 1.1%.

Among the Sensex stocks, Infosys, M&M, Vedanta, Tata Steel and SBI fell between 3% and 6%. The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure, with BSE midcap index ending 2.3% lower and smallcap index 1.1%. 
10 things to know about the Nifty, Sensex selloff today:
1) Overnight, on Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended with a loss of 3.29%, Nasdaq Composite 4.08% while the Dow shed 2.2% amid a rout in technology shares like Amazon, Apple and Facebook. It was the fifth straight loss for US markets, the longest slide since Donald Trump’s election win.
2) The US market tumble was so bad that it attracted the attention of US President Donald Trump, who pointed an accusing finger at the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. “I really disagree with what the Fed is doing,"" Trump said. “I think the Fed has gone crazy.""
3) Hawkish commentary from policymakers of the Federal Reserve, which has hiked policy rates thrice so far this year, has sent US long-term bond yields to their highest in seven years. The surge made stocks look less attractive compared to bonds. The rise in US Treasury yields has been boosted by good US economic data that has reinforced expectations of multiple rate hikes over the next 12 months by the Federal Reserve. 
4) A spike in US bond yields and a strengthening US dollar has led to a selloff in emerging markets, including India. On the other hand, gold prices strengthened today, both domestic and overseas, amid a rout in equity markets. 
5) For example, foreigners have pulled out over $10 billion from Indian stock and bond markets so far this year. 
6) The outflows from the Indian market, rising oil prices and the current account deficit, a tumbling rupee, and a rout in NBFC shares following multiple defaults by infrastructure financier IL&FS have erased all the gains the Sensex and Nifty had posted so far this year.
7) To add to the woes of the Indian stock markets, the rupee has been posting new lows against the dollar, approaching the 74.50 mark a dollar today.
8) The slide in the rupee comes despite many measures announced by the government to shore up the currency. The government had earlier increased import duty on many items while the RBI had allowed Indian companies to raise more money abroad and eased norms for foreign investment in local bonds, though those efforts haven’t stopped the rupee’s slide.
9) The risk of a widening current account deficit has left the rupee vulnerable to the rout in emerging markets amid surging oil prices, trade tensions and rising US interest rates. So far this year, the rupee is down over 14% against the US dollar and is seen sliding to 75 per dollar by year-end, according to the median view of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
10) The rout in global equity markets has sent the price of oil lower. Brent for December settlement was $1.52 lower at $81.57 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe Exchange, after falling $1.91 on Wednesday. G Chokkalingam, founder of Equinomics Research and Advisory, said oil prices are down around 5% from recent highs and this will benefit Indian markets. He is optimistic about a recovery in the Indian markets after global markets settle down. The Indian markets had fallen sharply even before the current global equity rout and the oil price fall will provide a cushion to the Indian markets on the downside, he added."

“Indian stock markets have fallen sharply Thursday. This is a continuation of the sharp fall we have witnessed in the stock prices over the last couple of weeks (except for one or two days of exception).
“While most of the earlier fall could be attributed largely to domestic factors - be it the IL&FS effect and fears of contagion thereon, or the ever increasing fuel prices due to the combined effect of weakening rupee and rising global crude prices etc – the reason for the fall this morning is clearly global,"" said Dheeraj Singh, Head of Investments- Taurus Asset Management Co Ltd.

868,2018-10-12,State Bank,"State Bank of India (SBI) has announced a liquidity support by trebling its portfolio purchase of loans from NBFCs

Mumbai: Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are seeing rising borrowing costs despite State Bank of India’s (SBI’s) liquidity support, company executives said, a development that could translate into higher lending rates for customers over the next six months. 
Mumbai: Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are seeing rising borrowing costs despite State Bank of India’s (SBI’s) liquidity support, company executives said, a development that could translate into higher lending rates for customers over the next six months.
“Our borrowing costs have gone up to 50 basis points. We expect part of the higher cost to be shared by customers and dealers,"" said Ramesh Iyer, vice-chairman and managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra Financial Services Ltd. The average cost for a one-year borrowing for an NBFC rated “AAA"" is around 8.8%., according to Bloomberg News.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Many NBFCs like Shriram Transport Finance Co. Ltd attribute the rise in borrowing cost to the recent change in mix of funding from mutual funds to banks. 
“As the mutual fund outflows come to the banking system, borrowing costs for NBFCs have risen. Our incremental borrowing cost has gone up by 100 basis points,"" said Umesh Revankar, managing director of Shriram Transport. “That said, we have enough liquidity for the growth of existing business. However, we require additional liquidity for a 20-25% growth, which is not available,"" he said.
The liquidity crunch started after Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted on payments, prompting banks to freeze lending to NBFCs and housing finance companies. This caution worsened the liquidity situation of NBFCs. It got accentuated after DSP Mutual Fund sold a one-year  ₹  300-crore commercial paper issued by Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) in the secondary market, at a discount of 11%. Further, a record  ₹  2.1 trillion flowed out of liquid and money market funds in September, shows data collated by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi).
In response to this liquidity crunch, SBI announced a liquidity support by announcing trebling of its portfolio purchase of loans from NBFCs to  ₹  45,000 crore this year. 
The SBI move has met with mixed reaction from NBFCs. Some firms believe this will lead to NBFCs losing some of their best portfolio to banks and being left with bad assets. Other NBFC players feel there is need for stronger liquidity support from other banks. 
“Recently, MFs faced huge redemptions in their liquid funds to the extent of around  ₹  2 trillion, and it is reported that the funds have moved to banks. This is a great opportunity for banks to use these funds to buy retail portfolios from NBFCs/HFCs to provide the much-needed liquidity at this point of time. Large and reputed NBFCs/HFCs will not have any ALM mismatch. However, they can use the portfolio sale proceeds to either pay off their CPs (commercial papers) or do further lending,"" said R. Sridhar, executive vice chairman and chief executive of IndoStar Capital.
Analysts believe selling good assets could have a negative impact on the NBFCs’ business growth and profitability.
“We anticipate substantial slowdown in AUM growth of NBFC in 2HFY19 along with increase in cost of funds. This may result into broad-based cutting down of their existing growth and profitability guidance,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.
Separately on 5 October, the Reserve Bank of India had warned of asset liability mismatches as NBFCs resort to increased market borrowings in the form of CPs for long-term funding such as infrastructure. The central bank assured that it will look at strengthening the ALM guidelines to avoid the roll-over risk going forward."
867,2018-10-12,State Bank,"State Bank of India is also seeing a slowdown in accretion of new bad loans, says Rajnish Kumar

Nusa Dua, Indonesia: State Bank of India , the country’s largest lender, sees its provision for bad loans remaining high for at least the next two quarters, after which it will start softening as it steps up efforts to improve asset quality, its chairman said on Friday. 
Nusa Dua, Indonesia: State Bank of India , the country’s largest lender, sees its provision for bad loans remaining high for at least the next two quarters, after which it will start softening as it steps up efforts to improve asset quality, its chairman said on Friday.
The state-run lender is also seeing a slowdown in “accretion"" of new bad loans, Rajnish Kumar told Reuters on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting at the Indonesian resort island of Bali.
India’s banks have been plagued by a surge in non-performing loans which hit a record $150 billion at the end of March. Twenty-one lenders led by SBI, in which the Indian government owns a majority stake, accounted for 86 percent of the pile.
“Whatever is the provision coverage...that will still remain elevated for at least two quarters and after that it should start tapering off, the requirement to do more coverage,"" Kumar said. “Overall, NPAs (non-performing loans) are under control.""
SBI, which accounts for about a fifth of India’s banking assets, saw its provisions for bad loans rising 7.5% in the June quarter from a year earlier, pulling it to its third straight quarter of losses.
SBI is one of the top shareholders in Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS), which has been taken over by the government on worries about the impact of its collapse on the financial markets.
“There are some projects where they have disputed claims. They really need to determine very quickly, which I’m sure the new board will be doing, how much money is recoverable and if there’s any gap then how do we address that gap.""

The September quarter (Q2) saw different shades of performance by life insurance companies and the pressure on their unit-linked products was patently visible. In terms of profitability, HDFC Standard Life overshadowed its peers ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life in performance. HDFC Life reported a robust 28% growth in value of new business and a huge 43% increase in new business premium. As a consequence, its value for new business margin was 24.3%, the highest among the three insurers who have reported results so far.
Not just individuals, but companies also grabbed the insurer’s products as it saw a 36% growth in its group new business premium. But the key gain was in the margin-friendly protection business (term plans), the share of which grew to 16.2% from 11.8% in the overall annualized premium equivalent. Protection business has been the focus of many insurers mainly due to its potential to increase profitability and the stability it lends to the product portfolio.
In this aspect, HDFC Life’s portfolio mix is superior to its peers. The share of protection in the annualized premium equivalent of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was 7.9% for the six months ended September.
The share of equity-linked products continues to dominate the portfolio of all three insurers. Considering the dismal performance of equity markets over the past month, Ulips have fallen out of favour, affecting the growth rate of premiums for the insurers. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw its new business premium drop by 5%. That said, ICICI Prudential Life could squeeze enough bang for a buck as its value of new business surged 41.5%, unlike the other two. The insurer even reported an impressive value for new business margin, at 17.5%.
SBI Life continued to report strong growth metrics despite being the largest insurer. Its new business premium grew 30% while the value of new business premium rose by 22%. Analysts believe that at roughly two times its estimated embedded value for FY20, SBI Life’s stock is reasonably valued. The valuation of HDFC Standard Life however is viewed as stretched, with some brokerages having a sell call on the stock."

 Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) wants to appoint an adviser to liaison among the separate resolution professionals (RPs) and prospective bidders for the 15 Videocon group entities that it referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), according to a public notice. 
 Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) wants to appoint an adviser to liaison among the separate resolution professionals (RPs) and prospective bidders for the 15 Videocon group entities that it referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), according to a public notice.
The bank has mandated SBI Capital Markets to look for this “common process adviser"". 
According to the notice, the adviser will need to coordinate among the committees of creditors and resolution professionals of the 15 companies and be the single point of contact for the prospective bidders on behalf of the lenders.
SBI believes this will help streamline the bidding and resolution process “to enable maximization of value for all stakeholders of the Videocon Group Companies from the prospective resolution plan(s)"".
The companies include Videocon Industries Ltd, Videocon Telecommunications Ltd, KAIL Ltd, Electroworld Digital Solutions Ltd, Value Industries Ltd, Evans Fraser and Co (India) Ltd, Millennium Appliances India Ltd, Sky Appliances Ltd, PE Electronics Ltd, Techno Electronics Ltd, Trend Electronics Ltd, Applicomp (India) Ltd, Techno Kart India Ltd, Century Appliances Ltd and CE India Ltd.
Videocon’s businesses, especially in consumer electronics and home appliances segment, are dependent on each other, according to SBI.
“The consortium of lenders to Videocon Group companies believe that a comprehensive resolution of all the Videocon Group Companies in a consolidated manner may fetch higher value for all the stakeholders as opposed to individual resolution of each Videocon Group Company,"" the notice said.
Legal experts said this will set a precedent for future insolvency cases where a conglomerate with several groups comprises faces the resolution process.
“Each company is a different legal entity and hence requires separate RPs. However, when group companies are interconnected or in businesses that complement each other, this kind of arrangement will surely fetch more value for lenders and also other stakeholders,"" said Sandeep Singhi, managing partner of corporate and dispute resolution firm Singhi & Co.
Nishit Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP & Partners, said appointing separate RPs for 15 companies and another advisor to liaison among them will add to the red tape. “The best way to deal with the situation is to have one RP for the entire group rather than going by the dotted line,"" said Dhruva.
On 5 October, Venugopal Dhoot, the chairman and managing director of Videocon Industries Ltd, had approached the NCLT to seek its intervention to stop inviting expressions of interest by the RPs of these 15 companies as the promoters have approached the principal bench in New Delhi for consolidation of the resolution process. 
“The promoter of the Aurangabad-based group has cross-shareholdings in every company and an expression of interest at this stage in any company that is under the insolvency proceedings can harm the prospects of other companies as well,"" a lawyer representing the promoters said on condition of anonymity.
Earlier on 6 June, the NCLT had admitted the insolvency plea filed by SBI against Videocon Industries Ltd. The single bench of NCLT, presided over by M.K. Shrawat, ruled in an oral order that the insolvency petition is fit for admission.
Another bench of the NCLT had also admitted insolvency action against Dhoot-owned mobile operating firm Videocon Telecommunications Ltd (VTL).
At the time of admitting both the insolvency petition, the tribunal had also approved the name of Anuj Jain as interim resolution professional (IRP) to conduct the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of Videocon Industries as well as Videocon Telecommunications.

New York: Indian banks are now “on top of the situation"" on the problem of the non-performing assets (NPA), State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said. Kumar said that going by the initial results that have started coming in September, it seems that many banks are returning to profit.

Kumar said that going by the initial results that have started coming in September, it seems that many banks are returning to profit. Elaborating further on the issue of NPAs, Kumar said last year the system was struggling with higher and elevated NPAs and largely it was the steel and power sectors that got impacted the most.
“The major challenge which the banks - public sector more and some of the private sector banks (in India) - they have been facing is the asset quality challenge. For the last three years, it has been going on but as of now we are now on top of the situation on the NPA problem,"" Kumar told PTI in an interview here. “In the power sector, the banks have still not been able to resolve the issues. But the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has helped the banks and at least now there is a solution available,"" he said.
Kumar added that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code has come as a “very good tool"" in the hands of the banks and the financial creditors. On the value of the rupee, which had this month fell below the 74 level compared to the dollar, Kumar said, “If the oil prices are stabilized, the exchange will also stabilize…Domestic inflation is not as much a cause of worry because it is very much well within the target that the Reserve Bank of India has set.""
He said domestically, the economy continues to do well but the oil prices are the “major culprit"" because that impacts the country’s current account deficit in a big way and it puts pressure on the exchange rate."

As of March 2018, SBI had issued over 39.50 crore debit cards while around 26 crore cards were being actively used.
There will be no changes in the daily withdrawal limits on other SBI debit cards. For example, SBI’s Gold and Platinum debit cards have a daily ATM withdrawal limit of  ₹ 50,000 and  ₹ 1 lakh, respectively.

The move on part of SBI to reduce the daily withdrawal limit was to reduce fraudulent transactions at ATMs and to encourage digital and cashless transactions. “The bank has been receiving many complaints regarding cloning. Due to this, the decision is taken to reduce the withdrawal limit on these cards,"" a Press Trust of India report cited an SBI official as saying.
In the recent past, SBI has announced many changes for the benefit of customers. SBI in a recent communication on Twitter has said that account holders can submit Form 15G/H at any SBI branch, instead of just the home branch. “No need to worry about going to the home branch anymore! Now, SBI accepts your form 15G/H at any and every SBI branch,"" SBI said on Twitter. A home branch is the branch where a customer has a bank account. All other branches of the bank are non-home branches for the customer. SBI also allows submission of Form 15G/H online.
Banks have to deduct TDS when interest income crosses a certain threshold in a financial year. Form 15G and Form 15H can be submitted to make sure TDS is not deducted on your income. Form 15H is for senior citizens.

SBI has also removed the limit on the amount that can be deposited in a non-home branch. Earlier the limit was  ₹ 25,000.
Meanwhile, SBI has been urging its customers who hold magstripe debit cards to switch to chip-based debit cards. “Do not take a chance; get enhanced security for your #debit card by applying for the SBI EMV Chip debit card without any fee at your branch or through OnlineSBI,"" said SBI in another tweet.
Those holding magstripe debit cards are required to change their EMV chip debit cards by the end of this year, according to RBI’s guidelines. EMV chip card technology, the latest global standard for debit card payments, helps protect against card fraud (skimming).

New Delhi: The country’s largest lender SBI has halved the daily cash withdrawal limit from ATMs for certain debit-card holders to Rs20,000 from Wednesday.
The withdrawal limit has been curtailed on Classic and Maestro debit cards, held by a large number of the bank customers.
However, customers with other variants of SBI debit card can continue to enjoy higher daily withdrawal from ATMs.
As per a senior SBI official, the average cash withdrawal from ATMs per card is less than Rs20,000 and the move will help in checking frauds and promote digital transaction.
About a month ago, the State Bank of India (SBI) had alerted its customers holding Classic and Maestro debit cards regarding reduction of cash withdrawal limit to Rs20,000 a day from ATM starting 31 October.
The SBI had put out the following message on its website: “Daily cash withdrawal limit for Classic and Maestro debit cards has been reduced from Rs40,000 to Rs20,000 per day with effect from 31 October.
“If you require higher daily cash withdrawal limit, please apply for a higher card variant."" SBI Managing Director PK Gupta had said the reduction in withdrawal intends to protect customers from fraudulent cash withdrawals from ATMs and also to spur more digital transactions.
“We analysed all the ATM transactions and we found that most of them are less than Rs20,000 a day. In case of frauds reported to us, we found that in all such cases withdrawals of Rs40,000 (the maximum) have happened. So, this is basically to protect the customers and secondly, we want that more digital transactions should happen,"" Gupta had said.
If any customer wants higher limit of cash withdrawal, he or she can ask for a higher variant card.
When asked how many such customers/cards are to be impacted due to this reduced limit, he said a very large number of customers fall into this category.
However, the bank has lots of customers with higher variant debit card, so they are not impacted.

Here are 5 things to know about SBI’s latest rule on cash daily withdrawal:
1) The withdrawal limit on other SBI debit cards remains unchanged. SBI’s Gold and Platinum debit cards, for example, have a daily ATM withdrawal limit of  ₹ 50,000 and  ₹ 1 lakh, respectively. SBI, India’s largest bank, has a network of nearly 22,500 branches and 59,000 ATMs. As of March 2018, SBI had over 40 crore active customer accounts. 
2) A top SBI official said that the bank has reduced the daily cash withdrawal limit on Classic and Maestro cards to reduce fraudulent transactions at ATMs and encourage digital and cashless transactions.

4) Meanwhile, SBI has been asking its account holders who have magstripe debit cards to switch to chip-based debit cards. SBI is replacing the cards free of cost. SBI account holders can apply online or visit their branches for the new debit card. Chip-based EMV cards come with more security features than the magstripe debit cards. Those holding magstripe debit cards are required to change their EMV chip debit cards by the end of this year, according to RBI’s guidelines. 
5) Meanwhile for the benefit of account holders, SBI has allowed the submission of Form 15G/H at any SBI branch, instead of just the home branch. SBI also allows submission of Form 15G/H online.

Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) has withdrawn an insolvency petition against Mumbai-based Uttam Galva Steels Ltd. The state-run lender’s move came after ArcelorMittal paid  ₹ 7,469 crore to clear outstanding debts of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, two companies in which Lakshmi Niwas Mittal had been a promoter. 
Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) has withdrawn an insolvency petition against Mumbai-based Uttam Galva Steels Ltd. The state-run lender’s move came after ArcelorMittal paid  ₹ 7,469 crore to clear outstanding debts of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron, two companies in which Lakshmi Niwas Mittal had been a promoter.
ArcelorMittal cleared the debts to become eligible to bid for debt-laden Essar Steel Ltd. Lenders to bankrupt Essar Steel last month accepted the resolution plan submitted by a joint venture of ArcelorMittal, promoted by Mittal, and Japan’s Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp.
On Thursday, Meghna Rajadhyaksha, partner at law firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas, representing SBI, informed the tribunal that the lender has decided to withdraw the petition.
The NCLT, presided by V.P. Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy, accepted SBI’s request.
SBI filed the bankruptcy petition against Uttam Galva after the company defaulted on  ₹ 1,486 crore of its total outstanding of  ₹ 1,832 crore. The Mumbai-based listed steel company’s total dues stood at  ₹ 6,880 crore as of September 2017. “We are unable to comment anything on the development or on our future strategy at this point in time,"" Ankit Miglani, managing director and part of Uttam Galva’s founding family said in an interview. “We are still studying the situation."" ArcelorMittal did not respond to an email query.
Uttam Galva is part of Reserve Bank of India’s so-called second list of defaulters, against whom the central bank had directed swift action.
On 24 March, Uttam Galva informed the exchanges it had received approvals from BSE and the National Stock Exchange to declassify the world’s largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal as a promoter of the company. ArcelorMittal had held a 29.1% stake since 2009 in the company. 
However, it asked Miglanis, founders of Uttam Galva to buy its stake in the firm to be qualify for bidding for another stressed asset, Essar Steel Ltd. 
On 4 October, the Supreme Court granted a final opportunity to ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius—the then two frontrunners for Essar Steel—to settle outstanding dues in related companies and submit fresh bids. ArcelorMittal subsequently paid  ₹ 7,469 crore (around $1 billion) to the financial creditors of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.
Even though the flagship company has managed to come out of the woods, two subsidiaries Uttam Value Steel and Uttam Galva Metallics are still under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP), as they owe banks  ₹ 3,200 crore and  ₹ 2,200 crore, respectively."

844,2018-11-06,State Bank,"SBI shareholders will meet on 7 December to consider the proposal to raise up to Rs20,000 crore through various modes, including a follow on FPO, to fund its growth

 New Delhi: The country’s largest lender SBI on Tuesday said it plans to raise up to Rs20,000 crore through various modes, including a follow on public offer (FPO), to fund its growth.
The shareholders of the bank will meet on 7 December to consider the proposal to raise funds, SBI said in a regulatory filing.
The bank said consent of the shareholders will be sought to issue equity shares for an amount not exceeding Rs20,000 crore or such amount as approved by the government and the Reserve Bank by way of public issue (FPO) or private placement including qualified institutional placement (QIP)/GDR/ADR or any other mode or a combination as may be decided by the board.
“The proceeds of the issue are proposed to be used to meet long term funding requirements of the bank, bank’s growth capital requirements, to meet capital expenditure, making investments/providing loans and advances, enhance its long term resources and thereby strengthening the financial structure of the Bank and its subsidiaries and associates and other general banking purposes as permitted by applicable laws,"" it said.
Banks globally have to adhere to Basel-III capital requirements by 1 January, 2019. However, domestic banks are set to follow the norms by 31 March. It was implemented in phases from April 2013 in India.
“The bank’s overall capital adequacy ratio (CAR), as on 30th June, 2018, stands as 12.83%, with CET-I Capital at 9.80%. The Central Board of the Bank has decided that the Bank should maintain minimum CAR in line with the RBI Basel III transitional arrangements,"" it said.
However, SBI said it may be required to raise additional capital during the current fiscal.
“Accordingly, considering the business growth during the current year as well as that for the years to come, there is a need for higher capital, particularly, tier-I capital...After evaluating the various available alternatives, as well as taking into consideration the guidelines issued by RBI, the bank has planned to access capital market to raise capital,"" it added.
SBI stock closed 2.98% down at Rs286.50 on BSE.

845,2018-11-06,State Bank,"It is premature for State Bank of India to sound the all-clear on asset quality when it has a $20 billion exposure to shadow financiers facing a liquidity squeeze

State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar wants to assure investors he’s in complete control of the “demon"" of soured loans. Not so fast, Aladdin. 
State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar wants to assure investors he’s in complete control of the “demon"" of soured loans. Not so fast, Aladdin.
The bank’s first quarterly profit in 12 months is no doubt an encouraging sign, though net income of $129 million on a $284 billion loan book is hardly worth celebrating. Besides, it’s premature for India’s largest lender to sound the all-clear on asset quality when it has a $20 billion exposure to shadow financiers facing a liquidity squeeze.
 Also read: With strong Q2 performance, SBI seeks to ramp up credit to economy
So far, investors’ attention has been on state-run Indian banks’ loans to big companies, which have been largely responsible for their bloated non-performing advances. But with strong buyer interest for distressed assets like Essar Steel India Ltd., there’s hope that some of the losses already booked on those accounts can be written back as profits. Further slippages could also be contained, with State Bank of India’s NPA ratio improving to (a still awful) 9.95% in September from almost 11% in March.
However, it would be wrong to think that India’s bad-loan problem has gone away. State Bank’s $600 million debt and equity exposure to IL&FS Group, the infrastructure lender whose sudden bankruptcy caused a crisis of confidence among nonbank financiers, is just the tip of the iceberg. The big chill will come if State Bank’s $36 billion in advances to small and midsize enterprises are stressed, which may well happen if shadow lenders are forced to cut back their own exposure to these borrowers.
Meanwhile, don’t underestimate the political dimension. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants banks to approve SME loans in 59 minutes. Sooner or later, such state-directed credit binges are guaranteed to end – badly.
The other worry is that shadow lenders’ troubles will carry over to property developers, some of which could lose access to short-term financing. With general elections due by May, the last thing the government wants is for builders to go bankrupt, abandoning projects and sending construction workers back to villages. Subdued real-estate prices could hurt consumer sentiment. SBI has $79 billion at stake in retail loans, including mortgages. The bad-loan ratio for this group of borrowers is currently only 1.2 percent, but it’s worth watching.
Finally, easing the liquidity crunch is the joint responsibility of the government and the central bank. But just when they should be working together, the finance ministry and the monetary authority are engaging in a very public slanging match.
On at least eight separate occasions in as many years, State Bank’s CEOs have claimed that the worst was over. Each time they were proved wrong. With so many genies waiting to be bottled, Kumar, too, should be cautious.

847,2018-11-06,State Bank,"SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar says he sees no systemic risk at the moment

Mumbai: The liquidity situation of non-banking financial companies (NBFC) has improved over the past three weeks, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Monday. 
Mumbai: The liquidity situation of non-banking financial companies (NBFC) has improved over the past three weeks, State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Monday.
Kumar said he sees no systemic risk at the moment. “I don’t see a systemic risk and whatever are the issues being faced by the NBFC sector are all very well known. But things seem to be much better today than they were three weeks ago,"" said Kumar after announcing SBI’s Q2 FY19 results.
The bank has already sanctioned the purchase of  ₹ 5,250 crore loans from NBFCs through the portfolio purchase programme and another  ₹ 15,940 crore is in the pipeline, the SBI chief said.
The bank had earlier announced that it will triple its target of buying standard loans from NBFCs up to  ₹ 45,000 crore in FY19. These loans are purchased in cash and while 90% of the loan is bought out, the rest remains on the books of the NBFC.
“Most of the NBFCs have been able to roll over their commercial papers (CPs) and non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and I hope they will be able to meet their upcoming commitments,"" said Kumar.
The bank’s outstanding loans to the NBFC sector stands at  ₹ 1.5 trillion, which includes the Housing Development Finance Corp (HFDC), the Power Finance Corp (PFC) and LIC Housing Finance Ltd, he said.
Commercial banks have three kinds of exposures to an NBFC. These include subscribing to their commercial papers, sanctioning a loan or a line of credit, and buying existing loans from them.
Outstanding bank credit to all industry stood at  ₹ 27.01 trillion in the fortnight ended 28 September, up 2.6% from the year-ago period, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data. Bank loans to NBFCs stood at  ₹ 5.46 trillion in the same fortnight, up 41.5% from the same period last year.
SBI has an exposure of  ₹ 4,250 crore to the Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) group, which is currently classified as standard, Kumar said.
“As I said it (exposure) is all at the special purpose vehicle (SPV) levels, spread over 13-14 SPVs, and our exposure is about  ₹ 4,000 crore and another  ₹ 250 crore to the holding company,"" said the SBI chairman.
Asked about discussions with the new board of IL&FS, Kumar said the bank will be part of the resolution plan and will support Uday Kotak in his efforts.
The liquidity crisis in NBFCs surfaced after IL&FS, which had funded long-term infrastructure projects through short-term funds, defaulted on payment obligations and was downgraded by credit agencies.
SBI is awaiting clarifications on how much capital should be set aside for partial credit enhancements to NBFC bonds, Kumar said.
Last week, RBI allowed banks to provide partial credit enhancement to bonds issued by some NBFCs, thereby enhancing the credit rating of these bonds and enabling the NBFCs to access funds from the bond market on better terms."
846,2018-11-06,State Bank,"With the overhang of bad loans seemingly receding, SBI hopes to grow faster even as it begins to get back money from errant borrowers

State Bank of India (SBI) has good news for the Indian economy. Notwithstanding all the news about a liquidity shortage among non-bank lenders and capital-starved banks, the economy will not be starved of credit. Rajnish Kumar, chairman of SBI, said the bank is well positioned to cater to the economy’s credit needs with a healthy capital base and enough liquidity. The lender’s capital adequacy ratio is 13.56% at the end of the September quarter, much higher than the regulatory mandate of 9.5% and its credit-to-deposit ratio is 66-67%.

And, what better timing than now when most of its competing non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are struggling with liquidity issues. In fact, SBI is willing to lend a hand to them by buying off their portfolios to free up their capital. In October it bought  ₹ 5,250 crore worth of loans from NBFCs and is willing to purchase another  ₹ 15,000 crore in the coming months.

Profit declined 40% from  ₹ 1,582 crore in the year-ago period. The Q2 profit, however, beat the  ₹ 439.2 crore estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.

The bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 10.6% to  ₹ 2.06 trillion in Q2 against  ₹ 1.86 trillion in the year-ago quarter. However, as a percentage of total advances, gross NPAs improved on a sequential basis to 9.95% at September-end compared with 10.7% in the previous quarter.
The bank reported slippages worth  ₹ 10,888 crore in the September quarter compared with  ₹ 14,349 crore in the previous quarter. The slippage ratio, which is loans turning bad during the quarter, fell to 2% and was the lowest in six quarters, the bank said.
The increase in slippages was seen in the bank’s small and medium portfolio. The SME portfolio saw increased slippage as a dispensation provided by the Reserve Bank of India to these firms expired in the September quarter.
“Though the profit is modest, there is no looking back,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said at the press conference. “From here on, this number will only be bigger and better. We have complete control over the demon of NPA,"" Kumar said.
Provisions during the quarter dropped 36.8% to  ₹ 12,092.17 crore against  ₹ 19,137.43 crore in the year-ago quarter. In the April-June quarter, the bank had set aside  ₹ 19,228.26 crore in provisions.
The bank said it expects some relief from the first list of accounts referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). “We will see a  ₹ 6,000 crore write-back from one of the NCLT-1 accounts,"" Kumar said, referring to the Essar Steel resolution.
On the operational performance, the bank’s other income, which includes core fee income, dropped 26.1% to  ₹ 7,814.50 crore during the September quarter, from  ₹ 10,579.91 crore a year ago.
Domestic advances grew 11.1% with corporate loan portfolio growing at 14.3% over last year. Retail advances, including SME, agriculture and personal advances, grew 8.9%.
Kumar also said that the countries largest lender, which was handling most of the payments to Iran for oil purchases, is now complying with the US sanctions against Tehran.
“We are an international bank. We are based in the US. And for a bank which is present in the USA we will act strictly in accordance with the sanctions... We will comply with the sanctions,"" Kumar said.

SBI, the country’s largest bank, has eased rules for submission of Form 15G and Form 15H by its account holders. SBI in a communication through Twitter said account holders can submit Form 15G and Form 15H at any of its bank branches, instead of just the home branch. “No need to worry about going to the home branch anymore! Now, SBI accepts your form 15G/H at any and every SBI branch,"" the bank said on Twitter. A home branch is the branch where a customer has a bank account.

Now, SBI accepts your form 15G/H at any and every SBI branch,"" the bank said on Twitter. A home branch is the branch where a customer has a bank account.
SBI in its Twitter post also shared the link where account holders can download Form 15G, Form 15H and other forms. As of March 2018, SBI had over 40 crore active customer accounts. 
Banks are mandated to deduct TDS or tax deducted at source when interest income crosses a certain threshold in a financial year. Basically, Form 15G or Form Form 15H (for senior citizens) are self-declaration forms to state that his/her income is below the taxable limit. Form 15G and Form 15H (for senior citizens) are submitted by account holders to make sure TDS is not deducted on their income.
For example, if you have an FD with SBI and your total income is expected to be below the taxable limit, Form 15G or Form 15H can be submitted to the bank to avoid TDS on interest earned on such deposits. Banks deduct TDS at the rate of 10% where depositors have furnished their Permanent Account Number (PAN) and at the rate of 20% in cases where there is no PAN.
No need to worry about going to the home branch anymore! Now, SBI accepts your form 15G/H at any and every SBI branch. Download the forms at https://t.co/cSnNE2BbY0#SBI #StateBankOfIndia #FormSubmission #OnlineSBI #Form15GH pic.twitter.com/S6Xyko6QtE
Ideally, Form 15G or Form 15H should be submitted at the start of the new financial year. From this financial year, TDS will not be charged to senior citizens if the interest income is less than  ₹ 50,000.
If an SBI account holder has internet banking facility, SBI also allows online submission of Form 15G or Form 15H. SBI account holders can log into their accounts online and submit the forms under e-services. In another recent communication, SBI has asked account holders to register their mobile numbers with the bank by 1 December 2018, failing which the bank will block access to their net banking accounts.
Meanwhile, in another customer friendly rule, SBI has also removed the limit on the amount that can be deposited in a non-home branch. Earlier the limit was  ₹ 25,000.
SBI has also been urging its account holders who still have magstripe debit cards to switch to the more secure EMV chip debit cards by the end of this year. SBI is replacing the magstripe debit cards free of cost. Account holders can also place a request online for the replacement of magstripe debit cards."

When the share markets are volatile it is considered a good idea to add some debt to your investment portfolio. One of the safer ways to earn something from your idle savings is investing in bank fixed deposits.

New Delhi: As SBI’s one-stop solution platform ‘YONO’ for accessing all the banking services digitally remained suspended following the Supreme Court’s order on Aadhaar seeding, the bank has sought clarity from the RBI for an alternative solution, a top official said.
The Supreme Court order on September 26 said it was not mandatory to link the 12-digit unique identification number Aadhaar for opening or availing banking services, among others.
Since then the State Bank of India (SBI) has disabled the facility of opening paperless bank account through ‘You Only Need One’ (YONO) temporarily, customers are required to visit a branch to open an account.
“As of now the e-KYC is not being permitted, so we want some clarification from the RBI. We have discussed this with the regulator. So after the clarification comes, then we can start (doing e-KYC through Aadhaar),"" the official told PTI.
The digital platform ‘YONO’, launched in November 2017, offers all financial services and lifestyle products and services of the bank including opening an account without even visiting a bank branch. Among others, customers can also transfer funds, avail of pre-approved personal loan sans any paperwork and get overdraft facility against fixed deposits.
SBI has set an ambitious customer base to 250 million through YONO platform in the next two years. By August, there were more than 2.5 million users registered under YONO platform of the bank.
Before the SC order on Aadhaar, the unique identification number was made mandatory for a host of services including banking and telephony and became a one-point solution to complete the know your customer (KYC) requirement at an affordable cost."

Mutual fund inflows have grown significantly over the last two years. Would you attribute this to the push towards financialisation of savings or is it more about recognising the potential of MF products across investment needs? 
Favourable demographics, rising income levels and a burgeoning affluent middle class have provided a strong customer base for the industry. We have seen investors moving towards evolved financial assets from passive ones. Over the last two years, the industry AUM (assets under management) has grown to 23% of bank deposits from 10%. The government’s push towards financialisation of savings through various initiatives as well as Mutual Fund Sahi Hai campaign by Amfi (Association of Mutual Funds of India) has led to this impressive growth. The growth can also be attributed to evolved products, digitalisation and ease of doing transactions. 
However, there is a lot of untapped potential across the country as awareness about MF catering to different financial goals is still low."

A home loan is probably the biggest loan that one takes. Not only in terms of the loan amount, but also tenures, which can be 15 years or more. The total final amount that one pays can be double of what was borrowed. But a home loan is among the cheapest loans available, and usually it is the only way a person can buy a house.

A home loan is called a ‘good’ loan because it helps you acquire a tangible asset that can appreciate over the long term. It makes sense to buy a house if you plan to live in it. This is also the reason, apart from the fact that many housing projects in India continue to be delayed by many years, why financial advisers say that one should buy a ready-to-move-in house.

New Delhi: SBI Capital Markets, KPMG and EY are in the fray to advise on the acquisitions of Satluj Jal Vidhyut Nigam Ltd (SJVNL) and Power Finance Corp. (PFC) by NTPC Ltd and REC Ltd, respectively, said two people aware of the development.
While the acquisition of the government’s 65.69% share in PFC by REC will help the centre net around  ₹ 13,000 crore, NTPC will pay around  ₹ 8,000 crore for acquiring the government’s 63.79% stake in SJVNL. The three firms are expected to make their respective presentations before the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) for the role of merger and acquisition adviser.
The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government is trying to meet its disinvestment target of  ₹ 80,000 crore for the current fiscal. It has so far garnered only  ₹ 15,247 crore, with its bid to privatize Air India collapsing.
“For PSUs, which occupy the same space, there is a value in integration and scaling them up. The process for appointment of advisors is on for the two acquisitions that has to be done,"" said the first person, requesting anonymity. “These are two big acquisitions on DIPAM’s radar for which the process is on,"" said the second person, who also requested anonymity.
On 24 September, news agency PTI reported that the government is considering selling its 65.61% stake in state-owned PFC to REC. Bloomberg reported on 24 March that NTPC is seeking to buy the government’s stake in hydro-power producer SJVNL.
While a KPMG spokesperson declined to comment, an SBI Caps spokesperson in an emailed response said: “As a company policy, we do not comment on speculation/mandate-related queries."" 
Queries emailed to spokespersons of India’s ministries of finance and power, EY, Power Finance Corp., NTPC Ltd and REC Ltd on 15 November evening remained unanswered. SJVNL, too, did not respond to emailed queries.
The Economic Times on Monday reported that the power ministry is concerned that the move will hurt the two firms.
The Union finance ministry has also sought proposals for appointing merchant bankers and selling brokers for divesting its stakes in General Insurance Corp. of India (GIC) and New India Assurance Co. Ltd (NIACL), using the stock exchange platform. 
In January 2017, the cabinet committee on economic affairs had approved the public listing of five state-owned non-life insurance companies and reducing the government’s stakes in them to 75% from 100%.
Finance minister Arun Jaitley had laid down the NDA government’s disinvestment policy in his budget speech for 2016-17. 
“We see opportunities to strengthen our central public sector enterprises (CPSEs) through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. By these methods, CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders.
“Possibilities of such restructuring are visible in the oil and gas sector. We propose to create an integrated public sector ‘oil major’, which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies,"" he said. 
In 2017-18, the government overshot its disinvestment target of  ₹ 72,500 crore by garnering  ₹ 1 trillion, aided by the acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd by Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd for around  ₹ 37,000 crore.
Share buyback by PSUs is also on the government’s radar. In 2017-18, the Centre carried out as many as 13 buybacks in cash-rich PSUs to meet its disinvestment target."

New Delhi: When it comes to investment that offers guaranteed returns, fixed deposits (FDs), also known as term deposits, are very popular among Indians. Bank FDs are meant for people who are looking for guaranteed returns, unaffected by market uncertainties. FDs require customers to deposit a lump sum for a rate of interest that is higher than that offered in savings accounts. The tenure of an FD ranges from seven days to 10 years. State Bank of India (SBI), the largest lender in the country, last revised its FD interest rates in July 2018. The higher rates are applicable on SBI fixed deposits of more than one year. SBI is offering an interest rate of 6.70% on FDs with maturity between one year and less than two years. If you keep your money with SBI for a period for 3 to 5 years you get an interest rate of 6.80%. As your term increases, so does the interest rate.

Multi-option deposit account, reinvestment account and tax savings account are some of the FD accounts of SBI.
A look at the type of SBI fixed deposit accounts:
 SBI Multi Option Deposit Scheme (MODS)
SBI Multi Option Deposit Scheme (MODS) are term deposits linked to savings accounts or individual current accounts. Unlike normal term deposits, which are fully liquidated anytime you need funds, you can withdraw from a MODS account in multiples of  ₹ 1,000 according to your need. The balance amount in your MODS account will continue to earn the term deposit rates applicable at the time of the initial deposit. A MODS account can be created through OnlineSBI or by visiting the nearest branch. The minimum fixed deposit amount for the multi-option deposit creation is  ₹ 1,000. Any deposit above this amount is required to be in multiples of  ₹ 1,000. There is no upper limit on the amount that can be deposited. The minimum tenure for this deposit is one year while the maximum is five years.

SBI Reinvestment Plan
This works like a fixed deposit. The difference between an SBI fixed deposit and reinvestment plan is that instead of interest being paid out at a regular frequency during the period of deposit, interest is paid out only at the time of maturity. Regular interest is added to the principal and compound interest is calculated and paid thereon. The minimum instalment that one is required to deposit in SBI Reinvestment Plan is  ₹ 1,000. There is no maximum limit on the investment. Interest rates for SBI Reinvestment Plan are the same as on fixed deposits.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

New Delhi: India’s GDP growth in the September quarter (Q2) is expected to slow to 7.5%-7.6% over the previous three months mainly due to slowdown in rural demand, a report released by SBI Research said Monday. India’s GDP growth rate at constant prices (2011-12) stood at 8.2% in the April-June quarter (Q1) of 2018-19. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will be releasing estimates for Q2 GDP growth on Friday. 
New Delhi: India’s GDP growth in the September quarter (Q2) is expected to slow to 7.5%-7.6% over the previous three months mainly due to slowdown in rural demand, a report released by SBI Research said Monday. India’s GDP growth rate at constant prices (2011-12) stood at 8.2% in the April-June quarter (Q1) of 2018-19. The Central Statistics Office (CSO) will be releasing estimates for Q2 GDP growth on Friday.
The SBI Ecowrap report said SBI Composite Leading Indicator (CLI), a basket of 21 leading indicators for Q2 FY19, is showing a marginal declining trend. Consequently, the headline second quarter Gross Value Added (GVA) growth could be 7.3-7.4%, due to the slowing of rural demand, it said.
“We also believe that the growth numbers in the second quarter will be helped by a weak base in September quarter 2017-18. We estimate that the base impact on second quarter GVA growth is around 30 bps. Based on tax collections, we subsequently expect Q2 GDP growth at 7.5-7.6%,"" said Ecowrap.
One basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point.
According to SBI Ecowrap, commercial vehicle sales, domestic air passenger traffic and cement production have maintained double-digit growth during Q2. All these indicators pushed up GVA in the quarter. However, the monthly data of various indicators for October 2018 suggest the GVA growth is slowing due to decline in demand.
“Of particular concern is that non-food credit, bank deposits and sale of passenger and commercial vehicles have slowed down as compared to previous month,"" the report said. Also, with a slowdown in government spending in Q2, the fiscal impulses to growth would now be clearly missing, the report added.
This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text. Only the headline has been changed."

New Delhi: Public sector banks are set to receive  ₹ 42,000 crore in capital infusion over the next four months as part of the  ₹ 2.11 trillion PSU bank capitalisation plan announced by the Union government last year, said a senior finance ministry official. Big lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) may however be excluded from this exercise, said the official, requesting anonymity. The next tranche of infusion will happen next month, said the official.
The development comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has partially relaxed rules relating to implementation of Basel III norms. Local banks will receive an additional one year to meet the capital conservation buffer requirements, according to a decision taken at the central bank’s board meeting last week. Banks will have to meet the capital conservation buffer norms under Basel III by 31 March 2020.
The rule is designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers at times when credit is growing, which can be drawn down when losses are incurred during a stressed period. The capital conservation buffer in the form of common equity is being uniformly phased over a period of four years, or 0.625% a year, starting 1 January 2016.
The extension of the deadline will free up capital of these banks and enable them to lend more than  ₹ 3.5 trillion.
“We will infuse the next tranche of recapitalisation by mid-December. Close to  ₹ 42,000 crore remain to be infused as capital in public sector banks in the current financial year,"" the official added.
Of the  ₹ 2.11 trillion bank recapitalisation plan,  ₹ 1.35 trillion was from the sale of so-called recapitalisation bonds. The remaining  ₹ 76,000 crore was through budgetary allocation and fundraising from the markets.
PSU banks have been struggling with high levels of bad debts, as well as huge losses, forcing the government to capitalize them to ensure they meet the prescribed capital norms.
However, fiscal constraints are preventing capital infusion over and above what was budgeted.
The government is relying on massive recoveries from a few cases that are in the last stages of resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code. It hopes to improve the balance sheets of banks and enable them to turn profitable, thereby reducing their dependency on the government.
The capital infusion will also help at least five banks come out of the prompt corrective action framework of RBI, said the official. Eleven of the 21 PSU banks are under the RBI’s PCA framework. The RBI board has asked the board of financial supervision to reconsider the PCA framework that places lending restriction on banks.

Mumbai: HSBC on Tuesday raised its rating on Indian equities to “neutral"" from “underweight"", citing recent underperformance and more reasonable valuations. 
Mumbai: HSBC on Tuesday raised its rating on Indian equities to “neutral"" from “underweight"", citing recent underperformance and more reasonable valuations.
“Since end-August, India underperformed because of issues in local banks, currency weakness and oil price volatility,"" HSBC analysts said in a note.
“Despite recent underperformance, these risks remain for Indian equity market. But investors’ holdings now lowest relative to history, valuations more reasonable, 2019e (expected) earnings growth highest in region,"" they said, adding, “We raise Indian equities from underweight to neutral in a regional context."" 
BSE’s 30-share Sensex rose 0.45% to close at 35,513.14 points on Tuesday, while the National Stock Exchange’s 50-share Nifty rose 0.54% to 10,685.60 points.
HSBC analysts said MSCI India EPS (earnings per share) growth consensus expectations are for 18.8% in 2018 and 24% in 2019, which means India is one of the fastest growing markets across the region.
However, five stocks—State Bank of India, Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd—account for nearly half of all 2019 earnings growth, they said, expressing concerns that they estimate 65% market-cap weighted average earnings growth for these five stocks.
Against this background of high growth and the much-anticipated rate hikes, India’s valuation now appears fair and almost in line with the five-year average 12-month forward PE (price to earnings), they said, adding that it was still far from cheap as India trades at 17.4 times whereas MSCI AxJ trades at 11 times.
“Meanwhile, investors’ weights in India are now at historically low levels and there is an opportunity to add to this. In the past, elections have tended to be a key catalyst for performance,"" HSBC analysts said. “A key risk is the dependency on a few large-cap stocks for growth. These are mostly banks. Thus, rising NPLs (non-performing loans) can quickly and significantly change India’s earnings outlook,"" they warned.
The currency could weaken from here, prompting more interest rate hikes, while lower oil prices are supportive now, HSBC said, though it expects oil to rise in 2019-20."

815,2018-12-01,State Bank,"In the letter, dated November 19, 2018, SBI informed NPCI of its intention to discontinue Aadhaar enabled payment system

New Delhi: The UIDAI on Friday asked banks not to discontinue the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) as it may create obstruction in the delivery of welfare benefits. The clarification came after the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) took note of a letter from the State Bank of India (SBI) to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). 
New Delhi: The UIDAI on Friday asked banks not to discontinue the Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS) as it may create obstruction in the delivery of welfare benefits. The clarification came after the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) took note of a letter from the State Bank of India (SBI) to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
In the letter, dated November 19, 2018, SBI informed NPCI of its intention to discontinue Aadhaar enabled payment system purportedly based on the understanding that its continuation may be in violation of the recent Supreme Court judgement.
UIDAI said the matter has been carefully examined, and the apex court has upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar programme, specifically Section 7 of the Aadhaar Act.
“Therefore any action to discontinue such payment/receipt mechanism (AEPS, BHIM, Aadhaar Pay) or bank accounts by banks, on the ground that it is not possible to distinguish their use for delivery of welfare benefits or other purposes may be held contrary to Section 7 of Aadhaar Act and Puttaswamy-II judgment as it will result in creating obstruction in delivery of benefits and may cause denial in deserving cases,"" UIDAI said in a circular marked to banks, CEO of NPCI and Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
The nodal body for Aadhaar further clarified that where a payment/ receipt mechanism using Aadhaar authentication such as AePS, BHIM, Aadhaar Pay has been established or a bank account has been opened or verified using Aadhaar eKYC for the purpose of correctly identifying a current or potential beneficiary of welfare scheme, there is nothing in the apex court’s recent judgement that bars use of such a mechanism.
“Instead it is obligatory on banks to continue to provide such facility to people,"" it said. The Supreme Court had in a landmark verdict in September restricted the use of Aadhaar authentication by private entities in the absence of a legal provision, but allowed its mandatory use for welfare schemes, filing of Income Tax (IT) returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN).

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.

Mumbai: Economists at the country’s largest lender SBI Tuesday termed concerns on credit supply to small businesses as a “myth"" and said the sector has had a “stupendous"" loan growth since GST. 
Mumbai: Economists at the country’s largest lender SBI Tuesday termed concerns on credit supply to small businesses as a “myth"" and said the sector has had a “stupendous"" loan growth since GST.
The commentary comes amid concerns on the state of small businesses sector post-GST, which also led the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) board to decide on a special dispensation on asset quality.
“The myth is...regarding the credit growth to Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs),"" its economists said in a note.
Calling the credit growth to the sector as “quite stupendous"", the note said post the July 2017 implementation of GST, incremental credit to MSEs under priority sector lending has increased by five times to  ₹ 1.23 lakh crores compared to  ₹ 25,700 crores during the corresponding period pre-GST.
The deceleration in credit in the pre-GST period was partly due to overall slowdown in economic activity, rising NPAs and reclassification of food and agro-processing units from MSME category to agriculture sector, it said.
The surge in loans post-GST shows a significant amount of MSMEs have been able to tap banks for credit, it justified.
At its November meet, the RBI central board decided to ask banks for some forbearance for classifying advances to MSME. In the lead up to the meet, there were reports saying along with asset classification, there are concerns on credit flow to the sector, especially in light of 11 banks being under the PCA framework.
Liquidity troubles faced by non-bank lenders, one of the largest credit suppliers to the sector, was also a worrying factor.
The SBI report pegged the share of credit from NBFCs at 10% of the overall MSME pie.
Commenting on the overall 15% credit growth achieved by the industry in October, it said there has been a lot of “hullabaloo"" about the year-on-year growth being at a five year high, but pointed out that it has actually declined when compared with the preceding month.
“The good thing is that decline in incremental credit growth is seasonal and may not still be a matter of concern,"" it said, adding that there was a decline in credit growth for the same period in FY18 and FY17.
It added that the credit growth has to be seen in context of a weak Q2FY19 GDP growth, slowdown in auto sales and retail loans for the month.

808,2018-12-05,State Bank,"Etihad Airways is also considering investing fresh funds in Naresh Goyal-led Jet Airways if it can agree on the structure

New Delhi: Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, the second largest shareholder of Jet Airways Ltd, is holding talks with the debt-laden Indian carrier and its bankers on a rescue plan, two sources aware of the matter told Reuters. 
New Delhi: Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, the second largest shareholder of Jet Airways Ltd, is holding talks with the debt-laden Indian carrier and its bankers on a rescue plan, two sources aware of the matter told Reuters.
Shares in Jet Airways rose as much as 3% on the BSE on Wednesday.
Executives from Etihad, which owns a 24% stake in Jet, and the Indian carrier have met some of the airline’s bankers from State Bank of India (SBI) in Mumbai in recent days to discuss ways to address its cash flow issues and evaluate the carrier’s future business plan, the sources said.
Etihad is also considering investing fresh funds in the airline if it can agree on the structure, one of the sources said, adding that no deal has been finalised.
The business plan presented to banks includes details on Jet’s network and fleet expansion target for the next three to five years as well as revenue and cost projections, the second source said.
There is an indication that by mid-January the airline could see some money coming in, said the source, adding Jet does not have the liquidity to honour all its payments and expenses but is paying its statutory dues like taxes.
The sources did not want to be named as the discussions are private.
Jet, Etihad and SBI did not immediately respond to Reuters’ emails seeking comment.
Jet, India’s biggest full service carrier by market share, is in desperate need of cash. The 25-year-old airline, founded by Naresh Goyal, has outstanding dues of about $400 million which it mainly owes to lessors and vendors, one of the sources, who is close to the matter, said.
It has delayed salary payments to pilots and top executives and is cutting flights on non-profitable routes to save money.

With fewer flights on some routes, the airline is looking at reducing some airport and support staff, the source said, adding that it has also deferred the delivery of at least two aircraft to January from November-December.
Some domestic airport operators and fuel suppliers have put Jet on cash-and-carry, meaning it must pay cash in advance for the services it uses, the source said.
India is one of the world’s fastest-growing domestic aviation markets but high fuel prices, a weak rupee and intense price wars in the country, which is dominated by no-frills airlines like Interglobe Aviation Ltd’s IndiGo, has exacerbated Jet’s woes in recent months.
Etihad has already come to Jet’s rescue once when it picked up a 24% stake in the carrier in 2013, but the situation is different this time.
While the Abu Dhabi-based carrier is invested in Jet, it has lost money in other airline ventures such as Alitalia and Air Berlin and may be wary of loosening the purse strings again, said another source.
Foreign carriers are permitted to own up to 49% in an Indian airline.
Also, with tighter lending norms and a liquidity crisis in India, bankers may be hesitant to lend more to the struggling airline. Jet had debt of about  ₹ 8,052 crore as of September 30.
Etihad’s and Jet’s meeting with SBI, India’s biggest state-run bank, has been focused on resolving operational cash flow issues, said one source, adding that they want visibility on how much more debt they can get while the bank wants to know how much equity they can put in upfront.

“It (higher recovery of loans) is a possibility. The message is very loud and clear. What we have to understand is that it (extradition) is a message that you just can’t default and run away from the country,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters here.
He said Mallya’s extradition will have a deep impact on the overall lender and borrower relationship.
“Lending is an important business for both lenders and borrowers as we need investment in the country. But the message is that you have to do clean banking and you have to be very careful about what is the purpose of the money lent,"" said Kumar.
The 62-year-old former boss of now defunct Kingfisher Airlines fled to the UK in March 2016. Mallya has been fighting a legal battle against his extradition to India, claiming that he has been falsely dubbed as a defaulter by politicians and media.
In a recent tweet, Mallya had offered to pay back the full amount of the principal loan he owed to multiple banks.
“The most important point is the public money and I am offering to pay 100 per cent back. I humbly request the banks and government to take it. If payback refused, WHY (sic),"" Mallya had said in his tweet.
However, Kumar said the bank has not received any formal offer from Mallya for settlement of loans.
“SBI is the lead consortium (to loans given to Kingfisher Airlines), and, as of date, we don’t have any offer on our table,"" he said.
Kumar further said with Mallya’s extradition, the process to extradite Nirav Modi and Mehul Chowksi, wanted in the biggest-ever banking fraud of over  ₹ 13,000 crore at state-run Punjab National Bank, will also pick up pace.
When asked for his response on the surprise resignation of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urjit Patel, Kumar said, “That is one question which I am not answering."" Patel unexpectedly resigned Monday citing ‘personal reasons’, amid rift between the central bank and government.
To a query on whether he sees any relaxation in RBI’s February 12 circular on one-day default norms post resignation of Patel, he said, “I don’t know whether there will be relaxation or no relaxation. It is very difficult to predict."" On the issue of resolution of stressed power companies, Kumar said he expects resolution in six to seven firms.
On the issue of promoter’s holding in a bank, he said a wider ownership is always preferred.
“It is a good thing for Indian financial system to have a diversified ownership rather than a concentrated ownership,"" said Kumar.

Acting swiftly, the government on Tuesday appointed Shaktikanta Das, a former finance secretary, as new RBI chief, calming a jittery market.
Here are 10 updates from the stock market
1) In his first public comment after assuming the charge of RBI, Shaktikanta Das struck a dovish tone on prospects for inflation and also hinted that the RBI might adopt a more growth-friendly monetary framework under his watch. He also said that banking sector would be his key focus and more measures were needed to revive lenders. 
2) Financial stocks have led this round of rally on Dalal Street. Today, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Yes Bank, and SBI were among the top Sensex gainers. 
3) Adding to stock market rally, bonds also rose today after inflation eased sharply in November, bolstering expectations of a RBI rate cut sooner than expected. The 10-year benchmark bond yield fell to 7.38% in early trade from 7.41% in the previous session. Markets also hope for liquidity easing measures from the new RBI chief, who said that there was a need to interact with stakeholders on liquidity issues.
4) The rupee also strengthened as US-China trade tensions eased. The rupee also strengthened to 71.70 a dollar, compared with previous close of 72.01.
5) Data released yesterday after market hours showed consumer inflation falling to a 17-month low of 2.33%, driven by falling food prices, and below the RBI’s medium term target of 4%.
6) Falling oil prices in recent months have eased inflationary pressure on India, a major fuel importer. Since early October, Brent crude prices have dropped by nearly 30% to about $60 per barrel. This has also helped the rupee rebound from October lows of 74.48 a dollar.
7) Separately, data released yesterday also showed India’s industrial output expanded at an annual 8.1% pace in November, the highest in 11 months, compared with a forecast of 5.7%.
8) Some economists expect the RBI will change their monetary policy stance to ‘neutral’ in February from ‘calibrated tightening’ currently, making a rate rise less likely. The RBI may even ease monetary policy to support growth, they say. 
9) Global markets have also rallied on signs of easing China-US trade tensions and expectations that China will step up efforts soon to support its cooling economy. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said trade talks were under way with China. A Reuters report said that China made the first major purchase of US soybeans since Washington and Beijing agreed to a temporary trade truce this month.
10) Trump also said he would intervene in a case against a top executive at Huawei Technologies if it would help secure a trade deal.

The audit has been awarded to EY LLP, which will probe the troubled airlines’ books between 1 April 2014 and 31 March 2018, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Forensic audits are also conducted when there is a proposal to restructure loans of the company and when extra funding is required, particularly in companies where there are cash-flow challenges, said a banker who is part of the consortium of lenders to Jet Airways.
“In this case, we are looking at a debt restructuring proposal for Jet Airways and, therefore, a thorough audit is necessary,"" the banker said, requesting not to be named. Lenders also conduct such forensic audits when they get credible complaints against a company, said a second banker.
“While the bank receives several complaints from investors regarding specific accounts, we take up only some after thoroughly looking into the nature of the complaint. The rest are quite frivolous,"" the second banker said on condition of anonymity.
SBI received a complaint in November where the allegations were “financial in nature"" and asked the complainant to wait for the completion of the forensic audit, which had already been ordered, said the first banker.
An email sent to Jet Airways seeking comment remained unanswered till publishing of this story.
Jet Airways, which had 13.3% share of the domestic aviation market in October, needs to urgently raise cash to stay afloat, hurt by fuel prices and a weak rupee.

Jet had a net debt of  ₹ 8,052 crore as of 30 September.

This is expected to be the first resolution under the inter-creditor agreement (ICA), which is part of the government’s Project Sashakt aimed at resolving bad loans. The step by SBI follows Canara Bank moving the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in September against the demerger and debt restructuring of Ratnagiri Gas.
IDBI Bank Ltd is the lead lender of the consortium, but its lending activities are restricted under the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, said one of the people cited above. “SBI, which has the second-highest exposure to Ratnagiri Gas, is discussing buying out Canara Bank’s stake under ICA to complete the resolution,"" he said, adding the plan has yet to be finalized.
The second person said PwC has tasked with valuing Ratnagiri Gas and is expected to submit its report soon. “The liquidation value of the company will be used as a reference point for the purchase,"" he said. This person said SBI’s plan will be sent to the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) for approval of the overseeing committee.
An IBA official said they have not received any proposal from SBI.
Under the ICA, the lead lender has the right to arrange for buyout of the loans of the dissenting lenders at a value equal to 85% of the lower of liquidation value.
SBI and Canara Bank did not respond to emails.
A PwC spokesperson said: “We do not comment on company-specific topics.""
Canara Bank moved NCLT months after a debt recast plan and demerger was approved for Ratnagiri Gas. However, the petition was rejected as non-maintainable.
The resolution plan involves demerger and a deep restructuring of debt. Ratnagiri Gas’s liquefied natural gas regasification plant has been demerged into its subsidiary, Konkan LNG Pvt. Ltd (KLPL), while loans of the power plant were restructured by lenders.
The demerger of the LNG business of Ratnagiri Gas into KLPL was approved by the NCLAT (National Company Law Appellate Tribunal) in March 2018. Mint reported on 28 September that Canara Bank has been advised by its auditor to seek resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code and to classify these companies as non-performing.
The debt restructuring proposal included bifurcation of existing loans of  ₹ 9,000 crore into Ratnagiri Gas and its subsidiary KLPL. Around  ₹ 5,200 crore of loans to the power plant was then divided into sustainable ( ₹ 2,000 crore) and unsustainable debt ( ₹ 3,200 crore) with the latter being converted into cumulative redeemable preference shares (CRPS).
The sustainable loan was given a very long repayment schedule and interest rates were reduced from 13% to 9%. Meanwhile, KLPL was given additional loans of  ₹ 1,200 crore to build a breakwater facility."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) Managing Director P K Gupta said that the charges for various services offered by the bank are among the lowest in the industry.
Various services offered by the bank, including ATM transaction and cash deposits, come at a cost, but the charges have been kept low in the larger interest of customers, Gupta told PTI.
Asked about rationale for levying charges for non-maintenance of monthly average balance (MAB), he said the bank has invested heavily in technological upgradation of systems for providing safe and secure banking facilities at any place in the country. Further, ATMs and cash points have been created across the country, thereby making huge investment for benefit and convenience of customers.
“With substantial investment in infrastructure and technology, it becomes imperative for the bank to recover at least a part of the cost. Considering the improvement in the quality of facilities and services extended to customers, the requirement of MAB in savings bank accounts was re-introduced from April 2017,"" he added.
The managing director looking after retail and digital banking also pointed out that these charges were reduced twice - in October last year and subsequently in April this year.
“Our charges are on the lower side when compared with the other private sector banks,"" Gupta said.
Besides, he said 60 per cent of the total savings account holders, including no-frill accounts, student and minor are exempt from requirement of MAB.
Customers are given various free services like 5 free ATM transaction and 2 cash withdrawal at branches, he noted.
To promote digital transaction, the bank has now made available to the customers several digital options to make payments seamlessly instead of using the ATMs. “Our request to our customers is to use the digital channels as much as possible, since the ATM operations are becoming costlier day by day,"" he said.
To promote digital transactions, he said, the bank in fact offers reward points to the customers.

Mumbai: Loss-making carrier Jet Airways is in discussions with the State Bank of India for raising  ₹ 1,500 crore short-term loan to meet its working capital requirement and some payment obligations, a source said. 
Mumbai: Loss-making carrier Jet Airways is in discussions with the State Bank of India for raising  ₹ 1,500 crore short-term loan to meet its working capital requirement and some payment obligations, a source said.
Jet Airways strategic partner and Middle-east carrier Etihad, which holds 24 % stake in the Indian full service carrier, is likely to provide guarantee for the loan, he said.
Significantly, the talks for availing loan are going on at a time when EY is carrying out a forensic audit of the Jet Airways on the orders of the airline’s largest lender for alleged irregularities.
“Jet Airways is in discussions with its largest lender to SBI for raising short-term loans worth  ₹ 1,500 crore. The airline is looking to mop up these funds to meet its working capital requirement as well as for meeting some payment obligations. Jet Airways is expected to provide Etihad Airways’ guarantee for this financing,"" an airline source told PTI.
The Naresh Goyal-controlled airline, which has posted three consecutive quarterly losses of over  ₹ 1,000 crore each since March, already has as much as  ₹ 8,052 of debt on its books as on September 30. Rating agency Icra has already cut the rating on Jet Airways borrowing programmes.
When contacted, SBI spokesperson said, “It is the policy of the bank not to comment upon individual accounts and its treatment"".
While Jet Airways did not respond to PTI queries on this issue, an Etihad Airways in an e-mail response to PTI from Abu Dhabi said, it “does not comment on rumour or speculation"".
“Jet Airways has been seeking these funds as its earlier proposal of raising $350 million Etihad-guaranteed loan from overseas lenders is still at the negotiations table and expected to take time,"" the source said who is privy to both the discussions.
With its financials in perils and the airline facing cash drought, promoter Goyal is looking to infuse capital in a manner where he does not have to lose control of the Jet Airways, which he set up 25 years ago.
At an emergency board meeting late this month, he asked his team to look for alternate routes of funding while resurrecting the airline.
His airline has already held preliminary level discussions with Tata Group for a possible stake sale a couple of months ago. However, reportedly “unhappy"" over the deal, he turned back to his Gulf friend once again to rescue the airline.
In 2013, Etihad had bailed out Jet Airways by acquiring 24 % stake in the airline for  ₹ 2,060 crore, besides extending low-interest loan of $150 million as well as purchasing 50.1 % stake in its loyalty programme JetPrivilege.
While down-grading Jet Airways long-term borrowing ratings from ‘B’ to ‘C’ on 10 December, Icra said its action considered delays in the implementation of the proposed liquidity initiatives by the management, further aggravating its liquidity, as reflected in the delays in employee salary payments and lease rental payments to the aircraft lessors.
The carrier has a back log of over two months in salary payments to its senior staff, including pilots and engineers."

What is an EMV chip card?
Chip-based cards, also called chip and PIN cards, use higher standards of data encryption and storage technology compared to magnetic stripe cards. Unlike magnetic stripe cards that require just a swipe on a point of sale (PoS) device to complete a transaction, chip and PIN cards require a PIN as well to complete the transaction. This provides an extra level of security. The shift to chip-based cards is driven globally due to increased risks of card cloning
Is your debit card a magstripe card?
If your debit card has no chip located on the face (centre-left position) of the debit card, then it is a magstripe card, according to SBI. EMV chip debit cards, on the other hand, have a chip located on the face (centre-left position) of the card.
SBI customers can either visit their home branch or apply online through internet banking to get EMV chip-based cards. Here’s how:
1. If you have an online banking facility with SBI, log in to its website (www.onlinesbi.com) using user id and password.
2. Thereafter, under ‘eServices’ tab, click on ‘ATM Card Services’.

After State Bank of India (SBI) and HDFC Bank, with businesses of  ₹ 45.85 trillion and  ₹ 15.8 trillion respectively, ICICI Bank ( ₹ 11.02 trillion) is the third largest commercial bank now,.
Based on share swap ratio, the total business of the merged entity will be  ₹ 15.4 trillion, only a notch below HDFC Bank but above ICICI Bank. “The merger of Bank of Baroda, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank will create the third largest lender in the country, with advances and deposits market share of 6.9% and 7.4%, respectively,"" according to a research report by Motilal Oswal.
5 things to know about Dena Bank, Vijaya Bank’s merger with Bank of Baroda:

3. According to market analysts, the merged Bank of Baroda will have the second largest number of branches in India at 9,511. While BoB already has a widespread network, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank are more regional-focused banks. This will help BoB to strengthen its presence in the western, southern and north-eastern regions. Following the merger, the number of state-run banks will come down to 19 from 21.
4. The finance ministry says the amalgamation will help create a “strong globally competitive bank"" in the form of Bank of Baroda by utilising economies of scale and wide-ranging synergies of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. BoB will take over all businesses, assets, rights, titles, claims, licenses, approvals and other privileges and all property, borrowings, liabilities and obligations of the other two banks.
5. “The bailout of Dena Bank comes at a cost, and the swap ratio reflects adjustments for net NPA; and, hence, we conclude banks with stronger balance sheet are likely to fetch better value for their businesses (in this case Vijaya Bank) while weaker franchises, which are struggling with stressed loans and provisioning burden, are likely to be bailed out at a discount,"" Elara Capital said.
According to market analysts, while typical merger issues like cultural and social, network overlaps, relocations, and business team integration are likely to be an overhang on the near-term performance of Bank of Baroda, the back-end technology integration will be relatively smooth as all three banks operate on the Finacle CBS Platform."

New Delhi: Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd has won the mandate to manage India’s first exchange traded fund of public sector firms’ debt securities, two people aware of the matter said. 
The other asset management companies (AMCs) in the fray were SBI Funds Management Pvt Ltd, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd, and UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd. Edelweiss won despite being the smallest AMC in terms of asset under management (AUM), with an average AUM of  ₹ 14,161 crore in the July-September quarter.
Edelweiss Asset Management declined to comment.
Earlier on Thursday, the five AMCs, including Edelweiss, had made presentations to the department of investment planning and asset management (Dipam) for the planned debt ETF. 
“Edelweiss was ranked number three on their technical expertise after Aditya Birla and Reliance Nippon. However, Edelweiss won the mandate on account of offering a 5 bps expense ratio,"" said one of the persons mentioned above.
“During the presentations, the fund houses focused on bringing out a good product for the retail investor which will serve as an alternative to fixed deposits. The ministry focused on the lowest and technically sound bidder,"" said the second person quoted above. Both of them spoke on condition of anonymity.
The chief executive officer (CEO) of one of the bidders said they would not have liked to compromise on economics. “We had bid for the debt ETF but would not have liked to compromise on profits and growth,"" said the CEO on condition of anonymity. 
The AMC would need to spend  ₹ 20 crore on every  ₹ 10,000 crore of AUM collected by the debt ETF for awareness and road shows, according to the government directive. An additional two basis points would also need to be spent on investor education as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Only AMCs with debt AUM of  ₹ 15,000 crore in the July-September quarter were eligible to apply. Edelweiss would also need to balance the economics as it incurred a loss of  ₹ 19 crore in FY18. 
Following up on a Union Budget 2018 announcement, Dipam on 16 November had invited AMCs to set up a debt ETF. Bids were to be submitted by 17 December. 
Edelweiss will need to work with the government and an external adviser for creating, launching and managing the debt fund, including additional tranches and fund offers. 
“Bonds, promissory notes, credit notes and debentures issued by leveraged good quality companies would make up the debt ETF. The ETF would be benchmarked or mirror a new index,"" said a fund manager, who did not wish to be named. 
The debt ETF would be made of AAA-rated bonds with defined maturity. The units of the fund then will be subscribed by investors, he added. 
A second fund manager explained that the AMCs have suggested four-five structures. 
“Both open-ended and close-ended have been proposed. Close-ended seems a more manageable structure. To create liquidity so that the ETF is easily tradable, market makers will be employed. The government is yet to finalize a structure,"" he said."

The bankers are being called to the meeting to reassure the creditors, some of whom are expected to come to India from overseas, that Jet Airways is working toward securing funding and has a repayment plan which it will share with them, said the first person.
Jet Airways, India’s biggest full-service carrier by market share, owes money to pilots, lessors, banks and vendors. Its problems have been exacerbated by higher oil prices and intense pricing competition in the domestic market.
The airline, part owned by Etihad Airways, was in talks with the Abu Dhabi-based carrier to infuse more equity, but any money would be conditional on Jet’s founder Naresh Goyal ceding control, the people have told Reuters.
Lessors have already forced the airline to ground at least four of its new fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX aircraft over non-payment of dues, the first person said, adding more planes could be grounded if lessors are unconvinced by the plan Jet Airways presents next week.
Jet Airways and SBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jet Airways has a total of 124 aircraft, the vast majority of which are leased.
Payment defaults
The airline on Tuesday said it had defaulted on debt payment to a consortium of Indian banks, led by SBI, prompting ratings agency ICRA Ltd to downgrade the carrier and send its shares sharply lower.
SBI, which has an exposure to Jet Airways of about  ₹ 1,600 crore, has in principle agreed to lend another  ₹ 1,500 crore, the second person said, adding this is subject to the bank satisfactorily completing a forensic audit of the airline’s books—a process that started in December.
SBI is discussing securitizing part of the sales of Jet Airways’s tickets against subsequent loans, this person said, adding it will not be able to securitize the entire amount.
“The debt will give the airline some money for its operational needs but it will not solve the long term problem,"" said the first person.
India’s aviation watchdog, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), has asked to meet Jet Airways’s chief executive on 7 January to get an update on its financial state and fundraising plans to ensure non-payment of pilot salaries and other dues is not having an impact on safety, the first person said.
The DGCA did not respond to a request for comment.
The carrier is also late on salary payments to its employees for the month of December, the first source said.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to soften its economic growth narrative and lower its projections for the current fiscal year.
That’s the view of Mumbai-based SBICap Securities Ltd after data released 11 January showed India’s industrial production in November grew 0.5% from a year ago, much lower than the expected 3.6%. RBI needs to cut its GDP growth projection for the year ending March closer to 7% from 7.4%, according to SBICap, to reflect the likely case of below 7% expansion in the second half.
“We hope the monetary policy committee members turn realistic and acknowledge the softness in domestic growth with some feedback into their decision,"" SBICap economists Arjun Nagarajan and Amol Bhoir wrote in a note. “The industrial production numbers must push the members to re-examine their growth narrative.""
Weaker growth and the possibility of inflation undershooting the 2% lower boundary of RBI’s inflation target range are adding to calls for interest rate cuts this year. Inflation probably eased to 2.2% in December from 2.3% in the previous month, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists ahead of data due later on Monday.
“Slowing growth and muted inflation will pave the way for a change in stance by the RBI at its February meeting, followed by rate cuts of up to 50 basis points in the first half of the next financial year,"" said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Equities Ltd. in Mumbai.
One basis point equals one-hundredth of a percentage point.

Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday put on sale its  ₹ 15,431 crore exposure to Essar Steel Ltd, as last-minute litigations continue to delay the recovery of its loans to the steelmaker. The bank has set the aggregate reserve price for the full-cash sale at  ₹ 9,588 crore.
In a notice on its website, SBI said its exposure to Essar Steel includes categories such as working capital, term loan, corporate loan, export performance bank guarantee and standby letter of credit. The bank said the loans may be assigned in whole or in part to buyers and all the security in relation to that will be transferred and shared pari passu to the extent of the amount sold. Asset reconstruction companies, other banks and non-banking financial companies can apply to buy these loans.
This is SBI’s second attempt to sell its Essar Steel loan exposure after dropping the process in September last year. Other lenders such as HDFC Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, and Federal Bank have already sold their Essar Steel exposure, either partly or in full, over the last few years.
Essar Steel owes more than  ₹ 49,000 crore to more than two dozen banks led by SBI. It runs a 10-million-tonne steel mill at Hazira in Gujarat, which is involved in ore beneficiation, pellet-making, iron-making, steel-making, and downstream facilities.
On 25 October 2018, Essar Steel’s committee of creditors (CoC) voted in favour of handing over the debt-laden company to ArcelorMittal after it cleared pending dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron. ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan envisages an upfront payment of  ₹ 42,000 crore to lenders and an additional  ₹ 8,000 crore towards capital expenditure.
On Wednesday, SBI said the resolution plan has been approved and filed before the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The minimum recovery for SBI under the plan is  ₹ 11,313.42 crore and the reserve price of  ₹ 9,588 crore has been fixed on the basis of net present value of minimum recovery discounted at 18%.
Earlier this month, the NCLT Ahmedabad said it will pronounce before 31 January its order on a petition filed by Essar Steel shareholders for submission of its proposal to settle dues amounting to  ₹ 54,389 crore. This came after observations made by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT), which had asked NCLT Ahmedabad to expedite the insolvency case filed against Essar Steel (India) Ltd.
Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd (ESAHL), which holds 72% of shares in Essar Steel, has submitted to NCLT Ahmedabad a proposal for settling the entire debt for about  ₹ 54,389 crore.
In October 2018, the Supreme Court allowed ArcelorMittal and Numetal Mauritius to bid for Essar Steel, provided they paid the dues of defaulters connected to them within two weeks.
At the Ahmedabad NCLT, the CoC and the resolution professional have opposed ESAHL’s debt recast plan, claiming it was against the apex court’s order and also against the insolvency law and that such proposals by Essar Steel shareholders have been rejected by them in the past.
ArcelorMittal and the lenders have been seeking permission of the tribunal to complete the debt resolution process, while Essar Steel Asia Holdings, Standard Chartered Plc, and several operational creditors have objected to ArcelorMittal’s proposal."

New Delhi: Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal is ready to invest up to  ₹ 700 crore in Jet Airways on the condition that his stake does not fall below 25%. Goyal’s offer comes against the backdrop of strategic partner Etihad reportedly putting forward strict conditions, including that Goyal should give up control, for infusing funds into the crisis-hit carrier. 
New Delhi: Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal is ready to invest up to  ₹ 700 crore in Jet Airways on the condition that his stake does not fall below 25%. Goyal’s offer comes against the backdrop of strategic partner Etihad reportedly putting forward strict conditions, including that Goyal should give up control, for infusing funds into the crisis-hit carrier.
In a letter to SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar, Goyal said he is writing with reference to the resolution plan under discussion and in view of Etihad’s position, “despite the significant cash crunch and imminent grounding, which the airline is facing"".
Naresh Goyal said he was committed to an “infusion of funds into the company to the extent of  ₹ 700 crore"" and pledging all his shares. This is subject to the condition that his shareholding post such infusion remained at least 25%, he said in the letter, which was seen by PTI.
“Should this not be possible, then I would not be able to infuse any funds or pledge my shares, unless Sebi accords me an exemption permitting me to increase my reduced stake (if it is to be below 25%) without triggering the Takeover Code,"" according to the letter.
When shareholding of an entity in a listed company goes beyond a certain threshold, the open offer requirement is triggered under Sebi’s Takeover Code.

769,2019-01-20,State Bank,"Kumar said interested investors should follow the bidding time frameHe also raised the issue of bidders not paying for the asset despite approval of their plans

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar said Section 29A of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which disallows defaulting promoters and related persons from bidding for assets, is being “stretched too far"". Speaking at an event in Mumbai, he said most of the litigation at present are due to Section 29A. “But this section, in my view is being stretched too far and there is a need that more clarity is brought about,"" he said.
According to him, while the intent of IBC Section 29A is very clear that the defaulting promoters should not be in the driver’s seat once again, it has become the most contentious issue.
Citing an example, Kumar said that if two brothers have parted 20 years ago and if one brother’s family is in trouble, then barring the other from bidding for an asset is alright. “However, to say that the other brother running a business successfully cannot bid for any asset is, I believe, carrying the interpretation too far. These are two independent businesses, so, if one is in default, you can stop the related party, but not being allowed to bid for any asset whatsoever is not logical,"" he added.
Kumar said he expects more clarity to emerge on this issue at an appropriate time.
“Everywhere, it is this Section 29A (that is) causing the maximum problem,"" Kumar said.
He also spoke against the practice of allowing late bidders for assets under IBC. “When we have completed the bid process, someone would say he has a cheque for a higher value. They were sleeping all throughout the process which has gone on for nine months and then suddenly they say that since   ₹ 15,000 crore is the highest bid, please take   ₹ 16,000 crore,"" he said.
Kumar said the practice of submitting late bids “is not the way in which IBC can be run"" and asked interested investors to follow the bidding time frame. “If we allow this to continue, then a short-term view could be that it is maximizing recovery for lenders but otherwise I think it is counterproductive. Anyone who is a serious bidder should participate in the process,"" he said, adding that once the bidding process is closed and the CoC has approved the plan, nobody should be allowed to make any bid after that as it defeats the entire process.

“Another negative impact would be that nobody will take the bidding seriously because they are unsure that even if they bid and get the unit, there could be somebody waiting outside the process to jump in with   ₹ 500 crore more, and then you go into the cycle of litigation,"" Kumar added.
He also raised the issue of bidders not paying for the asset despite approval of their plans. Kumar said there is need for very stiff penalties against such bidders.
“They have delayed the whole process and after that, they have been unable to find the money which they have committed and it has been a huge setback for the whole process. Some exemplary punitive actions are required for people who have delayed the process, in my view, deliberately,"" he said."

Mumbai: The saga of Jet Airways (India) Ltd continues, with its founder and promoter Naresh Goyal making a financial offer to State Bank of India (SBI) to retain control of the ailing airline, even as its single-largest public shareholder, Etihad Airways PJSC, has sought to oust him in exchange for infusing much-needed funds. 
Mumbai: The saga of Jet Airways (India) Ltd continues, with its founder and promoter Naresh Goyal making a financial offer to State Bank of India (SBI) to retain control of the ailing airline, even as its single-largest public shareholder, Etihad Airways PJSC, has sought to oust him in exchange for infusing much-needed funds.
Goyal has told SBI, Jet Airways’ largest lender, that he is ready to invest up to  ₹700 crore and pledge all his shares, provided he retains at least a 25% stake in the airline.
“Should this not be possible, I will not be able to infuse any funds or pledge my shares, unless SEBI accords me an exemption permitting me to increase my reduced stake (if it is to be below 25%) without triggering the takeover code,"" Goyal said in a 16 January letter to SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar.
A copy of the letter has been reviewed by Mint.
Kumar confirmed the investment offer from Goyal.
“We are working very fast. There are deadlines and it will be finalized very quickly,"" Rajnish Kumar told reporters on the sidelines of an event in Mumbai. “Lenders are very clear (about) what needs to be done and there is no disagreement among lenders in their approach.""
Jet Airways has been struggling to run its operations for the past six months amid a cash crunch caused by rising costs and a bruising fare war. On 31 December, the airline defaulted on interest payments to a consortium of lenders led by SBI.
The financial troubles have forced the airline to halt deliveries of Boeing Co. 737 Max planes and delay salary payments to pilots. Jet Airways, which was scheduled to take delivery of 11 737 Max planes by March, has so far received five planes.
According to analysts, Jet Airways needs to raise at least $250-300 million immediately to clear its dues to lenders and vendors. The airline would need to raise another $450-500 million by the end of 2020 when some of its overseas debt mature, analysts said earlier.
Etihad Airways chief executive Tony Douglas has informed SBI that it will not exceed its offer of  ₹150 per share of Jet Airways for making any fresh investment, according to reports. The Abu Dhabi-based airline has also demanded a complete exit of Goyal and his family from any management or even advisory role at the Mumbai-based airline.
Goyal and his family currently own 51% of Jet Airways. Etihad Airways has a 24% stake.
In the letter to the SBI chairman, Goyal said that under local laws, “amounts payable by the company to promoter group entities, should be treated on par with the other overdue creditors of the company and the same, and upon conversion into equity is considered cash"".
“I respectfully submit that unless my shareholding goes below 10% and/or my group is not represented on the board, I would continue to be held out as a promoter, and be faced with the attendant exposures/ risks of being a promoter—hence, it is only fair and equitable that our shareholding be at least 25%,"" Goyal said in the letter.
A spokesperson for Jet Airways did not respond to queries.
A spokesperson for Etihad Airways said the airline “does not comment on rumour or speculation"".
An SBI spokesperson said that the lenders to Jet Airways “are considering a restructuring plan under the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) framework for resolution of stressed assets that would ensure a long-term viability of the company"".

The discussions contemplated options on the debt-equity mix, proportion of equity infusion by stakeholders and change in the airline’s board in case of a fund infusion.
Mint on Tuesday reported that Etihad might gain effective control of Jet Airways if the lenders approve a resolution plan for the cash-strapped airline. The plan could see Etihad Airways raising its stake from the current 24% and Goyal ceding control of the airline, the report said, citing two people familiar with the ongoing discussions.

“While Etihad clearly doesn’t want him around if they are to increase their stake and infuse more funds into Jet Airways, Naresh Goyal will not relinquish control at Jet Airways easily,"" the person said, requesting anonymity.

765,2019-01-21,State Bank,"The SBI Life stock has recovered most of the losses after the IL&FS crisis, and the Q3 performance should come as an affirmation of investors’ faithThe insurer’s new business grew 20% on an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis

SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s investors would be a happy lot given that the largest private sector insurer has managed to deliver both growth and profitability in the third quarter (Q3).
The insurer’s new business grew 20% on an annualized premium equivalent (APE) basis, which means the company is on track to achieve its 20% growth forecast for FY19.
Indeed, data from the insurance regulator had shown that SBI Life’s business growth had picked up in December, second only to HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
The boost during the third quarter drove up the APE growth for the nine months ended December to 13%.
What’s more comforting is that the growth is led by margin-friendly protection plans. The share of protection in new business more than doubled to 11% in the overall portfolio from 5% a year ago. Since protection plans are the most difficult to sell, the strong growth here indicates SBI Life has managed to crack the code.
The branches of its parent, State Bank of India (SBI), sold the maximum number of protection plans contributing to the growth. This shows SBI Life has managed to use its biggest strength in distribution to the best possible use.
Hence, the impressive 24% growth in value of new business and the improvement in value of new business margin to 17.5% should not come as a surprise.
The largest life insurer has not only managed to grow, but has increased its most profitable business.
SBI Life’s products are not just flying off the shelves, the insurer’s customers are sticking to it as well. Persistency ratios improved across tenures barring that of the 61st month with the 13th month increasing to 83.3% from 81.5% a year ago.
During the nine months ended December, the insurer also managed to improve its cost ratios as efficiencies increased. In short, it has finally used its parent optimally to grow its business.
“SBI Life’s retail business franchise is the geographically most well diversified among its private peers, adding greater immunity to capital market downturns. The contribution of the top three states in its total retail business stands at only 26%, versus 42% for ICICI Prudential Life and 54% for HDFC Life,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
That said, market-linked plans still form 53% of its total portfolio and unit-linked plans (Ulips) grew by 19% year-on-year. This means that despite the volatility in equity markets during the third quarter, customers have opted for Ulips.
The SBI Life stock has recovered most of the losses after the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd crisis, and the Q3 performance should come as an affirmation of investors’ faith. Even with the rise, analysts believe the stock is reasonably valued at the current levels. It trades at a multiple of twice the estimated embedded value for FY20."

763,2019-01-22,State Bank,"With about 23,000 jobs at stake, pressure is building on PM Modi for a rescue package as a collapse would mean bad optics in his re-election bid in a poll due by MayJet Airways has piled on $1.1 billion in debt and failed to pay loans and salaries

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi rode to power five years ago on his business friendly credentials and the promise of generating millions of jobs. Now an airline is on the verge of collapse, bringing Modi’s image under attack just months before national elections.
Struggling in a competitive market where basic air fares can get as low as 2 cents, Jet Airways India Ltd., the country’s second-biggest airline, has piled on $1.1 billion in debt and failed to pay loans and salaries. With about 23,000 jobs at stake, pressure is building on Modi for a rescue package as a collapse would mean bad optics in his re-election bid in a poll due by May.
While Modi is not to blame for the unraveling of Jet Airways -- the airline was brought to its knees because of high fuel prices and intense competition -- his policies to make air travel affordable to more and more Indians didn’t help it either. The fate of the teetering carrier is now part of the opposition’s narrative that businesses are ailing, with the $2.6 trillion economy losing jobs on Modi’s watch.
The issue of jobs “is going to be at the forefront of the campaign,"" said Manish Tewari, a spokesman for the main opposition Indian National Congress. ""There has been gross mismanagement of the economy,"" Tewari said. ""It is not surprising that even aviation and some of the airlines that have been doing very well in the past are now bleeding and hemorrhaging.""
The ruling party argues the failure of a corporate like Jet Airways should not be linked to the government. Still, ""if policy intervention is required, the government will be open to that,"" said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, a spokesman of the Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. ""If it is a corporate failure, the government can’t intervene in every point of time.""
Rescue Bid
As the crisis at Jet Airways unfolded last year, Modi’s government reached out to the salt-to-software Tata Group to help rescue the airline, people familiar with the matter said in November, an effort that later fizzled.
While the Modi administration has maintained it won’t interfere in private businesses, history shows it has been difficult for Indian governments to stay away. Jet Airways’s troubles are reminiscent of the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines Ltd., which in 2011 defaulted on loan payments, airports and staff, forcing then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to urge state-run banks to extend a helping hand.
About eight years after that failed attempt, government-owned banks that are struggling to rein in bad loans are at it again -- this time to resuscitate Jet Airways. The carrier has accumulated more losses than any other publicly-traded carrier in Asia apart from Pakistan International Airlines Corp.
State Bank of India, the country’s biggest lender by assets, is now at the forefront of a bailout deal being worked out as the carrier considers “various options on the debt-equity mix."" Lenders, led by SBI, have sought 35 billion rupees ($492 million) of investment from founder Naresh Goyal and Etihad Airways PJSC, which owns 24 percent of the company, before they can revamp its debt, people with knowledge of the matter said last week.
The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has intervened in businesses in the past. When troubled lender Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd., part-owned by some government firms, missed repayments on $12.6 billion of loans last year, it seized control. That was only the second time since 2009, when the government under Singh took over Satyam Computer Services Ltd. after it falsified accounts, and later sold the software maker in an auction.
The cases of Jet Airways and Kingfisher also show how difficult it is to run a sustainable airline business in India -- the world’s fastest growing market, yet also one of the costliest.
Jet Airways once challenged the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd., but failed to raise fares as a slew of budget carriers including market leader IndiGo started luring customers with on-time, no-frills flights more than a decade ago. As a result, Jet Airways has lost money in all but two of the past 11 years, and saw its market share halve to 16 percent during that period.
‘Sense of Urgency’
The Jet Airways situation makes it “imperative for the government to do something because they can’t seem to be reticent on such a key issue where so many jobs are at stake,"" said Raghbendra Jha, who has authored a book on India’s political economy as an economics professor at the Australian National University. “It is also politically imperative because elections will be announced soon. There’s a sense of urgency in this.""
The government is aware of Jet’s discussions to salvage operations, but there has been no formal request for any help, aviation secretary R.N. Choubey, the top bureaucrat in the civil aviation ministry, said last week.
The restructuring plan may also include changes to its board, according to a statement last week and still needs to be finalized and approved.
The government will ensure that control of the airline remains in Indian hands, Choubey said. Indian regulations do not permit foreign airlines to own more than 49 percent of local carriers."

NEW DELHI :
State Bank of India has decided to sell its loans in Essar Steel as it could see a spurt in provisioning for bad loans and erosion in capital base if the steel makers insolvency process gets delayed further, sources said.
The SBIs decision, however, will not stall the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process as the new entity will join the committee of creditors, they clarified.
SBI, which is the largest creditor having total exposure of  ₹15,431.44 crore in Essar Steel, has invited expression of interest (EoI) from banks, asset reconstruction companies, and financial institutions for the proposed sale of its debt.
The lender has put the reserve price for the recovery of bad loans from Essar Steel India at  ₹9,587.64 crore, according to the EoI.
Although the matter is before the National Company Law Tribunal Ahmedabad bench, the delay in the process of resolution was the main reason for SBI opting for sale of its debt outside the IBC process.
The delay in resolution will hurt the balance sheet of the SBI, sources said, adding if the case is not settled during this quarter the bank will witness erosion in capital base as it will have to fully provide for, sources said.
In September last year, SBI had withdrawn the process of sale of debt of Essar Steel to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) after NCLAT asked lenders of the debt-ridden firm to consider the second round bid of Numetal and mining baron Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta.
Essar Steel, which runs a 10-million-tonne steel mill in Gujarat, owes more than  ₹49,000 crore to over two dozen banks led by SBI and has been under bankruptcy proceedings.
As per the resolution plan submitted by ArcelorMittal,  ₹42,000 crore will be paid to the secured lenders, while an additional  ₹8,000 crore will be pumped into the company as working capital.
ArcelorMittal's offer to take over the bankrupt Essar Steel was accepted by the committee of creditors (CoC).
Essar Steel Asia Holding, the holding company of Essar Steel that was controlled by the Ruias, had also proposed to the CoC, led by SBI, to pay an upfront  ₹54,389 crore to retake the management of Essar Steel.

NEW DELHI :
The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday directed the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to pass an order on the insolvency case filed against Essar Steel (India) Ltd.
“We allow the designated authority (NCLT) to pass appropriate orders by the next date, failing which this appellate tribunal will decide,"" said a two-member NCLAT bench headed by its chairperson Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya.
If the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT does not pass any order by January 31, then the appellate tribunal will pass an order accordingly on the next date of hearing, the bench added.
The NCLAT’s directive came while it was hearing the petition filed by the committee of creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel, through State Bank of India, against resolution professional Satish Kumar Gupta and others.
The matter is listed before the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT on 31 January for hearing.
On 3 January, the NCLAT had directed the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT to expedite the insolvency case filed against Essar Steel.
The financial creditors had voted in favour of the resolution plan of ArcelorMittal on 25 October. Essar Steel shareholders then proposed to pay all its lenders, including operational lenders, in full.
Later, Standard Chartered Bank also approached the dedicated bankruptcy court challenging the resolution plan approved by the majority of the financial lenders. Standard Chartered, which has more than 7.5% weight in the voting process, voted against ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan.
Essar Steel owes more than  ₹ 49,000 crore to more than two dozen banks led by State Bank of India. It runs a 10 million tonne steel mill at Hazira in Gujarat, which is involved in ore beneficiation, pellet making, iron making, steel making, and downstream facilities.
“The overriding objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is maximization of recovery for creditors and this has been established time and again by courts at all levels. Creditors of Essar Steel, including operational creditors, should not be forced to accept a resolution plan which undervalues the company and its assets,"" said a spokesperson of Essar Steel on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, a spokesperson of ArcelorMittal, whose resolution plan emerged as the highest bid for Essar Steel, said, “In the case of Essar Steel, opportunities have been provided to bidders for nearly a year to first be eligible and second, to make a compelling offer. ArcelorMittal has followed the process from the start. We fully expect the process to continue to be implemented correctly and as per the law and that statements attempting to convince otherwise not be given any credibility.""
The matter will be heard next by the NCLAT on 4 February."

761,2019-01-23,State Bank,"The sale of loans comes with a precondition that caps the profit a winning bidder can make from resolution to 18%Essar Steel has received a binding bid of around  ₹42,000 crore from ArcelorMittal

Mumbai: State Bank of India’s (SBI) latest effort to sell loans given to Essar Steel Ltd has stalled, as potential buyers baulk at the bank’s demand for a pound of flesh from the same loan’s bankruptcy resolution.
According to three people aware of the matter, the sale of Essar Steel loans worth  ₹15,431 crore comes with a precondition that caps the profit a winning bidder can make through bankruptcy resolution at 18%; the difference accruing from any higher profit must go to SBI. However, the bank won’t be liable for any loss the bidder might face.
According to the people cited above, at least three potential bidders have decided not to go ahead after evaluating the transaction.
Mint reported on 17 January that SBI had put on sale its entire exposure to Essar Steel, as last-minute litigation continues to delay the recovery of its loans to the steelmaker. The bank has set the aggregate reserve price for the full-cash sale at  ₹9,588 crore.
Essar Steel, which owes over  ₹49,000 crore to more than two dozen banks led by SBI, has received a binding bid of around  ₹42,000 crore from ArcelorMittal.
If the bid is accepted, it guarantees a significant recovery of Essar’s secured loans, largely owed to public sector banks, including SBI. The minimum recovery for SBI under the plan is  ₹11,313.42 crore.
However, Essar Steel’s promoter, the Ruia family, which is trying to retain control, has moved the bankruptcy tribunal agreeing to pay  ₹54,389 crore, which has been challenged by ArcelorMittal.
“SBI had initially set a deadline of 22 January, which has now been extended by a week to 30 January,"" said the first of the three persons cited earlier. “Some bidders feel that the risk-reward ratio in this situation does not justify the deal,"" the second person said. “The buyers feel that they will end up underwriting the risk while the rewards will be reaped by SBI."" Notably, the sale of SBI’s loans will give the acquirer a seat in the company’s committee of creditors (CoC), with the highest voting share.
“The buyer of SBI’s loans can effectively veto any resolution plan, thereby influencing the final outcome of the resolution process,"" said the second person.
A request for comment sent to an SBI spokesperson remained unanswered until press time.
In a related development, ArcelorMittal said on Tuesday that in the case of Essar Steel, opportunities had been provided to bidders for nearly a year to first be eligible and second, to make a compelling offer. The company claimed it has followed the process from the start. “No company or individual can say they were not aware of the process and therefore should not expect to come in at a late stage, providing no details as to the financing of their offer after a decision has been taken by the committee of creditors,"" a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal said.
While acquiring Essar Steel is key to ArcelorMittal’s long-cherished India entry plans, for the Ruia family it is the last shot at retaining the steelmaker at a time the demand cycle of steel is turning around globally.
This is SBI’s second attempt to sell its Essar Steel loan exposure after dropping the process in September last year. Other lenders such as HDFC Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd and Federal Bank have already sold their Essar Steel exposure, either partly or in full, over the last few years. Essar Steel runs a 10-million-tonne steel mill at Hazira in Gujarat, which is involved in ore beneficiation, pellet-making, iron-making, steel-making and downstream facilities.
On 25 October 2018, Essar Steel’s CoC voted in favour of handing over the debt-laden company to ArcelorMittal after it cleared pending dues of Uttam Galva and KSS Petron.
ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan envisages an upfront payment of  ₹42,000 crore to lenders and an additional ₹8,000 crore towards capital expenditure. CoC’s decision was, however, challenged by the Ruias in National Company Law Tribunal, Ahmedabad, which said it would pronounce a judgement by 31 January."
758,2019-01-24,State Bank,"Etihad, which owns 24% in Jet, is willing to bring in more money, but that would trigger the open offer thresholdEtihad says it will invest only if it is allowed an exemption and if Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal exits the airline

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar met Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi on Wednesday to discuss Etihad Airways PJSC’s demand for an open offer exemption before investing in cash-strapped Jet Airways (India) Ltd, two people aware of the matter said.
Under Sebi’s takeover code, any company acquiring control in a listed company, or when its stake crosses 25%, must make an open offer to its minority investors. Etihad, which owns 24% in Jet Airways, is willing to bring in more money, but that would trigger the open offer threshold. The Gulf airline says it will invest only if it is allowed an exemption and if Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal exits the airline.
“SBI chairman Kumar met with Ajay Tyagi, Sebi chairman, to understand provisions under which open offer exemption is possible in the case of Jet Airways bailout,"" said the first of the two people, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity. “The SBI chairman also wanted to understand if Sebi is inclined to provide such an exemption,"" the person added.
Kumar and Tyagi also discussed Goyal’s rival offer to invest up to  ₹700 crore and pledge all his shares, provided he retains at least a 25% stake in the airline. Goyal and his family together own 51% of Jet Airways.
“Though Goyal’s offer was discussed, the talks between the two mostly involved Etihad’s offer (to pick up additional stake in Jet Airways),"" said the second person.
“The Sebi chairman told the SBI chairman that an open offer exemption is possible under the takeover code to save a company in the larger investors’ interest. Sebi asked SBI to make a formal representation on this,"" added the second of the two people cited earlier.
An open offer exemption may also require a reference from the aviation regulator, Directorate General of Civil Aviation, or the civil aviation ministry.
However, the markets regulator can use sections 10 and 11 of the Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers, or the takeover code, which allows exemptions under special circumstances.
Section 10 of the Sebi takeover code allows exemption if it is made under section 18 of the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Act, 1985, or any statutory modification or re-enactment. Section 11 empowers the Sebi board to allow exemptions if it deems it a fit case in the interest of investors in securities.
The two sections are frequently used to give exemptions to public sector banks and undertakings when the government recapitalizes them.
Queries sent to spokespeople for Sebi and SBI seeking details of the meeting remained unanswered.
Etihad Airways chief executive officer Tony Douglas had earlier told SBI that the carrier would not exceed its offer of  ₹150 per share of Jet Airways for making any fresh investment, according to reports.

757,2019-01-26,State Bank,"Planning to take a loan? Consider one against securities since it is cheaper than a credit card or personal loan  Most banks allow you to take loan against securities, but it comes at a cost

Mumbai: There was a time not long ago when you had to wait for days to get a loan sanctioned. Today, you can get loans online and through apps within a day. Some banks even promise you to give loan within minutes and seconds. Since loans are easily available it doesn’t mean you have to borrow indiscriminately. The loans that are available on tap are unsecured loans, which generally have a higher interest rate. In case of secured loans such as loan against property and loan against securities, the interest rate is lower. Here is a look at how it works:
What is loan against securities?
Do you have securities such as insurance policies, mutual funds, direct stocks, fixed maturity plans, exchange traded funds and savings bonds? If yes, did you know that you can pledge these securities and get a loan in case you are in need of it? The amount and the interest rate can vary from bank to bank and the loan is offered as an overdraft facility. Some banks allow you to take the loan online. To take loan against shares you may need to have a demat account with the bank. State Bank of India (SBI) allows you to take a maximum loan of  ₹20 lakh and a minimum of  ₹50,000 and the loan-to-value ratio is 50% of the value of the shares. In case of mutual funds, you will get loan on up to 50% of the net asset value, according to ICICI Bank Ltd. In case of life insurance policies the minimum amount is  ₹50,000 and the maximum amount is  ₹5 crore. To take a loan against securities, along with the securities that you want to pledge, you also have to provide identity proof, address proof and signature.
The cost
Most banks allow you to take loan against securities and it comes at a cost. The interest rate varies based on the security and the bank. For instance, SBI currently offers interest rate of 10.95% on loan against shares, mutual funds and dual advantage funds. For loan against sovereign gold bond, the interest rate is 10.45% whereas for loan against national savings certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, RBI relief bonds and insurance it is 13.10%. Besides the interest rate, you have to pay annual maintenance fee, processing fee, stamp duty, credit information company charges, prepayment charges and other fees. For example, HDFC Bank Ltd charges annual maintenance charge of up to 50 basis points for equity, debt, non-convertible bonds and bonds with a minimum cap of  ₹1,000 and maximum of  ₹5,000. In case of processing charges, you may either have to pay a flat fee or a percentage of the loan amount. For instance, ICICI Bank charges a nonrefundable processing charge of  ₹3,500 plus goods and services tax (GST) or 0.25% of the loan amount will a cap of a minimum amount of  ₹5,000 plus GST.
Should you opt for it?
Ideally you should save first and then spend. However, if you are in a situation where you need money and have to take a loan, you should first evaluate the options that are available. Look for loans with lower interest rates.
For instance, credit cards if you don’t pay during the grace period, will cost you 22-44% in interest. In case of personal loan it can range between 12-24% per annum. If you opt for loan against securities, it will be in the range of 10-14% per annum. Hence, it would make sense to go for loan against securities if you have the option. “Loans should be your last resort. Once you have decided to opt for a loan, you should shop for the cheaper options available to you. Secured loans such as loan against property and loan against securities will be cheaper than unsecured loans such as personal loan and credit card. In situations where the securities are giving lower returns than the loan you are taking, logically you should sell it. However, it will depend on case-to-case basis,"" said Melvin Joseph, a Sebi-registered investment adviser and founder of Finvin Financial Planners."

NEW DELHI :
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd's (HPCL)  ₹43,129-crore refinery project in Barmer district of Rajasthan has achieved financial closure with tying up of a  ₹28,753-crore loan from a consortium of lenders, the company said Monday.
HPCL, a subsidiary of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), signed a debt syndication agreement with the consortium of nine lenders led by State Bank of India, a company statement said.
""SBI is the lead lender with more than 50% share in the consortium,"" it said. ""This is one of the largest project debt syndications in India.""
The project, where HPCL owns 74% stake and the balance is held by the Rajasthan government, will cost  ₹43,129 crore. Two-thirds of the project cost is being funded through loans and the remaining through equity by promoters.
It comprises a 9-million tonne a year oil refinery and a 2-million tonne per annum petrochemicals unit.
SBI Caps was the debt arranger, it added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 16, 2018, started work on the project that will be completed by 2022-23.
Originally, then Congress president Sonia Gandhi had laid foundation stone of the refinery on September 22, 2013.
The state government is giving  ₹1,123 crore per annum for 15 years as an interest-free loan instead of previously envisaged tax breaks. This has resulted in reducing the financial burden on the state government from  ₹56,040 crore to  ₹16,845 crore.
As much as 4,400,40 acres of land is required for the project, out of which, 1,454 acres will be developed as a green belt.
Of the total project cost,  ₹842 crore has been earmarked towards pollution-control measures.

Many global funds have pushed for India to resolve its bankruptcy cases faster, but some investors are finding opportunities in the delays.
As Indian lenders seek to offload soured debt worth billions of dollars, overseas firms such as Cantor Fitzgerald and SC Lowy see the chance for investors to reap returns from delays in the bankruptcy process.
Indian banks’ bad debt problem, second in the world only to Italy, along with the inefficiencies in the country’s bankruptcy process, offer opportunities for a potentially lucrative form of investing known as merger arbitrage.
Such trades focus on the risks of bids for companies falling through, the potential for other bidders to push up prices and the process dragging on, according to Rousseau Anai, head of Asia Pacific at Cantor Fitzgerald, whose firm’s investors are looking for minimum returns of 15% in US dollar terms.
Only three firms among the so-called dirty dozen—India’s largest stressed borrowers that the central bank asked in June 2017 to be resolved under the bankruptcy framework—have been worked out so far, with the rest stuck in various stages of litigation.
The Supreme Court last week upheld a law that bars founders of defaulted companies from buying back stressed assets, a move that may help India more quickly resolve bad debt.
Banks are inviting bids because loan sales will help them bolster capital buffers, as the pace of credit growth picks up in the nation.
State Bank of India (SBI), the nation’s largest lender, this month sought bids for  ₹154,00 crore ($2.2 billion) of loans made to debt-laden Essar Steel.
Central Bank of India, a commercial bank, is considering the sale of loans made to companies including Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd, Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Lanco Hills Technology Park, people familiar with the matter said last week.
It makes particular sense for lenders to try to sell loans that could fetch prices above what they’ve provisioned for, according to Mihir Chandra, head analyst at SC Lowy.
“As the insolvency processes drag on, we foresee more opportunities to buy loan portfolios from lenders,"" Chandra said.

MUMBAI :
India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is set to take an equity stake of at least 15 percent in Jet Airways India Ltd. as lenders to the carrier plan to convert part of their loans into equity, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Under a new rescue deal in the works, the nation’s biggest full-service airline’s founder Chairman Naresh Goyal’s stake will fall below 20 percent from the current 51 percent, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is not public. Etihad Airways PJSC, the current equity partner with 24 percent stake, is expected to infuse additional funds to take its total holding to more than 40 percent, they said.
The Mumbai-based carrier has struggled with low fares in an increasingly competitive market, losing money in all but two of the past 11 years. Jet Airways has called an extraordinary general meeting on Feb. 21 in Mumbai, to seek shareholders approval to increase authorized share capital of company by issuing equity and preferred shares.
No final decision has been taken, the people said. Spokesmen for SBI and Jet didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment.
The carrier is working on “various options on the debt-equity mix, proportion of equity infusion,"" the airline said in a statement on Jan. 16. adding the restructuring may lead to a change in the board of the company.

752,2019-01-31,State Bank,"SBI is working with the founders of several mid-sized companies to restructure loans and escape bankruptcy proceedings, said KantRecent bankruptcy proceedings were a wake up call for India’s business community

(Bloomberg) -- India’s largest lender is finding fear can be a potent weapon in recovering loans.
With 1.8 trillion rupees ($25 billion) in bad corporate debt to clean up, State Bank of India is having an easier time negotiating with founders keen to avoid the nation’s two-year-old bankruptcy law, according to Anshula Kant, a managing director overseeing stressed assets at the lender. That’s because a crackdown by policy makers has convinced business owners that they risk losing their companies once the courts become involved.
“The first thing they say when they come to us is ‘Madam please don’t send us to NCLT,’' she said, referring to the National Company Law Tribunal, which oversees bankruptcy cases. If the founder is “genuine we don’t want him to lose the company.""
Recent bankruptcy proceedings that wrested prominent companies from their owners were a wake up call for India’s business community, previously used to walking away from debts without major consequences. At the same time, the regulator has pressured banks to take defaulters to court, giving lenders just 180 days to recast loans once a payment is missed.
The crackdown helped reduce the bad-debt ratio at India’s banks to 10.8 percent in September from 11.5 percent six month earlier, though it remains among the worst for a major economy. For SBI, it stands at a one-year low of 9.95 percent.
SBI is working with the founders of several mid-sized companies to restructure loans and escape bankruptcy proceedings, said Kant, who joined SBI in 1983 and was previously the lender’s chief financial officer. One-time settlements are a “preferred choice"" if founders have funding, with the bank willing to take a haircut of as much as 40 percent, she said.
The bankruptcy process itself is better suited for accounts where several lenders are involved, making it hard to get everyone to agree to a restructuring, according to Kant.
Consensus building isn’t the only difficulty with the fledgling law. Legal challenges from founders, losing bidders and operational creditors have forced courts to extend the 270-day deadline for debt resolution that was enshrined in the law.
SBI recently sought bids for $2.2 billion of loans to Essar Steel India Ltd. after the company’s founders challenged the mill’s sale. Essar was among the first 12 companies forced before the nation’s bankruptcy court by the regulator in 2017.
Lost Income
Lenders to the so-called ‘dirty dozen’ lost out on 40 billion rupees in additional income due to delays in the resolution process beyond the time mandated by law, according to rating company ICRA. The number of cases of corporate debtors admitted before the courts that are yet to be resolved stood at 816 in September, it said.
SBI is also working to increase the amount of money it sets aside for soured corporate loans. The lender plans to raise its provisioning to about 70 percent by March 2020 from about 57 percent currently, Kant said.
“We want a cleaner balance sheet,"" she said. “It will be our endeavor that all corporate non-performing loans will be provided up to 70 percent by end of the next fiscal.""

Mumbai: The country’s largest lender State Bank of India on Friday posted a net profit of  ₹3,954.81 crore, the highest ever in seven years. Net profit rose on account of improved asset quality and strong net interest income (NII) growth.

“The slippages are under control. The net profit of the quarter which is  ₹3,955 crore has to be viewed in the light of accelerated provisioning, which we made during the quarter. As a result of that, net NPAs have come down to below 4 per cent. We are working in the direction in bringing down the net NPAs and we should be below 3 per cent by the end of March 2019,"" said Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI.
Kumar also said that the bank has an exposure of  ₹900 crore to Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services at the holding company level and has made 50% provisioning against the exposure.

State Bank of India beat expectations and posted its highest quarterly profit in nearly seven years on Friday, as the country's biggest lender by assets set aside lower provisions for bad loans and asset quality improved.
Its net profit was  ₹39.55 billion ($556 million) for the third quarter ended December 31, versus a loss of  ₹24.16 billion a year ago, and analysts' expectations for a profit of  ₹32.08 billion, according to Refinitiv data.

In the current quarter, SBI's provisions for bad loans dropped 21.3% to  ₹139.71 billion from a year earlier, the bank said in a stock exchange filing.
A write-back on provisions made for mark-to-market losses helped total provisions drop 68.2%. Net interest income grew 21.4% to  ₹226.91 billion, driven by healthy growth in loans.
SBI, which accounts for more than a fifth of India's banking assets, saw its gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans ease to 8.71% at end-December, from 9.95% in the previous quarter and 10.35% in the year-ago period.
In absolute terms, its gross bad loans eased from the previous quarter to  ₹1.88 trillion, helped by a slowdown in slippages.

The nation's largest lender State Bank of India on Friday denied reports that its servers have been compromised last week and assured that all its customer data continue to remain safe and secure.
According to a news item published by US-based TechCrunch, SBI has some unprotected servers which gave access to the financial information of its millions of customers to anyone looking for it. The report, however, did not quantify as to how many of SBI's over 42.2 crore customers were hit.
SBI said it has thoroughly investigated the matter after it was brought to the notice. ""Our investigation has revealed that our servers are fully protected and there was no breach at all,"" the bank tweeted Friday and assured that data of all its customers are safe and secure.
TechCrunch report had claimed that the SBI servers stored two months of data from SBI Quick, a service which involves banking by giving a missed call or sending an SMS. It said the bank did not protect the server with a password, making access to customers data open to anyone looking for it.
The bank said the incident under question relates to a service in which account information is quickly made available to a customer through an ongoing SMS service after taking care to mask account details so that customer data is protected.
The masking in any case ensures that there is a basic protection for the customer data. The process uses services of telcos and aggregates who have experience in the field and there are strict protocol are set up for these players.
""The investigation has revealed that there was a mis- configuration or lacuna in their process that arose on 27 January and was subsequently rectified,"" the bank said.

MUMBAI :
Jet Airways (India) Ltd. on Friday said that stakeholders of the airline and board of directors of the company are yet to agree and approve the resolution plan that is expected to infuse much needed capital in the company.
""The said resolution plan which, inter alia, contemplates various options on the debt equity mix and proportion of equity infusion by the various stakeholders will be implemented once agreed to and approved by all the stakeholders, including the Board of Directors of the Company and subject to receipt of applicable statutory, regulatory, contractual and corporate approvals and other requisite consents,"" the cash-strapped airline said in a BSE statement.
In an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on 21 February, shareholders of Jet Airways will vote on a proposal to raise its authorized share capital from  ₹200 crore to  ₹2,200 crore through a special resolution. The proposal from Jet Airways also contains a plan to give lenders the right to nominate one or more members on the airline’s board, post conversion of debt into equity.
The move will allow the debt-laden airline to issue fresh shares to lenders in a much-needed financial lifeline. It is, however, expected to result in a hefty drop in the holdings of the airline’s founder Naresh Goyal and Abu Dhabi-based Etihad, with stakes of 51% and 24%, respectively, in Jet Airways at present.
“…State Bank of India (SBI), in consultation with other members of the consortium of lenders and other stakeholders, has been working on a comprehensive resolution plan towards a turnaround of the Company for its sustained growth and restoration of financial health,"" the airline said in the statement.
Etihad Airway’s chief executive Tony Douglas had earlier informed the SBI-led consortium of domestic lenders to Jet Airways that it will not exceed its offer of  ₹150 per share of Jet Airways for making any fresh investment, according to reports. The airline has also demanded a complete exit of Goyal and his family from any management or even an advisory role in Jet Airways.
Following this, Goyal made a financial offer to SBI to retain control of the ailing airline, even as its single-largest public shareholder. Goyal has told SBI that he was ready to invest up to  ₹700 crore and pledge all his shares, provided he retained at least a 25% stake.
Goyal is expected to bring in fresh investments by subscribing to the new shares of Jet Airways. Abu Dhabi-based Etihad will also be able to make fresh investments without triggering a mandatory open offer.
Shares of Jet Airways rose 7.79% to  ₹255.90 on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.59% to 36,469.43."

MUMBAI :
Is the Indian economy finally free of the toxicity that infected balance sheets of companies? Will it now be free to quicken its pace of growth?
The 3Q performance of State Bank of India shows that banks are clearing their decks to fund the economy’s growth. But the disease of overleverage is not fully cured.
SBI reported an impressive 16% growth in domestic loan offtake, which was surprisingly led by growth in its corporate book. This is a departure from the retail-led loan expansion seen in the past two years. SBI gave 20% more loans to companies than it did a year ago and a lot of it is indeed working capital. In other words, firms that have pared their debt burden over time are back to borrowing.
To its credit, SBI has remained cautious. Much of the new loans have gone to borrowers in the services sector. Loans to services companies surged 68%, followed by petrochemicals at 23%. Loans to the troubled infrastructure sector, which grew 19%, are mainly to projects with good ratings, SBI elaborated.
Even as firms borrow more, delinquencies are reducing. Part of this is due to the threat of insolvency proceedings. This is visible from the steep fall of 60% in fresh slippages for SBI. The stock of dud assets has fallen and helped by strong loan growth, bad loan ratios have improved. Now, gross bad loans form only 8.71% of SBI’s loan book, compared with a stiff 10.4% a year ago.
What about old borrowers?
This is where the trouble lies. SBI had to write off a quarter of its loans that belonged to the first two lists of accounts referred to insolvency courts. During the December quarter, reductions to its bad loan stock through write-offs were more than  ₹18,000 crore. That is double that of the previous year. It has put the loan account of Essar Steel on sale.
Clearly, SBI is trying to clean its books even if this means forgoing high recoveries. Hence, it can hardly be blamed for continuing to ramp up provisioning. It has insured its balance sheet by having a coverage ratio of 75%. For loans that are stuck in insolvency proceedings, SBI has covered 67% by provisioning. It has made 100% provisioning for 20 accounts.
It is clear that SBI is wiping its balance sheet clean to make way for new strong credit. Likewise for the economy, as strong firms buy out weaker ones with good assets, growth may indeed revive."
746,2019-02-04,State Bank,"NCLAT’s directive was issued while it was hearing a petition filed by the CoC of Essar Steel, through SBI against Satish Kumar GuptaThe Ruia family backed ESAHL holds 72% of shares in Essar Steel

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Monday directed the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to decide on the insolvency plea filed against Essar Steel (India) Ltd. by 11 February.
A two-member NCLAT bench headed by its chairperson Justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya said only after the matter had been heard at NCLT, Ahmedabad, would the appellate tribunal hear it on 12 February.
The NCLAT’s directive was issued while it was hearing a petition filed by the committee of creditors (CoC) of Essar Steel, through State Bank of India, against resolution professional Satish Kumar Gupta and others.
The appellate tribunal also asked the operational creditors to choose one representative as the bench will not be hear all of them individually.
Last week, the Ahmedabad bankruptcy court had turned down the bid by Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd (ESAHL) to regain control over the debt-laden Essar Steel, which came as a major setback to the promoter Ruia family.
The Ruias have been seeking withdrawal of the petition under Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) that allows it subject to approval by 90% of the creditors and the NCLT. Their offer was made on a day when more than 92% of creditors to Essar Steel voted in favour of handing over the company to ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV.
The Ruia family backed ESAHL holds 72% of shares in Essar Steel.The NCLT decision paves the way for ArcelorMittal to move closer to its plans for acquiring Essar Steel.
On 3 January, the NCLAT had directed the Ahmedabad bench of the NCLT to expedite the insolvency case filed against Essar Steel.
The financial creditors had voted in favour of the resolution plan of ArcelorMittal on 25 October. Essar Steel shareholders then proposed to pay all its lenders, including operational lenders, in full.
ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan envisages an upfront payment of  ₹42,000 crore to lenders and an additional  ₹8,000 crore towards capital expenditure.
Later, Standard Chartered Bank also approached the bankruptcy court challenging the resolution plan approved by the majority of the financial lenders. Standard Chartered, which has more than 7.5% weight in the voting process, voted against ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan."
745,2019-02-05,State Bank,"The banks should give an undertaking to return the amount claimed by them to the court in the future, says EDVijay Mallya's extradition had been approved by the UK home secretary, the British government said on Monday

Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) told a special court here on Tuesday that it had no objection to restoration of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya's properties to a consortium of banks, but the banks should give an undertaking to return the amount claimed by them to the court in the future.
The central probe agency submitted its affidavit in response to an application filed by the consortium of banks, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), seeking restoration of properties of Mallya, who is accused of defaulting on loans worth over  ₹9,000 crore.
According to the consortium, the amount claimed by the banks was around  ₹6,200 crore.
In its affidavit filed before special PMLA judge M S Azmi, the ED said it had left the matter to the best judgement of the court to grant the prayer made by the applicant (consortium of banks).
""However, in case the court deems it fit to allow the application, it shall take an undertaking from them (consortium of banks) to return the said amount with interest, in case the court at any point deems 'fit and appropriate' in the 'interest of justice' to deposit the amount before it or to the complainant without delay,"" the affidavit said.
The agency further said that since all the applicants, except one, were public banks, the money sought to be recovered was public money, restoration of assets in their favour was in public interest.
""In light of these facts and circumstances, it is prayed that the court may graciously be pleased to allow the instant application in the interest of justice and/or pass any such order that it deems fit in the interest of justice,"" the ED submitted.
Mallya (63) last month became the first businessman to be declared as a fugitive economic offender (FEO) under the Fugitive Economic Offenders Act, which came into existence in August, 2018.
He had left the country on March 2, 2016. A London court had, on December 10, 2018, ordered his extradition.
Mallya's extradition had been approved by the UK home secretary, the British government said on Monday, in a major blow to the liquor baron and boosting India's efforts to bring back the fugitive businessman.
Subsequently, the business tycoon said he would initiate the process to file an appeal against his extradition."

NEW DELHI :
SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar Thursday said the bank has already cut the interest rate and will reduce it further with decline in marginal cost of funding.
The Reserve Bank had last week cut the repo rate by 0.25%, but the country's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) announced only a 0.05 per cent reduction in interest rate on home loans of up to  ₹30 lakh.
""Whatever cushion we had, we have already reduced our rates. If our marginal cost of funding comes down, then that benefit we will pass on to borrowers,"" Kumar told reporters.
Earlier, speaking at a CREDAI conference here, Kumar made a case for developing the corporate bond market to help fund projects with long gestation period and reduce the burden on banks for funding infrastructure projects.
""In India, still banks play a prominent role... Bond market is sill not developed and since bond market is not developed the dependence on banks for the capital is huge. So we need to do more to develop bond market,"" Kumar said.
He said the dependence on banks for funding projects will continue for few more years till the time an alternative mechanism is developed, particularly for projects where the gestation period is long.
Financing long term projects puts new responsibility on the banks who have traditionally been working capital lenders, he said.

Mumbai: MC Aviation Partners Inc., the wholly owned aircraft leasing unit of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp., said it will decide after 21 February on whether to repossess five Boeing Co. 737 planes it has leased to cash-strapped Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
Jet Airways, which has lease rentals overdue with MC Aviation, has convened an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders next week to decide on a proposal to convert a portion of its large debt into equity.
“Jet Airways hasn’t paid dues to MC Aviation Partners since October 2018,"" a senior official of the leasing firm said on Wednesday. The official declined to be named.
Shareholders of the Mumbai-based airline will vote on a proposal on 21 February to raise its authorized share capital from  ₹200 crore to  ₹2,200 crore through a special resolution. The step will allow the debt-laden airline to issue fresh shares to lenders—a much-needed financial lifeline. It is, however, expected to reduce the holdings of promoter Naresh Goyal, and Etihad Airways PJSC of Abu Dhabi, who currently hold stakes of 51% and 24%, respectively.
Jet Airways has been struggling with cash flows for the past six months due to higher fuel costs and intense competition that has forced the carrier to keep fares low to match those of its rivals. The cash crunch forced the airline to delay salaries to pilots, lessors and interest payments on its debt. Jet Airways defaulted on payments to a consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India on 31 December.
The financial woes also led Jet Airways to halt deliveries of six new Boeing 737 Max planes that were due by March. The airline has a total of 123 aircraft, including five Boeing 737 Max planes.
The official at MC Aviation said Jet Airways had also defaulted on paying aircraft lease rentals in 2013. “We hope that they are able to sort the situation quickly,"" the official said, without disclosing the overdue amount of the carrier.
A Jet Airways spokesperson declined to comment on individual relationships with aircraft leasing companies. “Considering the partnership with our vendors, we have been able to continuously reach agreements for certain past due payments,"" the spokesperson added.
Mint reported on 29 January that Jet Airways was forced to cancel several domestic flights after lessors grounded some aircraft due to delay in payment of lease rentals.
The Jet Airways board will meet today to consider the December quarter earnings.
On Wednesday, Jet Airways shares gained 1.25% to  ₹223.60 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex shed 0.33% to end the day at 36,034.11 points."
735,2019-02-14,State Bank,"The fund infusion would come as a lifeline for Jet AirwaysEtihad, Goyal and SBI have been holding talks for weeks over a rescue deal for the carrier

Mumbai: Jet Airways India Ltd.., the beleaguered carrier that’s in the midst of bailout talks with its partner and lenders, is set to get an emergency loan of as much as 6 billion rupees ($85 million) to help it tide over a cash crunch, according to people familiar with the matter.
Banks, led by State Bank of India, plan to provide the funds against shares pledged by founder and Chairman Naresh Goyal and partner Etihad Airways PJSC and backed by their guarantees, the people said, asking not to be identified before a public announcement. The disclosure is likely to be made after Jet Airways’ extraordinary shareholder meeting scheduled for Feb. 21, one of the people said.
The fund infusion would come as a lifeline for Jet Airways, Asia’s worst-performing airline stock, that has defaulted on interest payments, delayed salaries and grounded multiple aircraft in its struggle to stay afloat. Etihad, Goyal and SBI have been holding talks for weeks over a rescue deal for the carrier that hasn’t seen a profit for nine of the past 11 years in the face of cutthroat competition.
“That’s a good amount, I’d take that as a big positive,"" said Mayur Milak, a Mumbai-based analyst at IndiaNivesh Securities Ltd. “Crude has also came down from $85 to $60 and operational metrics have become more favorable. Once you get the money, that definitely adds to the sustainability of operations.""
Representatives for SBI and Jet Airways didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment. Etihad declined to comment. Jet Airways’ shares, which has dropped 73 percent in the past year, gained 1.4 percent at 224.25 rupees in Mumbai on Wednesday.
Under one proposal, Etihad, which owns 24 percent of Jet Airways, will raise its stake to almost 44 percent by boosting capital at 150 rupees a share, the people said. Goyal’s stake would fall to about 22 percent from 51 percent, and lenders would end up with more than 15 percent after swapping a part of Jet’s loans to equity, the people said.
A final decision is pending as the plan needs the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the market regulator, the people said.
Any agreement to avert a collapse of the Mumbai-based airline would help save 23,000 jobs and spare Prime Minister Narendra Modi the embarrassment of a failed business on his watch months before elections.
Jet Airways, which started operations more than two decades ago after India ended a state monopoly in aviation, has piled on debt as low-cost carriers lured fliers away with their cheaper, on-time, no-frills flights. With cost-conscious travelers, India has been a tough market for airlines. Kingfisher Airlines Ltd. collapsed earlier this decade while state-owned Air India has survived on repeated bailouts.
Jet Airways’s extraordinary general meeting later this month in Mumbai will seek shareholder approval to increase authorized share capital by issuing equity and preferred shares."
734,2019-02-15,State Bank,"As per the Jet Airways bailout plan, banks will become majority owners of the airline, pushing out founder-promoter Naresh GoyalThe Jet Airways bailout plan is similar to the offered to Kingfisher Airlines in 2011; that airline shut down three years later

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd on Thursday approved a bailout plan that would allow its domestic lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), to convert their loans into equity, making them the largest shareholders of the cash-strapped airline.
Jet Airways, meanwhile, reported its fourth straight quarterly loss, adding to the woes of the carrier hammered by higher costs and fierce competition from budget airlines.
In the three months through December, the airline plunged to a loss of  ₹587.77 crore, from a net profit of  ₹165.25 crore a year earlier. The earnings however topped the  ₹643.3 crore loss forecast in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts.
Expenses during the quarter rose 12% to  ₹6,786.15 crore from a year earlier. It included fuel costs of  ₹2,387.72 crore, a 30% increase from the year earlier.
Post the board decision, Jet Airways would seek approval from its shareholders in an extraordinary general meeting on 21 February to convert the debt into 114 million shares and allot them to the lenders.
The proposal to convert loans into equity was made after the Mumbai-based carrier defaulted on payments, including interest to the banks in December. Jet Airways had a gross debt of  ₹8,411 crore as of end-September including aircraft debt of  ₹1,851 crore.
Jet Airways has been struggling with cash flows for the past six months because of rising fuel costs. The cash crunch forced the airline to delay salaries to pilots and interest payments on its debt.
“We are indebted to our employees who, despite our interim challenges, have worked tirelessly to ensure the highest levels of operational reliability and customer services for our guests, in line with our core values,"" Jet Airways’ chief executive officer Vinay Dube said in a statement.
The bank-led provisional resolution plan (BLPRP), approved by the board, proposes restructuring under the provisions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in order to meet a funding gap of nearly  ₹8,500 crore.
The gap is to be met through a mix of equity infusion, debt restructuring, sale, sale and leaseback, and refinancing of aircraft, among others.
“Jet Airways continues to make steady progress on its operational and financial turnaround and with today’s approval of the bank-led provisional resolution plan by the board of directors of the company, we remain confident of delivering a more strategic, efficient and financially viable airline,"" Dube said.
At the EGM, shareholders would also vote on a proposal to raise its authorized share capital from  ₹200 crore to  ₹2,200 crore through a special resolution.
“The BLPRP envisages the company receiving the requisite approvals from shareholders at their meeting scheduled to be held on 21 February 2019 for conversion of lenders’ debt into appropriate equity shares that would result in the lenders becoming the largest shareholders in the company, and, appointment of lenders’ nominees to the board of directors of the company under the provisions of the RBI Circular,"" Jet Airways said in a statement.
Additionally, the BLPRP also envisages sanction of interim credit facilities by domestic lenders on terms to be agreed as well as the appropriate governance structure, including the board composition, in accordance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, the airline said.
The BLPRP will be presented to the banks, an overseeing committee of the Indian Bankers’ Association, the board of Etihad Airways PJSC, which owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways, and the airline’s promoter and chairman Naresh Goyal, it said, adding that implementation of the BLPRP is subject to receiving regulatory and other approvals.
Meanwhile, Jet Airways’ revenue in the December quarter fell to  ₹6,198.38 crore from  ₹6,207.83 crore a year earlier. The figure missed Bloomberg’s survey of three analysts which had expected the airline to report revenue of  ₹6,450.4 crore.
Analysts tracking the sector attributed Jet Airways’ loss in the latest quarter to high costs and its inability to match fares offered by budget airlines.
“The aggressive pricing strategies adopted by budget carriers have hurt Jet Airways adversely once again this quarter,"" said an analyst with a foreign brokerage.
The airline trimmed total capacity during the December quarter.
To cut costs, it either shut or reduced flights to unprofitable routes in the quarter. Also, a few lessors have also sought to repossess their planes after the airline failed to pay lease rentals.
Jet Airways carried 7.17 million passengers in Q3, a 6.9% decline from the year earlier.
“The movement of capacity to hubs enhanced choice and comfort for guests but also led to a minor and interim decline in ASKM (2.6%), RPKMS (3%) over Q3 FY18. The shift also impacted cargo revenues in the interim, which contracted 5.5%, despite an impressive growth in yields by 14%,"" it said.
ASKM is average seat per kilometre and RPKMS is revenue passenger kilometres. Both are unit measurements for airlines."

729,2019-02-16,State Bank,"The decision comes a day after Jet Airways board approved a bailout plan to rescue the airlineJet Privilege was estimated to have a valuation of $1.131 billion last year

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd on Friday deferred plans to sell stake in Jet Privilege, its frequent flyer programme that the Naresh Goyal-led management had repeatedly called a lifeline for the beleaguered airline. The decision comes a day after the Jet Airways board approved a bailout plan that takes away Goyal’s position as majority shareholder of the company.
The company has identified potential buyers for sale and SLB (sale and lease back) of 16 aircraft, including many wide-body planes owned by the carrier, its chief financial officer Amit Agarwal said in an analyst call. 
Jet Airways has 123 aircraft, according to its website. Of these, it owns 16 aircraft, mostly wide-body planes. The rest are on SLB from lessors.
Proceedings from the sale will be utilized to service debt, Agarwal said. “We will continue to work for JPPL (Jet Privilege Pvt. Ltd) stake sale at a later date,"" he said.
Jet Privilege was incorporated in 2012 as a wholly-owned unit of Jet Airways, but was hived off as an independent entity in 2014 after Etihad Airways PJSC bought a 50.1% stake for $150 million valuing the firm at $300 million. Etihad’s investment in Jet Privielge was part of its overall $600 million investment in Jet Airways announced in April 2013.
On Point Loyalty, a global management consultancy focused on airline loyalty programmes, had valued Jet Privilege at $1.131 billion (about  ₹7,300 crore) last year, based on the average rupee exchange rate in November.
Over the years, frequent-flyer programmes have become profit centres for airlines globally. Many airlines are said to be making higher profits by tying up with mileage partners such as banks, hotels and credit card companies. It remains to be seen if under the new ownership of the company, the airline will look to monetize Jet Privilege.
Jet Airways had on 14 February approved a bailout plan that allowed its domestic lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), to convert their loans into equity, also making them its largest shareholders.
The airline had earlier defaulted on interest payment obligations.
The banks-led provisional debt resolution plan, approved by the Jet Airways board, proposes restructuring under provisions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to meet a funding gap of nearly  ₹8,500 crore. The gap is to be met through a mix of equity infusion, debt restructuring, sale, SLB, and refinancing of aircraft, among others.
“Banks will not become promoters (of Jet Airways),"" Agarwal said during the analysts call.
The airline’s chief executive officer Vinay Dube said that Jet Airways will remain a professionally-run company where the management reports to the board of directors. The company, which has delayed payment of dues to several of its lessors and vendors, hopes to mitigate the situation in the coming days.
At present, Jet Airways has aircraft-related debt of about  ₹1,700 crore. The airline had a net debt of  ₹8,052 crore on 30 September 2018.
Agarwal said that the airline is working well with all stakeholders ""to manage a win-win situation for all sides"" on the issue of overdue of credits.
However, air fares, which had declined because of intense competition among carriers, have seen a rise during the October to December 2018 period.
“The domestic pricing (airfare) has improved. This improvement was necessary for the market,"" Agarwal said, adding he is unsure if the current pricing-levels are sustainable.
On Friday, Jet Airways shares rose 2.99% to  ₹232.55 apiece on the BSE, outperforming the benchmark Sensex that fell 0.19% to 35,808.95 points."
728,2019-02-16,State Bank,"Interest rate cut on spread, not on MLCRThe move will only benefit new borrowers with a loan amount of up to  ₹30 lakh, most home loan borrowers will not see any immediate impact

The State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, has cut interest rate on its home loans by 5 basis points (bps). One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The move comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut the key policy rate by 25 bps from 6.50% to 6.25%.
Usually, when SBI cuts rates, other banks tend to follow the move. However, this time it will not be the same. Here is why:
SBI cuts 5 bps on home loans
In case of a floating rate home loan, there are two components linked to it – marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) and spread. MCLR is built on four components: marginal cost of funds, negative carry on account of cash reserve ratio (CRR), operating costs and tenor premium.
Banks are also allowed to determine a spread above the MCLR. The spread is usually decided based on credit risk and tenor. Usually most banks offer a spread of 5-90 bps above MCLR on home loans.
Considering that the SBI rate cut is on spread and not benchmark rate, it will not impact all borrowers. “It is a cut in spread and not on MCLR. Without reducing deposit rate, it is not possible to cut MCLR.
Our deposit rates are the lowest in the market. Hence, I don’t have scope for further rate cut in deposits. Our priority is home loans and that is why we wanted to give some relief to this segment,"" said Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI.
The cut will benefit only new borrowers who take a loan up to  ₹30 lakh. “The change in spread will benefit new home loan borrowers because mostly home loans are linked to one year MCLR. When next reset comes, the rate will be adjusted based on the MCLR but the spread continues for life as per RBI’S instruction,"" said Kumar.
Besides the cut in spread by SBI, Bank of Maharashtra also cut its six month MCLR. The bank offers home loan on one-year MCLR and not on six month MCLR. Hence, no home loan borrowers will benefit from it.
Meanwhile, there are banks that have, in fact, increased rates before the repo rate cut announcement in the recent monetary policy. For instance, Bank of Baroda has increased its one year MCLR by 10 bps to 8.75% from 8.65%. The bank gives home loan on one-year MCLR. It has also increased the rate on MCLR of other tenure by 20 bps. The bank offers loans to a good credit customer without a mark-up on its MCLR.
All banks have around seven tenor of MCLR. For instance, SBI has an MCLR tenor of overnight, one month, two month, three month, six month, one year, two year and three year. Most banks link floating rate home loans to six-month or one-year MCLR.
What it means for home loan borrowers?
Although the RBI cut interest rate in its recent monetary policy announcement, indicating a rate reversal of lower interest rate cycle, you are unlikely to see any immediate impact on your home loans in the near term.
Considering that a component of the MCLR is linked to deposit rates, unless your fixed deposit rates are cut, you will not see any substantial change.
If you are planning to take a loan, besides considering the interest rate, also factor in other charges such as processing fee, administrative cost and stamp duty.
Look closely at the spread of a home loan. If it is higher, remember that the spread will continue for the lifetime of the loan.
You need to shop around to get the best rates. You can either go to individual bank websites or loan aggregators to compare the cost.
If you are a depositor, it is unlikely that the banks will cut fixed deposit rates immediately. Hence, you can lock in to your FD rates after comparing the rates of different banks."
727,2019-02-17,State Bank,"At the cutting edge of the ever burgeoning IL&FS crisis, these employees are exposed to toxic investmentsAs many as 15 lakh salaried employees are caught in this ticking time bomb and the number is only likely to go up

NEW DELHI :
A new threat looms large for the government in an election year. A spanking new but restive community of salaried employees is concerned about its money deposited with the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).
At the cutting edge of the ever burgeoning IL&FS crisis, these employees are exposed to toxic investments. Most of these Employee Provident Funds and Employee Pension Funds have stated that the IL&FS resolution plan must provide repayment before secured creditors as the resolution framework proposed by the company doesn't provide for any payment to secured creditors.
A sense of panic has crept in. They have collectively invested thousands of crores of rupees in IL&FS bonds. Many say that the resolution framework must balance interest of all stakeholders. Others have also challenged Sec 53 of the payment schedule distribution process as it doesn't address public and social interest. Since these are tradeable instruments, the exact quantum is not known, but investment bankers estimate it to be in thousands of crores since the infrastructure company's bonds - which were 'AAA' rated - were preferred by retirement funds that have a low-risk appetite but still have to get assured returns even when interest rates are low.
The growing discontent is across some of the blue chip Indian corporates. Some of these that have filed an intervening petition with the tribunal, thereby impleading themselves in this gargantuan case on how to run a corporate into the ground, include Apco Infratech, Apco, Titan, Asian Paints PF, Asian Paints Management Cadre Superannuation scheme, Aditya Birla Sun Life MF, Thomas Cook PF, Titan Watches, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), M & M PF, Himami, Bajaj Finance, Hindalco EPF, Max Financial Services PF Trust, IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd, IndusInd Bank, Hudco Employees CPF, MMTC CPF, 63 Moons, Nayara Energy EPF, Indian Oil Corp, ITPO, CIDCO, SBI PF, GUVNL PF, Ambuja Cement, HDFC AMC, IREDA among others.
The size, scope and magnitude of these companies is self explanatory - HUL, Asian Paints, Hindalco and M & M from the private sector, IOC, SBI and MMTC from the PSU sphere and HDFC AMC and Aditya Birla Sun Life from the mutual fund industry, virtually imperilling India Inc and most importantly dragging the financial savings of lakhs of salaried employees.
The employee provident funds of various companies and other entities had invested in IL&FS bonds and bond holders are unsecured and may or may not get paid in the ongoing crisis at IL&FS. In any case, they are seen pretty much last on the priority list. Over 75 companies and their PFs have filed an intervening petition before the appellate court to seek directions and instructions on repayment to unsecured creditors.
As many as 15 lakh salaried employees across different sectors are caught in this ticking time bomb and the number is only likely to go up as the true extent of the malaise is known and understood. Till September last year, Indian rating agencies, not realising that IL&FS was set to implode, were giving Triple A rating to the bonds. With elections around the corner, this new expose will further polarise debate. After all it is salaried employees who are now staking claim to their hard-earned monies.
In fact, in the intervening petition filed by IndusInd Bank, they have categorically asserted that the top five creditors of IL&FS were not consulted in the resolution plan. Abhishek Manu Singhvi, senior counsel, with Diwakar Maheshwari, Avishkar Singhvi and Shreyas Edupuganti appeared for IndusInd Bank. Similarly, Abhishek Anand and Anant Pavgi appeared for Federal Bank while Vikram Hegde appeared for IREDA and Priya Puri appeared for Indian Oil Corp.
Abhishek Singhvi, Arun Kathpalia, Abhinav Vashisht, Amrendra Saran, Rajiv Datta appeared on behalf of the intevener (financial creditors or operational creditors or other secured creditors). The NCLAT order of February 11 allowed the intervening applications filed by them. Furthermore, other intervenors and parties who intend to file impleadment application were allowed before the next date - which is March 12, 4 p.m.

MUMBAI :
The country's largest lender State Bank of India has initiated slew of measures, including waving off outstanding loans of 23 CRPF soldiers martyred in a terrorist attack in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir.
Last week, 40 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured in one of the deadliest terror strikes in J&K.
""23 CRPF soldiers had availed of loans from the bank and the bank has decided to waive off all the outstanding loans with immediate effect,"" the bank said in a statement.
All the CRPF soldiers were the bank's customers under defence salary package where it provides insurance of  ₹30 lakh to each of the defence personnel.
The bank said it is also taking steps to expedite release of insurance money to the next of kin of the martyred soldiers.
""It is extremely distressing and disturbing to witness the loss of lives of the soldiers who always stand for safety of our country. These initiatives by the bank is a small gesture towards the families who have faced irreparable loss,"" the bank's chairman Rajnish Kumar said.

One year after being hit by a $2 billion scam, Punjab National Bank (PNB) is set to return to annual profits and strong loan growth in fiscal 2020 even as investigations continue into the country's biggest banking fraud.
State-run PNB has already surprised markets with an earlier-than-expected profit for the quarter ended Dec. 31 as it completed setting aside funds to cover for the scam and its bad loan levels eased.
While the lender is still likely to post a loss of 59.84 billion rupees ($837.16 million) for this fiscal year ending March 31, analysts expect PNB to return to a full-year profit in the next fiscal, according to Refinitiv data.
The bank is expected to clock a net profit of 22.66 billion rupees for the year ending March 2020, which would be its highest annual profit in five years.
""The way the bank is shaping up, it is quite clear FY20 promises to be a much cleaner and better year for them,"" said Abhinesh Vijayaraj, vice president equity research for Spark Capital Advisors (India).
PNB's loan growth is estimated to be 8.33 percent for fiscal 2020, its highest in 4 years, as per the mean of analysts' estimates from Refinitiv. Its total assets are projected to grow at the highest rate in three years.
The lender said in February 2018 two jewellery groups used fake bank guarantees issued by rogue staff to raise credit overseas, triggering a plunge in its stock and driving it to three straight quarterly losses due to fraud-related provisions.
PNB's loss for the quarter following the scam's discovery was also a massive $1.90 billion - the biggest ever for an Indian lender.
Market participants believe fiscal 2020 will likely be good for other lenders as well.
""It's going to be a good period for corporate lenders on the whole in FY20 as credit growth has picked up and asset quality-related problems are largely behind us,"" said Alpesh Mehta, an analyst with Mumbai-based brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities.
In FY20, State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, and smaller peer Bank of Baroda are expected to report their best annual profits since at least 1998.
PNB's shares have fallen about 56 percent since mid-Feb last year. That plunge makes its shares undervalued compared to their valuation in previous years. It currently trades at a 12-month forward price to earnings ratio (PE) of 9.29 in comparison with the last five years' average of 15.7 and last two years' average of 31.9.
Analysts too feel the stock is currently undervalued after multiple infusions of capital by the Indian government. Since Jan. 2018, the government has infused close to $2 billion into PNB to help shore up capital and revive loan growth.
Some analysts, though, are cautious about PNB's prospects.
""The major concern is how has PNB changed their systems and processes following the scam, as it was unimaginable that such a big fraud could take place at one bank,"" said Asutosh Mishra, head of research of institutional equity at Ashika Stock Broking Ltd.
""Where will the bank be in three years is really the question,"" Spark Capital's Vijayaraj said.

721,2019-02-19,State Bank,"The complicated arrangement is on track to be voted through on February 21A group of lenders led by SBI has proposed taking a 50.1 percent stake for 1 rupee through the issuance of 114 million new shares

New Delhi: Debt-ravaged Jet Airways India Ltd., the country’s biggest so-called full-service airline, is selling a majority stake for 1 rupee -- a little more than 1 U.S. cent. It’s part of a bailout plan by its state-owned lenders that will give the airline time to arrange fresh equity. The complicated arrangement is on track to be voted through on February 21, in what would represent the rescue of one of the country’s most visible companies at a sensitive time, with India’s general election just weeks away.
1. What is Jet Airways?
It’s consistently been one of India’s top three airlines in the past decade. Jet Airways was founded by ticketing agent-turned-entrepreneur Naresh Goyal after India ended a state monopoly on aviation in the early 1990s. It’s now 24 percent owned by Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC and controls 13.9 percent of India’s market, one of the fastest-growing in the world. Jet Airways also flies to international destinations including London and Singapore.
2. Why is it in trouble?
As a slew of budget carriers started flooding the market in the mid 2000s, offering no-frills, yet on-time flights, Jet Airways began dropping fares, some to below cost. On top of that, provincial taxes of as much as 30 percent on jet fuel added to its expenses, while price-conscious Indian travelers refused to pay a premium for on-board meals and entertainment. Unlike budget operators, full-service airlines such as Jet Airways offer such amenities mostly for free. Jet Airways lost money in all but two of the past 11 years and has 72.99 billion rupees ($1 billion) of net debt. While it didn’t separately disclose cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, Bloomberg calculations show the airline had about 3.55 billion rupees of cash at the end of last year. It defaulted on loans that were due by December 31 and has delayed payments to staff and lessors.
3. What is the proposed deal?
A group of lenders led by State Bank of India has proposed taking a 50.1 percent stake for 1 rupee through the issuance of 114 million new shares, a maneuver that’s allowed under a framework outlined by the Reserve Bank of India last year. The procedure, applicable for companies with a negative net worth, is called Bank-led provisional resolution plan, or BLPRP, and it needs to be approved by all lenders, a banking industry group, founder Goyal and the board of Etihad. The structure, however, is expected to be temporary, allowing the airline to raise equity from investors, which in in turn would alter the shareholding pattern. Jet Airways, which requires some 85 billion rupees to get back on its feet, now needs to bridge that gap through fresh equity infusion, debt restructuring and asset disposals, such as selling aircraft and leasing them back. While the bank deal is nominally a conversion of debt into shares, debt levels will come down only by 1 rupee once the exercise is completed.
4. Who will invest fresh equity?
Jet Airways management has given scant detail, but said lenders will also participate in an equity issuance round beyond the already allotted 114 million shares. Jet Airways has held talks with Etihad and Indian conglomerate Tata Group, while Goyal has offered to pump in as much as 7 billion rupees, if he retains his 25 percent stake. Etihad may invest about 14 billion rupees and retain a stake below 25 percent, while India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund may bring in as much 13 billion rupees, television channel ET Now reported, citing unidentified people.
5. Why is it important to rescue a private company?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces an election within months, and the collapse of an airline -- with 23,000 jobs at stake -- would put a dent in his business-friendly image and fuel criticism that he’s failed to deliver on promises about creating jobs. Mumbai-based Jet Airways’ disappearance would also likely push up airfares -- it flies to 37 destinations across the country. The sensitivity of the matter was highlighted last year when Modi’s government reached out to the Tata Group seeking help.
6. What’s at stake for Etihad?
A lot. The struggling Abu Dhabi-based giant has scrapped routes and cut thousands of positions, putting the brakes on a costly expansion after almost $3.5 billion in losses in two years. It just slashed orders worth $21.4 billion for Boeing Co. and Airbus SE jetliners, after a strategy of buying into sick airlines around the world backfired. A healthy Jet Airways would feed traffic to Etihad’s base in Abu Dhabi, flying west-bound Indians to the U.S. and Europe.
7. How are others doing?
The airline business in India is notoriously difficult, with cutthroat competition pushing base fares to as low as 2 cents. Kingfisher Airlines, founded by beer tycoon Vijay Mallya, ended operations in 2012 after failing to clear its dues to banks, staff, lessors and airports. SpiceJet Ltd. almost collapsed two years later before its founders returned to gain control and revive the company. State-run Air India Ltd. is surviving on bailouts worth billions of dollars. Apart from Etihad, Singapore Airlines Ltd. and AirAsia Bhd. have also set up local ventures, but they are all loss-making. There’s one exception: IndiGo, operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd., has managed to consistently make money with a tight lid on costs and lucrative maintenance and engineering contracts negotiated as part of large aircraft orders.

Mumbai: From cloth makers to shipyards, Indian banks are getting stuck with shares of companies that are rapidly losing value even as the lenders seek to turn more loans they have made into equity in borrower firms.
In the latest move, State Bank of India and other creditors are planning to convert part of their loans to the beleaguered carrier Jet Airways Ltd. into equity as it struggles to repay debt. That’s a risk for the largest Indian bank, whose equity holdings’ market value crashed to about $104 million last quarter from $480 million a year earlier, while its stakes remained largely unchanged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
State Bank of India isn’t alone: competitors including ICICI Bank Ltd., Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank Ltd. saw the market value of their equity holdings drop last year. Those banks switched debt into equity in stressed companies from Bombay Rayon Fashions Ltd. to ABG Shipyard Ltd.
“No bank in India has expertise in turning around companies. None of them engage with the companies,"" said A. K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd. “Converting debt to equity normally leads to losses without such expertise.""

717,2019-02-21,State Bank,"Banks will get into trouble if the Jet Airways bailout plan eventually fails, like it did in the case of Kingfisher Airlines

For Jet Airways (India) Ltd, it’s always only about one rupee.
As I wrote last month, the troubled full-service carrier needed to garner an additional 1 rupee per available seat kilometre to make up for its cost disadvantage against no-frills rivals. Cutthroat price competition denied it that opportunity, and now banks are picking up a majority stake—at a price of 1 rupee for 114 million shares.
The gamble, which seeks to avoid putting India’s oldest private airline into court-administered bankruptcy, was put to a shareholder vote on 21 February. Beyond that, the details of the rescue plan are fuzzy.
How much of the airline’s  ₹7,654 crore ($1.08 billion) borrowings will get converted into equity? Between  ₹2,500 crore and  ₹3,000 crore, estimates an aviation analyst, while an article in the Business Standard pegs the reduction at  ₹1,000 crore. On the other hand, chief financial officer Amit Agarwal said on a conference call that the deal with banks would cut the debt burden by (you guessed it) “1 rupee.""
How will new funds enter the business? Founder Naresh Goyal and Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC are expected to bring in equity. But Etihad, which is expected to lead the round, doesn’t want to trigger India’s takeover code, which will then force it to buy shares from minority investors. The solution, according to Livemint, may be a  ₹4,000 crore rupee rights issue to which lenders (as new equity owners), as well as Etihad and Goyal will subscribe.
Banks will get into trouble if the rescue eventually fails, like it did in the case of a 2011 debt-to-equity swap at the now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines (KFA). So they will probably want to share the risk with a new investor. The name of India’s state-owned National Infrastructure Investment Fund, or NIIF, is doing the rounds.
The final picture is still muddy, but the consensus seems to favour 50%-plus ownership by banks and the NIIF; a 22% to 25% stake with Goyal, who currently controls 51%; 12% with Etihad, diluting the Middle East carrier by half; and the remaining shares with the public.
To this  ₹4,000 crore equity infusion, add the  ₹1,700 crore aircraft debt, which can be repaid by selling Jet’s 16 planes and leasing them back. (A Boeing Co. executive reckons that Jet can get up to $300 million, or  ₹2,100 crore, from the aircraft.)
That’s how  ₹5,700 crore out of Jet’s estimated  ₹8,500 crore funding deficit can be plugged. As for the remaining  ₹2,800 crore, this gap will close only if lenders agree to convert a part of their loans into a quasi-equity-type instrument. BloombergQuint says cumulative redeemable preference shares, carrying a 0.01% coupon, may be part of the toolkit.
On paper, the plan looks like it may work. Yet Jet shares, which have dropped 70% over the past year, haven’t reacted. After all, minority shareholders will also get diluted together with Etihad and Goyal. The founder might lose his board seat. Who’ll be in the cockpit instead of him? State-owned banks (plus NIIF) will have control, but they don’t know how to run an airline. Besides, even as Jet turns into a semi-state-owned carrier, taxpayers already have another mouth to feed. The government tried to sell 76% of Air India Ltd., together with $5 billion in debt; there were no takers for the unprofitable flag carrier.
Between them, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd.’s IndiGo, Jet Airways and SpiceJet Ltd., the three publicly traded Indian airlines, lost  ₹20 crore per day between April and September because of high oil prices and a weak rupee, according to ICRA, the local affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service. And yet the world’s fastest-growing aviation market is gripped by a mad expansion it can’t stop.
IndiGo, the biggest of the three, will increase its passenger carrying capacity by 34% between January and March despite a crippling pilot shortage and a 75% profit slump in the previous three months. SpiceJet, which had a passenger load factor of 90.9% in January, announced 12 new domestic flights on Tuesday. With 90 more aircraft to be added to the Indian fleet over the 12 months starting in April, cheap tickets will continue to dog profitability.
As long as IndiGo and SpiceJet keep ratcheting up the competitive tempo, only a well-capitalized Jet Airways will be able to stay in the ring, especially if oil prices spike again or the rupee collapses. However, state-owned banks, fearing investigation by the authorities in case the turnaround fails, will try to economize on haircuts on the debt. That might not leave the airline with enough of an equity cushion to stomach near-term losses. The new majority owners will also want an early exit. A combination of squeamishness and impatience could doom this airline’s second take-off.

Singapore/Bengaluru: International lessors have grounded more Jet Airways planes prior to potentially moving them out of India, as scepticism builds whether a state-led bailout of the carrier can clear their dues on time, sources familiar with the matter said.
The troubles at Jet Airways, which is saddled with a billion dollars in debt, have rekindled memories of Kingfisher Airlines' collapse in 2012 that forced lessors to write off millions of dollars. Jet has defaulted on loans and has not paid pilots, leasing firms and suppliers for months.
""There's some talk that the money is going to come but lessors have heard this for too long,"" one leasing source said on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""We are not convinced with the restructuring plan. This is panning out just like Kingfisher. Banks took control but they never wanted to take a majority stake and run the airline.""
Nine of Jet's planes have been grounded by lessors, versus the four it reported last month, with AerCap Holdings NV and BOC Aviation Ltd among those who have pulled out planes, sources told Reuters.
Cross-checks of the Jet fleet by Reuters on FlightRadar24 also show that nine of its planes have stopped flying over the last four weeks. That excludes two more that are at Singapore's Seletar Airport for, according to sources, maintenance work.
Jet, however, said on Thursday that five planes had been grounded due to non-payment of dues to lessors, as reported to regulators. The carrier added it was keeping its lessors informed about efforts to improve its financial situation.
BOC Aviation and AerCap declined to comment.
""We are waiting to see what the workout plan has in terms of us getting paid. The situation is very dicey,"" an executive at another lessor said. ""We have to make sure our assets are protected. Indian government and speedy resolutions are not words we normally use in the same sentence.""
Jet, after months of crisis-talks to plug a  ₹8,500 crore ($1.2 billion) funding hole, agreed a draft plan last week to sell a majority stake to a consortium led by the State Bank of India at  ₹1, under regulations that permit banks to convert debt to equity in a defaulting firm.
The stake sale will be followed by an equity raising, debt restructuring and the sale and leaseback of jets, but the plan needs approvals from several stakeholders.
Jet shareholders will vote later on Thursday to provide general approvals for a debt-to-equity swap.

The airline has posted losses for four quarters, battered by high fuel prices and a weak currency. Its shares plunged 67% in 2018, wiping out $1 billion from its value and making it the second-worst performer among airline stocks globally.
Boeing optimism
Jet has a fleet of about 123 mainly Boeing planes, including 16-owned aircraft. The rest are leased from many lessors including GE Capital Aviation Services, US-based BBAM and Japan's SMBC Aviation Capital, sources said, underscoring the need to get lessors on board with the bailout plan.
Jet's management team, however, was unable to provide a timeline for the receipt of approvals and funds under the bailout plan on a call with analysts last week.
But a senior Boeing executive struck a positive note, saying ""once lessors see the money come into their pockets, that's when the edginess will go away"".
""Right now they are only seeing all this paperwork ... it will take three months for things to settle,"" Dinesh Keskar, senior vice president for Asia Pacific and India sales at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said.
Keskar said Jet's lessors were taking deliveries of new Boeing 737 MAX planes but that they had held back 4-5 of the jets in Seattle pending payment from the Indian carrier.
The Boeing executive, however, was optimistic that the situation would stabilise in the near term.
""The government is interested in making sure that another airline doesn't go away and another debacle doesn't happen in a very high-growth country,"" Keskar said on the sidelines of the Aero India airshow in Bengaluru.

Mumbai: Shareholders of Jet Airways (India) Ltd have approved banks' bailout plan, the airline said in a statement o the BSE on Saturday morning.
According to the company's statement, 97.99% of Jet Airways shareholders approved the allotment of 114 million fresh shares. The company's proposal to alter the Articles of Association, and 'Object Clause' of Memorandum of Association of the company were also approved by over 99% of shareholders.

The voting, which was held on 21 February, both remotely (e-voting) and physically, at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) held in Mumbai, saw the bailout plan proposed by lenders approved by the majority of shareholders.
The approval will now allow lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) to become majority stakeholder in the airline and also infuse funds in the cash-crunched airline.
As a result, founder Naresh Goyal's stake in the airline will reduce from 51% to around 25%, while that of Etihad Airways will fall to 12% from 24%.
Jet Airways has been struggling with cash flows for the past six months due to rising fuel costs and intense competition. It has delayed payments to lessors, airport operators, oil marketing companies and a part of its staff to keep the airline flying.

To recover its loans from Jet Airways, state-run lender SBI is mulling moving National Company Law Tribunal as it feels the airline is running out of funds for operations, even as shareholders of the debt-laden carrier have approved a debt rejig plan, officials said.
Shareholders of Jet Airways have approved conversion of loan into shares and other proposals during the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) on Thursday.
A consortium of banks, led by the SBI, has extended loans to Jet Airways, which is looking to rejig debt and raise funds.
Officials associated with the lenders and key shareholders said the SBI is considering moving the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking insolvency proceedings against Jet Airways since it is running out of money for operations.
Lenders can initiate proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to recover dues from debt-laden entities. The process can commence only after approval from the NCLT.
Queries sent to SBI and Jet Airways regarding the bank considering insolvency proceedings against the airline remained unanswered.
The officials said that Gulf carrier Etihad, the strategic partner with 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, abstained from voting on various proposals during the EGM held on February 21.
According to them, Etihad is waiting for clarity on the overall funding that the SBI and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) would provide for Jet Airways in terms of equity.
The Gulf carrier has been pitching for the SBI and the NIIF to own 51 per cent and invest  ₹2,200 crore into the airline, they added.
On February 17, sources said Jet Airways was likely to invest  ₹3,000 crore post debt-rejig and investments by Etihad Airways as well as NIIF.
Besides, the SBI is not agreement with Etihad on the latter's proposal regarding Right of First Refusal (ROFR).
Etihad has sought ROFR for itself after one year and also want the SBI to get a confirmation from markets regulator Sebi that if ROFR is exercised, then the mandatory open offer would not be triggered, the officials said.
Under the Sebi norms, entities are required to make an open offer to shareholders in case their shareholding goes beyond a certain threshold.
A consortium of banks is considering an interim funding of  ₹500 crore for Jet Airways but a final decision is yet to be taken, Punjab National Bank Managing Director Sunil Mehta said on Friday. PNB is part of the lenders' consortium, led by State Bank of India (SBI), that has extended loans to the airline.
On February 14, Jet Airways' board approved a Bank-Led Provisional Resolution Plan (BLPRP), whereby lenders would become the largest shareholders in the airline.
Following approval from the shareholders, part of debt would be converted into 11.4 crore shares at a consideration of Re 1 apiece as per the RBI norms.
Later, appropriate interim credit facilities by domestic lenders would be sanctioned to the airline, according to a regulatory filing made on February 14.

707,2019-02-25,State Bank,"Lender to  sell corporate,  SME,  housing  NPAs  to  ARCs,  financial institutionsThe biggest chunk of such bad loans, 155, have been listed from SBI’s New Delhi stressed asset branch

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to sell 487 bad loans worth over  ₹1,000 crore in corporate, small and medium enterprise (SME) and housing segments to asset reconstruction companies (ARCs), other banks and financial institutions, said a bank notice seeking bids.
Among the large accounts listed by SBI are Sravanthi Energy Pvt. Ltd (exposure of  ₹177 crore), Burnpur Cement Ltd ( ₹133 crore) and Rana Iron and Power Ltd ( ₹97 crore). The bank said it has existing offers for these three accounts, and that those bidders will have the right to match the highest bid under the Swiss Challenge method, where an initial bidder gets a chance to match later bids. Other accounts up for sale include VS Lignite Power Pvt. Ltd, part of KSK Energy Ventures Ltd, with SBI’s exposure at  ₹98 crore.
Interestingly, the bank has also put on sale 480 housing and SME loans from its stressed asset resolution branches across the country. The biggest chunk of such bad loans, 155, have been listed from SBI’s New Delhi stressed asset branch, followed by 106 accounts from its branch in Titagarh, West Bengal.
An SBI official who did not wish to be named said most of these loans are backed by some form of security and are being offered at a discount to potential bidders. “The bank will put on sale some more such assets in the coming months as it looks to recover from defaulters,"" the SBI official said.
All these loans will be sold on a full-cash basis and not under the regular practice of 15% in cash and the rest in security receipts which are redeemable as and when the ARC recovers from the borrower. The assets are mostly sold at a deep discount to the total outstanding and the ARC charges 1.5-2% of the assets as management fee every year.
Meanwhile, not all banks have been selling loans to ARCs owing to differences in pricing and delays in recovery. The major bone of contention between a bank and an ARC has been the reserve price, the lowest price for a bid. While ARCs argue that banks seek high reserve price, bankers decline to take steep discounts resulting in a stalemate in many cases. In FY18, all ARCs put together purchased bad loans of close to  ₹20,000 crore, Vinayak Bahuguna, managing director and chief executive officer, Arcil told reporters last year.
Ashutosh Mishra, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities said an ARC is also able to affect faster recovery when it has bought a majority of the loans from lenders. “This gives the ARC a major say in the resolution process and quickens recovery of bad debt,"" said Mishra.
Earlier this month, SBI posted a net profit of  ₹3,954.81 crore, its highest in seven years, owing to improved asset quality and strong net interest income (NII) growth. The bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a proportion of total advances, fell to 8.71% in the December quarter from 9.95% in the previous quarter and 10.35% in the year-ago December quarter.
“The slippages are under control. We are working in the direction in bringing down the net NPAs and we should be below 3% by the end of March 2019,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said after announcing the bank’s December quarter results."
710,2019-02-25,State Bank,"A government job is always sought-after due to the life-time financial security and the other social benefits it offersBanks globally are re-aligning to changing realities due to the advent of technology

Mumbai: As technological shifts make more inroads into banking, the nations largest lender SBI has decided to replace only 75 percent of its retiring workforce over a five-year period and is benefiting from the prevailing poor jobs scenario by getting the best of candidates for the roles on offer, a senior official has said.
In a situation akin to the one observed in the Railways, the State Bank Group has got close to 28 lakh job applications for 8,000 clerical jobs in the last two years.
Starting 2018 fiscal, it has begun hiring only about 10,000 to replace the over 12,000 retirements annually, and 80 percent of the new recruits joining as a clerks are either MBAs or engineers.
""It is very good for us. We are getting good people at clerical levels who are adept with technology and other tools.
Career progressions are also happening fast, as most of them will appear for internal exams to be promoted as officers after joining as clerks,"" Prashant Kumar, deputy managing director and corporate development officer, told PTI.
Last year, the Railways had received a whopping 23 million applications for 90,000 posts that it was filling up.
A government job is always sought-after due to the life-time financial security and the other social benefits it offers.
Banks globally are re-aligning to changing realities due to the advent of technology.
British banking major HSBC has decided to nearly halve its network presence in the country, while its peer Standard Chartered axed 200 here due to automation.
The board has come out with a five-year roadmap in 2018 to replace only 75 percent of the retiring employees every year, he said, adding an average of up to 10,000, including 8,000 clerks and 2,000 officers are being hired annually as replacements.
The retirements will hit a peak in fiscal 2020 at 12,500, after that the number will start receding further, he said.
The new recruitments are helping get the average age of employees down, helping the bank become a much more vibrant organisation, with the average age coming down to 43, from 48 five years ago, Kumar said.
There is a clear shift in the areas for which the new recruitments are happening, with the share of branch banking coming down over time, he said.
The new roles which are opening up include those in varied functions like advisory loans and wealth management, recovery, risk management as well as analytics, he said.
Kumar said as much as 87 percent of the bank's overall transactions are happening outside branches today, and the present hiring reflects these ground realities.
Apart from fresher recruits, the bank also hires specialists directly from the market offering market rates, he said.
The bank does not go to campuses like its private sector peers which go directly to reputed B-schools for hiring talent, he said, explaining that it is restricted by the process which lays focus on direct recruitments.

Jet Airways and Etihad Airways on Monday said they along with key financial stakeholders are working towards finalisation of bank-led provisional resolution plan for the debt-laden domestic airline.
In a joint statement, the two carriers expressed confidence that once the plan is implemented, the Jet Airways would ""re-emerge as a viable and robust airline to reclaim its rightful place as airline of first choice for its customers"".
The joint statement has been issued by Jet Chairman Naresh Goyal and Etihad Airways CEO Tony Douglas.
Jet Airways has been grappling with financial woes and is looking to rejig debt as well as raise funds. Shareholders of the airline have approved conversion of loans into equity and other proposals last week.
State Bank of India (SBI), on Monday, said no decision has been taken on moving the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Jet Airways.
On Sunday, officials associated with the lenders and key shareholders said SBI was considering moving the tribunal seeking insolvency proceedings against Jet Airways since it is running out of money for operations.
Against this backdrop, Jet Airways and Etihad Airways said that in the last year the aviation industry has experienced extraordinary headwinds and challenges.
Rising oil prices, a depreciating rupee and market saturation, among other things, have combined to critically impact the civil aviation sector as a whole, it added.
""Some airlines have been hit harder than others; Jet Airways, India’s premier full-service airline, being one of them,"" the joint statement said.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad has 24 per cent stake in Jet Airways, which has been in operations for over 25 years.
""Jet Airways, its principal shareholders including Etihad Airways, and key financial stakeholders are working towards the finalisation and subsequent implementation of the Bank-led Provisional Resolution Plan (BLPRP), to ensure that the carrier emerges as a financially strong and resilient airline,"" it said.
Noting that any airline's financial health is subject to the ebb and flow of the economic environment in which it operates, the statement said a true measure of its strength and quality as a business are its operational metrics.
The statement also mentioned that Jet Airways' network load factor has risen to a high of 87% through December 2018 and January 2019 while flight cancellation rate in December stood at 0.2% -- the lowest among Indian carriers."
706,2019-02-26,State Bank,"The impact of lower GST in the absence of input tax credit, therefore, will vary based on the region and the projectThis is a win-win scenario for developers and buyers, if lower GST can fuel sales

A careful analysis of the reduction in goods and services tax (GST) rate for under-construction real estate projects unveils new challenges for developers.
True, the reduction in rates from 8% to 1% in the affordable housing category, and from 12% to 5% for other categories narrows the gap between completed and under-construction projects. This should fuel demand, as most of the inventory overhang in housing is in the under-construction segment. A Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, citing industry people, pointed out that 88%, 83% and 87% of the unsold inventory in Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR, respectively, were projects under construction. Indeed, this is a win-win scenario for developers and buyers, if lower GST can fuel sales.
But the worry lies in the caveats. First, lower GST rates comes with a bitter pill, which is the withdrawal of input tax credit. Withdrawing credit on inputs implies a pressure on developer margins, unless they pass on the cost (to the extent of the input tax credit withdrawn) to the buyer.
The only option with developers will be to increase the selling price, which may not be possible given the beleaguered state of the sector. A report from SBICap Securities Ltd says: “This is likely to raise the developer’s construction cost (ex-land), by ~18-20%.""
The impact of lower GST in the absence of input tax credit, therefore, will vary based on the region and the project. For instance, projects in Mumbai and Delhi or Gurugram, where land cost is high, may have less pressure on margins, as they can build in the increase in cost into the price. But those in south India, such as Bengaluru, and non-metros such as Pune, where cost of land is relatively lower, and the share of developmental cost is higher, will feel the heat on margins. Based on this, analysts are concerned about the negative impact on profit margins of firms such as Sobha Ltd and Prestige Estates Projects Ltd, which are developing projects at places where land cost is relatively lower.
Two, the big disappointment is that the notification has fixed a cap of  ₹45 lakh in value for a unit classified as affordable, in spite of increasing the carpet area. This excludes a host of projects, especially in the listed realty firms, which may otherwise have gained from the 1% GST on affordable housing projects.
No doubt, the motive to withdraw the input tax credit stems from lack of clarity in calculating the same, given the myriad services and goods that go into a realty project. Adhidev Chattopadhyay, analyst at ICICI Securities Ltd, said: “There have been fence sitters who were waiting for the GST cut on under-construction projects."" The drop in the Nifty Realty index on Monday showed investors preferred to remain fence sitters."
705,2019-02-26,State Bank,"The meeting assumes significance amid differences persisting between Goyal, the lenders and EtihadSBI is the lead lender of a consortium that has extended loans to Jet Airways

NEW DELHI :
State Bank of India (SBI) has called an urgent meeting of lenders with Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal and the domestic carrier's significant shareholder Etihad Airways' CEO Tony Douglas on Wednesday to discuss a way forward for the debt-laden airline, sources said.
The meeting, to be held at SBI's office in Mumbai, assumes significance amid differences persisting between Goyal, the lenders and Etihad, which has 24% stake in Jet Airways.
SBI is the lead lender of a consortium that has extended loans to Jet Airways.
While there was no official word from the airline, as also from the lenders, officials aware about the development said the meeting has been called by SBI and both Goyal and Douglas would be present.
Earlier on Monday, Jet and Etihad said in a joint statement they along with key financial stakeholders are working towards finalisation of bank-led provisional resolution plan for the debt-laden domestic airline.
The two carriers have also expressed confidence that once the plan is implemented, Jet Airways would ""re-emerge as a viable and robust airline to reclaim its rightful place as airline of first choice for its customers"".
The joint statement has been issued by Goyal and Douglas.
Jet Airways, which has been in operation for over 25 years, has been grappling with financial woes and is looking to rejig debt as well as raise funds.
Officials said Goyal is not agreeable to Etihad's demands that he should pledge his shares in the airline as well as in the loyalty programme, Jet Privilege, with lenders to raise funds.
Another bone of contention is that the Gulf carrier wants Goyal to be the sole promoter of Jet Airways but without board representation and management control, sources said.
Besides, there are also differences between the lenders and Etihad, including on the airline's demand it should be exempted from any open offer requirement from Sebi in case its stake in Jet Airways is hiked.
Lenders had originally proposed a rights issue of shares worth  ₹4,000 crore, in which SBI and other banks could have infused  ₹600 crore and NIIF  ₹1,400 crore for shares of the airlines. However, Etihad wants a rights issue worth  ₹5,000 crore while expecting SBI-led lenders and NIIF to bring an additional  ₹1,000 crore.
Etihad wants to restrict its contribution to  ₹1,400 crore. Besides, it does not want to pledge its shares to raise funds and also does not want to be classified as a promoter in the company.
On February 14, Jet Airways board had approved a Bank-Led Provisional Resolution Plan (BLPRP), whereby lenders would become the largest shareholders in the airline. Its shareholders have also approved conversion of loan into shares and other proposals during the Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) last Thursday.
On Monday, SBI had also said no decision has been taken on moving the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Jet Airways.
However, officials associated with the lenders and key shareholders have said SBI was considering various options, including eventually moving the tribunal seeking insolvency proceedings, if other attempts to recover its loans fail to yield desired results.
In their joint statement, Goyal and Douglas had said rising oil prices, a depreciating rupee and market saturation, among other things, have combined to critically impact the civil aviation sector as a whole.
""Some airlines have been hit harder than others; Jet Airways, India’s premier full-service airline, being one of them,"" they said.
The statement further said Jet Airways' network load factor has risen to a high of 87 per cent through December 2018 and January 2019 while flight cancellation rate in December stood at 0.2 percent -- the lowest among Indian carriers.

NEW DELHI :
The NCLAT Tuesday dismissed a petition of the resolution professional of debt-ridden Monnet Power Company against an NCLT order, which had directed the firm to reconsider claims of its operational creditor state-owned BHEL.
A two-member National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) bench headed by Justice S J Mukhopadhaya asked the RP to act in accordance with the directions passed by the Mumbai bench of the NCLT on October 12, 2018, directing it to re-examine the claims of BHEL.
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai had said RP of Monnet Power Company had ""wrongly disallowed the substantial claim in its entirety"" of BHEL, an operational creditor of the company.
""... we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order dated October 12, 2018 passed by the adjudicating authority (NCLT). The 'Resolution Professional' is directed to act in accordance with the directions of the Adjudicating Authority,"" the appellate tribunal said.
""The appeal is dismissed with aforesaid observations and directions,"" it said further.
In the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process of Monnet Power Company, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) had filed an application before the resolution professional to admit the entire claim of  ₹977.49 crore along with interest.
Navneet Kumar Gupta, the RP, did not accept part of the claim, which was contested by BHEL before the NCLT Mumbai.
NCLT Mumbai, while determining inventory cost etc held that RP had wrongly disallowed BHEL's substantial claim and directed him to re-examine the claim on the basis of the accounts and evidence of PSU.
It also said ""if the evidences corroborated the claim, the same should also be taken into account while finalising the total claim of BHEL"".
This NCLT order was challenged by the RP before NCLAT, which, in turn, rejected.
Monnet Power owes around  ₹6,000 crore to a consortium of lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank."

Mumbai: The IAF air strike on JeM camps in Pakistan is a positive for the markets as it illustrates a ""decisiveness"" in foreign policy and increases the chances of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retain power after elections due April-May, say analysts.
The comments come in the wake of concerns shown by investors in the immediate aftermath of the IAF air strikes in Pakistan.
On Tuesday, BSE Sensex and the broader Nifty index fell as much as 1.3% intraday before paring losses to end the day 0.66% and 0.41% weaker.
""We see this panic gap down and any further slide as a buying opportunity which has been the case in past such events as well. And this gives higher odds to the Modi government staying on, post elections,"" Sameer Kalra, an equity research analyst and founder at Target Investing, said in a note Tuesday.
Economists at State Bank of India said the stock markets are likely to gain after the IAF strikes as they will see the action as one that builds a positive deterrence—illustrating a decisiveness in foreign and national security policy.
In a note, SBI economists gave an account of how the markets reacted to the earlier armed conflicts, such as the surgical strike in 2016 and the Kargil war, where Pakistani intruders were pushed back.
During the Kargil conflict between May and July 1999, leading stock indices showed an initial decline but strong recovery thereafter, while after the surgical strike, the Sensex gained 100 points. The rupee too had gained, the SBI note observed.
The SBI report also deemed to suggest that just like the previous actions, conflicts are ""more localised in nature"".
It can be noted that the markets opened in the red Tuesday, after the IAF air strikes in the wee hours of Tuesday. The markets recovered thereafter.
In a swift and precise air strike following the Pulwama terror attack, India Air Force's (IAF's) fighter jets destroyed Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp in Pakistan, killing a ""very large number"" of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders.
The operation, described as a ""non-military, pre-emptive strike"", was welcomed by the entire political spectrum and military experts, who had been advocating retribution after the 14 February Pulwama attack, that killed 40 soldiers of the Central Police Reserve Force (CRPF).
The suicide attack—an explosives-laden car was rammed into a CRPF bus part of a larger convoy travelling to Srinagar from Jammu—was claimed by the Jaish-e-Mohammed."

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd’s founder Naresh Goyal has agreed to step down from the airline’s board as its chairman as part of a plan to secure a rescue deal for the cash-strapped company, a person familiar with the matter said.
Etihad Airways, which owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways, is however still to agree on several proposals put forward by a group of lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI).
The lenders have secured approval from shareholders to convert their unpaid loans into equity and infuse funds after the company defaulted on interest payments. The airline has also failed to pay dues to aircraft leasing firms for months and lessors have grounded 18 of its planes, according to industry sources.
Once the loans are converted into equity, Goyal’s stake in the airline will fall from 51% to around 22%, while that of Etihad will halve to 12%.
At a meeting held in Mumbai on Wednesday to discuss the future of Jet Airways, lenders led by SBI and Etihad failed to agree on several issues, said two people familiar with the matter, including the person cited above.

Jet Airways, Etihad and SBI did not immediately respond to queries.
A senior Jet Airways executive said on the condition of anonymity that the management hopes that the banks-led resolution plan is implemented at the earliest.
“Once the resolution plan is implemented and fresh funds are infused into the airline, we can expect it to stand back on its feet again and perhaps take advantage of the lower oil prices to turn around operations,"" the executive said.

Mumbai: In one of the biggest deals in the Indian life insurance sector in recent years, global private equity firm Carlyle Group on Friday said it has acquired a 9% stake in listed insurer SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd from BNP Paribas Cardif SA. According to SBI Life Insurance’s closing stock price on Friday, the 9% stake is worth around  ₹5,500 crore.
Shares of SBI Life closed at  ₹612.25 apiece, up 5.47%. The last major deal in the life insurance space was in August 2018, when a consortium of Westbridge Capital, Madison Capital and Rakesh Jhunjhunwala agreed to acquire Star Health and Allied Insurance Co. Ltd for around  ₹6,000-6,500 crore. 
“The life insurance industry in India has strong growth potential thanks to favourable demographics and an increasing focus on financial savings. SBI Life, led by a strong management team, is helping deliver this promise in the life insurance space and is well-positioned to further benefit from industry trends,"" said Sunil Kaul, managing director and head (South-East Asia) at Carlyle Asia's buyout advisory team.
Following this transaction, French insurer BNP Paribas Cardif and Carlyle now own 12.8% and 9% of SBI Life, respectively. State Bank of India (SBI) remains the majority shareholder with a 62.1% stake.

Carlyle’s trust in the company will further strengthen our resolve to enhance our leadership position in India’s life insurance industry,"" said Sanjeev Nautiyal, managing director and chief executive of SBI Life.
Mint had in September 2018 reported that BNP Paribas is looking to sell part of its stake in SBI Life. The stake sale was part of a move to bring down the stake held by promoters to 75%, as per Sebi laws for listed companies that mandate minimum public shareholding of 25% within three years of listing.
SBI Life went public in September 2017 in an initial public offering (IPO) that saw the two promoters—state-run lender SBI and BNP Paribas—collectively sell 12% stake, with SBI selling 8% and BNP Paribas Cardif 4%.
The IPO valued the company at  ₹70,000 crore.
The Carlyle deal comes at a time when PE interest in the insurance sector is high, with investors buying both minority and majority stakes in a host of insurers.
Earlier this week, homegrown PE firm True North acquired a controlling stake in health insurer Max Bupa Health Insurance Co. Ltd for over  ₹500 crore. The deal valued the insurer at  ₹1,001 crore.
Last year, Royal Sundaram General Insurance Co. Ltd sold 40% of its stake to Ageas Insurance NV of Belgium for  ₹1,520 crore, Mint reported in November last year. PE firm Warburg Pincus Llc acquired a 26% stake in IndiaFirst Life Insurance Co. Ltd for around $100 million in June.
Carlyle has invested in the financial services industry in Asia Pacific for 20 years, deploying more than $4 billion of equity in more than 15 PE investments, as of 31 December. In India, Carlyle’s recent investments in financial services include PNB Housing Finance Ltd and SBI Card.

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd promoter Naresh Goyal’s son Nivaan Goyal, who has been playing an active role in negotiations with lenders, is likely to be inducted into the cash-strapped airline’s board of directors, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Mint.
Nivaan Goyal is likely to be elevated as a board member soon, said the person who asked not to be identified, adding that Jet Airways lenders and shareholder Etihad Airways PJSC have supported the elevation.
“Lenders don’t want a situation where only they have to deal with Etihad. This is why they supported Nivaan’s elevation to the board,"" the person said, adding that Nivaan Goyal could be elevated to the executive director’s position in the board in the coming days.
Nivaan Goyal has led Jet Airways delegation for meetings with lenders on the last two occasions, the latest being on 27 February, when lenders were informed that founder Naresh Goyal had agreed to step down from the airline’s board as its chairman as part of a plan to secure a rescue deal for the company.

“The bank-led provisional resolution plan is very critical to the long-term viability and sustainability of our Jet Airways and would provide in due course, a funding package,"" Naresh Goyal said in a letter to Jet employees sent on Friday.
“While a few steps remain, some critical steps are behind us and the remaining approval processes are well underway. I assure you that I am personally working this situation as rapidly as possible,"" Goyal said.

Jet Airways has been struggling with cash flows for more than six months because of higher fuel costs and intense competition. It has defaulted on interest payment to lessors, airport operators, oil marketing companies, and a part of its staff.
Shareholders last week approved the Jet Airways bailout plan, which would allow lenders to convert their debt into equity. The approval will now allow lenders to become majority stakeholders and infuse funds in airline.
However, the airline continues to face a cash crunch. In a stock exchange notification on 27 February, Jet Airways said that lessors have grounded six more aircraft because of non-payment of dues. Two more aircraft were grounded on Friday, the Press Trust of India reported, taking the total number of planes grounded to at least 21.
“...the company is actively engaged with all its aircraft lessors and regularly provides them with updates on the efforts undertaken by the Company to improve its liquidity. Aircraft lessors have been supportive of the company’s efforts in this regard,"" Jet Airways said.

NEW DELHI :
After a nudge from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to lower their marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) following a cut in the repo rate, at least five banks have already reduced interest rates by 5-10 basis points while other banks are likely to follow suit soon.
India’s largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), which has shied away from revising its MCLR, reduced interest rates for home loans of up to  ₹30 lakh by 5 basis points (bps) last month.
During the day, state-owned Bank of Baroda (BoB) announced that it will cut its benchmark lending rate by 0.1 percentage points with effect from March 7. BoB's MCLR for overnight and one-month tenors would be 8.25% and 8.30%, respectively.
During the last few days, Punjab National Bank (PNB), Allahabad Bank, Kotak Mahindra and Union Bank of India have also cut their MCLR.
With effect from March 1, state-owned PNB has reduced the MCLR by 0.10 percentage point for loans of various tenors. The interest rate on one-year tenor loans, against which most of the bank's consumer loans are benchmarked, has been cut to 8.45% from 8.55%, while the three-year MCLR has been cut to 8.65%.
Union Bank of India (UBI) has similarly reduced its lending rate by 10 bps. The state-run bank’s one-year MCLR or the minimum lending rate, against which most consumer loans are benchmarked, has been decreased to 8.60% from 8.70%.
Unlike PNB, UBI has also lowered its base rate by 10 bps to 9%.
Allahabad Bank has also cut its MCLR by 10 basis points for all loan tenures up to three years.
Among private sector banks, Kotak Mahindra Bank has lowered its lending rate by 5 basis points, taking its new one-year MCLR to 9%.
IANS reported today that four other PSU banks and a private bank are in the process of announcing rate cuts.
In its bi-monthly policy review last month, the RBI had cut the key repo rate by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Citing higher credit cost due to massive NPA piles and the resultant churning of margins, banks have, however, been reluctant in passing the benefit of RBI rate cuts to borrowers. Mint had reported last month that the heads of public and private sector banks have sought time from RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das to pass benefits of the RBI repo rate cut to borrowers."
692,2019-03-05,State Bank,"RBI tightened banks' SWIFT requirements after $2 billion  PNB fraudFines represent a stern signal, says CARE Ratings

Mumbai: India's central bank has fined at least 19 lenders, including top banks such as ICICI Bank and State Bank of India, for failing to comply with its guidelines on the use of global payments network SWIFT.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed the fines over the past four days, according to stock exchange filings by the banks, though specifics of the non-compliance were not disclosed.
Four bankers whose institutions were fined said that most of the issues related either to interpretation of the RBI's guidelines or minor technical matters.
""These are petty, procedural issues like counterparty confirmation and nothing major or structural,"" said one banker who is directly aware of the matter but declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The penalties totalled more than Rs. 40 crore ($5.67 million) and ranged from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 4 crore for each bank, the filings showed.
The Indian banking system was sent reeling early last year by a $2 billion fraud at state lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) , resulting from unauthorised credit guarantees to businesses linked to billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi via SWIFT.
""The series of fines imposed is a stern signal from RBI to banks to strengthen their internal systems and minimise fraud after the PNB fraud last year, which tarnished the image of India's banking system,"" said Mitul Budhbhatti, associate director and head of banking, financial services and insurance at CARE Ratings.
""I expect RBI to continue to be more and more vigilant and continue with such monitoring.""
After the PNB loan fraud, which prompted criticism of the RBI by the government for its lack of regulatory oversight, the central bank had sent a confidential directive to banks about how they must use the SWIFT payment system, requiring most banks to overhaul their financial systems.
Most notable among those rules was the requirement for banks to connect the SWIFT interbank messaging system with their core banking software by 30 April last year.
However, gaps in compliance were found in more than two dozen places, prompting the RBI to impose the fines.
The RBI had conducted the audits at banks 8-10 months ago and issued show-cause notices four months ago. Since the notices were issued, banks have plugged those holes, bankers said.
""After the show-cause notices were issued to us, we have addressed those minor points,"" said one banker."
695,2019-03-05,State Bank,"The airline will use the money primarily to fund its core businessesAccording to the latest loan documents, Jet Airways has given “first and exclusive” rights on all its FDs to SBI for securing the loan

Crisis-hit Jet Airways (India) Ltd has pledged its fixed deposits (FDs) with various banks, totalling  ₹1,500 crore, to borrow  ₹225 crore from the State Bank of India (SBI), loan documents reviewed by Mint show.
The airline has the option to borrow more from SBI with the same FDs as security.
The airline decided to borrow against the FDs rather than redeem them because the deposits continue to earn a higher interest than what Jet has to pay to SBI, a person aware of the loan transaction said on condition of anonymity.
Since 8 February, lessors have grounded at least 23 planes because of non-payment of rent. In the past few months, Jet has struggled to pay dues to banks, vendors, lessors and employees, and has seen a series of credit ratings cuts. It has recorded losses of more than  ₹1,000 crore in each of the previous three quarters, and is expected to post a loss in the March quarter too.
“Banks were reluctant to sanction a term loan to Jet Airways without gaining exclusive rights on the airline’s interest-yielding cash deposits or appreciating assets or equity share pledges,"" the person cited above said. “Finally, SBI agreed to disburse a term loan after Jet Airways allowed the bank to pledge all its FDs with exclusive rights. Jet Airways may raise more capital from banks and stakeholders as part of the overall resolution plan.""
A negative net worth and several credit rating cuts have forced what was once India’s premier private airline to borrow against FDs, usually the last resort for companies facing liquidation risks or having no creditworthy assets.
Lenders typically demand secured assets with assured returns only when they suspect the borrower’s ability to repay the loan or the company has no other income-yielding asset or has all other assets pledged for other loans.
According to the latest loan documents, Jet Airways has given “first and exclusive"" rights on all its FDs to SBI for securing the loan.
SBI has given Jet Airways the term loan at an interest rate of 6.25%, to be repaid by 29 April 2019. According to the loan documents, Jet Airways will have to pay a total of  ₹250 crore to SBI by the time the loan is repaid. The loan was sanctioned after the agreement was signed on 31 January.
Jet had a total debt of  ₹9,610.16 crore as of 31 December. The carrier had a negative net worth of  ₹10,370.24 crore on that date.
Ratings company Icra Ltd has downgraded Jet Airways’ credit ratings in September, October, December 2018 and January 2019.
Emails sent to Jet Airways and SBI remained unanswered.
“The money will be used by the airline primarily to fund its core businesses, which include cost of flying, parking and paying salaries to the staff, and avoid further grounding of aircraft,"" said the person cited earlier.
According to the loan agreement, SBI has the right to take all benefits of the FDs and their accrued interest incomes, if the airline fails to repay the loan. SBI, the biggest lender to Jet Airways, said on 17 January that the airline’s lenders were considering a plan to resolve its debt issues. Mid-February, Jet Airways, after several attempts at finding help to rescue the carrier, approved a bailout plan aimed at making its lenders the largest shareholders and fixing a near  ₹8,500 crore funding gap.
On 23 February, its board approved the conversion of some of the debt into equity, resulting in founder and chairman Naresh Goyal’s holding falling from 51% to below 20%.
On Friday, Goyal agreed to step down from the airline’s board and surrender his directorial powers.
The airline’s defaults and rising expenses on account of higher jet fuel costs and increased competition in the private civil aviation space have forced it to scrap on-board freebies it used to offer to its passengers earlier."
694,2019-03-05,State Bank,"It is unfair to pass on investment risk, while retaining the power to make decisions

An investment product that offers guaranteed return doesn’t evoke much curiosity among investors about how the seller manages to give that guaranteed return. Those with a conservative investment appetite bring home the promise and sleep in peace. So when an insurance plan guarantees return of capital, you don’t ask the insurer how it’s going to invest the money. Or when the Employees’ Provident Fund (EPF) promises to declare a guaranteed rate of interest every year, you don’t ask what the actual return is on the portfolio. That’s because the risk and responsibility lies with the manufacturer. Using that line of thinking, the entities too don’t disclose their investments. But what happens when the investment risk shifts to the customers? Disclosure and choice become paramount and are no longer an option that manufacturers of products can choose to ignore. If you are bearing the risk, it’s only fair that you are in charge.
It’s unfair to pass on investment risk to a customer, while retaining decision-making, without making portfolio disclosures or giving the customer a say. It is like blindfolding the driver of a vehicle, where the risk of crashing is real but you can’t see where you are going.
Portfolio disclosure in market-linked products, therefore, is mandatory and most of these products, including the National Pension System (NPS) and unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips), across the financial industry give customers the flexibility to choose and switch their investment funds. EPFO, however, offers neither choice nor disclosure. In 2015, when EPFO decided to put a portion of your money in the stock market, it essentially shifted the risk of investment to you, but has fared badly on the metrics of disclosure and choice.
The authority decided in 2015 to park 5% of the incremental corpus with two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) of SBI Mutual Fund: SBI ETF Nifty 50 and SBI ETF Sensex. An ETF is a basket of securities that tracks the stock prices of the companies on an underlying index, and is traded on the exchanges. Being a passive fund, it not only comes with a much lower expense ratio but also obviates the fund manager risk. While the decision of passive investment is sensible given that EPF is a mass product—the NPS also was originally designed to participate in the stock market through the passive route—the choice of the fund manager did raise some questions. For EPFO, the choice was not merit based but comfort based. In fact, then EPF commissioner K.K. Jalan had told Mint (bit.ly/2EtS9oJ) that since SBI was their sole banker and they didn’t have time to come out with a tender to finalise the asset management company, the authority decided to go ahead with SBI Mutual Fund.
Given the large assets under management (AUM) of the ETF portfolio of SBI Mutual fund and the fact that these ETFs have one of the lowest tracking errors, the choice probably makes sense, but for EPFO the investment strategy to stick to state-run mutual fund company is due to their comfort zone and that hasn’t changed—subsequently, EPFO also invested in ETFs of UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd.
Sticking to comfort doesn’t make sense when you have passed on the risk of investment to the customers as other metrics such as costs become relevant and there are other ETFs in the market that charge less. But EPFO doesn’t seem to be addressing these questions. If anything, it’s moving deeper into its fixation for PSUs. In 2017, it decided to also invest in PSU ETFs through CPSE ETF and Bharat 22 ETF. While it helps the government with its disinvestment programme (former EPF commissioner V.P. Joy told Mint earlier that EPFO invested in these ETFs at the behest of the finance ministry; read more at bit.ly/2GUpPyA), this move appears to be at the cost of subscribers’ interest. 
Of course, many of the subscribers (EPFO has a subscriber base of more than 60 million who have contributed at least once in the last one year) don’t know that the money is being invested in PSU ETFs, but what’s worse is that this has been counterproductive for subscribers who despite being the biggest stakeholders have no say in the matter. Both CPSE ETF and Bharat 22 ETF have underperformed the Nifty ETF and Sensex ETF. In fact, most financial planners advise caution against investing in these funds. Read more at bit.ly/2GRl7Ct and bit.ly/2UfV22W. So it’s unclear why EPFO will choose to park your money in these ETFs and not give you any choice on funds or fund managers.
The only silver lining is the fact that EPFO has still not been able to unitize the investments it has made in the stock market even though it has increased the allocation from 5% to 15% of the incremental corpus that the authority gets every year. For you this means that the entire corpus under EPF will earn a guaranteed rate of return—for FY19 the rate has been hiked to 8.65%—even as 15% of it is parked in equities. But once the system is in place and 15% of the incremental corpus becomes market linked in the truest sense, EPFO must be ready to pass on choice to the customers and for that it needs to look out for options on the basis of merit. Much like the NPS that looks for fund managers who can operate on wafer thin costs, looking for AMCs that can offer ETFs at lower expense ratios is a good starting point.

691,2019-03-06,State Bank,"The funding will help Punjab Renewable Energy Systems (PRESPL) scale the business and expand into other geographiesPRESPL is Neev Fund’s 10th investment and its fourth in the renewable energy sector

Mumbai: Neev Fund, an infrastructure private equity fund, on Tuesday said it has invested an undisclosed amount in Punjab Renewable Energy Systems Pvt. Ltd (PRESPL).
The fund is managed by SBICAP Ventures Ltd, the alternative asset management business of SBI Capital Markets Ltd. Its mandate is to invest in eight low income and  developing states in India with a focus on infrastructure sub-sectors such as renewable energy, agricultural supply chain, healthcare, education, and urban infrastructure.
PRESPL is an end-to-end biomass value chain management company involved in collection, processing, storage and supply of agricultural residues such as paddy straw, cotton-stalk, soya-husk, maize-cob, and mustard stalk to biomass-based power plants and processing industries such as pharmaceuticals, distilleries, and sugar.
The company provides biomass as a raw material to clients for generation of bio-energy or for conversion into biofuel. It handles the supply of more than 1,000 metric tonnes of biomass per day.
“This will help us scale the business and expand into other geographies, especially India’s less developed states. We particularly welcome Neev’s laser sharp focus on ESG (environmental, social and governance) aspects of business that will help us grow the company into a world class institution,"" said Lt. Col Monish Ahuja (retd), managing director of PRESPL. “We are confident that with this investment, we will be able to maintain our leadership position in the biomass supply chain...""
This will be Neev Fund’s 10th investment and its fourth in the renewable energy sector.
“Surplus biomass can be used by power plants to produce power and new generation refineries to produce bio-ethanol. However, continuous availability of biomass remains a challenge. PRESPL will address this market barrier by guaranteeing biomass supply throughout the year... This ties in closely with Neev Fund’s vision for development,"" said Manav Bansal, chief investment officer of Neev Fund."
690,2019-03-06,State Bank,"Nivaan Goyal (and not Naresh Goyal) represented Jet Airways during bailout talks with lendersNivaan Goyal has been working in various roles in Jet Airways since 2016 to learn the ropes

Mumbai: For years, Naresh Goyal, founder and chairman of Jet Airways (India) Ltd, would lament that none of his two children—a son and a daughter—were interested in joining his airline business. Now, hit by a series of crises, the Mumbai-based carrier has turned to his son, Nivaan Goyal, to take a bigger role in the company founded by his father a quarter of a century ago, according to several people—including former employees, industry peers and friends.
For instance, it was Nivaan Goyal, who led the Jet Airways team in its last two meetings with a group of lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) in Mumbai in the past few weeks.
“I saw Nivaan Goyal (and not Naresh Goyal) representing Jet Airways during its negotiations with the lenders in the last two meetings in February,"" said a senior banker, requesting anonymity. “It seems that he is being given a bigger role in the company,"" the banker said.
To be sure, Nivaan Goyal has been working in various roles in Jet Airways since 2016 to learn the ropes, said a Jet executive, requesting anonymity. Prior to that, Nivaan Goyal, now in his mid-20s, spent over a decade studying in London.
His potential elevation to Jet Airways board comes at a time when a bailout plan proposed by the lenders has been approved by the board as well as shareholders. The bailout package proposes to meet a funding gap of nearly  ₹8,500 crore in the airline. The lenders have also received approvals to convert their loans into equity.
The restructuring exercise will also see a drop in Naresh Goyal’s stake in Jet Airways from the current 51% and him relinquishing the chairman’s post.
Jet Airways is battling a squeeze on cash flow caused by higher costs and intense competition. This has led it to default on interest payment to lenders as well as lessors, and vendors like airport operators and oil marketing companies.
It has also delayed payment of salaries to some staff.
Jet Airways had gross debt of  ₹8,411 crore as of end-September.
“Mr Goyal told me at a dinner a few years ago that his children were not interested to join his airline,"" said an executive at another airline, who did not want to be identified. “Nivaan’s induction into the airline’s board of directors means that Mr Goyal will still be calling the shots through a proxy,"" the person said.
Naresh Goyal, who built Jet Airways from scratch, is considered by peers, employees, friends and rivals as someone who’s shrewd and hardworking, and extremely smart with financials.
He is also someone who had complete control while running his airline, and didn’t give much space to either 24% stakeholder Etihad Airways PJSC or his managers to run the airline independently—at least, until recently.
“He (Naresh Goyal) is extremely strong on the P&L (profit and loss) side of his business but has his limits when it comes to divisions like MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) operations, and pilot and flight operations. So, he has hired some of the best talents in these divisions,"" said a former employee of Jet Airways, requesting anonymity.
“Goyal (and his wife) had a say in everything that happened in Jet Airways—from the selection of cutlery, to the planes,"" the person added.
An aviation consultant, requesting anonymity, said Jet Airways’ downward spiral started with the emergence of Gulf carriers, about a decade ago, and the mushrooming of domestic competition from budget airlines like IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd).
A legend in the aviation world, Naresh Goyal, practically camped at telecom ministry for days during early 1990s to get permissions to set up telephone lines at his airline counters in New Delhi and Mumbai.
He also remains very popular among his employees for connecting with them on a personal basis. For instance, Goyal is said to have personally supported cancer treatment and dialysis of family members of his employees.
However, Jet Airways has delayed salary payments to a section of staff, including pilots, who are yet to get a portion of their December salary and salaries for the following months.
“I think a large part of the goodwill Mr Goyal had generated among his staff has been eroding of late, with the airline delaying salaries to its staff,"" said the airline executive mentioned above.
Naresh Goyal had last week sought support of his employees and assured them that the current situation will ease by 18 March.
“Towards this, I commit to you personally from my heart, that I am prepared to make any sacrifice to ensure your future comfort and prosperity, viability of the airline and in fact welfare of all the employees of the company,"" he wrote in the letter.
His letter to his employees came at a time when Jet Airways has shrunk its operations as lessors grounded several aircraft due to non-payment of dues, leading to multiple flights being cancelled.
Aviation consultant CAPA India expects uncertainty surrounding Jet Airways to be temporary. “(We) expect the restructuring and recapitalization package to be formalized soon, which will start the process of stabilization at Jet,"" Kapil Kaul, chief executive and director of CAPA South Asia, said recently."

NEW DELHI :
Air safety regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Thursday said Jet Airways has been instructed to use only ‘air worthy’ aircraft totally fit for flying and to ensure that passengers do not suffer because of flight cancellations.
DGCA B.S. Bhullar said that the regulator was watching the situation of grounding of aircraft and flight cancellations on a day-to-day basis and was working with the airline to ensure passenger safety and convenience.
The company has been advised to give the regulator ample notice of flight cancellations in order to make changes in flight schedules. In case of last minute cancellations, the airline has been advised to make other arrangements for the passengers either within the airline or with other airlines, civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said in response to a question at a briefing on the ministry’s performance.
Jet said in an update of its operations to stock exchanges on Thursday that it has grounded three more aircraft since 4 March due to non-payment to lessors . “The company is actively engaged with all its aircraft lessors and regularly providesthem with updates on the efforts undertaken by the company to improve its liquidity,"" Jet stated. It said that aircraft lessors have been supportive of its efforts in this regard.

688,2019-03-07,State Bank,"A year ago, there was much more excitement in the marketplaceBanks are working towards recovering the maximum from their assets through the IBC process

The initial euphoria over the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) Act has now faded, though the IBC has changed the way promoters looked at their liabilities, according to top industry voices at the Mint India Investment Summit.
A year ago, there was much more excitement in the marketplace, said Kalpesh Kikani, managing director and senior partner at AION Capital. The IBC cases were just being resolved, with the first dozen at the fag end of this process. “A lot more realism has now set in,"" said Kikani.
Things have not resolved as fast as people had predicted, but one should not judge IBC based on these last 12 months, said Kikani. “The fact that section 29A is here to stay has indeed played out how promoters approached the post-IBC era and, therefore, pre-IBC deal-making has increased.""
Banks are working towards recovering the maximum from their assets through the IBC process, said others.
Banks are able to recover maybe  ₹60 where they have lent  ₹100 in case of good companies, but much less in the case of other companies, said Vishal Gupta, senior vice president, SBI Capital Markets. “First you have to discover the price and then run a Swiss challenge method and we are doing this in quite a few cases—a fair and transparent process. Each case is different and, therefore, you cannot have a standardized process and will have to tweak it,"" he said. Under the Swiss challenge method, an initial bidder gets a chance to match later bids.
Shantanu Nalavadi, managing director, India Resurgence Fund (India RF), lauded the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) 12 February circular, saying it was a phenomenal step to push banks towards recognizing stress. “That coupled with section 29A of IBC has shown results,"" said Nalavadi. Some people, however, highlighted some of the shortfalls of the mechanism.
India has made a lot of progress on IBC regulations, but it is still pockmarked with a lot of issues and the more recent judgements by courts have probably done a little bit of harm to the process and its efficiency, according to Srini Sriniwasan, managing director and chief executive officer, Kotak Investment Advisors.
He pointed out that in a few of these cases, there are a number of operational challenges.
If one goes back to the start of the IBC, everyone had predicted that the first year would be historic and the second and third would see some suspect judgements, said Aniruddha Sen, partner at Trilegal.
“Most of the stress in India is more in the capital intensive sector that is where you need somebody to run and operate. This is not a passive investor role and section 29A makes it more complex,"" said Manish Agarwal, partner and head, special situations group at KPMG India."

Singapore: FLY Leasing Ltd has grounded three planes on lease to India's Jet Airways Ltd and will take them back and redeploy them elsewhere if the airline cannot gain approvals for a restructuring plan this month, the lessor's CEO said.
Jet Airways on Thursday said another three aircraft had been grounded due to its failure to make payments, taking the total number to 28, but it has not specified the lessors involved.
The grounding of nearly one-quarter of the airline's fleet has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and complaints from customers on social media.
Several major global aircraft leasing companies, including AerCap Holdings NV and BOC Aviation, have exposure to the financially troubled airline, which has defaulted on loans and has not paid pilots, leasing firms and suppliers for months.

""We have grounded our aircraft, we have control over our aircraft, but we have not terminated the leases and we are waiting for the airline to approve all its restructuring with the State Bank of India,"" FLY Leasing CEO Colm Barrington told analysts on a results call on Thursday.
""If that goes through at the end of the month, obviously, we will stay with Jet. If they can't get that done, then we'll take our aircraft back and redeploy.""
The airline had three relatively young Boeing Co 737-800s on lease to Jet Airways, which accounted for around 3% of FLY Leasing's revenue, he said.
Jet Airways, promoted by Naresh Goyal, has outlined a draft to sell a majority stake to a consortium led by the State Bank of India (SBI) at  ₹1, under regulations that permit banks to convert debt to equity in a defaulting firm.

New Delhi: In a setback to Punj Lloyd Ltd, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday admitted an insolvency plea against the engineering and construction firm filed by ICICI Bank Ltd. A two-member principal bench headed by president Justice M.M. Kumar has admitted the lender's plea to initiate insolvency proceedings against Punj Lloyd for a default of  ₹853.83 crore.
Confirming the development, Punj Lloyd said in a regulatory filing that the company was waiting for the copy of the full order to provide further details.
""We hereby inform you that NCLT Principal Bench, New Delhi vide order pronounced on March 8, 2019, has admitted the petition filed by ICICI Bank under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 in respect of an alleged default amount of  ₹853.83 crore,"" Punj Lloyd said in the filing.
ICICI Bank had in June 2018 filed an application before NCLT against Punj Lloyd alleging default by the company. However, at that time, its other lenders—including the State Bank of India—opposed the insolvency plea, saying that the company has several ongoing projects and favoured restructuring of its debts.
Punj Lloyd has total debt of around  ₹6,000 crore, of which ICICI Bank accounts for around  ₹854 crore.

685,2019-03-08,State Bank,"SBI savings account rates and interest rate on a few loans will now change as and when RBI changes its repo rateWhile home loan rates will still be determined by MCLR, rates are expected to fall as savings deposit rates have substantial weightage while determining MCLR

MUMBAI :
Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday linked its interest rate on savings account with balance above  ₹1 lakh and short-term loans to Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) repo rate, effective 1 May 2019. This means that savings account interest rates and interest rate on a few loans will change as and when the regulator changes its repo rate.
The RBI repo rate currently stands at 6.25%.
According to an SBI statement, the bank will link savings accounts with deposits over  ₹1 lakh to repo rate at current effective rate of 3.5% (2.75 percentage points lower than the current repo rate of 6.25%). All cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh will also be linked to the benchmark policy rate, plus a spread of 2.25%—amounting to 8.5%.
SBI will charge a risk premium on these loans, over and above the floor rate of 8.5%, based on the risk profile of the borrower, similar to the current practice.
According to SBI's managing director P.K. Gupta, 40-45% of the bank's deposit will be affected by this move. While home loan interest rates will still be determined by the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate, or MCLR, rates are expected to fall as savings deposit rates have a substantial weightage while determining MCLR.
“Home loan customers will soon see better rates as we are moving a chunk of our liabilities to the external benchmark rate, affecting a pass-through of policy rate cuts,"" said Gupta over the phone.
Bankers have always maintained that linking their asset portfolio to an external benchmark would require them to link their liabilities to an external benchmark as well to avoid asset liability mismatch.
In order to make the loan pricing process transparent, RBI has over the years directed banks to price their loans against their benchmark prime lending rate, base rate, and, finally, MCLR. But in December 2018, RBI asked banks to price their loans against an external benchmark.
RBI said banks are free to decide on the external benchmark: it could be the repo rate, 91-day treasury bill yield, 182-day treasury bill yield or any other benchmark market interest rate produced by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd (FBIL), including the Mumbai interbank offered rate, or MIBOR.
FBIL, jointly owned by Fixed Income Money Market & Derivative Association of India, Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India and the Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), was formed in 2014 as a private limited company. Its aim is to develop and administer benchmarks relating to money market, government securities and foreign exchange in India.

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank on Friday said it has imposed penalties worth  ₹71 crore on 36 public, private and foreign banks for non-compliance with various directions on time-bound implementation and strengthening of SWIFT operations.
SWIFT is a global messaging software used for transactions by financial entities. The massive  ₹14,000-crore fraud at the PNB was a case of misuse of this messaging software.
The banks include, Bank of Baroda, City Union Bank, HSBC, ICICI Bank, SBI and YES Bank.
The penalties, ranging from  ₹1 crore to  ₹4 crore, were imposed by orders dated 31 January, 2019, and 25 February, 2019, the RBI said in a statement.
It, however, added that penalties are based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and ""is not intended"" to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the banks with their customers.
The RBI had carried out an assessment of compliance with its directions on implementation and strengthening of SWIFT-related operational controls of 50 major banks.
The assessment, the RBI said, revealed that banks had not complied with one or more of the major direction pertaining to direct creation of payment messages in the SWIFT environment and introduction of an additional layer of approval for all payment messages exceeding a particular threshold, among others.
Based on the findings of the assessment and extent of non-compliance, notices (SCNs) were issued to 49 banks advising them to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with directions.
""After considering the replies received from the banks, oral submissions made in the personal hearings where sought by the banks, and examination of additional submissions, if any, RBI decided to impose monetary penalty on aforementioned 36 banks, based on the extent of non-compliance in each bank,"" the Central Bank said.
Penalty of  ₹4 crore each has been imposed on Bank of Baroda, Catholic Syrian Bank, Citibank N.A., Indian Bank and Karnataka Bank.
The penalty on BNP Paribas, City Union Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, and United Bank of India, is  ₹3 crore each.
The amount is  ₹2 crore each in case of Allahabad Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Canara Bank, DCB Bank, Dena Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, and Syndicate Bank.
Penalty of  ₹1 crore each has beeN slapped on Bank of America, Barclays Bank Plc, Central Bank of India, Corporation Bank, DBS Bank, Deutsche Bank A.G., HSBC, ICICI Bank and IDBI Bank.

MUMBAI :
A day after State Bank decided to link its short-term loans and large savings deposits rates to the repo rate, chairman Rajnish Kumar Saturday said loans and deposits below  ₹1 lakh will continue to be linked to the present MCLR to protect retail customers from market vagaries.
In a first, the nations largest lender had Friday said from May 1, it would link its savings accounts with deposits over  ₹1 lakh and all cash credit accounts and overdrafts or short term loans with limits above  ₹1 lakh or short-term loans, to the repo rate, which currently is at 6.25 %.
At present some banks like Kotak Mahindra, Yes Bank, RBL Bank and Singaporean lender DBS Bank pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 % on savings deposits regardless of the balance, while large players like SBI and other state-run lenders, and private players like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others pay 4 % per annum.
From May 1, the savings bank deposits with balance above  ₹1 lakh will earn an interest of 3.5 %, 2.75 % lower than the repo rate and lower amounts in balance will earn 4 %.
The bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 %.
""The category which we have linked to the external benchmark is the best category--all cash credits and overdrafts above  ₹1 lakh. Here also, for accounts with  ₹1 lakh and below, we've kept out of the purview as we believe that retail customers should not be forced to suffer from the market vagaries,"" Kumar told reporters on the sidelines on event organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
He also said, across the world, retail loans are not left to the market forces alone when it comes to pricing and that it is mostly corporate accounts that are left to the market conditions.
He also said the move is in accordance with the RBI guidelines on the MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rates) and other loan pricing norms.
Kumar said SBIs retail loans are currently priced as per MCLR and the system is working well and will continue to be remain so.
""Retail loans will continue to be linked to MCLR for the time being. If the loan is long-term in nature, you cannot re-price it very frequently...that way MCLR is a good solution,"" Kumar said.
He said by linking savings bank deposits rate to the repo rate, MCLR will get adjusted automatically as and when there is a change in the repo rate.
He, however, said MCLR will not move by 25 bps if there is a similar reduction by the RBI in the repo rate.
""It will depend on what portion of our savings banks gets repriced and its consequent impact on MCLR. To that extent the MCLR will get repriced,"" Kumar said.
Currently, the bank is offering a rate of 3.50 % for savings bank deposit rates up to  ₹1 crore, and 4 % above  ₹1 crore.
As much as 33 % of its savings account-holders will get the benefit of the new pricing system, the bank said.
On the thorny issue of swift monetary transmission, Kumar said liabilities are mostly fixed for banks and transmission on the asset side alone cannot happen.
""Transmission cannot happen only on one side. If transmission has to happen it has to happen on both sides and that is why SBI came out with this solution that the deposits savings bank account with 1 lakh and above, we will link it to repo rate and all the working capital loans which are theoretically payable on demand.
Talking about NCLT clearing ArcelorMittal's  ₹42,000-crore bid for Essar Steel rejecting the  ₹54,389 crore offered by a company run by the Ruias of Essar group, Kumar said they are awaiting the final order.
""The written order is yet to come. But our stand as well as that of the committee of creditors is that we abide by the order. The final process of the resolution of Essar Steel began with the NCLT order yesterday,"" he said.
Kumar said in the case of Jet Airways, whatever is the resolution plan, it will be implemented if all the conditions by all stakeholders--Naresh Goyal, lenders, Etihad and approval from the government, are met.

It is tempting to buy a new car, be it an upgrade, a first car or another car for the family. Whatever be the reason, a car loan makes the purchase easier. Car loans are usually of 3-5 years but some lenders may offer loans for up to 7 years too.
A loan for longer may mean smaller equated monthly instalments (EMIs), which makes the car seem more affordable, but overall, you pay more as interest. Don’t forget that a car is a depreciating asset, so taking a bigger loan may not be the best thing to do.
But if you take a car loan for a short duration, the EMIs will be heavy and non-payment will mean a blot on your credit report. Conditions apply to the loan amount also. For instance, some lenders give a loan for the full ex-showroom price of the car, while others may offer a loan up to 80%. Apart from the interest rate on a car loan, also take a look at the applicable processing fee and other charges."

679,2019-03-11,State Bank,"RBI data shows the main overnight lending rate offered by banks has been sticky in a range of 8.15% to 8.55% since the beginning of the yearMost banks have trimmed lending rates by a token 10 basis points

Indian lenders haven’t fully passed on the central bank’s latest interest rate cut to borrowers, pressuring the monetary authority to loosen policy even more to support economic growth.
A mismatch between deposits and credit growth, and competition from the government for small-savings mean banks face a high cost of capital, limiting their ability to transmit monetary policy easing. Bankers say the Reserve Bank of India’s 25 basis-point reduction in the repurchase rate to 6.25 percent in February was a start, but was probably too little to have any impact on lending rates just yet.
Latest data from the central bank shows the main overnight lending rate offered by commercial banks has been sticky in a range of 8.15 percent to 8.55 percent since the beginning of the year. Most banks have trimmed lending rates by a ‘token’ 10 basis points, said Ashutosh Khajuria, chief financial officer at Federal Bank Ltd. in Mumbai, adding that the RBI needs to move by a bigger-than-usual 50 basis points to spur lending.
“If it is a 50 basis points cut, it will be an accelerated transmission,"" Khajuria said. “If inflation behaves the way it has been,"" rates will certainly go down in the first quarter of the next financial year starting April.
Subdued Inflation
Calls for rate cuts have been building, given benign inflation and weak demand. Inflation has been subdued at about 2 percent, much lower than the central bank’s medium-term target of 4 percent. The latest inflation data is due on Tuesday, with economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecasting consumer prices to rise 2.4 percent.
Shaktikanta Das, the new RBI governor, has been trying to nudge bankers to lower lending rates, holding meetings with bank chiefs last month to discuss the monetary policy transmission. In India, rate adjustments take about six to nine months to work its way through the economy.
The State Bank of India, the country’s largest bank, Friday linked some of its deposits and and short-term loans to the repurchase rate. Its managing director P.K.Gupta told Bloomberg Quint that a quarter percentage repo rate change will have an impact of 7-10 basis points on the bank’s floating lending rate.
Most bankers remain cautious though and “are not willing to cut rates as deposits and household financial savings are at historical lows,"" said Prachi Mishra, chief India economist at Goldman Sachs India Securities. “Even while policy rates are down, the rates paid by the government on small savings are significantly higher than bank deposit rates.""
Savings programs offered by the government through post offices return between 7 percent and 8 percent annually along with tax benefits, while a one- to two-year time deposit with the State Bank earns an interest of 6.8 percent.
Bank deposits are also growing at a slower pace than loans, putting pressure on commercial lenders to offer attractive rates to lure depositors and boost resources to lend, analysts say. While bank lending has been growing at more than 14 percent year-on-year as of February, deposit growth has been a laggard at 10 percent, according to central bank data.
“We believe the monetary transmission in terms of banks’ lending and deposit rates will be partial and delayed due to a wide gap between credit and deposit growth,"" said Tanvee Gupta Jain, an economist at UBS Securities India Pvt.
The problem is unlikely to go away soon, posing a headache for banks already struggling with soured loans and tight financial conditions.
“When you’re thinking of mobilizing deposits, you can’t cut interest rates. The entire problem on monetary policy transmission lies there,"" said Khajuria of Federal Bank.

Mumbai: Etihad Airways PJSC, which owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways (India) Ltd, has set several conditions before its next round of proposed investment in the cash-strapped airline. The infusion of fresh funds, will, however, be subject to approval from the Etihad board of directors.
According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the Jet-Etihad deal, 15% of the total share capital of Jet Airways loyalty programme, Jet Privilege Pvt. Ltd, pledged by Jet Airways to HSBC as security for a $150 million loan, will have to be made available to Jet Airways.
Etihad has also sought completion of the  ₹4,000 crore interim financing as per terms agreed upon by Etihad, Jet Airways founder and chairman Naresh Goyal and a group of lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI), before it makes a fresh investment in the Mumbai-based carrier.
“As part of the interim financing, lenders shall infuse  ₹750 crore into the company. Etihad will procure funding for the company, either itself, or from an offshore or onshore lender, for an amount equivalent to lender’s financing, i.e.,  ₹750 crore, as soon as reasonably possible,"" the document said.
This will be subject to obtaining necessary approvals from Etihad Airways board of directors, regulatory clearances, and valid creation of a pledge for not less than 34.9% of the total issued equity share capital of Jet Privilege in favour of the lenders and Etihad ""on a pari passu basis"".
A copy of the MoU, dated 8 March 2019, has been reviewed by Mint.
The Gulf-based carrier's board met in Abu Dhabi on Monday evening to discuss the Jet-Etihad deal, among other things.
Other conditions include issuances undertaken by Goyal and lenders to forego and renounce their pro-rata entitlement of participation in the rights issue, and for Goyal to limit his shareholding to 22%.
Besides, Goyal and Etihad will also need to agree to support the final resolution plan led by the lenders.
A Jet Airways bailout plan proposed by the lenders has already been approved by the Jet Airways board, as well as shareholders. The bailout package proposes to meet a funding gap of nearly  ₹8,500 crore in the airline. The lenders have also received approvals to convert their loans into equity.
The fresh fund infusions and conditions attached to them will require approvals from the civil aviation ministry, Competition Commission of India (CCI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
Etihad said it will extend lease of three slots at London’s Heathrow airports to Jet Airways for 16 years at market rates, subject to the usual terms and conditions.
Etihad and Goyal will also support Jet Airways in obtaining release of dues from credit card companies and the International Air Transport Association (Iata), besides negotiating with vendors and lessors to ensure an extension of the lease agreement.
“As a minority shareholder, Etihad continues to work constructively with Jet Airways board, management team and other stakeholders,"" an Etihad spokesperson said.
Jet Airways and SBI did not respond to emailed queries till the publishing of this story.
Jet Airways is battling cash flow issues due to higher costs and intense competition. This has led it to default on interest payment to lenders and lessors, besides vendors such as airport operators and oil marketing companies. It has also delayed salary payments to a section of staff.
Jet Airways had gross debt of  ₹8,411 crore as of end-September.

676,2019-03-12,State Bank,"The move will only affect SBI savings account holders with a balance above  ₹1 lakhStarting 1 May, SBI will link savings bank deposits above  ₹1 lakh and short-term loans like overdraft with RBI’s repo rate

In a major development that could eventually lead to significant improvement in interest rate transmission for consumers, State Bank of India Ltd (SBI) on 8 March announced the linking of savings bank account deposits and short-term loans to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) repo rate. RBI had in December asked banks to link all new floating rate retail loans like home loans with an external benchmark from 1 April 2019. The central bank is yet to issue the final guidelines in this regard.
The current SBI move will not only affect its customers, but also customers of other banks in general as it could define the way deposit and lending rates will be fixed in the future. Here’s what this means for you.
The SBI move
Starting 1 May, SBI will link savings bank deposits above  ₹1 lakh and short- term loans like overdraft with RBI’s repo rate. This is the rate at which the central bank lends money to banks, when the latter face shortage of funds. RBI reviews, but not necessarily changes, the repo rate in every bi-monthly monetary policy.
With SBI linking rates for such deposits and loans to the repo rate, the change will be automatically transmitted. For instance, if the RBI cuts its repo rate by 25 basis points or bps, the interest rate for your savings bank account having over  ₹1 lakh will come down by 25 bps. One bps is a hundredth of a percentage point. At the same time, the interest rate you were paying on a short-term loan like overdraft or cash credit will also come down by 25 bps.
In its bi-monthly policy meeting in February, RBI cut the repo rate to 6.25%, which is likely to come down further as a rate cut is widely expected in April. SBI currently gives a 3.5% interest for savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 crore. After the latest linking of this rate with the repo rate for deposits over  ₹1 lakh, the effective rate remains at the same level of 3.5%, which is 2.75% below the current repo rate. The mark-down is fixed by the bank.
For short-term loans of over  ₹1 lakh, a spread of 2.25% over the repo rate will be charged, taking the floor rate to 8.5% currently, which is very close to the current marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) at 8.55%. The actual rate charged from you, the customer, will also include a risk premium based on your credit profile, like it is currently done.
According to P.K. Gupta, SBI’s managing director, about 98% of the bank’s savings account holders will not come under this repo rate-linked interest rate as the balance in these accounts is less than  ₹1 lakh. However, in terms of value, about 80% of the savings account deposits will be covered, he added.
For the bank, this move is expected to improve the asset-liability management. Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Care Ratings Ltd, called it a smart move by SBI. “Deposits have not been growing at an adequate pace for banks. So one issue was how do you get more deposits converted from savings bank deposits to fixed deposits. The latest move by SBI is in a way telling customers to convert their savings account deposits into term (fixed) deposits to get a fixed rate if they have over  ₹1 lakh in their accounts. It will improve their asset-liability management because some short-term deposits will get converted into medium term deposits,"" he said.
What it means for you
If you are an SBI savings account depositor with over  ₹1 lakh lying idle in the account, you will lose out if repo rates go down further. “In that case, I will gain if I move that money to a fixed deposit,"" Sabnavis said.
If you are not an SBI customer, you will not be directly impacted by this change. However, the move is being seen as an important development, and could lay the foundation for determining interest rates on loans like home loans when they are linked to external benchmarks.
Gupta said, with this move, a significant portion of the bank’s balance sheet, both on the assets and liabilities sides, will be linked with the policy rate, which will mean that the transmission will happen automatically whenever the policy rate changes. “In the process, a lot of loans will get benchmarked to the external benchmark. We will link other loans as well with the external benchmark over a period of time. Let us see how this experiment goes,"" he said.
Over the past many years, banks have been reluctant to pass on the rate cut benefits to borrowers but have passed on the cut to depositors faster. Similarly, in case of policy rate hikes, banks have been observed to keep the deposit rates low, while increasing the interest rates on loans. 
While RBI is yet to issue final guidelines on external benchmarking of floating rate retail loans, the new system adopted by SBI will also have a bearing on MCLR that helps determine interest rates for other loans like home loans.
MCLR goes down when banks’ cost of funds reduce, and that happens when deposit rates are lowered. Sabnavis said that the only way for banks to reduce their cost of funds is by reducing the cost of deposits. “Changing the deposit rate is completely under the bank’s control. Linking deposit rates with the repo rate will automatically have a direct impact on the overall cost of funds of the bank. As it happens automatically, the transmission will also be smoother,"" he said.
However, banks have been unable to reduce rates on fixed deposits as doing that could slow down deposit collection which could further impact their lending capacity. “Despite a recent cut in repo rate, banks were struggling to reduce their lending and deposit rates as the deposit accretion continued to lag credit growth. Cutting deposits rate was not a feasible option for banks amid slowing deposits growth,"" said Anil Gupta, sector head, financial sector ratings, Icra Ltd.
For SBI, savings account deposits make 38% of the total deposits and a 25 bps reduction in the interest rate on these deposits could lead to a 7-10 bps reduction in the bank’s MCLR, said P.K. Gupta. Interest rates paid on deposits—savings as well as fixed—are an important variable in the calculation of the cost of funds of a bank.
More banks are expected to follow in the footsteps of SBI and adopt this practice of pricing deposits with an external benchmark. “We expect more banks especially all public sector banks and a few large private banks to follow the move by linking their deposit and lending rates to repo rate which will also be in line with RBI requirements to link these rates to external benchmarks,"" Anil Gupta said.
It now needs to be seen when the external benchmarking of retail loans like home loans comes into effect, as the implementation could make loan pricing much more transparent."

Mumbai: Indian stocks hit fresh 2019 highs on Monday after opinion polls predicted that the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) is likely to form the next government.
The BSE Sensex rose 382.67 points, or 1.04%, to 37,054.10, while the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty gained 1.2% to 11,168.05. The indices are now at a six-month high.

“Since many stocks are available at cheap valuation, investors rushed to high quality mid- and small-caps to participate in the pre-election rally,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services Ltd.
BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices gained more than 1.5%, as investors scooped up beaten-down stocks with reasonable valuations.
Investor sentiment has revived, with mid- and small-caps rallying in the last few weeks, said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research (wealth) at Centrum Broking Ltd. “The markets have seen broad-based robustness, with buying interest visible across sectors. FIIs have continued their relentless aggressive buying, triggering a pre-election rally. February and March 2019 have seen FII inflows to the tune of  ₹20,000 crore.""
“As border tensions appear to have cooled off, and global central bankers turned pro-liquidity, Indian markets are in risk-on mood,"" he added.
After several months of aggressive selling, FIIs have returned to India, on hopes of easing monetary policy and a stable central government. According to Sebi data, FIIs bought $2.37 billion in stocks in February, their biggest purchase since November 2017. However, there was a slowdown in domestic liquidity, which was driving the markets, while foreign funds were away. Net flows into equities, including those linked to savings scheme funds, fell to  ₹5,122 crore in February after hitting a 24-month low of  ₹6,158 crore in January, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India.

677,2019-03-12,State Bank,"Private banks have over the past five years eaten into market share of public sector banks in savings depositsSBI, on account of its sheer size, may be able to protect its base, but its peers will suffer, should they choose to follow

India’s largest bank has bitten the bullet on making interest rates more pliable to changes in policy rates. State Bank of India (SBI) has linked the rate on the stickiest of its products, savings bank deposits, to the benchmark repo rate. The change applies to deposits exceeding  ₹1 lakh in value.
It is natural that when SBI’s cost of deposits comes down, so would lending rates. Ergo, the regulator’s complaints on poor transmission seem to have been addressed.
SBI’s move to link its savings rate to the policy rate, at a time when the probability of an RBI rate cut is high, makes smart business sense. Margins may improve immediately and the fact that savings deposits are sticky will ensure SBI doesn’t lose its customers.
Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities note that the difference between the current savings rate and the estimated repo rate-linked one has narrowed in recent times. “A variable interest rate does not necessarily mean a negative outcome for the customer as well,"" the firm said in a note.
In any case, the understanding is that savings accounts are a function of convenience and habit more than interest rates. But it may not be so simple and linear an argument.
The chart above shows that over the last five years, private banks have eaten into the market share of public sector peers in savings deposits. Incremental deposits are going to the likes of Kotak Mahindra Bank and Yes Bank, which offer higher interest rates than the 3.5% given by the remaining lenders.
Last week, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said in a television interview that 95% of its customers will not be impacted. However, by value, roughly one-third of the lender’s deposit base is estimated to get linked to the repo rate. That is because 80% of its savings deposits, which form 40% of its total deposits, will fall in the category of above  ₹1 lakh, an SBI official told BloombergQuint.
Large savings deposits can be traced to high net worth individuals and corporations. They are not as sticky as the rest of the crowd. SBI’s market share in savings deposits has largely remained unchanged over the last decade.
The same cannot be said about its peers. Public sector banks have lost a massive 2.58 percentage points market share over the last five years and private banks have gained 5.54 percentage points. SBI, by the sheer size of its franchise, may be able to protect its base, but its peers will suffer, should they choose to follow.
The move towards market benchmarking of deposit rates has begun. It would be interesting to see if the historic trend of stickiness persists, or if public sector lenders become big losers."

But this comes at a time when Jet Airways (India) Ltd and market leader InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (which runs IndiGo) have cancelled flights because of financial troubles and pilot shortage, respectively. Incrementally, the ban is expected to have an impact on supply and eventually cause fares to rise.
In India, two aviation companies, SpiceJet Ltd and Jet Airways, have the 737 Max 8 fleet. SpiceJet has 12 operational Max 8 aircraft, representing 20%-plus seat capacity. The beleaguered Jet Airways has five.
IndiGo and Jet Airways were already estimated to have cancelled 100-plus daily flights, said Santosh Hiredesai, analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd. The ban could add 70-80 more cancellations, he said. “According to the current ongoing winter schedule, the number of daily departures in the domestic market is estimated at ~3200. In keeping with that, these cancellations amount to about 5% of capacity and should further drive tightness in the market, taking up fares and pulling down growth rates,"" said Hiredesai.
Analysts say IndiGo is set to benefit the most from this development given its size. The airline enjoys a domestic market share of more than 40%. Besides, it doesn’t have any Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. Its shares rose 2% on Wednesday.
Having said that, it is too early to quantify the impact on the profitability of SpiceJet. Investors would do well to closely monitor the extent of the ban in terms of its duration. More clarity on any compensation clauses applicable to airline operators will also help.
However, SpiceJet investors are jittery. “For SpiceJet, should the issue prolong, it could result in loss of profits in the impending peak season for the industry, but expect some compensation though from the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) depending on the agreement,"" pointed out Hiredesai.
SpiceJet is scheduled to take delivery of more of these aircraft. So far this week, its shares have dropped by 7.6% on BSE.
On the brighter side, amid all this, relatively lower crude oil prices will provide much-needed respite for all aviation companies in this quarter."

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank on Thursday said SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank will have to comply with additional capital requirement norms by April 1 as the banks continue to remain 'too big to fail' lenders, referred to as D-SIB or domestic systemically important bank.
SIBs are subjected to higher levels of supervision so as to prevent disruption in financial services in the event of any failure.
""The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs has already been phased-in from April 1, 2016 and will become fully effective from April 1, 2019. The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer,"" the central bank said.
The additional CET1 core capital requirement in case of the State Bank of India applicable from April 1 has been prescribed at 0.6% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) while for the other two banks it is 0.4%.
The Reserve Bank had issued the Framework for dealing with D-SIBs in July 22, 2014. The D-SIB framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these banks in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).
Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.
SIBs are seen as 'too big to fail (TBTF)', creating expectation of government support for them in times of financial distress. These banks also enjoy certain advantages in funding markets.

671,2019-03-15,State Bank,"Etihad Airways' board not prepared to meet Jet Airways bailout terms proposed by lenders led by SBIAnother contentious issue is Naresh Goyal's demand for removal of the perpetuity clause that caps his shareholding to 22%

Mumbai: Etihad Airways PJSC is unlikely to agree to a provisional debt resolution plan proposed by lenders for the crisis-hit Jet Airways (India) Ltd, said two people directly aware of the development. A meeting of the board of Etihad in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday remained inconclusive, with several members expressing reservations about the terms proposed by the lenders that included adding two nominee directors from the promoter group of Jet Airways, led by founder Naresh Goyal, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
“Another contentious issue was Goyal’s demand for exclusion of the perpetuity clause, which capped Goyal’s shareholding to 22%,"" said one of the two people cited above.
The provisional pact envisaged a “new investor"" injecting between  ₹1,600 crore and  ₹1,900 crore for about 20% in Jet Airways and the Goyal-led promoter group’s stake falling to 17.1%, with a caveat seeking to cap it at 22%.
An early resolution to the financial woes is crucial for Jet Airways. More than 50 of the airline’s 119 planes are currently grounded by lessors due to non-payment of lease rentals, while it has delayed salaries to pilots and interest payments on its debt.
According to the proposed agreement, the consortium of lenders, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), will convert its dues into shares and pump in an additional  ₹1,000 crore to raise its stake to 29.5%. Etihad was also expected to infuse between  ₹1,600 crore and  ₹1,900 crore to raise its shareholding to 24.9%.
The exact details would be known once a deal is finalized.
“Etihad may still consider a rescue plan and the board is expected to meet again to discuss revised terms,"" said the first person cited earlier.
Mint reported on 12 March that Goyal had written to Etihad seeking an emergency cash infusion of  ₹750 crore. In a letter that was reviewed by Mint, Goyal cited Jet Airways’ financial stress that had led several of its lessors to ground planes due to non-payment of dues.
In a separate letter on 8 March to Tony Douglas, group chief executive officer of Etihad Aviation Group, Goyal sought dropping of the perpetuity requirement of capping promoter shareholding to 22%.
Jet Airways and SBI did not respond to emailed queries. A spokesperson for Etihad said the airline “does not comment on rumour or speculation"".
Meanwhile, Jet Airways said on Thursday it would be unable to repay $140 million of external commercial borrowings (ECB) of HSBC Bank UAE. The repayment obligation falls this month, with Jet Airways originally expected to make the repayment through two tranches on 11 March ($31 million) and 28 March ($109 million), respectively.
“Jet Airways is currently facing severe liquidity constraints and is working through a bank-led resolution plan for its revival,"" Jet Airways said in an 11 March letter to HSBC Bank Plc (UK), which was reviewed by Mint. “Pending the implementation of measures listed in BLPRP (bank-led provisional resolution plan), we wish to inform you that the company is unable to pay Tranche A of $31 million falling due to repayment today,"" it added. Etihad is the guarantor of the $140 million ECB facility raised by Jet Airways from HSBC Abu Dhabi.
Jet Airways, which is facing a severe cash crunch, had defaulted on a domestic loan repayment in December. According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, lenders must find resolution to cases pertaining to defaulting companies—such as Jet Airways—within 180 days of their first default.
If the case remains unresolved, the company has to be referred to a bankruptcy court. Jet Airways had first defaulted on a scheduled interest payment to domestic lenders on 31 December.
The airline had a gross debt of  ₹8,411 crore as of September-end.
Etihad holds a 24% stake in Jet Airways, while promoter Goyal and his family own a controlling 51% stake. Etihad has lost $1.28 billion in 2018, the third straight year the state-owned long-haul carrier has lost over a billion dollars. Since 2016, Etihad has lost a total of $4.75 billion, as its strategy of aggressively buying stakes in airlines from Europe to Australia didn’t reap the desired benefits.
In 2017, Etihad had to write off its investments in Air Berlin and Alitalia.
Meanwhile, oil prices, which drive West Asian economies including that of Abu Dhabi, have settled from their historic highs of over $100 a barrel to $65-70 a barrel. This has further restricted investment capabilities of West Asian carriers and its state-owned airlines.
On Thursday, Jet Airways shares fell 1.54%, or  ₹3.70, to  ₹236.90 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex ended little changed at 37,754.89 points."

Mumbai: Lenders to crisis-hit Jet Airways (India) Ltd were hopeful of arriving at a resolution within the next one week, a senior State Bank of India (SBI) official said on the condition of anonymity.
“In next one week you should have something. Any SBI stressed asset resolution plan will be a comprehensive plan as we do not believe in patchworks,"" the banker said, adding that the resolution process started in November.
Asked if lenders were concerned about the delay in the resolution process of the Jet Airways crisis, the banker said since lenders were making all efforts led by SBI to keep the airline running. “It is not because our (SBI’s) account will become NPA,"" he said.
“Any resolution plan for a corporate is a very complex process and things do not happen in one or two days. There are various stakeholders and you have to align and take care of all of them—lenders, promoters, JV partners.""
The contours of the resolution plan were very much in place, but lenders have to tie-up couple of loose ends, he added.

Mumbai: In a first, State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, has linked savings account deposit and short-term loans to an external benchmark rate—repo rate. Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends to commercial banks. From 1 May, savings bank deposits with balances above  ₹1 lakh will be linked to repo rate (6.25%) minus 2.75% with an effective saving account rate of 3.50% per annum. In case of lending, all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above Rs1 lakh will be linked to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25%—to 8.50%. The bank also mentions that the risk premiums over and above the floor rate of 8.50% would be based on the risk profile of the borrower.
Will deposit and loans be impacted directly?
According to Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI, only 5% of the customers will be impacted from the change. “Our 95% customers will have stability of the interest rate. The impact will be only for individuals with deposits over  ₹1 lakh and above. The impact on number of credit customers will be more. No retail accounts will be impacted. Only wholesale or corporate account will see a change. The variable rate becomes applicable only to the running account which is cash credits and over drafts,"" said Kumar.
The bank believes that retail customers should not be exposed to market risk and they need stability in interest rate, hence, in order to insulate the small deposit holders and small borrowers from the movement of external benchmarks, SBI has decided to exempt savings bank account holders with balances up to  ₹1 lakh and borrowers with CC or OD limits up to  ₹1 lakh from linkage to the repo rate. “Retail customers should not be exposed to the market risk. Corporates can always hedge and plan their cash flows better. Home loan borrowers are more concerned about the stability of their EMI (equated monthly instalment). If their EMI fluctuates with repo rate, it will not work,"" said the SBI chairman.
You will indirectly see a benefit
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is currently considering whether to do away with marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) and link all loans to external benchmark rate. SBI’s move to link certain loans to repo rate will indirectly bring down your loan rates linked to MCLR but the quantum will be lower. “Due to the repo rate linkage, MCLR will see an impact though not by straight 25 bps because we take weighted average cost of fund. But there will be a movement of 5-10 bps in MCLR on both side. The quantum will be less,"" said Kumar. The impact is due to the substantial weightage of savings deposit rate on MCLR."

India’s largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) today announced the launch of YONO Cash using which customers can withdraw money from ATMs without using a card.
SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the new initiative will address concerns over using debit cards at ATMs for cash withdrawals by eliminating the possible associated risks. “This feature on YONO is designed to help its users withdraw cash without a physical debit card,"" he said in a statement, adding that it also maximizes convenience and enhances the banking experience for its customers.
SBI said that transactions using YONO will be secured with two-factor authentication and will also eliminate the risk of skimming and cloning.
SBI customers can initiate the cash withdrawal process on the YONO app and set a six-digit pin for the transaction. They will also get a six-digit reference number for the transaction on their registered mobile numbers via SMS. The cash withdrawal has to be completed within the next 30 minutes at an ATM using both the PIN and the reference number.
ATMs enabled for this service will be termed YONO Cash Point, the bank said in a release.

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and the process involved is simple. But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset. The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.
Here are some of the lowest personal loan interest rates offered by various banks."
666,2019-03-19,State Bank,"Bank deposit growth has been falling even though real rates have risen, because of the drop in retail inflation Unless Indian households warm up to deposits again, banks will find it difficult to cut rates as warranted by RBI

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has struggled for more than a decade trying to ensure that policy rate changes end up getting reflected in bank lending rates. Fed up with banks unwilling to play ball on lending rates, the central bank has changed the math behind loan rates thrice in the last decade.
How banks calculate their loan rates could change yet again this year, if RBI goes ahead with a proposal to link them with external benchmarks.
But this time, the math is not the central bank’s only problem. The growing currency in circulation is a greater risk at present, given the implications on liquidity. The fact that it has far exceeded deposit growth makes the problem bigger. Analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd point out that currency in circulation as a proportion of deposits is back to pre-demonetisation levels and higher than the average in the past 25 years.
Falling deposit growth and rising cash among Indians are twin blows to liquidity in the banking system. Edelweiss’s analysts expect financiers to be more aggressive in seeking deposits. In fact, they say rates may even move up, which is a risk to banks’ margins.
Deposit growth has been falling even though real rates have risen, because of the drop in retail inflation. This is hardly surprising. Average Indians don’t sit and look for real returns. What they see is nominal deposit rates and this has fallen sharply.
The weighted average term deposit rate has dropped by 100 basis points in the last three years.
Unless Indian households warm up to deposits again, banks will find it difficult to cut rates. “Transmission of policy rates will have to be accompanied by a fall in deposit rates,"" said Saugata Bhattacharya, chief economist at Axis Bank Ltd. He added that the recent move of State Bank of India to link its savings rate to the repo rate could give some room to lower lending rates.
But this could be a one-off since term deposits form as much as 60% of banks’ total deposits, and hence any cost benefit that finds its way to loan rates needs a cut in term deposit rates.
Meanwhile, as cash continues to flow out of banks, market rates could also remain elevated. Currency in circulation grew at a brisk 17.9% year-on-year in February.
The drain on liquidity has made RBI buy government bonds to pump in money incessantly. RBI has also added an unusual tool of forex swaps to its liquidity management arsenal lately.
Ironing out cyclical wrinkles of liquidity is easy but what about the long term? Surely, RBI cannot infinitely keep buying bonds or even dollars to keep the rupees coming in.
Unless deposit growth bounces back or the currency leak from banks slows down, the central bank will have a tough battle to prod the lenders and the market to bring down borrowing costs should it decide to cut rates in April."

New Delhi: Banks are likely to infuse fresh funds into cash-strapped Jet Airways (India) Ltd, provided major shareholders of the airline, including Gulf carrier Etihad Airways PJSC, pledge their shares as collateral, said people aware of the matter. With the airline unable to get fresh funds, the options are limited now, they added.
Jet Airways is grappling with acute financial woes that has resulted in grounding of a significant number of planes, defaulting on debt repayments	and delay in payment of salaries to pilots and other senior officials.
Founder chairman Naresh Goyal and his family owns around 52% stake in Jet Airways while Etihad, a strategic partner, has 24% shareholding.
According to the people quoted above, banks can provide further loans if major stakeholders—Goyal and Etihad—agree to pledge their shares as security.
A consortium of lenders, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), is working on a resolution plan for Jet Airways, which has a debt burden of more than  ₹8,200 crore. Goyal has agreed to pare down his shareholding to 22% as part of securing a deal to bailout the airline.
Last week, a senior SBI official expressed hope that a Jet Airways bailout should be finalized in a week or so.
On  14 February, Jet Airways board approved a bank-led bailout plan whereby lenders would become the largest shareholders in the airline. Following approval from the shareholders, part of debt would be converted into 11.4 crore shares at a consideration of  ₹1 apiece as per the RBI norms.
Since January, Jet Airways has defaulted thrice on payments to its debenture holders.
So far, the finance ministry has maintained arm's length in the matter due to its commercial nature and creditors and debtors are working on the resolution plan, according to people.
On Tuesday, Jet Airways shares fell 3.35% to  ₹229.05 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.70% to end the day at 38,363.47 points."

New Delhi: A crisis at Jet Airways (India) Ltd deepened on Tuesday as an increasingly worried government called for an emergency meeting, angry passengers demanded refunds and pilots threatened to go on strike over unpaid salaries.
Civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu asked his officials to call for a meeting to discuss grounding of flights, advance bookings, cancellations, refunds, and any potential safety issues, at the cash-strapped carrier.
Saddled with debt of more than $1 billion, Jet Airways is struggling to stay aloft. It has delayed payments to banks, suppliers, pilots and lessors—some of whom have started cancelling their lease deals with the airlines.
The groundings have forced Jet Airways to cancel hundreds of flights, some at the last minute, leaving passengers stranded. Many have taken to social media to voice their angst.
Jet Airways is currently operating only 41 aircraft, just a third of its original fleet, the aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), said in a statement, adding that the situation is fluid and the airline may be forced to reduce its fleet further in coming weeks.
Several angry passengers were seen demanding pending refunds for cancelled flights at Jet Airways' offices in Mumbai earlier on Tuesday, a source told Reuters.
The airline's pilots union has also said that pilots have decided to stop flying from 1 April if Jet Airways does not have a rescue plan in place by 31 March and does not provide a proper roadmap on paying their overdue salaries.
""It is not about the salary right now, it is about whether we are going to survive,"" one pilots told television news channel ET Now.
Jet Airways did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The 25-year-old airline is in talks with its lenders—state-run banks led by State Bank of India (SBI)—and its biggest shareholder, Abu Dhabi-based carrier Etihad Airways PJSC, to secure a rescue deal but talks have dragged on and it is struggling to finalise a plan.
While on the surface Jet Airways' future still hangs in the balance, there has been behind-the-scenes support from the government indicating that a bailout is likely, Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday.
The government has asked state-run banks to rescue the privately held airline without pushing it into bankruptcy, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to avert thousands of job losses weeks before a general election, people familiar with the matter have said.
DGCA said that with the current fleet, Jet Airways is likely to operate only about 985 flights a week or 140 flights a day—down from an average of about 650 flights a day in March 2018.
The regulator also said that Jet Airways' pilots, cabin crew and ground staff who have reported any kind of stress should not be put on duty, and the airline should carry out regular maintenance of its aircraft even if they are currently grounded.
Prabhu, in a separate statement on Tuesday, asked officials to continuously monitor the situation at Jet Airways and ensure that public interest and safety are given top priority."

Meanwhile, shares of Jet Airways (India) Ltd fell for a sixth session out of the last seven on continued financial woes. More than half of its aircraft fleet is grounded due to non-payment of dues to lessors and several defaults. As on Wednesday, the airline had only 41 planes in operation, down from its original fleet of 119 aircraft.
Reports of Etihad Airways PJSC planning to exit Jet Airways and its loyalty programme—Jet Privilege—are exacerbating the crisis. The government has asked state-run banks to rescue Jet Airways without pushing it into bankruptcy.

NEW DELHI :
Bankruptcy is the ""last option"" for Jet Airways, State Bank of India's (SBI) chairman said on Wednesday, adding that it might still be possible to draft in a new investor to keep the airline flying.
""We believe it is in everybody's interest that Jet Airways continues to fly,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters after meeting government officials, adding that placing Jet into bankruptcy would mean grounding the airline.
The SBI chief said that a resolution plan is ""almost"" ready and that it would not involve a bailout for any individual, including the airline's founder and chairman Naresh Goyal.
Jet has more than $1 billion in debt, and owes money to banks, suppliers, pilots and lessors - some of whom have started terminating leases with the carrier.
The government has asked state-run banks, led by SBI, to rescue Jet without pushing it into bankruptcy, two people within the administration have told Reuters as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to avert thousands of job losses weeks before a general election.
Talks with Etihad Airways, Jet's largest shareholder, to secure a rescue deal are also ongoing, the SBI chief said, adding that the Abu Dhabi-based airline has not ""conclusively"" decided to exit the venture.
""There are certain conditions they want fulfilled and that is that the airline should be professionally managed and without interference,"" Kumar said.
Etihad had earlier said that if it were to invest more money then the Jet's founder Goyal must step down and take a less prominent role.
A senior finance ministry source, who was at the meeting, said that lenders to Jet are trying to revive the airline by changing the management, which includes Goyal.
Goyal agreed this month to step down as chairman and reduce his stake from 51 percent, sources told Reuters, in order to secure a rescue deal for the airline he established 25 years ago.
PUBLIC BAILOUT
India's opposition Congress party earlier held a press conference during which its spokesman alleged that Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was using state-run banks like SBI to bail out a bankrupt, private airline.
This came a day after Reuters reported how the government is playing a crucial behind-the-scenes role to rescue Jet.
""On one hand, (the) Modi government is seeking to privatise Air India and on the other hand they are buying a bankrupt private airline with public money,"" Randeep Singh Surjewala, a spokesman for the Congress party, said.
The government has urged state-run banks, led by SBI, to convert debt into equity and take a stake in Jet, which would however be ""transitory"", in a rare move in India to use taxpayer money to save a struggling private sector firm.
Kumar, however, said that any decision taken to rescue Jet is a commercial one and is not at the direction of the Indian government. He was speaking after a meeting with officials from the prime minister's office and finance and civil aviation ministries to discuss the rescue plan.

A brand is simply trust, proclaimed Steve Jobs once.
The statement has gathered huge momentum today, when more and more consumers engage with brands on the internet. Although the internet has its own set of perks when it comes to reaching out to customers, it also raises a question mark on brand authenticity.
How, then, do brands go about gaining customers’ trust in the digital era?
The same was taken up for discussion at the eighth edition of HT Brand Studio Live—a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more.
This episode marked the Mumbai Chapter of Brand Studio Live, where the show was webcast from the iconic BSE instead of the HT newsroom.
Speaking at the session on Tuesday, Pankaj Gupta, chief marketing officer and head of strategic alliances, credit life, speciality sales and government business, HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “There are three trust elements that every brand needs—transparency, customer-centricity, and reliability.""
Trust is especially crucial in the financial services sector because of the monetary and emotional investments involved. According to the 2015 Edelman Trust Barometer, banking and financial services are the least trusted of industries, compared to technology, consumer electronics, or food/beverages.
“If people trust you with their savings of a lifetime, then your responsibility level automatically goes up several notches,"" said Asha Kharga, chief marketing officer at Axis Bank.
For Kharga, the “human quotient"" also plays an important role in gaining a customer’s trust. “Always humanize a brand. In the banking industry, the human touch is still important,"" the ace marketer said.
Shankar Jadhav, managing director, BSE Investments Ltd, highlighted how “timeliness"" also matters in the financial services sector.
“Trust is built in the financial services sector if you are prompt in letting people know of all developments,"" he said, while also outlining how BSE—which is the world’s fastest stock exchange—contributed towards the growth of the Indian economy.
Venkat Mallik, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Tidal7 Brand Digital, however, pointed out that brand relevance matters as much as brand trust in the digital era.
“A lot of brands have lost value not because people lost their trust in them, but because they have lost relevance,"" he said, adding that brand relevance begins with “making conversations with people that matter.""
In the same vein, Sharad Mathur, head (sales and distribution) at SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “Today, customers are well-informed and intelligent; they expect as well as cherish interactions with a brand. They leave queries for companies online, and expect them to be answered immediately.""

Mumbai/New Delhi: Etihad Airways PJSC has offered to sell its entire 24% stake in Jet Airways (India) Ltd to State Bank of India (SBI), a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, even as the government held an emergency meeting on Tuesday to discuss the unfolding crisis at the cash-strapped Indian airline.
Etihad chief executive Tony Douglas on Monday met SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar in Mumbai to discuss the Jet Airways bailout plan prepared by a group of lenders.
“Tony Douglas tabled the exit proposal yesterday (18 March). (He has) asked SBI to buy Etihad’s 24% stake at  ₹150 per share, or about  ₹400 crore (for the full stake),"" said the person cited above, requesting anonymity.
The person said Douglas has also asked SBI to consider buying Etihad’s 50.1% stake in Jet Privilege Pvt. Ltd, the frequent flyer programme of Jet Airways.
SBI and Jet Airways did not respond to emailed queries.
“As a minority shareholder, Etihad is working closely with Indian lenders, the company and key stakeholders to facilitate a solution for Jet Airways,"" a spokesperson for Etihad said on email.
Etihad bought its 24% stake in Jet Airways in 2013 for $379 million, or about  ₹2,060 crore at the time.
The Abu Dhabi-based airline’s stake in Jet Privilege has an estimated value of $600 million, the person said, adding that the carrier had also asked SBI to take over the guarantee provided by Etihad for a  ₹1,000 crore external commercial borrowing facility raised by Jet Airways from HSBC Bank, Abu Dhabi, a few years ago. The airline founded by Naresh Goyal recently defaulted on repaying this loan facility.
On Tuesday, some of Jet Airways’ pilots threatened to go on strike from 1 April unless salary dues were paid by March-end, PTI reported.
The civil aviation ministry, which held an “emergency meeting"" to discuss the crisis at the airline, has asked Jet Airways to avoid last-minute flight changes, keep its planes airworthy and take care of customers affected by flight cancellations.
The airline has only 41 planes currently, down from its original fleet of 119 planes.
“It is a dynamic situation and there may be further (fleet) attrition in the coming weeks,"" the ministry said in a statement. Jet Airways has scheduled 985 weekly flights, including 382 international flights, with the current fleet. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) was closely monitoring the situation, the statement said.
With SBI suggesting last week that the Jet Airways bailout plan could be in place within a week, the government has given the lenders a free hand to take a call on the resolution plan, said a government official, requesting anonymity.
On Tuesday, Jet Airways shares fell 3.35% to  ₹229.05 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.70% to end the day at 38,363.47 points."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI), the largest lender to cash-strapped Jet Airways (India) Ltd, has asked the airline’s chairman Naresh Goyal, his wife and two other nominee directors to step down immediately, even as the bank said it was in the interest of lenders to revive the distressed carrier. SBI has asked Goyal, his wife Anita, and two nominee directors, Nasim Zaidi and Gaurang Shetty, to step down from the board as well as executive roles, a person aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.
In New Delhi, after a meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said that lenders to Jet Airways would make every effort to keep the airline from slipping into bankruptcy as it would further erode the company’s value.
SBI’s commitment to the revival of Jet Airways comes a day after the government took stock of the airline’s operations and advised it to take care of customers affected by flight cancellations. The airline now flies only 41 of the 119 aircraft it had before the crisis, the aviation ministry said on Tuesday.
Kumar said talks with Etihad Airways PJSC, which owns 24% in Jet Airways, were still on and the Abu Dhabi-based investor had not conclusively decided to sell its stake in the Indian airline.
A spokesperson for Etihad said that the airline “is working closely with Indian lenders, the company and key stakeholders to facilitate a solution for Jet Airways"".
The turnaround plan proposed by the SBI-led lenders’ consortium will involve a change in its existing management, said a second person privy to discussions among Jet’s lenders and shareholders.
The plan being discussed among lenders and shareholders reached a deadlock recently, with Etihad expressing a wish to sell its stake in the airline due to differences over the terms of the scheme, rather than infusing fresh funds.
Mint reported on Wednesday that Etihad had offered to sell its entire stake in Jet Airways to SBI. Emails sent to Jet Airways on Wednesday remained unanswered at the time of publishing.
Kumar said no lender wanted to take Jet Airways to the bankruptcy courts. In a service industry where businesses operate with few physical assets of their own and rely a lot on brand name and customer confidence, bankruptcy proceedings could hurt the airline’s ability to remain in business.

“The meeting with the finance minister was just to brief him. We have been working on a resolution plan for the last five months. The resolution plan was almost ready, but because of certain issues there is some delay. We need a little bit more time,"" said Kumar.
The meeting was also attended by Nripendra Misra, principal secretary to the prime minister, and civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola. “We believe it is in the lender’s interest, the country’s interest, the aviation sector’s interest that Jet Airways continues to fly,"" said Kumar, adding that bankruptcy proceedings would be the last option.
On Wednesday, Jet Airways shares fell 4.82% to  ₹218.00 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex ended flat at 38,386.75 points."
657,2019-03-22,State Bank,"SpiceJet is likely to take around 50 aircraft on lease from lessors, according to sourcesJet Airways is currently operating 41 of the 119 planes in its fleet 

New Delhi: Air travellers could be assured of fares remaining reasonable with budget carrier SpiceJet planning to lease distressed Jet Airways' grounded aircraft from their lessors in a move that will restore part of the airline industry's capacity.
A person privy to discussions between aircraft lessors and the two airlines said that as many as 50 aircraft are on offer to SpiceJet. ""Commercial negotiations are on for the leasing deal with SpiceJet. It will make immense sense to find an operator in India for these grounded planes than taking them elsewhere,"" said the person who spoke on condition of anonymity.
With Jet Airways operating only about 41 of the 119 planes it had in its fleet before the current liquidity crisis hit the airline, industry capacity has shrunk in recent weeks. In addition, the recent grounding of the controversial Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), too, has affected the aviation industry's capacity.
For SpiceJet, which had to cancel several flights on account of this, leasing Jet's grounded planes will be a quick solution to replenishing capacity. SpiceJet said last week it operated with 94% capacity utilisation in February.
The person quoted above said that once a commercial deal is struck between aircraft lessors and SpiceJet, it may take a few weeks to repaint the planes and deliver them to SpiceJet for induction into its fleet.
Airfare usually goes up during times of unexpected flight cancellations as airlines focus on making alternate arrangements to affected passengers rather than taking fresh bookings at low fare. The industry capacity reduction has already affected fares. A Delhi-Mumbai flight booked about 24 hours in advance on Friday is about 20% costlier than a similar flight booked last week one day before the journey, according to data available from online travel portals.
SpiceJet taking lease of about 50 of Jet's grounded planes is set to ease this pressure on capacity, boost competition and keep fares in check. The DGCA has already cautioned airlines in recent weeks against any unreasonable spike in ticket prices.
The regulator had also said last week that Jet Airways' fleet of 41 aircraft in operation could see a further reduction, which may impact the airline industry's capacity. However, with national polls due in April, the government is giving its blessings to a revival scheme for Jet Airways, which its lenders, led by state-owned bank SBI, are working out with the company's shareholders. SBI is also likely to provide interim financial support if a turnaround scheme is approved."

655,2019-03-24,State Bank,"Recent cases show that Indian banks are terrified of taking firms to insolvency courtsThe prime reason for this fear is that a resolution plan would involve deep haircuts

Indian banks are famous for dragging their feet in taking decisions over soured loans. In the past, they had the full support of their regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), although that backing has waned in recent years.
Still, old habits die hard. State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar said last week that lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd would make every effort to keep the airline from slipping into bankruptcy, as it would further erode the company’s value. Such an approach is fraught with risks.
What’s more, this was soon after an operational creditor, Ericsson AB, won a case in the Supreme Court that made Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) pay it nearly half of what it was owed. This left banks red-faced, as Ericsson, an unsecured creditor, moved from being among the last in the queue for recovery, to first.
But to paint the Ericsson win as a complete failure for banks would be unfair. Ericsson’s repayment was the result of a contempt order from the Supreme Court that involved a jail term for RCom’s promoter if he failed to comply with the order. The amount involved as dues was also small. The  ₹1,150 crore dues is paltry compared with banks’ exposure of roughly  ₹40,000 crore. Operational creditors have been able to get back money from errant companies through the threat of insolvency proceedings in other instances.
Even so, these cases show that Indian banks are terrified of taking companies to insolvency courts though they see little hope in getting their money back on time. While there have been cases where companies have been dragged to the bankruptcy process, in a large number of cases, that was at the prodding of RBI.
The prime reason for this fear is that a resolution plan in their case would have to involve deep haircuts. “We can understand why bankers are reluctant for insolvency proceedings in some cases where a services company is involved. IBC is not the ideal platform to take a services company because they are thin on assets,"" said Abizer Diwanji, partner and national leader (financial services) at EY India. IBC is the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
Liquidation is akin to writing off the entire loan. A precursor to those haircuts would be the mandated 50% provisioning against the loan once the borrower is admitted to insolvency courts. A restructuring, on the other hand, would entail only 15% provisioning. Already bleeding due to provisioning against legacy stock of bad loans, banks do not want the nascent recovery in their balance sheets to be snuffed out by another wave of provisioning.
Efforts to not let RCom enter insolvency courts eventually didn’t succeed, and the company volunteered for bankruptcy proceedings last month.
In the case of Jet Airways too, it remains to be seen how long bankers can prolong the inevitable. The resolution plan would without doubt contain a debt-to-equity conversion. Emergency funds of  ₹1,200 crore will be provided, as per media reports.
Ironically, banks will now own the very companies which had turned defaulters. Finding a strategic buyer and keeping haircut to the minimum is like the dream of having the cake and eating it too. In the case of Kingfisher Airlines, a similar arrangement had blown up in their face.
ALSO READ | The Jet Airways bailout won’t be able to solve anything
Banks need to realize soon that extending and pretending only makes them look gullible to take more risky assets. They have already hiked the stakes in the game by becoming largest shareholders of defaulting borrowers. To pull an Ericsson on defaulters is unthinkable.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

Mumbai: The board of Etihad Airways PJSC will meet 31 March to take a final decision on whether the Abu Dhabi-based carrier should make a fresh investment in Jet Airways (India) Ltd or exit the ailing airline, two people directly aware of the development said.
Etihad’s chief executive, Tony Douglas, who met State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar in Mumbai on 18 March, has sought a term sheet from Indian lenders, which require them to buy Etihad’s 24% stake in Jet Airways if the UAE airline decides to sell. Alternatively, Etihad will make fresh investments in the Mumbai-based carrier only after the lenders agree to fulfil specific conditions.
“Etihad has laid down certain conditions, which includes removal of the Naresh Goyal group from the board altogether,"" one of the two people cited earlier said on condition of anonymity. The airline has also sought a guarantee from the lenders for offering more credit to Jet Airways after the equity infusion, the person added.
“Etihad hopes that the lenders will be able to address all these issues before the board meeting later this month,"" the second person said, requesting anonymity. “Etihad has also sought a ‘put option’ through which it can sell its entire stake to the lenders (led by SBI) if it is not happy with the revised resolution plan.""
Under the “put option"", the seller gets the right but not the obligation to sell assets at an agreed price on or before a particular date. During his meeting with the SBI chief, Douglas offered to sell Etihad’s 24% stake to the state-run lender at  ₹150 per share, or about  ₹400 crore for the full stake.
The development comes after weeks of negotiation between the two sides. Etihad was on the verge of making more investments in cash-strapped Jet Airways, but later dropped the plan. “Etihad is of the view that the lenders have been rather soft on Goyal by allowing him to retain the clawback option in the airline,"" the second person said.
The board of Jet Airways has called a meeting in London late on Sunday to discuss the issue of resignation of the promoters, a third person said, requesting anonymity.
Founder and chairman Naresh Goyal owns a 51% stake in Jet Airways, along with his wife, Anita, who is also on the airline’s board.
Jet Airways and SBI did not respond to queries till the time of publishing this story.
“As a minority shareholder, Etihad is working closely with Indian lenders, the company and key stakeholders to facilitate a solution for Jet Airways,"" a spokesperson for Etihad said.
Mint reported on 15 March that the board of Etihad was not prepared to meet the bailout terms for Jet Airways proposed by a consortium of lenders led by SBI, as the UAE airline did not agree with Goyal’s demand for removal of the perpetuity clause that caps his shareholding at 22%. Etihad is also against Goyal’s proposal to nominate two directors on the airline’s board.
Jet Airways, which is facing a severe cash crunch, defaulted on a domestic loan repayment in December. According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulations, lenders must resolve cases pertaining to defaulting companies such as Jet Airways within 180 days of their first default.
The airline has not paid salaries to a section of its employees, including pilots. It has also not cleared dues to lessors for the past few months.
Lessors have subsequently taken back Jet’s aircraft, forcing Jet Airways to drastically scale down operations this month.
Pilots of Jet Airways have also threatened strike from 1 April unless the airline signs a letter of intent to pay their salary dues.

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday said that it expects investors for the cash-strapped Jet Airways (India) Ltd by the end of May and founder Naresh Goyal has option of increasing his stake in the beleaguered airline to beyond 25% in the future.
Naresh Goyal resigned as chairman of Jet Airways on Monday, two decades after he started the full-service airline. Jet Airways lenders, led by SBI, will immediately infuse  ₹1,500 crore in the airline. 
Lenders will subsequently acquire 51% stake in the airline by issuing 11.4 crore new shares. This move will reduce Goyal's stake in Jet Airways to 25% from 50%, while Etihad Airways' stake will pare down to 12% from 24 at present.
The bidding process for Jet Airways' sale to new investors is expected to be completed in the June quarter, according to the lenders' bailout plan for the airline. 
""June is too late. My expectation is 31 May...market is open for everyone whosoever wants to come in. There will be expression of interest which will be given by 9 April and binding bid by 30 April,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar told CNBC TV18. ""It could be financial investor, it could be (an) airline...including Naresh Goyal himself or Etihad. Nobody is barred from bidding or taking over the airline as per the rule.""

MUMBAI :
Jet Airways staff and officers body on Monday sought representation in the interim management committee which will oversee the functioning of the airline under the banks-led management.
The committee under the overall supervision of the airline's board, was announced after founder Naresh Goyal was forced to step down from the board as also as the chairman of the 25-year-old airline earlier in the day.
After weeks of speculations and uncertainty over the future of the airline, which has grounded over 80 planes due to financial woes, the airline's board earlier in the day approved a resolution plan formulated by SBI-led domestic lenders to whom it owes over  ₹8,200 crore.
The resolution also involves the banks extending an emergency funding of  ₹1,500 crore to the airline.
""It would be appropriate for you to include two representatives from us so as to better understand our concerns about the company, and also to enable the new shareholders to confidently expect a highly empowered and engaged workforce,"" All-India Jet Airways Officers & Staff Association president and NCP lawmaker in the state legislature, Kiran Pawaskar said in a letter to SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar.
He said for the past some years, the airline management has not been addressing many issues that the employees have been facing. These include issues of wage/salary revision from April 2018 and other issues like bonus and ex-gratia payments, leave and leave benefits, among others, he said.
While Jet has been regular on payment to a large part of its workforce, it has been delaying salaries to the senior management people, pilots and engineers since last August. These categories of staff have not been paid for almost four months now, he said.
The association's efforts at getting redressal from the management has unfortunately been very unsuccessful in view of the complete absence of information on the current financial crisis, he said in the letter.
""We are extremely concerned about the allegations of financial mismanagement among others, including tax evasion which we understand are under examination of various statutory authorities,"" Pawaskar alleged.
Recently, the association had approached the management to discuss issues and it was advised that the airline was undergoing shareholding changes under a resolution plan, he added.

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd's founder Naresh Goyal, who along with his wife Anita Goyal, stepped down from the board Monday, said the decision is not the end of the journey but the start of a brand new chapter. Goyal has also resigned from the chairmanship of the 25-year-old airline.
In a letter to 22,000 employees, Goyal also said the approval of the Jet Airways bailout plan will put the carrier on a ""sounder and sustainable"" financial footing.
After weeks of speculations over the future of Jet Airways, which has grounded over 80 planes due to financial woes, its board Monday approved a resolution plan formulated by a consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India. The banks have now become the new owners of the airline with 51% equity holding.
""I'd like to humbly and with immense love and gratitude, inform you that both Anita and myself are stepping down from the board of Jet Airways with immediate effect. Our airline stands poised to turn the page, ready to fly out of the turbulence and soar into a bright new future,"" Goyal, who began his aviation journey as a travel agent, said in the letter.
""We've not come to this decision lightly but this is not the end of the journey, rather it is the start of a brand new chapter,"" Goyal said.
He said he has seen the airline growing from a fleet of just four aircraft flying to 12 routes in the first year, to a peak fleet of 124 flying to over 550 destinations.
This has all been possible because of the tireless, unrelenting efforts of each and every one of the employees, tight-knit members of the Jet Airways family, he added.
""It has truly been a labour of love that Anita and I, together with all of you have built collectively with our blood, toil and tears. Looking back I wouldn't want to change a thing. Not the triumphs, nor the trials and tribulations, challenges nor sweat equity,"" Goyal said.
""For the past 25 years, Jet has been a way of life for Anita and me. Very few people are fortunate enough to live their dreams and we have been truly blessed to be one among those few,"" he said.
""I'd also like to take this moment, to acknowledge the contribution of my wife, confidant and partner Anita without whom this journey would just not have been possible,"" Goyal concluded."
649,2019-03-25,State Bank,"Banks have shown they have nerves of steel with regards to the Jet Airways crisis. The question now is whether a strategic investor will display equal bravado and take on the beleaguered airline

""It takes nerves of steel to stay neurotic,"" Herb Kelleher, co-founder of Southwest Airlines, once famously said. Lenders to the beleaguered airline, Jet Airways (India) Ltd, have shown they have nerves of steel with regards to the troubled investment, but the moot question is if their continued support of the airline borders on neurosis.
The lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), said on Monday that they will pump in another  ₹1,500 crore into Jet Airways, to get the airline in shape for an eventual sale. At the end of December, Jet Airways had an unmanageable net debt of  ₹7,299 crore.
With recovery becoming increasingly challenging, the lenders had converted some loans into equity, giving them a 51% stake in the company. Unless a buyer emerges for the airline, the lenders will just be saddled with more debt.
Jet Airways also announced that its founder Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal will step down from the board. While the fund infusion is expected to help the company get its grounded planes back into service, the change in board composition is expected to help attract a strategic investor. The lenders, therefore, seem to be betting on a new owner for Jet Airways, which will take some of load off their backs.
SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the bank expects Jet Airways to get a new investor within two months. While the two steps mentioned above will help the cause, the key thing to watch out here would be if a deal is possible, given the airline’s high leverage.
Based on Monday’s share price, Jet Airways’ enterprise value (EV) works out to  ₹31,800 crore. This includes the present value of future rentals, using a rough capitalization factor of seven times rentals, and calculates market capitalization using an expanded equity base. This would mean an EV-Ebitdar ratio of 12.5 times using FY18 earnings, a relatively stable period for earnings.
Ebitdar is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization and lease rentals.
In comparison, the same measure for market leader InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo airlines, stood at 11.6 times. While there is no reason anyone would want to pay a premium over IndiGo to buy Jet Airways, perhaps a potential buyer may factor in possible cost savings, which result in a lower valuation multiple.
Besides, Jet Airways’ international slots are an attractive selling point. The big swing factor may well be the change in board composition, given that reports had earlier suggested interest from the Tata Group, with one of the conditions being full control.
But all of these positives will not guarantee a deal. The company’s operations have scaled down, considering that about half of its planes are grounded. As the chart above shows, Jet Airways had already lost considerable market share by end-February. Returning to normalcy can be an uphill task, especially with some competitors successful in poaching some of the airline’s resources. Even before Jet Airways’ current troubles, its cost structure was far higher than that of its peers.
Cumulatively, these factors could well mean that Jet Airways’ sale will not take off easily. Investors are taking note of this. Small wonder then that despite the rally in its shares on Monday, the stock is still trading 58% lower compared to the beginning of FY19.
So, when banks try to find a strategic investor for Jet Airways within the next two months, their only hope is of others who have similar nerves of steel. Else, their latest show of support will be a case of false bravado."

MUMBAI :
Jet Airways' domestic pilots body, the National Aviators Guild (NAG), Tuesday sought a meeting with State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar over pending salaries, a day after the lenders took over the carrier founded by Naresh Goyal a quarter of a century ago.
The guild had last week announced that its over 1,100 -odd members would stop flying from April 1 of their salaries dues were not cleared and a clarity on the revival roadmap was not provided by March 31.
After lots of dilly-dallying, founder chairman Naresh Goyal and his board-member wife Anita, had Monday decided to step down and also pare their stake to 25.5 percent from 50.1 percent. The changes also saw its foreign partner Etihad halving its stake to 12 percent and ceding a board position.
Under the new deal, banks, mostly led by state-run lenders, have would infuse  ₹1,500 crore of emergency liquidity to the airline and convert total debt of over 9,700 crore (including the fresh capital infusion) into equity worth 50.1 percent at a price of Re 1.
With this, the public float in the airline has also come down 12.5 percent from 25 percent earlier.
""We humbly request to you to alleviate some of the hardships that we and engineers have been facing, by ensuring that the new Jet management does not further delay our pending salaries dues at the earliest,"" NAG general secretary Tej Sood said in an e-mail to Kumar.

The guild represents about 1,100 of the around 1,600 pilots of the airline, and many of them have reportedly got offers from rival Indigo and Spicejet.
The guild members have come together and stood behind the airline when it was passing through its worst period, he claimed adding, ""despite the severe financial difficulties and uncertainties over our future that we have been facing over the past few months, we have not wavered.""

State Bank of India, the country’s largest lender, recently announced that its savings account deposits above  ₹1 lakh will earn an interest rate that is linked to the repo rate, an external benchmark, from May 2019. SBI’s move is being seen as a nudge to customers to move their surplus money from their savings bank accounts to fixed deposits that give higher yields. More banks are expected to follow in SBI’s footsteps. Shaikh Zoaib Saleem asks experts if, in such a situation, it makes sense to stick to bank savings accounts to park one’s surplus money, or to move to fixed deposits or liquid mutual funds
Returns will improve if surplus money is moved to FDs
Nitin Rao, CEO, Reliance Wealth Management
The recent move by the State Bank of India (SBI) to link its savings bank deposit rates to the repo rate makes the determination of interest rate transparent. This will have a bearing only on individuals with deposits above  ₹1 lakh.
For such savings accounts, SBI will give a rate of 3.5%, which is 2.75% below the repo rate (the rate is 3.5% for other SBI savings accounts too). This is a negative real returns on a net of tax basis. Investors typically use savings account to park their surplus and exigency funds. With rates expected to head lower, returns could be improved by allocating the portion needed for an exigency into fixed deposits (FDs). Some FDs provide immediate liquidity, like a savings account, even on non-working days.
The balance exigency funds can move to liquid schemes of mutual funds as they provide better post-tax returns. Investors looking to further optimise returns by about 1% and with a short-term outlook can look at investing in ultra short-term funds as they provide superior risk-adjusted returns.

Taresh Bhatia, Partner, Advantage Financial Planners LLP
From a financial planning perspective, all your investments should be goal-driven. Even maintaining money in a savings account should be linked to a specific goal.
If someone is in a stable job, a three-month contingency fund is advisable. This is other than the family’s regular expenses. For instance, if someone has a monthly expense of  ₹50,000, including loan repayment EMIs, the person should have a contingency fund of  ₹1.5 lakh. Of this, keep just  ₹50,000, that is one third of your contingency fund, in a savings account and the balance in a liquid fund. The reason for this distribution is that you should be able to withdraw the first  ₹50,000 immediately if required. For the rest, you can choose liquid funds that offer liquidation at the earliest.
Money in excess of this should be deployed based on your financial goals and the investments and instruments need to be decided accordingly. It is important to have a financial plan in place. The asset categories and allocation will vary from person to person.
Liquid funds score over bank accounts in terms of returns
Dhawal Dalal, CIO, fixed income, Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd
The linking of savings bank deposits with an external benchmark makes the investment case for liquid funds stronger. Given the nature of liquid funds, their track record and incremental returns, investing in them will be superior compared to investing in savings bank accounts.
For medium-term investments, there is more comfort among investors with FDs. Mutual funds are far from giving that kind of comfort, but we are making progress. People invest in FDs for two-three years and above, while liquid funds are for cash surplus that is waiting to be deployed. But for short-term deposits of three to six months, liquid funds are superior in terms of returns and liquidity.
For investments of one to two years, you are better off investing in listed corporate bonds because here long-term capital gains are applicable after 12 months. But if the investment period is above three years, then fixed maturity plans or FMPs are much better compared to FDs due to diversification, indexation benefit and lower costs.
With interest rates likely to go down, FDs are a viable option
Surinder Chawla, Head, branch and business banking, RBL Bank
Every individual is comfortable with different levels of savings account balance. The choice for deployment of excess money depends on what asset class you are comfortable with and how much risk you are ready to take, and the period of investment.
If someone has a surplus for the short term, they would think of choosing between a liquid fund and an FD. When deciding between the two, you have to consider the fact that a liquid fund is market-linked and, hence, returns are not guaranteed. Depending on tenure, you also have to keep tax calculations in mind. On the other hand, FDs have a fixed return but also have a TDS (tax deducted at source).
Another important factor will be interest rates in the near future. If rates are expected to go higher, then I would do a short-term investment now and go for an FD when the rates go up. At present, we know that the rates are going down. In the current situation, I would go with the security of an FD for a longer term rather than liquid funds that have market volatility."

NEW DELHI :
Financially-troubled Jet Airways on Tuesday assured the government that it will not ground any more aircraft and strive to increase the seat-capacity in coming weeks.
""They (Jet Airways) have assured us that no more jets will be grounded. Today, 35 planes are flying,"" said Pradeep Singh Kharola, Secretary in the Ministry of Civil Aviation.
""They will approach the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for the next one month to get the schedule approved for the 35 planes,"" he told reporters after the meeting with Jet officials, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar and DGCA chief B.S. Bhullar.
Kharola said that Jet has given a plan and is hopeful of flying 40 more planes by the end of next month. ""If this happens, it comes to about 80% of the capacity.""
""It is an aggressive target,"" he said. ""We have told them to sit with the lessors, plan the details and convince them to withdraw grounding notices. Once withdrawn, Jet will need to approach the DGCA, which will then authorise them to use the planes.""
The development came a day after Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita holding 51% of the equity resigned from the board and transferred control to the lenders. An interim management committee has been created to manage and monitor daily operations and cash flow.
On Monday, Jet's board of directors said there will be immediate funding support of up to  ₹1,500 crore by lenders by way of issue of appropriate debt instrument against the security of the assets of Jet Airways.
Jet has been suffering bruising competition from low-cost airlines, fluctuating crude prices and a weak rupee. The airline has over one billion dollars in debt and has to repay money to banks, lessors of planes and suppliers besides clearing pending salaries to its pilots."
646,2019-03-26,State Bank,"For over five months, SBI-led lenders worked tirelessly to save the crisis-hit Jet AirlinesSBI chairman Kumar was clear that lenders would not let Jet Airways face bankruptcy

Mumbai: It’s very rare for a banker to force a promoter to step down, and take over the reins of a company to save it from the brink of a collapse. State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar has managed to do the unthinkable by convincing Naresh Goyal, the founder chairman of Jet Airways (India) Ltd, and his wife Anita Goyal to step down from the board of the airline.
For over five months, SBI-led lenders worked tirelessly to save the beleaguered airline.
On 14 February, Jet Airways announced a bailout plan under which lenders would convert 114 million fresh shares into equity, resulting in the lenders becoming majority shareholders.
Lenders had also promised to pump in  ₹1,000 crore with the foreign partner, Etihad Airways PJSC, infusing another  ₹1,600-1,900 crore.
However, Etihad put a spanner in the works by refusing to accept the restructuring plan and asking SBI to buy its entire 24% stake in Jet Airways.
But Kumar was clear that the lenders would not let the airline go bust. “We believe that it is in everybody’s interest that Jet Airways continues to fly,"" he said.
Naresh Goyal tried hard to delay the inevitable by refusing to cede control of the airline he founded 25 years ago. However, he finally gave in to Kumar and his team.
For Kumar and SBI, the memories of Kingfisher Airlines, the biggest aviation fiasco, were still fresh. In 2011, banks undertook a similar restructuring exercise in the case of Kingfisher by converting debt into equity. The defunct airline owes as much as  ₹9,000 crore to banks, but they failed to recover these dues, resulting in the promoter Vijay Mallya fleeing the country. An extradition trial is underway in the UK to bring Mallya back to India.
“Rajnish Kumar has demonstrated business acumen and dexterity in leading the lenders towards the most appropriate bank-led resolution under the current circumstances. This demonstrates bankers can take the lead to find solutions for operating entities without allowing impairment of the asset and in the best interest of all stakeholders,"" said Sunil Mehta, chairman, Punjab National Bank. “This also shows that banks should start working when they see signs of financial weakness.""
Reliance Communications Ltd was one such example where lenders delayed the restructuring plan, resulting in the unsecured creditor walking away with 50% of its dues under the bankruptcy process. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) said that the sale process turned out to be a failure, noting that the lenders had messed up the restructuring process.
With Jet Airways, Kumar and his team were clear that they had to move fast and save the banking system from another bad loan mess, especially at a time when resolutions and recoveries under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) have been delayed."
647,2019-03-26,State Bank,"Naresh Goyal's exit from Jet Airways and immediate bank funding underscore government's resolve to solve the crisisThe government can ill afford to look away, especially during poll seasos, as Jet Airways is crucial to the aviation sector

New Delhi: Quick action on the Jet Airways crisis—emergency bank funding of  ₹1,500 crore and the exit of chairman Naresh Goyal as part of a bailout plan—is the latest example of the government stepping in to prevent a high-profile corporate collapse.
The move has multiple goals—saving ‘Brand India’ from the taint of a bankruptcy, saving serious inconveniences for passengers, and avoiding the impact of a business collapse on the economy.
The government is keen to ensure that the airline survives in order to prevent any wrong signals going to investors at a time India is projecting itself as a destination for investments and is making serious efforts to improve ease of doing business. The Narendra Modi administration also leveraged its good relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to ensure that its carrier Etihad Airways PJSC remains on board, as far as any revival scheme for Jet Airways is concerned. 
Etihad owns 24% in Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
“The idea is that what has happened in the case of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) does not play out in the case of Jet Airways. All serious efforts are on to ensure that Jet Airways remains afloat as a going concern,"" a person informed about discussions between Jet’s shareholders and lenders said on the condition of anonymity.
Government intervention takes place in the case of entities which have either systemic importance to the financial sector or have big impact on an industry or the economy in general. It was last seen in the case of IL&FS in October last year, when the government replaced its board of directors and ordered a probe into its failure. The new IL&FS board is now in the process of selling key assets to finance a turnaround. The UPA government in January 2009 did a similar drill when it moved the Company Law Board, the predecessor of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), to replace the board of directors of software maker Satyam Computer Services Ltd, which reported a fraud.
Jet Airways’ troubles became public when the carrier had to defer announcement of its first quarter results last August saying certain matters needed closure.
For the first quarter of 2018-19, the company eventually posted net losses of  ₹1,323 crore on account of high fuel cost and rupee depreciation, compared to a  ₹53.5 crore net profit a year earlier. At the end of the June quarter of FY19, Jet Airways saw its net worth plunge into the negative. 
It became clear that the company needed a bailout.
Policymakers usually keep track of such developments, especially when these take place close to national polls. After a meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley last week, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said that lenders to Jet Airways would make every effort to keep the airline from slipping into bankruptcy. That meeting was also attended by Nripendra Misra, principal secretary to PM Modi, and civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola."
648,2019-03-26,State Bank,"When the Jet Airways crisis broke out, Naresh Goyal ensured the right message went out, assuring everyone there was a fix at handIn hindsight, it has now become clear what Naresh Goyal was unwilling to give up control—key to prestige in corporate corridors

Mumbai: It takes sheer guts to found and fly an airline for 27 years, in a period that saw the ambitious launches of several Indian carriers that only got grounded a few years down the line. For Naresh Goyal, his ingenuity in crisis-handling was a key asset all through, say people who knew him closely.
On Monday, the man who successfully battled competition to Jet Airways (India) Ltd from foreign airlines—and also took on domestic heavyweights—was forced out as chairman of the company he founded in 1992.
July 2018 was a tough month for Goyal, who had fought and emerged victorious in all his battles, yet.
When the early signs of a crisis surfaced in Jet Airways, Goyal, true to his character, ensured the right message went out, repeatedly assuring employees, shareholders and lenders alike that a fix was at hand. Only a year before, he spurned overtures from multiple suitors, mainly foreign airlines, as he sought a premium almost three times Jet Airways' share price then.
In hindsight, it has now become clear what Goyal was unwilling to give up control—key to prestige in corporate corridors.
In all his negotiations over a stake sale, Goyal insisted on keeping control of Jet Airways—dissuading suitors who were willing to invest precisely for that.
Across conversations with investors, analysts and industry executives, Mint pieced together the story of how Goyal finally lost what he treasured most.
When Jet Airways reported a loss of  ₹636.45 crore in the year ended 31 March 2018, it had a gross debt of  ₹8,425 crore. At the same time, India’s largest airline IndiGo, run by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, posted a net profit of  ₹2,242.37 crore.
“The writing on the wall was clear,"" said a senior banker, requesting anonymity.
“The company was over-leveraged and there was no way lenders were extending more credit unless there was fresh equity infusion,"" the person added.
But Goyal like before was adamant on getting a higher price, said another banker.
“But the problem was, the situation had changed dramatically in a year. Crude surged 43.4% during this period while the rupee weakened 7.2% against the dollar in the same period—leaving almost no room for any further manoeuvring,"" the person added.
There was no way Goyal was going to get what he wanted. Adding to its woes, Jet Airways’ statutory auditor in August 2018 refused to sign off on its first quarter results, citing differing views over interpretations of some accounting rules.
“The Tata Group was the only interested bidder but its relations with Goyal had been thorny from the early days of private airlines in India. Nevertheless, they were willing to invest provided Goyal was willing to cede control,"" the second person quoted above said. “But Tatas, suspecting revenue leakage, also made it amply clear that all of Jet’s existing vendor contracts including ground handling had to end,"" this person added. It also wanted Goyal to exit completely.
Not surprisingly, Goyal, used to handling the smallest of details, found Tata’s conditions unacceptable, and turned to Etihad, which has been Jet Airways’ partner since 2013. However, since its $379 million investment in the Mumbai-based carrier, the UAE airline had curtailed its global aspirations and written off similar investments in at least two other airlines. “There was no love lost between Goyal and Etihad,"" said a former senior executive at Jet Airways.
Despite its stake of 24%, Etihad never really got around to have any say in Jet Airways. Against its expectations, Jet Airways never really became the feeder airline from India that Etihad hoped it would become for its global operations.
“Like Tata, Etihad too wanted Goyal out, but alongside, also wanted a waiver on the mandatory open offer post equity infusion,"" the third person said adding, “But the Securities and Exchange Board of India, which felt Etihad should have made an open offer back in 2013 since there was a change in management control in Jet Airways, said there could not be any waiver this time around.""
In 2013, the Jet-Etihad deal had won regulatory approval after a revised shareholder agreement decreased Etihad’s presence on the board of Jet Airways, addressing government concerns that the Abu Dhabi carrier appeared to be taking control of the Indian airline. Etihad settled for two seats on the board, which was to have up to 12 members, one less than initially planned.
In fact, as recently as 8 March, Jet and Etihad had almost finalized a deal envisaging a total fund infusion of  ₹4,200 crore, including from an unidentified white knight. Also, Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal would have to give up executive powers and board duties.
The draft agreement also proposed to cap the Goyal-led promoter group’s shareholding to 22%, which was to be documented in the shareholders’ agreement and in the articles of association of Jet Airways.
Goyal tried to renegotiate this clause in an 8 March letter to Tony Douglas, CEO of Etihad. In the letter, he asked that the perpetuity requirement of capping promoter shareholding to 22% be dropped.
Etihad wasn’t excited; it decided not to proceed with the deal. Left with few options, Goyal made a last-ditch plea to the government for a potential bailout, said the people cited above.
“But it was too late by then,"" said the first person cited above. “The government was already grappling with the crisis in IL&FS and was fending off accusations in the Rafale case. Seen as backing Goyal at this juncture would only invite more trouble,"" the first person said.
Banks were told to find a solution with or without Goyal. They found one."
653,2019-03-26,State Bank,"Lenders to immediately pump about  ₹1,500 crore into Jet Airways by way of issue of appropriate debt instrumentsA bidding process, to be completed by June, will be initiated by the lenders for issuing shares to a new investor in Jet Airways

Mumbai: Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal agreed to step down from their respective positions in Jet Airways (India) Ltd following a marathon board meeting in Mumbai that started late on Sunday and continued till Monday afternoon. “Naresh Goyal also ceases to be the chairman of the company,"" Jet Airways told the exchanges on Monday.
The unprecedented move will see Goyal lose control of an airline that he founded 27 years ago. It also culminates calls from Jet Airways’ lenders, as well as its 24% stakeholder, Etihad Airways PJSC, for Goyal to step down from the chairmanship.
On Monday, a consortium of lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) took control of Jet Airways, promising to throw open a bidding contest for a new investor that is expected to be completed in the June quarter.
While the lenders ensured that the debt-laden airline is not grounded, it also turned out to be a face-saving exercise for the Indian economy, which is grappling to emerge out of the liquidity crunch following the crisis at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd. A shutdown of Jet Airways and consequent job losses would have been a political nightmare for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, ahead of Lok Sabha Elections 2019.
The bidding process for Jet Airways is expected to start on 9 April and is likely to generate interest not only from domestic carriers, but also from foreign airlines. Among the contenders are India’s largest airline by market share, IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd), and the Tata Group.
While Etihad continues to be an investor in Jet Airways, it remains to be seen if its rival, Qatar Airways, will also place a bid.
A foreign airline can hold a maximum of 49% in an Indian carrier.
Jet Airways on Monday said its promoters, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal, also a director at the airline, and Kevin Knight, one of the two nominees of Etihad on the board, will step down.
The lenders have agreed to take a 50.5% stake in Jet Airways in order to save the airline. Meanwhile, the lenders will form an interim management at the Mumbai-based airline, which will monitor the daily cash flow and operations. Two members will also be nominated to the board.
Besides, the lenders will make a cash infusion of about  ₹1,500 crore into Jet Airways, which is likely to take care of some of the immediate issues faced by the airline such as delay in payments to employees, lessors and others.

Investors cheered the announcement, sending shares of Jet Airways to their highest in over two months. The shares closed 12.69% higher at  ₹254.50 on the BSE.
“We see this (Goyal’s resignation) as positive for the company, as urgency of funds and (issues like) new investors wanting removal of old promoters are addressed,"" said Sameer Kalra, founder of Target Investing, an equity research firm.
Ajay Singh, chairman of rival SpiceJet Ltd, termed the exit of the Goyals a “sad day for Indian aviation"". “This is also a wake-up call for Indian policymakers. We urgently need to address structural challenges that make India’s airlines uncompetitive to airlines around the world,"" he said.
SBI, the top lender to Jet Airways, is hoping that it will be able to find a new investor in about two months. “SBI Caps is handling the process. We hope to get an investor before 31 May,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said in an interview.
He added that an independent director would take charge of Jet Airways after the exit of Naresh Goyal. “Most likely, we are going to suggest the name of A.K. Purwar, a former SBI chairman, for the position. It’s, however, up to the board then to decide.""
Jet Airways, which is facing a severe cash crunch, defaulted on a domestic loan repayment in December. Under Reserve Bank of India regulations, lenders must resolve cases of defaulting firms such as Jet Airways within 180 days of their first default.
The airline has also unpaid dues with lessors, which have subsequently taken back several planes, forcing Jet to drastically cut flights. It has a fleet of about 34 planes, a fraction of the original fleet of 119 planes.

Mumbai: Negotations by State Bank of India (SBI)-led lenders’ consortium with Jet Airways (India) Ltd, Etihad Airways PJSC and other stakeholders finally ended in chairman Naresh Goyal resigning from the board of the airline he founded over two-and-a-half decades ago. Talks were not easy, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said in an interview. Edited excerpts:
Are you in talks with any investors currently?
SBI Caps is handling the process. We hope to get an investor before 31 May.
Who will take charge as the chairman of Jet Airways after Goyal’s exit?
An independent director will take charge. Most likely we are going to suggest the name of A.K. Purwar, former State Bank of India chairman, for the position. It’s, however, up to the board to decide.
Will the lenders get two seats on the board?
Yes. One will be the chairman’s position and the other will go to a private sector bank with the largest exposure. It could be IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank or Yes Bank.
You were spearheading the whole process on behalf of the lenders. How difficult were the negotiations?
The negotiations were not easy. I can say that. I was driven by only one thing, that we needed to act tough and act fast.
Our approach was focused on preserving the economic value of the airline.
We have signed a binding agreement with both Etihad Airways and Jet Airways to ensure that they don’t come in the way of the sale process.
What happens to the total liabilities of the airline, which is close to  ₹15,000 crore?
We aim to restructure the debt and complete the sale process over the next two months. The new investor will, however, have to take a call on the debt, and put the best value to it.

How do you ensure that Jet Airways will not go the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code way?
We are confident that Jet Airways has value. It has a fantastic brand value and will not be put under liquidation. The media has been talking about taking the company to NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal), but let me tell you that in the case of airline companies, NCLT does not mean revival but liquidation. And Jet Airways hasn’t reached that state.
Naresh Goyal had been trying hard to delay his exit. How did you manage to pull the plug?
I cannot reveal all my secrets (laughs)."

NEW DELHI :
Former State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Arun Kumar Purwar tops the list of probables to head the interim board of Jet Airways, among others, sources told IANS.
The other names doing the rounds include Janaki Ballav and Arundhati Bhattarcharya, both former chairpersons of SBI, according to people privy to the developments.
Banking sources said that Purwar's chances of heading the board are higher and he could be one of the two nominees on the Jet board, which became vacant after former Chairman Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal stepped down on Monday.
The other vacant seat could go to one of the other lenders -- IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank or Yes Bank.
The decision, once taken by the lenders, would need the approval of the current board which is still in the process of being reconstituted.
People in the know of things said that the SBI-led management is likely to soon approve the names of the would be Chairman and the other member of the board. Thereafter, the newly constituted board will formally approve the next Chairman.
""The SBI wants to appoint a Chairman to head the interim board fast, as it does not want the baord to remain headless and also wants to start work on finding a buyer at the earliest,"" a source said.
On Tuesday, the Civil Aviation Ministry had a meeting with the representatives of the SBI, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Jet Airways whereby the airline assured that it would not ground any more flights and would talk to lessors to operationalise as many as 40 grounded aircraft by April-end.
Jet Airways has been struggling with cash flows for the past six months because of rising fuel costs and intense competition. It has even delayed payment to lessors, airport operators and oil marketing companies (OMCs) besides a part of its workforce to keep the company running.
Around 50 of its aircraft were grounded due to the inability to pay rentals. Its pilots and certain sections of the employees have been without pay for some months, forcing the pilots to issue an ultimatum to the erstwhile management on salary payments.
The airline owes  ₹8,000 crore to the SBI-led lenders' consortium.

New Delhi: Power Finance Corp. Ltd (PFC) has completed the purchase of a controlling stake in state-run peer REC Ltd that will create an $80-billion lending giant by assets and potentially help in faster resolution of stressed assets in India’s power sector.
PFC paid  ₹14,500 crore to the Union government to buy a 52.63% stake in REC, the company’s chairman and managing director Rajeev Sharma said on Thursday.
The proceeds from the REC stake sale have also helped the union government exceed its disinvestment target of  ₹80,000 crore for the fiscal year 2018-19. The disinvestment receipts touched  ₹85,000 crore last week.
PFC plans to complete the process of the merger with REC in the next fiscal year in consultation with the government. This would make PFC India’s second largest state-owned financial firm by market capitalization after State Bank of India (SBI).
While SBI commanded a market cap of  ₹2.84 trillion on Thursday, REC and PFC achieved a market cap of  ₹29,485.53 crore and  ₹31,034.16 crore, respectively.
“PFC, therefore, will be a dominant player not only in the power sector but also in the entire financial market space,"" Sharma said.
PFC and REC had reported assets of  ₹2.86 trillion ($43 billion) and  ₹2.46 trillion ($37 billion), respectively, as of March-end, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
“PFC’s strategic importance to the government will further increase upon completion of the acquisition as the combined entity will become the biggest non-bank finance entity in which the government holds a controlling stake. In addition, it will account for the majority of financing for state power utilities. State power utilities, in turn, still account for a material portion of power generation capacity in India,"" Moody’s said in a statement on Wednesday.
Sharma said the consolidation will help in faster resolution of stressed assets, given PFC and REC have a robust presence in any consortium of lenders to power companies.
The PFC-REC deal comes against the backdrop of around 66 gigawatts of capacity facing various degrees of financial stress. Power sector NPAs comprise around 5.9% of the banking sector’s total outstanding advances of  ₹4.73 trillion, according to Economic Survey 2016-17 released in August.
Sharma said the consolidation will help in raising funds at competitive costs and lead to convergence of lending policies and rates. It will also help in improving asset quality and impress upon state utilities to improve their performance.
“Currently, PFC and REC compete for resources both in domestic and international markets. A collaborative approach can lead to efficiencies in terms of timing and pricing and not competing in the same time or lenders space,"" he said.
The state distribution utilities, or power discoms, have been plagued by issues such as low collection, increase in power purchase cost, inadequate electricity tariff hike and subsidy disbursement, and increasing government department dues. This has resulted in discoms having poor payment records.
A group of ministers set up to evaluate the bill discounting proposal, wherein firms such as PFC make upfront payments to power generation utilities after discounting the receivables from discoms, could not find a solution to the vexed issue.
The PFC-REC deal has helped the government reach its fiscal deficit target of 3.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018-19. The budgeted fiscal deficit target was 3.3% of GDP at the beginning of 2018-19, which was later revised to 3.4%, while preparing the interim budget.
The shares of REC were bought at  ₹139.50 apiece. While 70% of the deal was funded through cash flows, the rest was through debt. The government approved the transaction in December.
Moody’s has, meanwhile, retained the Baa3 issuer ratings of PFC and REC. It retained the previous stable outlook for the two lenders after placing them “on review for downgrade"" in December. Baa3 is the lowest investment grade.
“I had informed that PFC will maintain its capital adequacy levels as per the RBI requirements and also to meet our future business growth. Let me reiterate that post the acquisition also, PFC will continue to be comfortable on capital,"" Sharma said."
637,2019-03-29,State Bank,"The ED told the special court that it had no objection to allowing banks to sell Mallya properties provided they gave an undertaking The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court did not take up the petition and fixed 2 April for the next date of hearing

MUMBAI :
A day after the SBI-led bankers consortium raised  ₹1,008 crore by selling 7.4 million pledged shares of United Breweries, their bid to recover more money by liquidating shares of United Spirits faced opposition from HDFC Bank which moved the special PMLA court here against it.
The special PMLA (Prevention of Money Laundering Act) court did not take up the petition and fixed 2 April for the next date of hearing.
At Thursday's closing price of  ₹532.20 on the BSE, these 6.6 million shares could fetch the banks over  ₹350 crore.
Banks are seeking court permission to liquidate 65.85 lakh shares of United Spirits which were pledged by two Vijay Mallya companies -- United Breweries Holdings (UBHL) and Kingfisher Finvest, the holding company of the defunct Kingfisher Airlines -- as collateral for loans from HDFC Bank.
The banks are trying to part-recover the  ₹6,203.35 crore of dues along with annualized interest of 11.5 per cent payable since 2013, by liquidating the confiscated assets of Mallya, who is awaiting an extradition case at the London High Court now.
In its application moved before MS Azmi, the judge of the PMLA court, HDFC Bank said as part of its business operations it's been extending loans to United Breweries since 1980. Similarly, in 2010 various loans were given and these were secured by shares and various immovable properties.
United Spirits (USL) is majority owned by British spirits major Diageo since 2013 after Mallya sold controlling stake in the country's largest spirits maker.
Under the share pledge agreement for the loan from HDFC Bank, UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest had pledged a total of 65.85 lakh shares of United Spirits in favour of HDFC Bank, the application noted.
HDFC Bank further claimed that the exclusive charge over the attached shares, especially USL shares, was disclosed in the 2011-12 annual report of UBHL.
The application states that it is not the case of consortium of banks that UBHL or Kingfisher Finvest had created a pledge in their favour, prior to creation of pledge in favour HDFC Bank.
The contention that dues of HDFC Bank are not adjudicated and hence they cannot claim right over the pledged share of USL is 'baseless' and 'unfounded', the HDFC Bank said.
Earlier, a 12-bank consortium led by State Bank had moved the PMLA court seeking release of Mallya's assets that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had attached.
The banks claimed ""legitimate interests"" in all the properties belonging to Mallya, Kingfisher Airlines, UBHL and Kingfisher Finvest including movable and immovable properties.
The ED told the special court that it had no objection to allowing banks to sell Mallya properties provided they gave an undertaking that they would return the money later. But this was opposed by the official liquidator appointed by the Karnataka High Court.
Later in January this year, Mallya, who owes over  ₹9,900 crore to banks, was declared as an fugitive economic offender under the provisions of the new Fugitive Economic Offenders Act which came into existence last August. This facilitated the PMLA court to allow banks to sell the stocks.
It can be noted that the official liquidator of the Bengaluru Debt Recovery Tribunal had Wednesday sold 74 million pledged shares of United Breweries, currently owned by beer major Heineken, for  ₹1,008 crore on behalf of the ED.
The proceeds would go to the banks. This is among the big recovery action taken by the authorities since Mallya left the country in March 2016.
These shares, which were pledged with Yes Bank, were attached by the ED in connection with money laundering probe involving Mallya and debt-laden Kingfisher Airlines.
The sale could go on after the PMLA court had last month directed Yes Bank to surrender these in favour of the recovery officer in Bengaluru within three weeks.
Mallya personally held 7.91% in UBHL as of December 2016, while total promoter holdings stood at 52%. UBHL is now facing liquidation. The ED attachment included 41.3 million UB shares or almost 15 per cent held by Mallya and his group companies.
Currently Heineken holds about 44% in UB, once controlled by Mallya, while 23% with UB promoters and promoter groups are pledged.
So far, the ED has attached assets of Mallya worth  ₹9,700 crore in connection with an alleged IDBI Bank loan fraud case registered by the CBI.

Mumbai: Jet Airways pilots have written to the chief executive officer (CEO) of the embattled airline, Vinay Dube, threatening to take legal action or go on indefinite leave from 1 April if the company fails to pay salary dues by the end of March.
“After having been aggrieved over the last eight months my anticipation, belief and confidence in your management has been completely eroded, washed off due to the complete lack of communication in a transparent and fair manner,"" said a letter written by a pilot to Dube on 29 March.
Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter, which is in the same format as the other letters.
“I am hoping to receive all the payments due to me in my account before last working day,"" the letter said. “I have recourse under the law to file cases for recovery of my payment (both by civil law and labour regulation). I can jointly express my discomfort and agitate under the auspices of the association to which I belong or become a part of a new group that raises disputes before the management. I can express my displeasure by refusing to fly till such time that my issues are not resolved,"" the letter said.
Pilots of Jet Airways (India) Ltd haven’t been paid salaries for more than three months as the airline struggled to keep its operations afloat because of rising costs. The airline has also not paid salaries to other employees and has defaulted on lease rentals to aircraft lessors. The airline has also defaulted on interest payment in December.
Last Monday, a consortium of lenders—led by State Bank of India (SBI)—took control of Jet Airways, promising to throw open a bidding contest for a new investor, which is expected to be completed in the June quarter.
Lenders are expected to immediately pump about  ₹1,500 crore into Jet Airways by issuing appropriate debt instruments.
The pilots have decided to protest under the banner of the airline’s pilots union—the National Aviators Guild—or under a different banner if their salaries are not paid by the end of March.

“While I understand and have been more than willing to cooperate at difficult times either currently or in the past, I have to candidly let you know that I have a deep sense of discomfort within me by your conduct in not honouring the terms of understanding to make all salary current as of 31st March. There is 387.5% of unpaid salaries due to me as on 31 March 2019,"" the letter said.

“I can express my displeasure by refusing to fly till such time that my issues are not resolved. I have been pondering over the alternatives above and I feel that it would be suitable for me to proceed on leave of absence, to assist me in organizing my personal life and arrange for sources of my existence as you have failed in honouring the agreement and your word,"" the letter said.
“As announced earlier this week , the airline’s lenders and its management team would like to reiterate, that every effort is being made to inject adequate liquidity into the Company, to quickly restore normalcy of operations, ensuring due compliance with all appropriate legal processes / formalities at the same time. While acknowledging the support of each and every member of its family, Jet Airways’ especially recognises the contribution of its pilots, AMEs and members of its senior management, who have sacrificed personal interests and have gone beyond their call of duty in order to ensure safe and reliable operations for the airline’s guests,"" Jet Airways Spokesperson said. 
Spokespersons of the National Aviators Guild were also unavailable for comment.
On Friday, Jet Airways shares traded flat at  ₹269.35 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.33% to end the day at 38,672.91 points."

634,2019-04-01,State Bank,"Salaries from Jan to March, amounting to about  ₹320 crore, are currently pendingJet’s pilot union had called ‘open house’ meeting of its members in New Delhi and Mumbai

MUMBAI :
About 1,100 unionized pilots of Jet Airways (India) Ltd have deferred by a fortnight a plan to abstain from work from Monday in a relief to the troubled carrier, as well as its passengers.
The pilots union, National Aviator’s Guild, took the decision after the airline management paid the remaining 87.5% of their December salary on Saturday. The pilots had earlier received 12.5% of their salaries for December.
The NAG members who organized an ‘open house’ on Sunday afternoon have now asked the management to clear their unpaid salaries by 15 April, said a Mumbai-based Jet Airways pilot. The pilot, who is also a union member, spoke to Mint after the conclusion of an ‘open house’ meeting of the NAG to discuss the situation at the airline.
“The decision made by the pilots’ union is expected to convey to Jet Airlines chief executive Vinay Dube soon,"" the pilot said, requesting anonymity.
A spokesperson for Jet Airways didn’t immediately respond to queries.
Cash-strapped Jet Airways hasn’t paid salaries to a section of its staff, including pilots, engineers and general managers, since the past three months. The airline, unable to cope up with rising costs, has deferred on interest payments, besides lease rental payments to lessors, which has led to a sizeable reduction in its fleet.
Over 200 pilots wrote to Dube last week asking him to clear their pending salaries by Sunday, else they would stop flying Jet Airways planes. “Salaries from January to March 2019, which is to the tune of about  ₹320 crore, are currently pending,"" said the pilot cited above.
Dube said on Saturday that the airline will only be able to fully clear the December salaries immediately. “We continue to work on additional funding on an urgent basis and shall advise you on the remaining salary arrears as the funds come in,"" Dube said in an email to Jet Airways’ employees.
There are an estimated 1,600 pilots at Jet Airways, of which about 1,100 are unionied.
“It’s a difficult situation as I have loans to repay every month. I am hoping that pending salaries are cleared at the earliest,"" said a New Delhi-based senior pilot with Jet Airways.
Last week, a consortium of lenders, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), took control of Jet Airways and have outlined plans to bring in a new investor in the carrier by May-end, according to SBI’s chairman Rajnish Kumar."
633,2019-04-01,State Bank,"Lender proposes a  ₹9,535 crore fund infusion, including  ₹3,800 crore from two new investorsThe resolution plan believes Jet’s lenders will make a gain of  ₹2,636 cr if its share price rises to  ₹300 by March 2022

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India (SBI), the biggest lender to Jet Airways (India) Ltd, has proposed a new plan to revive the ailing carrier that involves a total fund infusion of  ₹9,535 crore, and the exit of founder Naresh Goyal and Etihad Airways PJSC.
The plan includes an equity infusion of  ₹3,800 crore by two unidentified investors and a  ₹850 crore equity infusion by state-run lenders led by SBI,  ₹485 crore on behalf of public shareholders that will be achieved through banks underwriting a rights issue, additional debt of  ₹2,400 crore and non-fund based facilities of  ₹2,000 crore, according to the plan reviewed by Mint.
The resolution plan also proposes a complete exit of Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, as well as large haircuts for lenders, including a write-off of debt by the domestic lenders to Jet Airways.
Last month, the lenders committed a fund infusion of  ₹1,500 crore, which was conditional on the resignation of Goyal from the board. A shutdown of Jet Airways and consequent job losses would have been a setback for the Narendra Modi administration, ahead of national polls.
According to the new plan, both Goyal and Etihad will transfer all their shares, 51% and 24% stakes, respectively, in the airline to an independent trust managed by trustees, who will be appointed by the lenders. The trustees will have a call option on the shares owned by the trust at  ₹150 apiece. The resolution plan is subject to approval by various stakeholders.
A call option is a pact between two parties wherein the buyer earns a right to exercise the option to purchase a particular asset from the call option seller within a set period of time. Once the buyer exercises the option, the seller has to sell the asset at the originally agreed price.
After the shares of Jet are placed in a trust, an issuance of new capital in the form of an equity infusion of  ₹5,135 crore through a rights issue at  ₹150 per share will take place, which will see participation from two unidentified investors that will invest  ₹1,700 crore and  ₹2,100 crore, respectively, according to the details of the plan.
Following this, the domestic lenders will write off debt worth  ₹2,600 crore, while foreign lenders led by Dubai-based Mashreq Bank and HSBC will take a total haircut of  ₹1,170 crore. The resolution plan believes that Jet’s lenders will still make a gain of  ₹2,636 crore on the assumption that Jet’s share price will rise to  ₹300 by March 2022. There will not be any write-down by any of the airline’s lessors and creditors. The resolution plan estimates an overall need of  ₹10,645 crore to sustain Jet’s operations, including  ₹4,094 crore overdue to creditors, an estimated loss of  ₹2,700 crore, settlement of unsecured dues worth  ₹1,170 crore to HSBC, Mashreq, etc., cash balance requirement of  ₹1,248 crore and paying  ₹1,433 crore to the US Exim Bank. To be sure, the estimated loss could be more as the airline has grounded dozens of planes, which has affected its operations.
The resolution plan aims to meet Jet’s needs through the new cash equity infusion of  ₹5,135 crore, refinancing of aircraft loans and additional secured facilities worth  ₹2,400 crore for 10 Boeing 777s, cash receivables by the International Air Transport Association of  ₹725 crore, sale and leaseback of at least three Airbus A330 planes and  ₹2,000 crore in non-fund based facilities. In doing so, the proposed exposure of lenders to Jet will increase by  ₹3,081 crore to  ₹8,859 crore.
After the conversion of the loans into equity, lenders will be allotted 114 million shares of the airline equivalent to a 50.1% stake in the firm. The trust that will subsume shares of Goyal and Etihad will hold 37.4%, with public shareholders holding the remainder.
Once the trust sells a part of these shares and the rights issue takes place that will induct two new shareholders, the structure of the company will change. The two new investors will hold stakes of 19.9% and 24.6%, respectively, in the airline. The holdings of the banks, public shareholders and trust will reduce to 29.9%, 10.7% and 14.9%, respectively.
Emails seeking comments from Jet Airways, Mashreq, HSBC and SBI remained unanswered till press time. An Etihad spokesperson said the airline “continues to work closely with lenders, Jet management and key stakeholders to facilitate a solution for Jet Airways""."

NEW DELHI :
Indian aviation watchdog DGCA has approved the summer schedule of flights of Jet Airways from 31 March to 25 April only, according to an official document.
The summer schedule of flights of all other domestic airlines such as Vistara, IndiGo, Air India and GoAir have been approved till 26 October, according to the document.
The summer schedule begins on 31  March, 2019 for all the airlines.
As per the international practice, DGCA approves two flight schedules in a year, namely, 'summer schedule' effective from Sunday of the last week of March and 'winter schedule' effective from Sunday of the last week of October.
A major crisis at the struggling Jet Airways was averted Sunday after its pilots' body, National Aviator's Guild (NAG), deferred till 15 April its call for halting operations.
The NAG, which claims to represent around 1,100 of the 1,600 Jet Airways pilots, had announced earlier that its members will not fly from April 1, unless their salary dues were cleared and clarity was provided on future payments by March 31.
On 25 March, Jet Airways' board approved a resolution plan formulated by SBI-led domestic lenders. Under the plan, lenders decided to take control of the airline and make a fund infusion of  ₹1,500 crore.
Consequently, the stake of promoter Naresh Goyal has come down to 25.5% from 51%, while that of Abu Dhabi's Etihad Airways, which had a 24 per cent stake in the carrier, came down to 12%.

New Delhi: The sale of electoral bonds has skyrocketed ahead of Lok Sabha Elections 2019 by 62% as compared to last year with State Bank of India (SBI) selling bonds worth more than  ₹1,700 crore, an RTI reply shows. In an RTI response to Pune-based Vihar Durve, SBI said that in 2018, it had sold bonds worth  ₹1,056.73 crore in March, April, May, July, October and November. This year, in January and March, the bank has sold electoral bonds worth  ₹1,716.05 crore.
India goes to polls this month with first phase of voting to take place on 11 April.
The sale of electoral bonds opens in SBI branches when the union finance ministry issues notification of the sale for a given period.
According to SBI data, Mumbai bought electoral bonds worth  ₹495.60 crore, the highest in India, followed by Kolkata ( ₹370.07 crore), Hyderabad ( ₹290.50 crore), Delhi ( ₹205.92 crore) and Bhubaneswar ( ₹194 crore).
The electoral bonds scheme, notified by the central government in 2018, has been challenged in the Supreme Court. Only the political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) and which secured not less than 1% of the votes polled in the last general election shall be eligible to receive the electoral bonds.
The bonds may be purchased by a person who is a citizen of India ""or incorporated or established in India,"" the government had said in a statement last year. The electoral bonds remain valid for 15 days and can be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with the authorised bank within that period only.
A voluntary group working in the field of electoral reforms, Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) has demanded a stay on the sale while Communist Party of India (Marxist), or COM, has challenged it before the Supreme Court in separate petitions.
ADR recently filed an application in the apex court seeking stay on the Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018, which was notified by the Centre in January last year. It said that amendments carried out in relevant Acts have ""opened the floodgates to unlimited corporate donations to political parties and anonymous financing by Indian as well as foreign companies which can have serious repercussions on the Indian democracy"".
The EC, which has filed affidavit in the apex court, said that on 26 May 2017, it had written to the Ministry of Law and Justice about its views that the changes made in the Income Tax Act, the Representation of People Act and the Finance Act would be against the endeavour to have transparency in funding to political parties."

MUMBAI :
Bank of Baroda on Monday said the amalgamation of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank it from Monday is unlikely to bring in much changes in the financials of the combined entity, including non-performing assets.
The three-way merger, the first in the country, makes BoB the third largest lender after State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, and the second largest among state-run banks, with a combined business of  ₹15 lakh crore, of which deposits are  ₹8.75 lakh crore and advances are at  ₹6.25 lakh crore.
""Looking at capital adequacy ratio for December 2018 quarter, the numbers don't change magically as the pluses of one (Vijaya) are offsetting the minuses of the other (Dena). So net numbers of the combined entity is close to where BoB has been in terms of core capital,"" managing director & chief executive PS Jayakumar told PTI in an interaction.
He said as of the December quarter, CET1 of BoB was 8.65% and on a consolidated level it would be 8.67 percent. Of this, on a standalone basis, BoB's tier 1 capital stood at 9.86 %  and at the combined level it would also be 9.86% .
As far as net NPA is concerned, for BoB it was 4.26% in the December quarter. Given the fact that Dena has much higher NPAs, the new NPA numbers for the combined entity is marginally higher at 4.80%, he said.
""Yes, net NPA has increased but it is not a blow up by any means, and at 4.8% but this is something that we can address over the next two quarters,"" Jayakumar said.
He said in absolute terms, net NPA of BoB stood at around  ₹19,000 crore and this would move to  ₹30,000 crore on a combined basis and he hopes to see improvement in the combined numbers from the first quarter of FY20.
""We are at the end phase of NPA-related challenges. In general, everybody is expecting the recovery cycle to begin from now on. I'd think that positive movement should start from the March quarter itself,"" he said.
Ahead of the merger, government had infused  ₹5,042 crore capital into the bank, and he said he will not require any immediate capital.
From now on, all customers of Dena Bank, which is under prompt corrective action of the RBI, will have renewed access to credit facilities immediately, he said, adding credit growth of BoB and Vijay have been at 15-18% and it will continue to grow at the same pace.
Jayakumar said plans are also afoot to build on the strengths of individual banks and their gain from their synergies and scale up operations by deepening relationships with a wider customer base.
By the end of this month, BoB will bring in interoperability of the key banking services at all the 9,500 branches of the combined entities which would now be known as BoB also the 13,400 ATMs.
He said IT integration is expected to be completed over the next 12-18 months when accounts of all three banks will be migrated to single core-banking system. BoB is now on the version 10 of Finnacle, while Dena and Vijaya are on a different versions of Finnacle.
Ruling out a massive branch mergers, Jayakumar said in rural areas the overlaps are very thin, but in around 1,000 urban centres, the bank will be looking at relocating branches to areas.
Similarly, he also ruled out retrenchment as he does not see redundancy in extra-staff as there are many sectors where BoB is not present and would now focus on those areas. The combined entity will have a workforce of over 85,000.
""Our total number of employees is not going to shrink. We will, in fact, be in an expansionary mode as we need different kind of talents such as a larger outbound sales force, more competencies in analytics and artificial intelligence,"" he said, adding so there is not plan on the table to bring in a voluntary retirement scheme.
Amalgamation of Dena and Vijaya with BoB is the second merger during the past five years. The State Bank had merged five of its associate banks--that of Patiala, Bikaner & Jaipur, Mysore, Travancore and Hyderabad as also the Bhartiya Mahila--in April 2017, making SBI the 48th largest lender in the world with a balance sheet of USD 500 billion.
The BoB counter closed 3.2% up at  ₹132.85 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex rallied 0.51%to close at a near-life time high of 38,871.87.

LONDON :
Embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya on Wednesday faced yet another legal battle to prevent a consortium of Indian banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) getting access to nearly £260,000 in a UK bank account.
The 62-year-old is contesting an interim debt order obtained by the Indian banks in January this year, which relates to funds in the former Kingfisher Airlines boss’ current account with ICICI Bank in London.
At a hearing before Master David Cook at the Queen's Bench Division of the court, Mallya's legal team sought a dismissal of the interim order. A judgment in the case is expected at a later date.
""The hearing concerns an interim third-party debt order obtained by the banks in January and relates to funds worth just short of £260,000 in Dr Mallya's current account with ICICI Bank in London,"" said a spokesperson for TLT LLP, the law firm representing the Indian banks.
""This is part of the banks' ongoing efforts to enforce the (Indian) Debt Recovery Tribunal judgment against Dr Mallya in the UK. Dr Mallya is opposing the application and asking that the court discharges the interim order. If it is made final, the funds will be released to the banks,"" the spokesperson explained.
The case is part of wider efforts by SBI and 12 other Indian banks – Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd – to recover some of the funds owed to them as a result of unpaid loans by Mallya's now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.
In a ruling in May last year, a UK High Court judge had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya's assets and upheld an Indian court's ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly £1.145 billion.
TLT LLP has been representing the banks in their efforts to recover their dues as part of the worldwide freezing order, including a bankruptcy petition aimed at seizing his assets to recover dues filed at the end of last year.
Mallya had been granted £20,000 in weekly allowance as a result of the worldwide freeze order after his legal team made representations to the court to hike the initial £5,000 weekly allowance.
Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail after his extradition was ordered by Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December last year and signed off by UK home secretary Sajid Javid in February.
He has since filed an application in the UK High Court seeking leave to appeal against that order, with the papers now awaiting a judge's ruling on whether it should be rejected or can move to a hearing stage."

Vijay Mallya, the ex-billionaire known as the “king of good times"" in India, may have to prepare for a bout of relative austerity as he fights multiple lawsuits against creditors.
Mallya’s lawyers told State Bank of India, which is among lenders owed 1.142 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) by his defunct Kingfisher Airlines, that their client is willing to cut his spending to 29,500 pounds a month, SBI’s lawyers told a London court Wednesday. He is currently spending about 18,300 pounds a week.
The banks are seeking to seize about 258,000 pounds held in Mallya’s ICICI Bank UK Plc account. They have accused Mallya of willfully defaulting on debts of Kingfisher Airlines, which was founded in 2005 and folded in 2012. The U.K. resident is fighting his extradition to India to face criminal fraud charges.
Mallya, who added a portfolio of real estate, yachts, Scotch whisky and Formula 1 racing to his United Breweries Ltd. business over the last two decades, continues to live a “lavish lifestyle,"" according to a written application from SBI’s lawyers. Mallya “is suffering no real hardship as would be understood by the man on the street,"" the lawyers said. He has other sources of income including a 7,500-pound monthly payment from Kingfisher Beer Europe Ltd. and his family’s wealth, much of which is tied up in trusts, SBI’s lawyers said.

“Dr. Mallya continues to do all he can to support a court process in India which should see creditors paid off in full,"" Jonathan Isaacs, his lawyer, said in an emailed statement. “No one creditor should be allowed to break rank and grab assets at the expense of all other creditors. Dr. Mallya meanwhile lives well within the court-ordered limits and looks forward to its conclusion in the coming months.""

MUMBAI :
Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd has deferred paying salaries for March as the cash-strapped carrier continues to battle its financial woes. Jet Airways’ chief people officer Rahul Taneja informed employees on Wednesday that an update would be provided by 9 April on the status of last month’s salaries.
“...Please be assured that we continue to strive and are in continuous deliberations with the lenders and institutions to find a solution. In light of the current situation, please note that salaries for March 2019 will be deferred,"" Taneja said in an email, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint.
“We would like to assure you that we are making every possible effort to remit salaries at the earliest and we request you to bear with us through these difficult times,"" Taneja said in the email.
Jet Airways, which has been struggling to continue flying, has yet to pay salaries since January to a section of its staff—including pilots, engineers and general managers.
It has also deferred interest and lease rental payments, forcing lessors to ground dozens of Boeing planes of Jet Airways including 15 aircraft on Tuesday. Jet Airways has about 80 Boeing 737 planes in its fleet of 115 planes, according to its website.
On Wednesday, Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal said in a statement that he has agreed to “each and every term and condition"" of the state-run lenders “in order to secure a sustainable future for Jet Airways"".

“It is my fervent desire that Jet Airways not only survives but continues to provide meaningful employment and growth opportunities to every employee and continues to offer our incomparable joy of flying to our patrons for a long time to come,"" Goyal said.
Lenders to Jet Airways, led by the State Bank of India, took temporary control of the airline last week and said they expect to find new investors for the airline by the end of May.
A spokesperson for regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said Jet Airways is flying 28 aircraft as of Wednesday. Some of the airline’s wide-body aircraft, Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 aircraft, are flown only on international routes. Jet Airways also operates some of its narrow-body Boeing 737 planes on international routes.
A spokesperson for Jet Airways did not comment on the fleet size.
A government official said that “at present, there are no plans to review Jet Airways’ international operations"".
Indian airlines are required to operate a fleet of at least 20 aircraft on domestic routes to qualify for flying international sectors.
In a regulatory filing, Jet Airways said the “airline is operating a curtailed schedule with sufficient number of aircraft, and is compliant with applicable guidelines,"" it added.

New Delhi: Lessors to Jet Airways Ltd are planning to ask the aviation regulator to de-register many more planes leased to the airline, three sources said, signalling a planned bailout of the debt-laden carrier is failing to assuage their concerns.
About six lessors are expected to apply to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to de-register up to 15 planes that have already been grounded, over the next 10 days, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
This is in addition to the five planes that MC Aviation Partners, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp, applied on Friday to de-register, the source said.
Once de-registered, lessors can take the plane out of the country and lease them to other airlines.
While some lessors have already taken their planes out after a mutual agreement with Jet, sources say the latest applications to do so are on a non-consensual basis.
This deepens the crisis for Jet that has had to ground more than three-quarters of its fleet of 119 planes, many due to non-payment to lessors, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations.

It was not immediately clear which of its lessors were planning to apply for de-registration in the coming days.
About 100 of Jet's 119 mainly Boeing planes are leased by companies such as Avolon, GE Capital Aviation Services and AerCap Holdings.
Avolon, one of the world's biggest aircraft lessors, on Thursday applied to the DGCA to take two of its planes placed with Jet outside of India, making it the first to pull planes out on a non-consensual basis.
""The lessors are really hassled,"" said one of the sources, declining to be identified as the discussions were private.
""Nobody wants to take risks.""
Jet, India's oldest private carrier now controlled by its lenders, did not respond to requests for comment.
Reflecting the overall risk-off sentiment, Indian Oil halted jet fuel supplies to the airline from Friday noon, saying it hopes to soon resolve payment issue with Jet.
Down to the wire
India is keen to save Jet to prevent thousands of job losses, which could potentially dent sentiment days ahead a federal election in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to secure a second term.
Jet's lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), last month agreed to bailout the airline in a complex deal that involved the banks taking a majority stake in the company, while they continue looking for a new investor, and providing a fresh loan of $218 million.

The lenders said late on Thursday they intended to push forward with their plan but offered no clarity on the interim funding.
Also read: Are Jet Airways’ desperate lenders throwing good money after bad?
Some lessors have been sceptical about whether this proposed bailout can clear their dues on time. Several have not been paid for five to six months, a source has told Reuters.
""It's getting down to the wire. If nothing comes out by next week, I think it's done,"" said another source.
After Kingfisher Airlines' disorderly collapse in 2012, India modified rules in line with the Cape Town convention, an international treaty that makes it easier for foreign lessors to repossess aircraft during payment defaults.
In theory, lessors have the option to file a complaint with the DGCA, which in turn can cancel a plane's registration within five working days. But this is subject to some conditions such as clearing dues owed to airport operators, fuel vendors, tax authorities and other private entities.
The government also needs to revise some local laws that conflict with the full implementation of the convention, making it a more complicated process in India than in some other countries.

Mumbai: Indian Oil Corp. Ltd stopped supplying aviation fuel to Jet Airways (India) Ltd at noon on Friday before rescinding its decision hours later, after the government likely stepped in to avert a crisis at the cash-strapped airline.
The decision to stop providing fuel to Jet Airways took effect from noon on Friday across the country because of non-payment of dues, an Indian Oil spokesperson said.
The decision was rolled back at around 4.30pm.
Later, a senior Indian Oil official said on condition of anonymity that Jet Airways hadn’t paid its dues yet. The official, however, did not say how much the airline owes the New Delhi-based public sector company.
A Jet Airways spokesperson confirmed that Indian Oil had resumed supply of ATF but did not comment on whether the airline had cleared its dues, and what had led to Indian Oil rescinding its decision.
An industry official said it is likely that the government had stepped in to ask Indian Oil to extend a credit line which would have allowed it to resume fuel supplies and for Jet Airways to continue operations.
Queries sent to the civil aviation secretary did not yield any response till press time.
Jet Airways, which has been struggling to continue its operations, hasn’t paid salaries to a section of its staff since January. Recently, the airline informed its employees that the disbursal of March salaries, too, would be deferred.
Jet Airways has been unable to cope with rising costs and has also deferred interest and lease rental payments to lessors. Lessors have either grounded or repossessed aircraft earlier leased to the Mumbai-headquartered airline.
Lenders to Jet Airways said on Thursday that bids for a stake sale in the airline will be invited on Saturday and these will have to be submitted by 9 April.
The Jet Airways stake sale will be completed in a time-bound manner, said lenders led by State Bank of India. However, if there are no satisfactory bids, the lenders may also explore initiating bankruptcy proceedings against the beleaguered airline.
Jet Airways is waiting for a cash infusion pledged by its lenders for paying aircraft lessors and clearing part of the salary dues.
Jet Airways also needs to quickly re-induct its grounded planes. The airline, which is operating only about 26 of its original fleet of 119 aircraft, cannot afford to let the numbers go below 20, as that could trigger a government review of whether it can continue to fly international routes.

The bidding process for stake sale in the cash-starved Jet Airways is likely to commence from Monday as the bid document is still to be given a final shape, a source said.
The SBI-led consortium of 26 lenders, which now has the management control of the full-service carrier under a debt-recast plan, last Thursday said bid for the stake sale in Jet Airways airline would be issued on 6 April.
""The expression of interest (EoI) for stake sale in Jet Airways will now be issued Monday (April 8),"" said the source.
Accordingly, the last date for submission of the bids, which was April 9 earlier, is also likely to be extended by a day to April 10, he said.
SBI is the lead lender to Jet Airways, which has a debt burden of  ₹8,000 crore.
Under the debt resolution plan approved by the Jet Airways' board on March 25, lenders have taken majority stake in the airline and are set to infuse  ₹1,500 crore funds. Besides, the carrier's founder and promoter Naresh Goyal as well as his wife Anita Goyal quit the board. The shareholding of Goyals have come down to 25 per cent from 51 per cent earlier.
Acute financial crunch has forced the airline to ground aircraft, cancel flights and delay payment of salaries, including to pilots.

The SBI-led consortium of banks to the ailing airline had last week said that bid for the stake sale in Jet Airways would be issued on 6 April, and the deadline for submission would be 9 April. This had since then been postponed.
Jet Airways, which has been struggling to continue flying, has yet to pay salaries since January to a section of its staff—including pilots, engineers and general managers. It has lease rental payments, forcing lessors to ground a large part of its fleet. It has also deferred scheduled interest to banks.
As a result, a consortium of lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) took control of Jet Airways, in March, promising to throw open a bidding contest for a new investor that is expected to be completed in the June quarter.
The lenders had in February agreed to convert a portion of the airline's debt into equity by agreeing to take a 50.5% stake in Jet Airways, nominate two members to its board and make a cash infusion of about Rs1,500 crore into the airline, which is likely to take care of some of the immediate issues faced by the airline such as delay in payments to employees, lessors and others.
However, recently the Supreme Court of India quashed Reserve Bank of India's February 12, 2018 circular, which prescribed rules for recognising one-day defaults by large corporates and called for insolvency action as a remedy.
Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal had on 25 March agreed to step down from their respective positions in the airline. As a result, Naresh Goyal also ceases to be the chairman of the company."

That’s why planes now have oval windows. The more significant consequence of the investigation, though, was the installation of a near-indestructible flight data recorder, the black box, in every aircraft. The aviation industry is remarkable for its good safety record—and that’s because mistakes are learned from, rather than concealed.
It’s the kind of thinking that has entered management parlance—the term “black box thinking"" was coined by Matthew Syed. The idea that makes black box thinking so compelling is: Success is possible only when we confront mistakes. It is about creating cultures that enable organizations to learn from errors, rather than feeling threatened by them. A little bit of black box thinking could have helped Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal course-correct at any point in his journey and, perhaps, avoid the descent of the once-revered airline into near bankruptcy.
“A black box records thousands of pieces of data per second, including the pilots’ conversations in the cockpit, making it easier to determine the exact cause of a crash. No industry takes mistakes more seriously than airlines…With each crash, future flights became safer. This principle is an exquisite mental tool that can be applied to other areas of life—and lets call it black box thinking,"" writes Rolf Dobelli in his book, The Art of the Good Life. It’s ironical that Goyal didn’t adopt black box thinking despite operating in the industry. First, Goyal refused to change his management style, which was often criticized. There were enough warning signals: in five years, Jet had seven CEOs, including three acting CEOs.
Steve Forte, who led Jet in the early 2000s, told the Economic Times if Goyal continued in the cockpit, “the airline will burn through any new cash infusion"". Lenders and Jet’s partner Etihad said Goyal giving up control was a pre-condition to supporting the airline. Going by black box thinking principles, when people don’t accept errors, they don’t even know they have made one.
Second, experts posit that signs of Jet’s trouble showed soon after it acquired low-cost carrier (LCC) Air Sahara in 2007. Goyal bought the down-and-out airline for a huge price, all to ensure that Jet remained the only private airline to fly abroad.
Goyal’s idea to compete with IndiGo and Kingfisher proved to be disastrous. Dabbling in both full service and LCC markets, Jet couldn’t integrate Air Sahara, which resulted in confusion among customers and drained management resources. “Success is not just dependent on before-the-event reasoning, it is also about after-the-trigger adaptation,"" says black box thinking.
Third, Goyal could not learn from the mistakes of Kingfisher Airlines, which was a live case study on what could go wrong. According to a 3 October Business Today report, a couple of months before the airline was almost grounded, the carrier struggled to pay its 7,000-plus employees. It had to cancel flights after pilots reported sick to protest non-payment of salaries. When the Vijay Mallya-run airline was grounded, it had an outstanding debt of  ₹7,000 crore, and a negative net worth of  ₹12,919 crore.
Compare that to Jet Airways. It has also been reportedly defaulting on employees’ salaries. Jet Airways has a debt of over  ₹8,200 crore and needed to make repayments of up to  ₹1,700 crore by the end of March, besides a negative net worth of over  ₹7,000 crore. Following a trajectory similar to Kingfisher should have set the alarm bells ringing and avoid repeating mistakes which were internal and under their control. “If we wish to fulfil our potential as individuals and organizations, we must redefine failure,"" says black box thinking.
To be fair, there are factors beyond control—changes in external environment such as price of jet fuel and rupee depreciation. Aviation business is cyclical, which makes airlines prone to bankruptcies every few years. To quote Warren Buffet: “The worst sort of business is one that grows rapidly, requires significant capital to engender growth, and then earns little or no money. Think airlines. Here, a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers.""

617,2019-04-09,State Bank,"Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa AG and Blackstone Group said to be in fray to buy a stake in Jet AirwaysOn offer is a controlling interest, defined as 31.2-75% of the equity capital in Jet Airways to save it from bankruptcy

Mumbai: Bankers to debt-laden Jet Airways (India) Ltd, led by State Bank of India (SBI) have approached foreign airlines—including Air France-KLM, Delta Air Lines and Deutsche Lufthansa AG—and buyout firms such as Blackstone Group LP, offering them as much as 75% of the Indian airline in a bid to save it from bankruptcy, said a person directly aware of the developments.
According to bid documents prepared by the lenders, strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector.
For financial investors, qualifying conditions are minimum assets under management (AUM) of  ₹2,000 crore or at least  ₹1,000 crore in committed funds for investment in Indian firms or assets, according to the expression of interest document that was made available to prospective bidders and reviewed by Mint. Potential bidders must submit their interest by Wednesday.
A clearer picture on the bidders would emerge only after the close of bidding, the person said, requesting anonymity.
On offer is a controlling interest, defined as 31.2-75% of the equity capital, in India’s oldest surviving airline outside government control, the document said.
Analysts said Jet Airways could generate robust investor interest.
“This is a good opportunity for a player seeking to enter the Indian aviation market or is already there and wants to grow inorganically,"" said Dhiraj Mathur, who was until recently a partner and leader of aerospace and defence at PwC India.
A successful transaction will, however, depend on the valuation of the asset and the complexity of the Jet Airways stake sale, said Hetal Gandhi, director at Crisil Research.
In case a consortium is bidding for Jet Airways, it needs to limit itself to three members, with shareholding of an individual member not exceeding 15%.
The consortium is also required to be represented by a lead member, who will take decisions on behalf of the grouping.
If the consortium is made up of companies, its net worth will be the weighted average of the net worth of the individual members.
On the other hand, if the bidding consortium comprises financial investors, minimum AUM of the consortium will be calculated as weighted average of individual members or committed funds available.
State-run firms, government agencies, government-promoted funds and quasi-sovereign wealth funds are also eligible to directly procure bidding documents and submit their bids, the bid document said. 
KLM, Delta and Lufthansa did not respond to emailed queries. 
Blackstone Group declined to comment.
Burdened by high operating costs and a huge debt, Jet Airways has been struggling to stay afloat. Its fleet has shrunk to 26 planes from 119 just before it defaulted on interest payments on 31 December. Since January, it hasn’t paid salaries to a section of its staff, including pilots and engineers, and lessors have taken possession of planes after the airline failed to pay rents.
Lenders, led by the State Bank of India, took control of Jet Airways in March and forced its founder Naresh Goyal to relinquish all roles in the carrier in order to resolve the crisis.
The lenders had in February decided to convert a portion of the airline’s debt into equity by agreeing to take a 50.5% stake in Jet Airways, nominate two members to its board and make a cash infusion of about  ₹1,500 crore into the airline. But the lenders are yet to convert their debt into equity.
Industry executives Mint spoke with said some private equity investors and sovereign wealth funds might find Jet Airways an attractive investment. “With the founder stepping down from the board, the stake sale process of Jet Airways could attract interest from a lot of interested parties, including airlines, PE funds as well of sovereign wealth funds,"" said an executive with a rival airline, who didn’t want to be named.
“Whoever gets the airline will have serious work ahead to restore confidence in the brand, which has taken a beating in the past few months,"" the person added.
On 25 March, Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita stepped down from the airline’s board of directors. Naresh Goyal also ceased to be the chairman.

MUMBAI :
Mumbai: India's largest bank, State Bank of India (SBI), has reduced its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points (bps) across tenors. The one-year MCLR was cut from 8.55% to 8.5% effective 10 April.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
SBI has also reduced its home loan rate by 10 bps for loans of up to  ₹30 lakh, in a move that has provided relief to home loan borrowers. The new rate for housing loans will be 8.6-8.9%.
Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last week, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
On Monday, the largest private sector bank HDFC Bank Ltd had reduced its MCLR by 5-10bps. The bank’s one-year MCLR stands revised at 8.7%.
The central bank has reduced its key policy rate by 50bps over two consecutive rate cuts since February.
In response, the lenders have not been able to pass on the entire benefit to customers because of tight liquidity conditions.

SBI Mutual Fund recorded the second fastest growth rate at 30% despite its already huge size. “Among the fund houses that grew the largest in FY18-19, the AUM growth of SBI Mutual Fund is likely to be the result of ETF (exchange-traded fund) inflows.

On the other hand, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd saw a 24% contraction in AUM, while Sundaram Asset Management Co. Ltd witnessed an 11% contraction.
A financial planner, on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the contraction in Sundaram Mutual Fund may be on account of a clampdown on closed-end funds by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The regulator capped the total expense ratio (TER) for closed-end equity schemes at 1.25% and non-equity schemes at 1% through a notification issued in September 2018.

Mumbai: The fate of debt-laden Jet Airways India Ltd., the country’s oldest surviving private airline, could be determined as soon as a creditor-imposed deadline for takeover bids runs out on Wednesday.
Creditors led by State Bank of India (SBI) had not received any bids for as much as 75% of Jet Airways as of Tuesday, though that doesn’t mean that offers won’t come in on the final day, people familiar with the matter said, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter. Questions abound from potential bidders, including debt levels and how much of a stake will actually be available for sale, the people said.
There’s much at stake beyond the troubled airline, which once represented a cornerstone of the Indian travel market. The deal will be pivotal for creditors seeking to recover more than $1 billion in debt from the carrier, which has posted losses in nine of the past 11 years and had to ground planes amid its liquidity challenges. The fate of Jet Airways, which employs more than 20,000 people, is also crucial to the legacy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he faces an election that begins 11 April after holding power for the last five years.
“I am not very optimistic that they will get any investors coming in and with a large part of its fleet grounded,' said Jitender Bhargava, aviation expert and former director of Air India. “The future of the airline looks very bleak unless some kind of divine intervention takes place.""
Representative for State Bank of India and Jet Airways declined to comment.

“There is a limit to the credit one could extend to a customer. The terms of supply with the Indian Oil Corp. is the most attractive an airline could get. Once payment is made, supplies will resume,"" said this person.

New Delhi: A delay in interim funding, amid lender-driven stake sale and bailout plan, has cost Jet Airways (India) Ltd dear.
On Thursday, Jet Airways grounded 10 more flights due to non-payment of dues to aircraft lessors even as bidding process for up to 75% stake in the airline continued. 
Jet Airways now is operating about 70 flights a day compared to over 600 flights that it used to fly daily before the financial crisis struck more than six months ago.
On 25 March, Jet Airways informed the stock exchanges about a bailout plan involving conversion of part of lenders’ debt into equity, changes in the board of directors and an “immediate interim finance from"" banks to the tune of  ₹1,500 crore.
This ""immediate interim finance"" is yet to materialize, said a person familiar with the discussions between the airline and its lenders, led by State Bank of India.

With Jet Airways in dire straits, the infusion of fresh funds by a new investor has become critical to stave off a potential bankruptcy.
Jet Airways has salaries pending since January to a section of its staff, including pilots, engineers and general managers.

Lenders to Jet Airways, led by the State Bank of India, have also modified the terms of the stake sale process by allowing restructuring of debt and permission to infuse funds into the carrier through loans.
Interested bidders would also have to provide solvency certificates before they submit their initial bids, according to the document issued to interested bidders, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint.

Indian Oil had on 5 April stopped fuel supplies to Jet Airways but rescinded its decision within a few hours.
The SBI-led consortium took control of Jet Airways in late-March, promising to throw open a bidding contest for a new investor that is expected to be completed in the current quarter.

Mumbai: The employees union of Jet Airways (India) Ltd, which is facing its worst crisis, has sought to register first investigation reports (FIRs) against the airline's founder Naresh Goyal, chief executive officer Vinay Dube and SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar for non-payment of March salaries, even as passengers continued to bear the brunt of last-minute cancellations and missing refunds.
Over 200 Jet Airways employees, led by union president and NCP alwmaker Kiran Pawaskar, marched from the Mumbai airport to the airline's headquarters in Siroya Centre, Andheri, to meet CEO Dube. 
They, however, were only able to meet some members of the senior management. They then went to the police, seeking to register FIRs against Goyal, Dube and Kumar.
""We have to inform you that Jet has not paid our March salaries of date. We call upon you to register offences for cheating, criminal breach of trust, misappropriation of funds and other offences under relevant sections of the law,"" Pawaskar, who heads the All India Jet Airways Officers & Staff Association, said in a police complaint.
Before meeting the management, Pawaskar addressed the employees and blamed the government policies for the downfall of the airline. He also claimed that whatever the little money the airline is earning now is being used to make refunds to the passengers.
Passengers stranded at the Mumbai airport, however, claimed that they are not getting refunds and are being forced to shell out more for last-minute tickets.
""I had a flight to New Delhi this evening, but when I reached the airport I was informed that the flight was cancelled. When I sought the refund, I was told to collect it from my travel agent,"" said an aggrieved passenger.
The employee protests aside, Friday marked yet another day of hightened crisis at the airline. Jet Airways has suspended all its international flights till 15 April even as the the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) called an urgent meeting to resolve the situation at the beleaguered airline. 
Jet Airways is currently operating only 11 out of the 123 planes it had in operation before the financial crisis struck about six months ago.

It said Goyal had pledged over 29.5 million shares amounting to a 26.01% stake. Goyal owned 51% in Jet Airways at the end of 31 December, according to the latest company filing with stock exchanges.
A State Bank of India (SBI)-led lenders’ consortium took control of Jet Airways in late-March, promising to throw open a bidding contest for a new investor that is expected to be completed in the current quarter.
The lenders had in February agreed to convert a part of Jet Airways’ debt into equity by agreeing to take a 50.5% stake in the carrier, nominate two board members and make cash infusion of about  ₹1,500 crore into the airline.
However, the lenders are yet to convert their debt into equity. The Supreme Court had earlier this month quashed the Reserve Bank of India’s 12 February 2018 circular, which prescribed rules for recognizing one-day defaults by large corporates and called for insolvency action as a remedy.
The circular had directed lenders to refer any loan account over  ₹2,000 crore under the bankruptcy code if it was not resolved within 180 days of default. As of 30 September, the airline’s net debt was  ₹8,052 crore.
The SBI-led consortium oversaw the exit of Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita from the board of the airline. The lenders originally set 10 April evening as the deadline for submitting expressions of interest (EoIs) to buy a controlling stake of up to 75% in Jet Airways. This has been extended to 12 April.
Mint reported on 10 April that private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd and current Jet Airways shareholder Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways PJSC had submitted their EoIs, citing an unidentified person.
On Thursday, Jet Airways shares fell 1.14% to  ₹260.40 apiece on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.06% to end the day at 38,607.01 points."

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd founder Naresh Goyal has put in his bid for buying stake in the crisis-hit airline, said people aware of the development. Goyal quit as Jet Airways chairman in March under a bailout plan that saw lenders, led by State Bank of India, taking control of the airline. It could not be immediately ascertained whether Goyal has partnered with any entity or airline for the bid.
Friday marked the end of a bidding deadline to buy up to 75% stake in Jet Airways.
SBI Capital Markets has the mandate for the Jet Airways stake sale on behalf of the SBI-led consortium of domestic lenders to the debt-ridden private carrier.
The bidding norms allow Goyal to participate in the stake sale process.
""It could be financial investor, it could be airline...including Naresh Goyal himself or Etihad. Nobody is barred from bidding or taking over the airline as per the rule,"" SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar had said last month.
In March, Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal stepped down from the board of the airline, which has more than  ₹8,000 crore debt.
The ongoing Jet Airways crisis deepened Friday as the airline operated only 11 aircraft, leaving passengers stranded at various domestic and international airports. This prompted the prime minister's office (PMO) to hold an urgent meeting to discuss the situation.
According to people aware of that development, the meeting was called after civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu asked secretary of the department Pradeep Singh Kharola to review issues concerning Jet Airways.
On Friday, Jet Airways shares rose 0.02% to  ₹260.45 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.41% to end the day at 38,767.11."
600,2019-04-13,State Bank,"Civil aviation secretary says Jet Airways had a meeting with bankers on Friday where they put forth their funding requirementsJet Airways was supposed to get  ₹1,500 crore as interim funding as part of a bailout plan but lenders are releasing small amounts

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd, struggling to stay afloat and avoid being taken to the bankruptcy court, will on Monday meet with lenders—led by the State Bank of India (SBI)—with a fresh demand for interim funding. 
The airline has suspended its international operations till Monday afternoon.
SBI Capital Markets Ltd, which is managing a Jet Airways stake sale, got expressions of interest (EoI) from about five investors until about an hour before the end of a four-day window that ended on Friday.
These investors, including Jet Airways shareholder Etihad Airways PJSC, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and a couple of private equity funds, will now be asked to put in financial bids, a person privy to the development said before Friday’s deadline drew to a close.
An update on the Jet Airways stake sale process was awaited from SBI Caps at the time of publishing this story.
Civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said in Delhi that Jet Airways executives had a meeting with bankers on Friday where they put forth their funding requirements.
“Discussions on interim funding are on. They have been asked to rework their requirement. They will again approach their banks on Monday. The future course of action will be decided depending on what the banks decide,"" said Kharola.
The secretary said that Jet Airways was operating only 11 flights as of Friday, and the number could come down further.
However, a person familiar with the operations of the airline said that the company owns 16 aircraft that it has no reason to take them off from service.
Jet Airways' liquidity crisis could not have come at a worse time—the government is busy with Lok Sabha elections and officials are cautious about taking decisions in an environment of political uncertainty.
Kharola had a meeting with Nripendra Misra, principal secretary to the prime minister, on Friday but officials did not confirm if it had anything to do with Jet Airways. The government is keen to salvage the airline and prevent it from collapsing, but does not want to give ammunition to the opposition over any allegations that it went out of its way to support a private company.
Jet Airways had informed stock exchanges last month of a lender-led resolution plan under which it was to get  ₹1,500 crore in emergency funding. However, lenders have been releasing funds only in small amounts and the airline has found this insufficient for running its operations.
“Sadly, while the airline was supposed to get a cash infusion of  ₹1,500 crore, nothing has happened till now,"" said Kiran Pawaskar, a Nationalist Congress Party legislator, and a senior member of All India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association.
Pawaskar pointed out that airline staff are not getting paid and said that lenders should at least try to keep the airline afloat till the bidding process is completed. 
Mint had on 11 April reported that private equity (PE) firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, NIIF, and Etihad Airways have submitted their expressions of interest. 
“We will soon take legal recourse and also file FIRs against the management for salary delays,"" Pawaskar said.
Pilots of Jet Airways have also threatened to take legal action against the management of the cash-strapped airline if salaries pending for the last three months are not paid by 14 April. Aviation minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted on Friday that his ministry would “review issues related to Jet"" and “take steps to minimise passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety""."

New Delhi: Regular savings accounts require customers to maintain a minimum average balance (MAB). Generally, banks charge a penalty on non-maintenance of MAB in your saving accounts. The MAB amount and the penalty differ across banks, and also depends on the type of bank account you have. State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and other leading banks have fixed their monthly minimum average balance requirements according to the location of a customer's account. Banks also charge a penalty from customers who fail to maintain an average monthly balance in their savings account. The penalty varies on factors such as the location of a branch. The MAB is calculated by taking into account the balance maintained in an account on all days of the month.
Here are the MAB requirements and penalty charges levied for non-maintenance of balance by SBI, and Bank of Baroda (BoB):
State Bank of India: Customers having a regular savings bank account in SBI branches located in metro and urban areas are required to maintain a minimum average balance of  ₹3,000, in semi-urban branches  ₹2,000, and in rural branches  ₹1,000, according to the bank's website. Like other banks, SBI imposes penalties on non-maintenance of MAB in most savings accounts.
Currently, SBI imposes a charge of  ₹10- ₹15, besides GST, on accounts in metro and urban branches if MAB is not maintained. These charges vary between  ₹7.50 and  ₹12 in semi-urban branches while for rural branches the charges are between  ₹5 and  ₹10, plus GST. The amount of penalty is decided on the amount that falls short of MAB requirements for the particular category of account.
Bank of Baroda: Bank of Baroda (BoB), which has become the second largest public sector bank after SBI after its amalgamation with Bengaluru-based Vijaya Bank and Mumbai-based Dena Bank, has increased the minimum quarterly average balance requirements in its advantage savings account with effect from 1 February 2019.
The minimum quarterly average balance for BoB advantage savings accounts for urban and metro branches is  ₹2,000 and for semi-urban branches,  ₹1,000.
If a customer fails to maintain this in BoB advantage savings account, then the individual will be fined according to the prescribed slabs by the bank. The maximum charges for non-maintenance of minimum balance are  ₹200 for metro and urban branches and  ₹100 for semi-urban branches, according to a press release by the bank.
The Jan Dhan Yojana accounts and Basic Savings Bank Deposit Accounts are exempt from minimum balance requirements. Many banks also exempt salary accounts from this requirement."

MUMBAI :
The National Aviators Guild (NAG), representing three-fourths of all Jet Airways pilots, on Sunday evening, told its members to stop flying from midnight, after the management failed to pay salary dues as promised, before rescinding its decision hours later.
In a written communiqué, NAG told its members that its decision on not flying stands deferred for the time being.
“It has come to our notice that there is a critical meeting planned tomorrow morning with the airline management and SBI (State Bank of India). In light of the meeting, the members have been requested, through their team leaders, that the call of No Pay No Work be deferred to give the airline a chance of survival,"" it said.
Pilots have, however, been asked by NAG to be present at the company’s headquarters on Monday morning. “An Open House will be called shortly as per the availability of the venue and the committee members. We urge our members to be present in large numbers,"" it added.
On Saturday, the airline operated a mere 40 domestic flights using six to seven planes. International operations have been suspended till 15 April.
Last week, Jet pilots had threatened legal action against the management of the cash-strapped airline if pending salaries for the last three months were not paid by 14 April. Other employees who have not been paid since March had said on Friday they that will file a first information report (FIR) against the airline’s management for delaying salaries.
About 1,100 of the airline’s 1,500 pilots are NAG members. “There are several pilots in the airline that are not members of NAG. They are expected to continue to fly,"" said another NAG member.
Jet Airways has held back salaries since January to a section of its staff, including pilots, engineers and general managers. In addition, it has deferred March salaries to all its employees, as it continues to battle financial woes. The airline has also deferred interest payments to banks, and dues to fuel suppliers, oil marketing companies (OMCs) and aircraft lessors.
Last week, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) had twice stopped supplying fuel to Jet Airways before resuming supply.
Given Jet’s situation, IOCL, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd have seen demand drop by 20-30%, officials said. A BPCL official said the company has already invoked a Jet Airways bank guarantee.
An SBI-led lenders’ consortium took control of Jet Airways in late March, promising an auction that is expected to be completed in the current quarter.
The effort by the lenders has so far seen interest from private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd (NIIF), Etihad Airways PJSC, and founder Naresh Goyal, among others. With Jet Airways in dire straits, the infusion of fresh funds by a new investor has become critical to stave off a potential bankruptcy."

MUMBAI :
Jet Airways pilots body, the National Aviator's Guild (NAG), Sunday deferred its ""no flying"" call to a later date, particularly when the management is scheduled to meet the lenders on Monday.
Earlier in the day, the Guild, which has around 1,100 pilots as its members, decided to stop flying from April 15 in protest against non-payment of salaries since March.
""It is come to our notice that there is a critical meeting planned tomorrow (Monday) morning with the airline management and SBI.

Accordingly, as requested, the Committee would like to inform all that the decision stands deferred for the time being,"" the Guild committee said in a late evening communication to its members.
All pilots are still requested, however, to be present at Siroya Centre at 0930 hours on April 15 in their uniforms, it said.
Siroya Centre is Jet Airways headquarters in Andheri suburb in Mumbai.
According to NAG, it has also called upon other departments to join the gathering at the headquarters as a show of unity.
An Open House will be called shortly as per the availability of the venue and the committee members, the communication added.
The pilots, along with engineers and senior management, have not received salaries since January. The debt-ridden carrier has also not paid the March salary to employees of other categories as well.
""As on today, we have not been paid for nearly three-and-a-half months and we do not know when we will be paid. So we have decided to go ahead with our call of no-flying from April 15. All 1,100 pilots of NAG will stop flying from 10 am Monday,"" a Guild source said earlier in the day.
The NAG, which claims representation of around 1,100 pilots of the total 1,600 with the full service carrier, had in late March called for no flying from April 1 over non-payment of salaries.
However, on March 31, it deferred the agitation to April 15, saying it wanted to give more time to the new management.
Jet Airways is at present under the management control of SBI-led consortium of lenders after the approval of a debt-rejig plan last month, which also led its founder chairman Naresh Goyal to quit.

NEW DELHI :
More than a thousand pilots of India's debt-laden Jet Airways will not fly from on Monday as they have not been paid salaries for the past three months, the President of the National Aviators Guild said on Sunday.
Saddled with more than $1.2 billion of bank debt, the airline has been teetering for weeks and has yet to receive a loan of about $217 million from its lenders as part of a rescue deal agreed in late March.
""Pilots haven't been paid for the last three months,"" Capt Karan Chopra told Reuters.
The crisis at Jet has deepened in recent weeks as lessors have started applying to deregister planes, signalling the planned bailout had failed to assuage their concerns.
An urgent meeting to discuss the Jet situation was held at the prime minister's office on Friday, which was also attended by the country's aviation secretary, Pradeep Singh Kharola.
After the meeting, Kharola said the carrier had money to operate 6-7 planes over the weekend and after that the lenders would have to decide how many jets it could fly after Monday afternoon, news channel ET Now reported late on Friday.
Kharola said the company will meet bankers on Monday for an infusion of funds in the interim, the TV channel said.
According to a Business Standard newspaper report on Sunday, Jet's lenders, led by the State Bank of India, are considering a proposal to infuse 10 billion rupees ($144.55 million) to keep the airline afloat.
The money is expected to be disbursed after the Jet management submits an operational plan on how it intends to use the money till 7 May, the report said.
An SBI spokesman could not immediately comment on the emergency funding being considered by lenders for Jet Airways.
The lenders, who have been seeking a new investor to take a stake of up to 75% in the airline, hope to complete the selection of bidders by May 7.
Initial bids were to be submitted by the end 10 April, but SBI extended the deadline to 12 April.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, which owns a 24-percent stake in the airline, private equity fund TPG Capital, the government-owned sovereign fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and ousted chairman Naresh Goyal are among those to have submitted bids, the Business Standard reported."

Indore: A whopping 99.8% of donations received by political parties was through electoral bonds of the highest denominations —  ₹10 lakh and  ₹1 crore — between March 2018 and 24 January 2019, revealed data obtained under the RTI Act.
Donors purchased bonds worth  ₹1,407.09 crore of which  ₹1,403.90 crore were in the highest denominations of  ₹10 lakh and  ₹1 crore during the period.
Social worker Chandrashekhar Goud shared the data received from State Bank of India (SBI) through an RTI query.
The donors bought 1,459 electoral bonds of denomination of  ₹10 lakh and 1,258 bonds of  ₹1 crore denomination. They purchased 318 bonds of  ₹1 lakh, 12 bonds of  ₹10,000 and 24 bonds of  ₹1000 denomination, according to the RTI reply.

MUMBAI :
Jet Airways' survival remained under serious threat after its lenders Monday deferred a much-anticipated decision to provide emergency funds to the carrier following a marathon meeting, even as its pilots' union appealed to the lenders and the prime minister to save the airline.
Jet Airways chief executive Vinay Dube in an internal communication has said the lenders could not decide on the emergency funding and that the board of the airline will meet Tuesday to take a call on the future.
""As you are aware, we have been working with the lenders to secure interim funding for our operations. The interim funding has not been forthcoming thus far, and as a result we have extended cancellation of international operations until April 19.
""The current status of our engagement with the lenders and other related matters shall be placed before the board tomorrow morning, where the management will seek guidance from the board on the next steps forward. We will keep you updated on all critical developments,"" Dube said in a mail.
Jet Airways pilots' union, the National Aviators Guild had Sunday deferred a decision to strike from Monday saying that it wanted to give more time to the airline ahead of the lenders' meeting here.
On 25 March, the airline's board had approved 'the debt resolution plan', under which SBI-led consortium would provide an emergency loan of  ₹1,500 crore and in turn acquire majority stake, following which founder chairman Naresh Goyal and wife Anita would leave the airline and pare his stake to around 25 percent.
But banks have so far only under  ₹300 crore has been disbursed that too in small amounts, citing procedural delays. This left the airline cancelling hundreds of flights as the airline failed to pay the lease rentals.
Currently it has just six-seven planes for operations, way below its peak of 123 planes in December.
A meeting between the airline management and its major lender SBI last week also could not take a decision on the fund infusion.
""We were expecting some cash support at Monday's meeting but the lenders have told the airline that they are not going to provide any funds for now...We are disappointed,"" said a source in the pilots' union.
""If funds don't come by tomorrow, we apprehend that the airline will not sustain any longer,"" he said, adding much will depend on the outcome of the Tuesday board meeting.
Earlier in the day, the airline's pilot union along with engineers and cabin crew members assembled at its headquarters to show their solidarity over salary delays.
The airline's pilots along with engineers and senior staff were last paid for December 2018. This apart, the airline has also defaulted on the March salary of other categories of employees as well.
""We would like to appeal SBI to release  ₹1,500 crore funds to help the airline continue operations. We also appeal Prime Minister Narendra Modi to save 20,000 odd jobs at the airline,"" NAG vice-president Adim Valiani told reporters at the airline's headquarters here."

Even as the much-needed funding remains elusive for Jet Airways, merchant banker SBI Caps has started the process for sale of the financially troubled carrier for lenders.
The SBI Caps' legal team is working on the expressions of interest (EoIs) received from investors and bidders will be selected soon.
""The proposed equity conversion by banks, if any, will be undertaken as a transitory mechanism to facilitate the bidding-cum-sale process,"" the State Bank of India (SBI) said in a statement on Monday.
The SBI is acting on behalf of the group of lenders as part of the bank-led resolution process. Necessary support to facilitate the process is being extended by other banks in the consortium.
""Cooperation and support from all other stakeholders will be the key to the success of the process,"" SBI said.
The airline, which has been expecting  ₹1,500 crore interim funding from lenders, has failed to get that despite several meetings. The latest meeting with lenders on Monday too remained inconclusive.

MUMBAI :
Lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd are unlikely to consider an initial bid from Naresh Goyal, the airline’s ousted founder, to regain control of the debt-laden carrier, two people directly familiar with the bidding process said.
Goyal was allowed to submit an expression of interest (EoI) on the condition that he bid as part of a consortium with other investors where he would hold a minority stake, the people cited above said, requesting anonymity. Those conditions have not been met in his bid submitted on Friday. A final decision on the bid would be conveyed to Goyal after considering legal opinion, they said.
In March, Goyal was forced to cede control of the airline he had founded more than two decades ago, after Jet Airways, saddled with over $1 billion in debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors. Jet Airways’ fleet has now dwindled to 14, a fraction of the 119 aircraft it flew before its first default on 31 December. The airline has stopped international flights till Monday afternoon and significantly curtailed its domestic operations.
Creditors to Jet Airways had extended by two days a deadline for potential buyers to bid for as much as 75% of the carrier to Friday evening.
At least four bidders are likely to be shortlisted by early this week, according to the two people cited before. Current shareholder Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways PJSC and two other international airlines are among companies that had submitted initial bids, they said.
Mint reported on 11 April that India’s quasi-sovereign wealth fund National Investment and Infrastructure Fund Ltd, Etihad Airways and two other financial investors had shown interest.
“The majority view is that Naresh Goyal is ineligible to bid, but lenders are seeking legal opinion before declaring the names of the qualified bidders,"" said one of the people cited earlier.
Strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector. For financial investors, the qualifying conditions are minimum assets under management of  ₹2,000 crore or at least ₹1,000 crore in committed funds for investment in Indian firms or assets, according to the EoI document that was made available to prospective bidders and reviewed by Mint.
“Once the qualified bidders are finalized, they will be given access to Jet Airways’ data room,"" said the second person. “The final bids are expected to come by 9 May, though the date may change depending on how the process goes.""
“Since, this is an open bidding (to the public), I am not sure if SBI (State Bank of India) can disallow Naresh Goyal from bidding,"" said Mark Martin, chief executive of aviation consultancy firm Martin Consulting. “As to why he wants to bid for Jet Airways, we all know that he’s still very emotionally attached to the airline he founded over two and half decades ago.""
Goyal was not available for comment on the landline number listed in his latest address to Jet Airways staff. Emails sent to his official Jet Airways account bounced back.
Mint was the first to report on 3 August that Jet Airways was facing several challenges, including a surge in fuel prices, weaker rupee and intensifying competition, and had approached investment bankers to help sell a stake in the carrier.
The planned stake sale did not materialize and in March the lenders led by SBI agreed to take a 50.5% stake in Jet Airways and make a cash infusion of about  ₹1,500 crore to tackle urgent issues faced by the carrier such as delay in payments to employees, lessors and others. However, lenders have been releasing funds only in small amounts, which Jet Airways has found insufficient for running its operations.
Mint reported on 13 April that Jet Airways’ executives will meet lenders on Monday with a fresh demand for interim funding.
In a related development, pilots of Jet Airways have threatened to take legal action against the management if salaries pending for the last three months were not paid by Sunday.
Civil aviation minister Suresh Prabhu tweeted on Friday that his ministry would “review issues related to Jet"" and “take steps to minimize passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety""."

A home loan is probably the biggest loan that one takes. Not only in terms of the loan one pays can be double of what was borrowed. But a home loan is among the cheapest loans available, and usually it is the only way a person can buy a house. A home loan is called a ‘good’ loan because it helps you acquire a tangible asset that can appreciate over the long-term. It makes sense to buy a house if you plan to live in it.

MUMBAI :
Jet Airways pilots body, the National Aviator's Guild, Monday appealed the State Bank of India (SBI) to release  ₹1,500 crore, which was proposed to be infused in the ailing carrier as part of a debt-restructuring plan last month.
The airline is operating just 6-7 planes, with almost its entire fleet being grounded due to non-payment of rentals to lessors amid severe paucity of cash.
""We would like to appeal SBI to release  ₹1,500 crore funds for the airline to help it continue operations. We also appeal Prime Minister Narendra Modi to save 20,000 odd jobs at the airline,"" National Aviator's Guild ( NAG) vice president Adim Valiani told reporters at the airline's headquarter, Siroya Centre, here Monday.
Earlier, the airline's pilots, engineers and cabin crew members assembled at the headquarters to show their solidarity.
Jet Airways's pilots along with engineers and senior staff were last paid for December, 2018. This apart, the airline has also defaulted on the March salary of other categories of employees as well.
Last month, an SBI-led consortium of lenders had taken management control of the airline post a debt-recast deal, following which the lenders had proposed to infuse as much as  ₹1,500 crore to the carrier to keep it afloat till the time it gets a investor.
The Monday meeting with lenders is reportedly expected to take a final decision on the quantum of funds to be infused immediately to avert a possible shut down. A meeting between the airline management and its major lender SBI last Friday could not take a decision on the fund infusion issue.

Mumbai: Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners were shortlisted on Monday to place binding bids for Jet Airways (India) Ltd, although there is no clarity on the eligibility of founder Naresh Goyal to bid for a stake in the cash-strapped airline.
Two people aware of the ongoing Jet Airways stake sale process said a final decision on Goyal’s eligibility was expected by Tuesday, when the cash-strapped airline's lenders were also expected to formally declare the names of all eligible bidders. These bidders would be allowed access to Jet Airways’ data room before they can place binding bids by the end of May.
Meanwhile, Jet Airways chief executive Vinay Dube informed employees on Monday that the airline had extended a suspension on international flights by three days to Thursday because it was yet to receive interim funding from lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI).
Potential buyers were allowed to bid for as much as 75% of the carrier till Friday evening. Goyal, who was ousted from the airline in March, was allowed to submit an expression of interest (EoI) on the condition that he bid as part of a consortium with other investors where he would hold a minority stake. But those terms were not met in Goyal’s bid, the people cited earlier said, leading the lenders to take legal opinion before taking a final decision on the eligibility of the bid.
Among the bidders, NIIF had been exempted from submitting an EoI as it is a quasi-sovereign wealth fund and had automatically qualified for the next round, said the two people cited earlier.
The four bidders, including NIIF, would be “conducting independent due diligence of the airline"", the first person said. “However, there is a strong possibility that Etihad, TPG Capital and NIIF may form a consortium to jointly bid at a later stage.""
“The bidding process for orderly sale of equity in Jet Airways is currently being run by SBI Caps and is being vetted by the legal team. The prospective bidders will be shortlisted by SBI Caps shortly,"" said a spokesperson for SBI.
“The proposed equity conversion by banks, if any, will be undertaken as a transitory mechanism to facilitate the bidding-cum-sale process,"" the spokesperson added.
In March, Goyal was forced to give up control of Jet Airways after the airline, saddled with over $1 billion in debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors. Jet Airways’ operating fleet has dwindled to seven, a fraction of the 119 planes it flew before its first default on 31 December.
In his email to Jet Airways employees, Dube said, “Please note that the current status of our engagement with the lenders and other related matters shall be placed before the board in the meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning, where the management will seek guidance from the board on the next steps forward."" 
A copy of the email was reviewed by Mint.
Jet Airways on Monday met the lenders with a fresh demand for interim funds. 
The carrier, which is gasping for fresh funds, may see its operations grounded temporarily if it fails to raise money in the days ahead.
The airline had last week suspended international operations till 15 April.
Meanwhile, Jet Airways pilots on Monday morning gathered in front of the company’s headquarters in Andheri, Mumbai, to protest the delay in disbursement of salaries.
The airline has held back salaries since January to a section of its staff, including pilots, engineers and general managers. In addition, it has deferred March salaries to all its employees, as it continues to battle financial woes.
The National Aviator’s Guild (NAG), a union representing about two-thirds of Jet Airways pilots, on Sunday evening told its members to stop flying from midnight, before rescinding its decision hours later. About 1,100 of the airline’s 1,500 pilots are NAG members.
A senior Jet Airways pilot, who is a member of the NAG board, said that the airline’s management was yet to convey the decisions taken by the lenders during their meeting on Monday.
“We will decide on the next course of action after we meet member pilots of the union at open-house sessions in Mumbai and Delhi. We will then take a decision on whether we will continue flying,"" the pilot said on condition of anonymity.
Apart from deferred interest payments to banks, and dues to fuel suppliers and oil marketing companies, Jet Airways has put off lease payment to aircraft lessors, which has resulted in the grounding of most of its fleet.
On Wednesday, Jet Airways shares rose 0.52% to  ₹261.80 apiece on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.36% to end the day at 38,905.84 points."

Accordingly, the company now has investible funds to the tune of  ₹400 crore accumulated through business profits and sale of properties and shares (UPS Jetair Express Pvt. Ltd),"" the document said.
Jetair on Friday submitted a bid to buy Jet Airways from lenders who have put it up for sale, backed by companies in the US and the UK, The Economic Times reported on Monday.

In March, Goyal was forced to cede control of the airline that he had founded more than two decades ago, after Jet Airways, saddled with over $1 billion in debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors. 
Since January, the airline has not paid salaries to a section of its staff, including pilots and engineers, while lessors have taken possession of planes after the airline failed to pay fees. Creditors to Jet Airways had extended by two days a deadline for potential buyers to bid for as much as 75% of the carrier to Friday evening.
Earlier this month, Mint reported that strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector, citing documents seeking bids.

New Delhi: The fate of Jet Airways (India) Ltd remained uncertain with no revival plan or interim funding in sight. On Tuesday, Jet Airways lenders, led by State Bank of India (SBI), met financial services secretary Rajeev Kumar amid reports of a temporary shutdown that sent the airline's share price tumbling by as much as 19%.
While a discussion on Jet Airways’ revival is going on, no plan has been finalized, said Sunil Mehta, chief executive of Punjab National Bank. PNB is a part of the consortium of lenders that is carrying out debt resolution at the beleaguered airline. 
Mehta said SBI and SBI Capital Markets Ltd are working on the domestic carrier’s revival plan, which includes an emergency funding.
Jet Airways’ lenders have carried out a bidding process to sell up to 75% stake in the airline. On Monday, SBI said the bidding process was being vetted by a legal team and prospective bidders will be shortlisted by SBI CAPS shortly.

Lenders have released some amount in small tranches, which is insufficient to meet the airline's day-to-day operational costs.
The lack of funds has led to grounding of almost all Jet Airways planes. The airline, as of Monday, was operating only seven aircraft out of its original fleet of 119 before the financial crisis struck."

Mumbai: Lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd have refused funding to the cash-strapped carrier, according to people familiar with the situation, forcing the nation’s oldest surviving private airline to consider a temporary shutdown.
Bankers have confirmed that there’s no money coming in for now, the people said asking not to be identified as the matter is not public.
Jet Airways executives, including operational heads, are meeting in Mumbai Tuesday to take a call on complete halt of operations, according to two persons in the know, even as the failing airline scrambles to get a new investor.
A spokesman for the airline declined to comment.
Jet Airways, which broke into the monopoly of state-run Air India Ltd in the early 1990s, went in a tailspin after a slew of budget airlines started offering ultra-low fares which hurt its profits and led to a mountain of debt over the past decade. It’s now burdened with more than $1 billion in debt and unpaid dues to its employees and leasing firms.
Jet Airways' shares tumbled as much as 18.5% on Tuesday and closed 8.1% lower at  ₹240.5. S&P BSE Sensex advanced nearly 1%.
Agitating Pilots
The airline is now flying just seven planes, one of the people said, compared with 123 aircraft as of end-December, according to a company presentation. It was forced to ground 10 planes last week, suspend international flights and has seen pilots agitate over non-payment of salaries. The carrier has reported losses for four straight quarters despite the revenues holding up.
The Jet Airways crisis threatens the loss of about 23,000 jobs and is reminiscent of the fate suffered by Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines Ltd, another indebted airline that had to be grounded and whose flashy fugitive founder India is still trying to extradite from London.
Jet Airways’ crisis also comes at an awkward time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi who’s battling a slide in popularity over rising concerns of unemployment and seeking a re-election bid in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The government had tried to help the ailing Jet Airways by asking other carriers to consider taking over a few of its aircraft.

LONDON :
Vijay Mallya on Wednesday failed to convince a UK High Court to dismiss an order related to money in one of his London bank accounts, dealing a blow to the embattled liquor tycoon's efforts to prevent a consortium of Indian banks getting access to nearly 260,000 pounds.
In one of the many legal cases being faced by the 63-year-old liquor tycoon in the UK, Master David Cook ruled that an interim debt order in favour of SBI and other banks seeking access to funds in the ICICI UK bank account ""should remain in force"" but that the application to make it final should be adjourned until after the hearing of Mallya's pending bankruptcy petition.
The funds in the account will meanwhile remain frozen as part of the worldwide freezing order in favour of the Indian banks last year.
Mallya's lawyers had argued for the dismissal of the interim order on a number of grounds, including a claim that it was a ""deliberate ploy"" to prevent Mallya ""reasonable"" living expenses.
""I reject the proposition that the application for a TPDO (third party debt order) was a deliberate ploy to thwart Dr Mallya's ability to meet his ordinary living expenses and reasonable legal expenses which are permitted under the terms of the WWFO (worldwide freezing order),"" Master Cook notes in his judgment.
""The relevant context here is that Dr Mallya is in a post judgment scenario where the Claimants (Indian banks) are attempting to enforce their judgment and discover the true extent of his assets. I note that Dr Mallya has made no voluntary payment to date… while continuing to incur substantial legal costs in opposing the Claimants’ efforts to enforce their judgment,"" he said.
The case revolves around 258,559.79 pounds held in a bank account with the ICICI UK, which is named as a third party in the High Court case. It is among one of many orders pursued by TLT LLP, the law firm acting for the Indian banks, as part of efforts to recoup some of the 1.142 billion pounds owed to them arising from proceedings in the Bangalore Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) against Kingfisher Airlines and others.
The DRT case was registered in the UK under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 and went in favour of the Indian banks in an appeal in May 2018.
The banks have since also filed a bankruptcy petition against Mallya in the UK courts, which is being challenged by the former Kingfisher Airlines boss and is expected to come up for hearing around December this year.
Meanwhile, in yet another legal intervention, Mallya is seeking a stay of all enforcement proceedings which have been commenced since the presentation of the bankruptcy petition by the Indian banks in September last year, a hearing of which is expected next month.
The outcome of that hearing will determine the future course of the funds being sought by the SBI, Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd.
Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail after his extradition was signed off by UK home secretary Sajid Javid in February and is seeking leave to appeal against that order in the High Court as well.

MUMBAI :
Hinting at job losses going forward, grounded carrier Jet Airways chief executive Vinay Dube Wednesday said the airline does not have an ""answer"" at present on the fate of its 20,000-odd employees during the stake sale process.
The SBI-led consortium of lenders has offered prospective bidders ownership of the airline anywhere between 31.2% and 75% for which it had run an online bidding process between April 8 and 12 and had shortlisted four - Etihad Airways, NIIF, private equity funds TPG Capital and Indigo Partners-who can submit the final bids by May 10.
""However, we must also be realistic that the sale process will take some time and will throw up several more challenges for us, many of which we don't have the answer today,"" Dube said in a communication to the harried employees who have not been paid since March.
""For example, we don't have an answer today to the very important question of what happens to employees during the sale process,"" he added.
Nevertheless, he said the leadership team is working on answering such questions alongside the lenders.
Jet owes over three months salaries to 15% of the staff comprising senior management, pilots and engineers.
Besides, it has also defaulted on the March salary of its entire workforce.
Dube, in the letter said the decision to shut the operations temporarily was taken after painstaking evaluation of all alternatives and guidance and advice of the board.
""A decision like this is never easy to make, but without the interim funding, which we have been repeatedly requesting for, we are simply unable to conduct flight operations in a manner that delivers to the very reasonable expectations of our guests, employees, partners and service providers,"" he said.
Over the past several weeks and months, the airline has tried every means possible to seek funding, both interim as well as long-term funds, to keep the operations going, but could not succeed, he said.
""Late last night we were informed by SBI, on behalf of the consortium of the lenders, that they are unable to consider our request for interim funding of  ₹983 crores,"" he said adding, however, this was declined.
But public statements from the airline, and government officials Tuesday said the management was looking for a lifeline of  ₹400 crore.

With the lenders rejecting an lifeline of  ₹400 crore on Wednesday Jet Airways, which has been on a wing and prayer since January, is left with no other option but to ground operations at least temporarily.
Since the March 25 resolution to infuse  ₹1,500 crore into the airline is yet to fructify, the once leading airline has been defaulting on payments, forcing its lessors to retake almost all its planes and was operating just about six planes as of Tuesday.
An official announcement of grounding of operations is expected anytime now as the Jet Airways board had Tuesday authorised chief executive Vinay Dube to make one last appeal to the SBI-led consortium to get a life-line of  ₹400 crore Wednesday, before taking a final call on the future.
Jet will be the seventh airline to go down since May 2014 and the 13th one after East West was shuttered.

Mumbai/New Delhi: Jet Airways (India) Ltd teetered on the brink of collapse as lenders to the cash-strapped airline, once the country’s largest outside government control, weighed interim funding to keep at least some of its planes operational.
A section of the Jet Airways management was in favour of a temporary shutdown until emergency funds are made available, two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
A meeting between the airline’s management and lenders went on till late Tuesday evening but the impasse continued.
Jet Airways has sought an emergency funding of  ₹400 crore from lenders, civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola told reporters on Tuesday evening. He said the airline had only five aircraft in operation on Tuesday.
The interim funding was supposed to help Jet Airways keep at least some of its planes flying till the lenders find a buyer.
On Monday, lenders had shortlisted Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners to place binding bids for the ailing airline.
Finding a buyer will be critical for the airline’s survival.
Jet Airways’ board met in Mumbai on Tuesday, where the management led by chief executive Vinay Dube suggested the airline suspend domestic operations among other options, said the first of the two people cited above.
The second person said the management of the airline will continue to seek funding from lenders. “Fresh fund infusion is essential to keep the airline operational,"" the person said.
Queries emailed to a Jet Airways spokesperson for comment remained unanswered.
State Bank of India, the lead lender to Jet Airways, did not respond to Mint’s query about the options before the lenders.
In a statement on late evening Tuesday, Jet Airways said: “The company is waiting for emergency liquidity support from the consortium of domestic lenders led by the State Bank of India. The company’s leadership, in consultation with the board of directors, is engaged with the lenders in connection with the said emergency funding request to arrest a further deterioration of its services and minimize inconvenience to its guests.""
Meanwhile, the US Exim Bank, which had extended loans to the tune of  ₹2,000 crore to Jet Airways for purchase of Boeing 777 aircraft, has recalled all loans to the airline due to default. It is likely to take possession of aircraft that were purchased by the airline using the funds.
Queries sent to the US Exim Bank didn’t yield any response till press time.
However, a senior finance ministry official on Tuesday said that the lenders are likely to disburse funds to Jet Airways. The official didn’t want to be named.
Jet Airways may have to shut operations, at least temporarily, if it fails to raise money in the days ahead. The airline has suspended international operations till 18 April.
Jet Airways has deferred interest payments to banks, and dues to fuel suppliers, oil marketing companies and aircraft lessors. As a result, lessors of the airline have grounded most of its 119 aircraft.
It has also held back salaries since January to a section of its staff, including pilots, engineers and general managers. In addition, the carrier has deferred March salaries to all its employees, as it continues to battle financial woes.
“Our sense is that the airline’s board of directors will continue its operations using skeletal staff,"" said a Jet Airways official, who is not a member of the airline’s board.
“In the last few months, about 250 pilots have left the airline while 23 pilots resigned on Tuesday. At present, the total number of pilots in the airline stands at about 1,300,"" the person said requesting anonymity.
On Tuesday, Jet Airways shares fell 7.62% to  ₹241.85 apiece on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.95% to end the day at 39,275.64 points.

New Delhi: Distressed airline Jet Airways (India) Ltd. said on Wednesday it is compelled to cancel all its international and domestic flights with immediate effect as it has not received emergency funding from lenders or any other source. The last flight will operate today.
In a statement to stock exchanges, Jet said the company was not able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations flowing.
“Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian Lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding. Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going,"" India’s second largest airline said.
This decision has been taken after a painstaking evaluation of all alternatives that were made available to the company and after receiving guidance and advice on the same from its board of directors, it said.
Jet Airways has informed the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), and the Ministries of Civil Aviation and Finance and other relevant government institutions, of this course of action, the release added.
In March, founder Naresh Goyal was forced to cede control of the airline, after Jet Airways, saddled with over $1 billion in debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors.
According to reports, Jet owns 17 planes, mostly wide bodied Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s, while the rest are leased. It had a fleet of 124 aircraft as of December but the owned planes have already been collateralised against funds that were raised to finance their purchase.
Since January, the airline has not paid salaries to a section of its staff, including pilots and engineers, while lessors have taken possession of planes after the airline failed to pay fees.
Essential services needed to support guest services and the re-commencement of the flight operations will be kept onboard until further notice."
578,2019-04-17,State Bank,"The turbulence at India’s third largest airline threatens to leave a gaping hole in the Indian aviation sectorIndiGo is in a good place to capitalize on Jet’s plight and give wings to its international ambitions as well

Mumbai: Sonal Raj, 35, a senior fashion executive in Mumbai, was set to fly to Delhi on 18 April for the Easter weekend to spend time with her family. But little did she know that her travel plans would take a knock. On Saturday, Raj received an SMS informing that her Jet Airways (India) Ltd flight to Delhi has been cancelled. “I’m hurt by how Jet is behaving now,"" said Raj over the phone.
As more and more passengers cope with Jet’s increasing frequency of flight cancellations, the $1.2 billion question—the estimated funding gap for Jet Airways—is whether they would opt for the airline again if it manages to turnaround its fortunes.
But, the even bigger question is perhaps whether the 25-year-old private airline should survive at all? As we write this, Jet’s life is hanging by a thread; liquidity constraints have led the airline’s lessors to ground a majority of its fleet. Analysts and experts are now worried about who will fill the gap in capacity if Jet were to die, and the repercussions of that on the Indian aviation industry and consumers.
Moreover, there’s the human angle: In the event of a shutdown, naturally, there will be job losses. This would be awkward given that we are in the middle of general elections. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government can ill afford bad press on jobs, as its track record in job creation hasn’t been particularly encouraging. According to Jet’s FY18 annual report, the airline had 16,558 permanent employees, and 6,306 temporary employees as on 31 March 2018.
“How is it good as a country to reduce so much seat capacity,"" asked an analyst, requesting anonymity. The demise of Jet Airways would only make it a monopoly situation for InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, according to some analysts. InterGlobe Aviation runs budget airline IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share with a more than 40% share of the domestic market. “More competition in an industry is always a good thing from consumers’ point of view,"" says Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings Ltd. That’s one reason why Jet Airways should survive, he added.
Widespread cancellations because of grounding of Jet Airways planes coupled with grounding of all 737 Max 8 aircraft of SpiceJet Ltd should reduce domestic capacity resulting in a contraction in traffic growth in March, pointed out analysts from SBICAP Securities Ltd in a report on 20 March.
THE GLOBAL IMPACT
Worse still, is the outlook on the international segment of the Indian aviation market where Jet has a significant share. In fact, the airline accounted for about a third (33.5%) of total available seat kilometres or ASKs of Indian carriers on scheduled international services in 2018, according to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). ASK is aviation terminology for the measure of capacity. Essentially, this big chunk of international capacity is at risk if Jet were to go out of the system.
Just for perspective: In 2011, which was a relatively stable year for Kingfisher Airlines Ltd before it folded up a year later, the airline accounted for 10.8% of the overall ASK of the Indian carriers on scheduled international services. In absolute terms, Jet’s international ASK in 2018 is nearly 6.5 times Kingfisher’s international ASK in 2011. Given this backdrop, for investors, how the Indian aviation market would cope with that gap in capacity will be the most interesting development to watch out for in the coming days.
Sure, Air India and Air India Express can plug that gap.
But DGCA data shows they already operated at a passenger load factor of 79.4% and 76.5%, respectively, in their international segments in FY18. So incrementally, Air India can only take so many passengers. But, how can we be sure that passengers would choose Air India instead of other foreign carriers? What this means is that a reasonable portion of international traffic will be eaten into by other international carriers such as Emirates, Etihad Airways PJSC, Qatar Airways Ltd, British Airways Plc, Singapore Airlines Ltd and Deutsche Lufthansa AG.
Note that over the years, India has steadily grown its share of international air traffic to and from the country. In 2004-05, scheduled foreign carriers controlled a 71% share of the international traffic, with domestic carriers making up the remaining 29%, according to DGCA data. This fell to 61% in 2017-18 as the share of Indian carriers climbed to 39%.
With airlines such as IndiGo, Tata SIA Airlines Ltd-run Vistara, SpiceJet Ltd and GoAir willing to increase focus on the international market, the share of Indian carriers in the international market was expected to increase. But, if Jet goes out of the system, that can take a set back.
On Monday, SpiceJet announced the launch of a slew of non-stop flights to eight international destinations from Mumbai. “Even as some of these Indian airlines can step up their game on the international front, it is not going to happen overnight,"" said Praveen Sahay, assistant vice-president (equity research) at Edelweiss Broking Ltd. “Jet has bilateral rights and slots with some coveted international aviation markets and these are difficult to get,"" he said. “These are usually on first come, first serve basis. If a carrier has fleet, and has applied for routes, they may receive them if they are ahead in this race for slots/ bilateral rights,"" he added.
According to an analyst, who did not wish to be named, “Indian airlines either do not offer the similar product or currently do not have the right equipment to serve some of these markets.""
To be sure, even as the current lenders-led resolution plan offers some hope for Jet’s survival, recovery from here will hardly be a cakewalk. Edelweiss Securities Ltd assumes Jet will eventually lose 50 planes to lessors, which would swerve its fleet size down to 73 in fiscal year 2021.“Even if someone comes in right now, so much of damage has been done already. The resolution process should have started six-nine months earlier,"" said an analyst, who did not wish to be named. “Jet needs patient equity capital and the ability to invest more if needed,"" according to the analyst, who however points out that Jet’s high cost structure has been a major area of pain for the airline.
THE DOMESTIC IMPACT
IndiGo is emerging as a clear winner out of this,"" said Sahay of Edelweiss. Indeed, according to DGCA, the airline has seen its domestic market share increase by 3.5 percentage points in February, on a year-on-year basis.
Other airlines have gained too. IndiGo’s smaller low cost peer, SpiceJet’s domestic market share expanded 1.3 percentage points in February. Sahay elaborates IndiGo has already doubled its international market share to 8% on the short-haul routes capitalizing on Jet vacating some key markets.
IndiGo is in a good place to capitalize on Jet’s plight and give wings to its international ambitions as well. But, as mentioned earlier, any international capacity expansion will not happen in a hurry, and in the interim, international flight tickets can be expected to become pricey. Sure, when Kingfisher was grounded in 2012, Jet was in a sweet spot to take advantage of the situation but it never had the balance sheet strength.
However, IndiGo is in a different league as far as balance sheet might goes. At the end of December, IndiGo had total cash (including restricted cash) worth  ₹14,136 crore and its debt stood at  ₹2,476 crore. ICICI Securities estimates if IndiGo were to reach 20% market share of the international Indian traffic in the next five years, it could generate about  ₹1,000 crore in additional earnings. For FY18, IndiGo’s overall net profit stood at  ₹2,242 crore.
HOW THE CONSUMER LOSES
Amidst Jet’s financial woes and massive scaling down of operations, the quintessential cost conscious Indian consumer has ended up as the biggest loser. “The party is over for the Indian passenger,"" says Shannon Attari, partner and aviation restructuring expert at Attari Capital, reflecting on the recent surge in airfares.
Jet’s troubles come at a time when the industry is in a dire need of capacity rationalization to give a fillip to air fares. Lower fares due to intense competition are a key reason for the current dire straits of Jet Airways. While the grounding of Jet’s planes has sucked some capacity out of the market, IndiGo too has cancelled some flights due to pilot shortages. In addition, a global ban has been imposed since March on Boeing 737 Max 8 planes. The squeeze on capacity has only helped to increase fares meaningfully after a long while, restoring some pricing power to airlines. What’s more, outlook on yields (a measure of pricing), looks encouraging at least from a near-to-medium term point of view. That’s because Jet’s capacity is not expected to bounce back quickly.
“On an average, airfares on major routes have increased by almost 30% for tickets booked seven days prior to the Easter weekend, compared to last year’s same weekend,"" says Sharat Dhall, chief operating officer (B2C), at Yatra.com, an online travel portal. For tickets booked 15 days prior to the Easter weekend, fares have increased by about 10%, he added.
The analysts from SBICAP Securities said in their March quarter earnings preview that profitability in the seasonally weak March quarter will be the best for the year due to better yields and lower pressure on costs. Average aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices in Delhi, according to the Indian Oil Corp. Ltd website, fell 20% lower sequentially in the March quarter, which should assist profitability.
It’s worth noting here that after the financial results were announced for the nine-month period ended 31 December, fiscal year 2018-19 was proving to be a disastrous year for Indian airlines. The villains were higher costs led by a sharp increase in crude oil prices and a weak rupee, which swelled dollar denominated costs coupled with pricing pressures. Just for perspective: IndiGo, SpiceJet and Jet posted a net loss of  ₹433 crore,  ₹372 crore and  ₹3,208 crore, respectively, for 9MFY19. Now, the March quarter could well bring some respite to the full year profitability.
To be sure, green shoots of improvement in pricing were already visible in the December quarter. In a report on 4 April, SBICAP analysts said, “The industry, which has been recording healthy 18-20% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) growth in the past three-four years, is entering a phase of consolidation where companies that weathered the storm stand to benefit at the cost of Jet Airways—so the pricing environment should improve significantly.""
Of course, the bigger question is whether these pricing gains are sustainable for the industry in the long run. Most likely, they will not be. That’s simply because, the Indian consumer is essentially price sensitive. What this means if fares increase sharply, people will look for cheaper options and go for road or train travel if that’s more compelling. In such a scenario, passenger load factors (PLFs) will take a hit. Already, for the December quarter, we saw IndiGo and SpiceJet sacrificed their PLFs for better yields.
“The Indian passenger will not fly if fares are too high,"" says Sahay of Edelweiss, adding that people can jolly well use train transport as a substitute travel mode. In the Indian aviation business, airlines have to ensure they have a pricing discipline else they end up losing in the long run,"" according to Sahay.
India’s fast growing domestic traffic has been a feather in the cap for the current government. Passengers carried by domestic airlines over 2014-18, increased by about 20% CAGR. But, this hasn’t translated into decent profits for all Indian airlines.
“If airlines in the country act rationally and do not dump capacity into the market, there is room for everyone to sustain and grow,"" said an analyst.
Pricing is crucial too. Bhaskar Bhat, chairman of full-service carrier, Vistara, told The Economic Times on Monday, “Predatory pricing has been the root cause of the issues now being faced by the sector... Jet is the seventh airline going under. The industry needs to apply themselves into what needs to be done to make it grow. The airline industry has not encouraged ideas and has been promiscuous in its approach in spite of being one of the fastest growing markets in the world.""
But, if the pricing discipline doesn’t come, then who’s to say we won’t be in a similar situation again. Seven years ago, Kingfisher died. Today, Jet is on ventilator.
Who’s going to be next?"
572,2019-04-18,State Bank,"Lenders are unsure if the funds pumped into Jet Airways at this stage could be recovered at a later dateJet Airways is now awaiting the outcome of the bid process that is likely to bring in fresh equity by the end of May

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd flew its last flight on Wednesday night—9W 2502 from Amritsar to Mumbai—after lenders declined to hand out emergency funds, bringing the curtains down on an era in which it broke into a state monopoly sector to become India’s largest private airline at one point.
It’s unclear whether the airline will ever return to the skies, but if it does so, it will be under a new ownership structure.
“Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding,"" Jet Airways said in a statement on Wednesday. “Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going.""
The airline said it would await the bid finalization process by the lenders that is likely to bring in fresh equity by the end of May.
If the stake sale process to induct a new investor fails, it will mark the end of the airline that started operations on 5 May 1993, and then went on to become the first Indian airline outside government control to fly overseas destinations. The suspension of operations also marks the end of a year-long effort made by the airline and its lenders to save it from being grounded. The airline had already halted international flights. It operated about 40 flights using five aircraft on Tuesday and Wednesday.
“A decision like this is never easy to make, but without the interim funding, which we have been repeatedly requesting for, we are simply unable to conduct flight operations in a manner that delivers to the very reasonable expectations of our guests, employees, partners and service providers,"" CEO Vinay Dube said in an email to Jet Airways employees, adding that the company was working to ensure the bid process leads to a viable solution.
The developments on Wednesday are similar to the events that led to the grounding of Vijay Mallya’s Kingfisher Airlines about seven years ago. 
Kingfisher Airlines was grounded temporarily when the aviation regulator suspended its flying licence, but the airline could never take to the skies again. Kingfisher Airlines shut down its operations on 20 October 2012.
“History and our business dynamics prove that once an airline shuts down in India, it never does restart,"" said Mark D. Martin, founder and CEO of aviation consultancy Martin Consulting Llc. “We were given to understand by SBI in explicit terms that they’d do all that is possible with ensuring Jet Airways does not shut down; and to think that no money was pumped in to resolve liabilities such as lessor outstanding, fuellers and salaries is unforgiving.""
“With no aircraft, pilots, flight attendants and engineers, I certainly don’t see how any bidder will continue to see value in Jet Airways,"" Martin added.
Two senior bankers told Mint that the lenders to the airline had rejected its request for emergency funds as they were unsure if the funds pumped into the airline at this stage could be recovered later.
“All along, we have neither declined nor accepted Jet Airways’ request for interim funding,"" one of the two bankers said on condition of anonymity. 
“We have always wanted some assurance that this money that we give will not go down the drain and can be recovered at a later stage.""
“Whatever money we give, we would want to get it back and that assurance is not visible. Things will be clearer once we are able to move ahead with the planned resolution process,"" the person added.
The interim emergency funding of  ₹400 crore sought by Jet Airways was supposed to help the airline keep at least some of its planes flying till the lenders found a buyer.
“We are not going to give emergency funding until we have a clear visibility of their cash flow. A large portion of the current revenue of the airline is being used to settle pending dues, IATA (International Air Transport Association) and credit card charges, etc.,"" said the second banker.
“There is no point of additional funding at this moment, since valuation of the airline will not change during the bidding process. Even if the services are grounded completely, the bidding process will not change,"" the banker said. “As lenders, we have to see whether we will get back our money and in this case, we are not sure.""
On Tuesday, Jet Airways’ board met in Mumbai, where the management led by CEO Vinay Dube suggested the airline suspend domestic operations among other options.
“The company’s leadership, in consultation with the board of directors, is engaged with the lenders in connection with the said emergency funding request to arrest a further deterioration of its services and minimize inconvenience to its guests,"" the company said in a statement after the board meeting.
Jet Airways has deferred interest payments to banks, and dues to fuel suppliers, oil marketing companies and aircraft lessors. As a result, lessors of the airline have grounded most of its 119 aircraft.
It has also held back salaries since January to a section of its employees, including pilots, engineers and general managers. In addition, the carrier has deferred March salaries to all its employees, as it continues to battle financial woes. In the last few months, about 250 pilots have left the airline, while 23 more resigned on Tuesday, leaving their strength in the airline at about 1,300.
In a separate statement, Jet Privilege Pvt. Ltd said the value of JPMiles was secure and remained intact.
“With our air reward offering, “Select Flights"", members have the choice to redeem their JPMiles to fly free across more airlines, any destinations, any flights and any seats in India and globally, starting with the same JPMiles requirement as before, which was applicable on Jet Airways and its partner airlines,"" it said.

571,2019-04-18,State Bank,"A bankruptcy court-monitored resolution may take longer than an out-of-court Jet Airways stake saleA bankruptcy process may prove too costly as employees may quit and airport operators may re-assign slots to rivals

With operations halted, Jet Airways (India) Ltd has exposed itself to the possibility of service providers and workers dragging the beleaguered airline to bankruptcy tribunals over unpaid dues.
A revival of the carrier may also become difficult if an investor is not finalized within a week or two, according to bankruptcy experts.
Lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) have earlier said that they will not approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). However, operational creditors such as service providers and aircraft lessors, as well as workers, can potentially take Jet Airways to the bankruptcy tribunal.
A formal bankruptcy process will offer Jet Airways protection for some time from lenders taking over its assets for non-payment of dues but would delay resolution.
The share sale process for Jet would then have to be restarted under the supervision of the tribunal as part of a rescue plan to be designed by a resolution professional.
The experts said it could take up to three months for such a court-monitored share sale process to start after the case is admitted and claims assessed by the resolution professional. This may prove very detrimental to the airline as many employees may leave for other jobs, airport operators may re-assign slots to rival airlines, and lessors may take back the planes in favour of other airlines if the company’s operations remain suspended for more than a few weeks. Selling Jet Airways to an investor, therefore, is a more viable option.
“The process under the bankruptcy code is not a suitable proposition in such a scenario. It is ideal to finalize the investor within a week or a fortnight. It is always better to keep the company alive as a going concern than trying to recover (dues) through bankruptcy process,"" said Manoj Kumar, partner at law firm Corporate Professionals.
Some experts, however, said if Jet Airways or its lenders had filed for bankruptcy earlier, it would have ensured a going concern for the insolvency professional instead of a defunct one.
“It is still not too late. Lenders should consider filing an insolvency petition immediately, which will help in salvaging any further loss of value of the company,"" said Sumant Batra, managing partner of law firm Kesar Dass B. & Associates.
Etihad Airways, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners were shortlisted on Monday to place binding bids for the airline.
Jet informed the stock exchanges on Wednesday that it will await the share sale process led by State Bank of India and the consortium of lenders. Lenders are not ready to infuse more funds before an investor brings in fresh capital. A delay in reviving the company could also impair Jet’s brand value and alienate its customer base."

—Name withheld on request
There are two issues with your question—one, the product that you are talking about (and investing in) is not a mutual fund product, but a unit-linked insurance product (Ulip). Also, it appears that this is a product that guarantees a certain amount of return to the investor, which implies that it is a very conservative investment vehicle.
Two, even if you were investing in a mutual fund, investing  ₹5,000 a month for 16 years means you would be investing Rs9.6 lakh total. It is very improbable that this amount will turn to Rs4 crore in this period (it would mean an annualized return of more than 30% sustained for 16 years, which has never happened). Moreover, it is impossible for it to happen with this investment-cum- insurance product.
So, my advice to you would be to switch to mutual fund systematic investment plans (SIPs) for your long-term investing needs, and increase your monthly investment considerably to get to your target.
I am a 27-year-old bachelor and I want to accumulate Rs2 crore by the time I turn 50. I plan to use this money to travel the world. To this end, I am investing  ₹65,000 in mutual funds through direct plans since 2015. Of this amount,  ₹5,000 in Reliance Small Cap Fund, and  ₹15,000 each in in Kotak Emerging Equity Scheme, Parag Parikh Long Term Equity Fund and Aditya Birla Sunlife Frontline Equity Fund. For debt, I save about  ₹9,000 per month in my Provident Fund account and  ₹2,000 each month in Public Provident Fund (PPF). Could you please evaluate my portfolio and suggest changes in my mutual fund investments, if necessary?
—Sanjay Kumar
It is not quite clear from your question whether your investments in mutual funds are ongoing SIPs or if they were one-time investments made four years ago. If they are SIPs, then you are very well-positioned to reach your goal of accumulating  ₹2 crore long before you reach 50 years of age. You might even achieve it by the time you turn 40 years old.
However, if they were one-time investments made a few years ago, they would not be enough, just by themselves, for you to reach your goal, since this money would grow to only about  ₹15 lakh in the given time frame of 23 more years.
If this is the case, then you should start an SIP for about  ₹20,000 a month (or as much as you can invest) in a diversified, aggressive portfolio. From among the schemes you have selected for this purpose, you can continue investing in Parag Parikh and Aditya Birla Sunlife funds. You can consider replacing the Kotak Emerging Equity Fund with Kotak Standard Multicap Fund. For the allocation to small-cap, consider adding HDFC Small Cap Fund into the mix and splitting the allocation with the Reliance Small Cap Fund, which you already have.

569,2019-04-19,State Bank,"Investors are seen pinning hopes on the outcome of the bidding process for Jet Airways set to end on 10 MayBut it seems unlikely that any buyer will cut a deal that has positive implications for existing shareholders

Mumbai: Jet Airways shares have been quite resilient through all the crisis over the past few months. On Wednesday evening, the 25-year-old beleaguered private airline informed stock exchanges that it would suspend operations temporarily. When markets opened on Thursday, Jet Airways’ shares were, of course, in free fall. The stock touched a 52-week low during trading and eventually closed the day 32% down. Still, it does appear that the company’s shareholders think this isn’t really the final call to deboard.
“Investors think there is still value to be found and people are pinning their hopes on the outcome of the bidding process for the airline,"" said an analyst requesting anonymity.
Jet Airways has a market capitalization of  ₹1,862 crore even after Thursday’s fall, and an outstanding debt of more than  ₹7,000 crore, as on 31 December. Considering that the airline has shut operations, it seems unlikely any buyer will cut a deal that has positive implications for existing shareholders. In light of this, the resilience in Jet Airways’ shares is surprising.
History is not in their favour either. When Kingfisher Airlines Ltd had temporarily suspended operations on 20 October 2012, the markets still gave its shares a value of  ₹900 crore. Eventually, the shares turned out to be worthless. However, even in that case, note that the KFA stock had tanked about 40% six months prior to the temporary suspension.
In Jet Airways’ case, its shares have increased by 10% in the last six months until Wednesday. While the airline may have possibly taken its last flight ever on Wednesday, investors’ hopes are still flying high.
And even if Jet Airways were to revive, its capacity is not expected to bounce back quickly. Edelweiss Securities Ltd analysts wrote in a report on 8 April, “We assume that Jet Airways will eventually lose 50 planes to lessors, which would swerve its fleet size down to 73 in financial year 2021.""
Further, it’s not as if the outlook on profitability was bright. A Bloomberg poll of analysts was expecting Jet Airways to post a consolidated net loss of  ₹460 crore for FY20. This is after reporting a massive  ₹2,916 crore net loss for FY19.
Meanwhile, other airlines are set to gain at the expense of Jet Airways. SpiceJet Ltd and InterGlobe Aviation Ltd shares have already risen by 53% and 33%, respectively, so far this year. InterGlobe runs IndiGo, India’s largest airline by market share. 
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, “Disruption of Jet Airways’ capacity can lead to temporary demand-supply mismatch, particularly going into peak summer demand.""
Needless to say, for Jet Airways’ shareholders, news flow on the stake sale process will be crucial to watch out for hereon. Lenders have told the airline the bidding process will conclude on 10 May."
566,2019-04-19,State Bank,"While the government is silent on a Jet Airways revival plan, lenders see the stake sale process as key to the airline's futureJet Airways employees union, meanwhile, criticized banks for not infusing funds and said it would approach the labour commissioner

Mumbai: Once a poster boy of Indian aviation, the fate of Jet Airways (India) Ltd and its more than 15,000 employees hangs in the balance a day after the airline suspended operations even as its lenders, the civil aviation regulator and the union government struggle to find ways to revive the company.
At stake is the uncertain future of employees, lessors and its vendors as well as the reputation of the Narendra Modi-led government, which has evidently tried to find a remedy to the crisis at what was till recently India’s third-largest domestic airline by market share.
But, that’s too little too late as groups of Jet Airways employees began a protest on Thursday against the airline’s grounding at New Delhi’s Jantar Mantar and outside the company’s headquarters in Mumbai. Some employees haven’t been paid up to three months of salaries and the rest haven’t received salary for March. The protesting group, standing in a loose human chain, blocked the entry to Jet Airways’ headquarters.
The development has come at a sensitive time when the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance is seeking a second consecutive term at the centre, when job creation and economic growth are high on voters’ minds.
The matter has taken a political turn.
Kiran Pawaskar, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and president of All India Jet Airways Officers and Staff Association on Thursday criticized banks for not infusing the required funds and said the union would approach the labour commissioner.
“We don’t know why the banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) didn’t infuse  ₹1,500 crore into the company after saying so,"" Pawaskar said. He has filed a police complaint against the management over salary dues.
Jet Airways flew its last flight—S2 3502, from Amritsar to Mumbai—Wednesday night, as it ran out of cash and lenders declined requests for more funds to keep the airline running.
“Jet Airways is grounded. Sad. It was once my default airline of choice. #Modi has so many spectacular achievements to his credit,"" Sanjay Jha, national spokesperson of the Congress, the main opposition party, said in a tweet.
As per protocol, industry regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has asked Jet Airways to prepare a “concrete and credible revival plan to restart the suspended operations"". In 2012, DGCA had to cancel the licence of Vijay Mallya-led Kingfisher Airlines Ltd when the now-defunct airline failed to come up with a viable plan for its revival.
“DGCA would endeavour to do its best to help the company revive its operations within the set regulatory framework,"" it said in a statement.
Civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola on Thursday did not say whether the government planned to take fresh measures to revive Jet Airways. Speaking to reporters in New Delhi, Kharola said airport slots vacant due to Jet Airways’ grounding would be temporarily assigned to other carriers for three months, which might be extended later. Preference would be given to carriers inducting new aircraft, he said, adding that “Jet will have a right on slots when it returns"".
Kharola said there was a deficit of about 17 planes in India’s civil aviation market but expected airlines to add about 30 planes over the next three months. The carriers had assured the government about keeping fares at reasonable levels, he said, adding that state-run Air India was also in talks to add more planes, including for more international services.
“Passenger safety and convenience is the most important concern for the government,"" said Kharola, adding that the Jet Airways crisis had to be resolved between the carrier and the lenders.
All eyes are now on India’s largest lender, State Bank of India, and the consortium of banks it leads. For now, they believe the best way forward for the survival of Jet Airways is to get the binding bids from potential investors. In a statement, the consortium of lenders said they were “reasonably hopeful"" that the bid process was likely to be successful in determining fair value of the enterprise in a transparent manner.
As for the bidders—Etihad Airways PJSC, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), TPG Capital and Indigo Partners—it is time for some hard bargain.
“The bidders are likely to ask lenders to take a significant haircut. The ball is in the court of lenders now,"" a person aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
While Etihad declined comment, queries to TPG Capital, NIIF and Indigo Partners didn’t yield a response till press time.
The National Aviator’s Guild (NAG), the pilots’ union of Jet Airways, said it would take legal action against the management. “This is a difficult situation for us. But we will be engaged with the management to help pilots and others recover their salary dues,"" said a member of NAG.
“Jet Airways has informed MoCA (ministry of civil aviation) that it is temporarily ceasing operations. The bank-led resolution process is still underway and expected to end by May 10. During this time, MoCA will support the resolution process within the existing legal and regulatory framework,"" the ministry said in a tweet. “DGCA and other regulators are monitoring the situation carefully to ensure that all existing rules regarding refunds, cancellations and alternative bookings are followed strictly.""

565,2019-04-19,State Bank,"In Mallya's characteristic style, the media was once again at the receiving end of the former Kingfisher Airlines boss’ social media commentsMallya issued a string of statements on Twitter to allege that the SBI led consortium of PSU banks were wrongly going after him in the UK courts

LONDON :
Embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya once again used social media to reiterate his offer to pay back the debt owed to public sector banks in India, targeting this time the State Bank of India (SBI) for allegedly wasting Indian taxpayers’ money on expensive legal fees in the UK.
Days after a UK High Court judge refused to dismiss an interim order freezing nearly 260,000 pounds in one of his London bank accounts, the 63-year-old issued a string of statements on Twitter to allege that the SBI led consortium of PSU banks were wrongly going after him in the UK courts.
""SBI Lawyers in UK making presentations on their accomplishments against me. Indian Tax payers cost. Despite full recovery in India confirmed by the Prime Minister himself,"" he tweeted on Friday.
His statements were illustrated with a series of document screenshots showing TLT LLP, the banks’ law firm, hailing its victory in the 1.142 billion pounds worldwide freezing order judgment in their favour last May.
“SBI UK Lawyers in self-promotion at Indian public cost. SBI must answer,"" reads Mallya's tweet.
In his characteristic style, the media was once again at the receiving end of the former Kingfisher Airlines boss’ social media comments.
He noted: “Whilst media love sensational headlines, why doesn’t anybody ask the PSU State Bank of India under RTI [Right to Information] on how much they are spending on legal fees trying to recover money from me in the UK when I have offered 100 per cent payback in India.
“To substantiate my point, assets belonging to me in the UK were sold and the costs of sale were almost 50 per cent of value. The remaining assets yet to be sold won’t cover legal costs. So what’s this all about? To enrich UK Lawyers? SBI please answer.""
On Thursday, Mallya had made another reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s interview from last month, in which he had claimed that the government had recovered assets worth  ₹14,000 crores related to the now-defunct airline’s loan defaults.
Mallya is wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering amounting to an alleged  ₹9,000 crores.
The series of statements follow a ruling by Master David Cook, a judge in the Queen’s Bench Division of the Royal Courts of Justice in London, earlier this week which went against Mallya. Master Cook ruled that an interim debt order in favour of SBI and other banks seeking access to funds in Mallya’s ICICI UK bank account “should remain in force"".
However, the application to make it final has been adjourned until after the hearing of Mallya’s pending bankruptcy petition, expected by the end of this year.
The funds held in the account – 258,559.79 pounds – will meanwhile remain frozen as part of the worldwide freezing order in favour of the Indian banks last year.
Mallya’s lawyers had argued for the dismissal of the interim order on a number of grounds, including a claim that it was a “deliberate ploy"" to prevent Mallya “reasonable"" court-sanctioned living expenses.
However, the judge rejected the assertion and noted that the Indian banks are within their rights to discover the true extent of Mallya’s assets in order to recover the estimated 1.142 billion pounds owed to them, arising from proceedings in the Bangalore Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) against Kingfisher Airlines and others.
The DRT case was registered in the UK under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 and went in favour of the Indian banks in an appeal in May 2018.
The banks – SBI, Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd – have since also filed a bankruptcy petition against Mallya, which is being challenged by the former Kingfisher Airlines boss and is expected to come up for hearing around December this year.
TLT LLP, the law firm acting for the Indian banks, has been pursuing a series of court orders in the UK courts as part of efforts to enforce last year’s High Court judgment in favour of the banks.
Meanwhile, Mallya remains on bail after his extradition was signed off by UK home secretary Sajid Javid in February and is seeking leave to appeal against that order in the UK High Court. An oral hearing on his appeal renewal application is expected in the coming weeks."
564,2019-04-19,State Bank,"Banks have put in place a transparent bidding process for a new investor to take over the airline and the outcome would be known by May 10Lenders are actively considering proposals, including from Air India, for utilising the planes owned by Jet Airways

New Delhi: Lenders are exploring ways to utilise about 15 planes owned by Jet Airways and also discussing with authorities on protecting the valuable assets, including airport slots, of the now-shuttered airline, banking sources said.
As they wait for completion of the bidding process for stake sale, the domestic lenders, led by SBI, are looking at options to raise funds from available assets of the carrier, which has served the Indian skies for nearly 26 years.
Left with no cash to continue flying, the once-mighty Jet Airways on Wednesday suspended operations temporarily — a decision that has also left more than 20,000 employees as well as various other stakeholders in the lurch.
The sources said the lenders are actively considering proposals, including from Air India, for utilising the planes owned by Jet Airways. The use of these idle planes would ensure that they remain in good condition as well as earn revenues, they added.
Jet Airways owns 16 aircraft, including 10 wide-body Boeing 777-300 ERs, rest of the planes were on lease. The full-service carrier had more than 120 planes in its fleet last year.
Earlier this week, Air India Chairman and Managing Director Ashwani Lohani wrote to SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar saying that the airline is looking at leasing five of Jet Airways' Boeing 777s and operate them on London, Dubai and Singapore routes.
As concerns mount over the future course of Jet Airways, the sources said lenders have been proactive and cannot be blamed for the current situation at the airlines.
""They (lenders) have been actively engaging with the company for almost nine months ever since the airlines started incurring cash losses and have been urging the management to come forward with a definite plan for resolution.""
""Unfortunately, the management and the promoter delayed in taking a decision leading to the present situation. The lenders continued to support the airline during this period,"" one of the sources said.
The decision of founder-promoter Naresh Goyal to step down came as late as March 25 and he signed a binding agreement to facilitate stake sale only in the second week of April. By then, the airline's operations had been severely affected, the source added.
The source also said that banks have now put in place a transparent bidding process for a new investor to take over the airline and the outcome would be known by May 10.
According to the sources, lenders have also reached out to relevant authorities to protect valuable assets for the airline, such as airport slots, as it would improve the chances of a better revival. The best revival prospect would be to have a new investor who brings in sufficient cash and also has a definite plan going forward, they added.
It is also learnt that while the promoter has stepped down and entered into a binding agreement, there has been no change in complexion of the board of the airline due to technical reasons.
""The conversion of debt into equity was conceived as a way to allow a new investor to come in. Also, while the lenders have nominated A K Purwar and Kapil Kaul to the board of Jet Airways consequent upon stepping down of the promoters, this is yet to take effect on account of some technical reasons,"" another source said.
The banks have been working with the same executive management team who have been in charge of running the company even after stepping down of the promoter, the source added.
On Thursday, lenders said they were ""reasonably hopeful"" that the bidding process for the airline will end successfully.
""The lenders after due deliberations decided that the best way forward for the survival of Jet Airways is to get the binding bids from potential investors who have expressed EOI (Expression of Interest) and have been issued bid documents on April 16,"" they had said in a statement.
A consortium of seven domestic lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI), has invited bids from potential suitors. Their debt exposure to the airline is more than  ₹8,500 crore.
""Lenders are reasonably hopeful that the bid process is likely to be successful in determining the fair value of the enterprise in a transparent manner,"" it said.
Banks had rejected emergency funding request of Jet Airways that forced it to ground operations."

MUMBAI :
Air India chairman Ashwani Lohani held preliminary talks with his State Bank counterpart Rajnish Kumar in the Capital Friday on the national carrier's interest in leasing five Boeing 777s from the now-grounded Jet Airways, sources close to the development said.
The meeting lasted for over more than an hour at the Airlines House, the headquarters of the flag carrier in the national Capital.
""During the meeting with Kumar, Lohani discussed his proposal on leasing five B777s of Jet Airways,"" the sources told PTI.
As per these sources, the AI chairman will now take the proposal to the airline's board for approval, after more internal discussions and if all goes well, then the proposal will be sent to the aviation ministry for the final approval.
The AI board is scheduled to meet on April 27 and the subject may come up for discussions.
Weighed down by a mountain of debt and falling revenue, Jet Airways announced suspension of its entire operations from Wednesday night. The airline now owns 16 wide-body planes--10 B777-300ERs and six Airbus A330s.
The SBI-led consortium of lenders are now running the airline under a debt recast plan.
The AI chairman had written to SBI chief Wednesday expressing interest in taking on lease five of the Boeing 777s from Jet and deploy them in key international routes.
When asked about the next step, the source said after further deliberations, a formal proposal will be sent to the board for its approval. ""If the board gives its go ahead, it will be sent to the aviation ministry which will take a final call.""
Air India is keen to launch more international routes and enhance frequencies on the existing ones.
""But it does not have additional aircraft to do so. If it is able to strike a deal with Jet lenders, it can expand the international operations further,"" the source said.
The Air India spokesperson was not available to comment parleys.
In a dry-lease arrangement, the lessor gives out only the aircraft to a lessee, while in wet-lease, the aircraft comes with the complete crew, maintenance and insurance.
After the grounding of Jet, Air India is the only domestic carrier now operating services on long haul and ultra-long haul routes like London, Paris, New York, Washington, Chicago and San Francisco, among other cities.

NEW DELHI :
Naresh Goyal-founded Jet Airways, India’s second largest airline till not too long back, suspended its all domestic and international operations Wednesday, after failing to secure emergency funding from lenders or any other source. The last flight operated Wednesday.
In a statement to stock exchanges, Jet said the company was unable to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations flowing.
“Late last night, Jet Airways was informed by the State Bank of India (SBI), on behalf of the consortium of Indian Lenders, that they are unable to consider its request for critical interim funding. Since no emergency funding from the lenders or any other source is forthcoming, the airline will not be able to pay for fuel or other critical services to keep the operations going,"" the airline, that started as a taxi operator, said.
Lenders pushed Goyal out of the airline in March, after Jet Airways, saddled with huge debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors.
According to reports, Jet Airways had been incurring a daily loss of  ₹21 crore and has debt and dues totaling at least  ₹15,000 crore.
The suspension of operations would have a multiplier effect -- a whopping 16,500 employees stand to lose their jobs and thousands more working in ancilliary services will be at risk. Not only that, there could be a steep rise in air fares and an acute lack of capacity to cater to the rising domestic demand.
At its peak, Jet had 119 aircraft in its fleet and used to operate about 600 flights a day. It also ran the most successful international operations by an Indian airline. The disappearance of these would rob airport operators of landing and parking charges and other rental revenue from the airline. These charges account for roughly 10% of the ticket price, the bulk of which is on account of fuel.
As the dust settles, there are reports that the Directorate General of Civil Aviation will ask the airline for a ""concrete and credible"" revival plan, as well as extend help within the regulatory framework. The resolution, if any, is likely to be a long drawn-out process.
For an airline that provided world-class services for 25 long years, what went wrong? Let’s go to where it all started.
How did Jet Airways come into being?
Jet started as an air taxi service operator in 1993. Goyal set it up with a 20% equity contribution from Kuwait Airways and Gulf Air, both of whom exited later. Overseas operations kicked off with a Chennai-Colombo route in 2004. The airline launched a successful initial public offer (IPO) in 2005, and the stock listed on March 14, 2005 with an issue price of  ₹1,100 a share. The scrip on Thursday closed at  ₹165.75 on the National Stock Exchange. In 2007, Jet bought Air Sahara in 2007 for  ₹1,450 crore. As of Thursday, despite the steep fall in shares, Jet’s market capitalization stood at  ₹1,861.86 crore.
Shareholding pattern
Jet Airways had in February approved the conversion of loans into equity, which would effectively give banks 51% control of the airline. However, data from stock exchanges show that as of March 31, Goyal and associates, collectively held 51% stake in the airline. United Arab Emirates’ Etihad Airways held 24% stake and the rest was with public.
Market share
In the third quarter of 2010, Jet Airways became the largest airline in India with a passenger market share of 22.6%. In October 2017, it was the second-largest airline in India after IndiGo with a 17.8% passenger market share. It operated flights to 52 destinations. Just before its collapse, Jet Air had a market share of about 11%.
Fleet size
Jet owned 17 planes, mostly wide bodied Boeing 777s and Airbus A330s, while the rest were leased. It had a fleet of 119 aircraft as of December but the owned planes were collateralised against funds that were raised to finance their purchase. Before suspending operations, Jet was flying five aircraft.
The beginning of an end
Many in the industry believe that Jet buying out Air Sahara in 2007 was a major mistake. The deal severely curtailed Jet’s ability to spend extra money to take on the competition effectively.
The second mistake was the purchase of mixed fleet of 10 wide-bodied Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 planes. Unlike his peers, Goyal decided to have only 308 seats, much lower than the global standard of 400, in order to give his customers a premium offering. He lost a fourth of the potential revenue in the process.
It faced its first major crisis in 2011-12 and subsequently sold 24% stake to Etihad for $379 million in 2013.
What now?
A bidding process, being pursued by an SBI-led consortium of 26, is currently underway. Lenders had sought expression of interest from both strategic and financial investors to acquire at least 31.2% and up to 75% stake in the airline.
Six interested parties had submitted expression of interest. However, two of them -- a consortium that included ousted chairman Naresh Goyal and another consortium of private equity firms -- backed out. The remaining four--private equity firms Indigo Partners and TPG Capital, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airlines, and India's sovereign wealth fund National Infrastructure Investment Fund -- qualified as bidders, according to lenders.
The qualified bidders will have to submit their binding bids by May 10.
As said earlier, it will be a long wait."

An employee union of Jet Airways has said they will neither let the airline go down nor tolerate casual talk to dismantle it ""piece by piece"".
All India Jet Airways Technicians Association (AIJATA), which has around 800 members, has written an open letter.
The letter has come against the backdrop of Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha's reported comments that capable employees of Jet Airways would be absorbed by other airlines.
According to the union, employees who have left have done so due to their financial condition and other commitments.
""We will not let this company go down and will not tolerate this casual talk to dismantle this company piece by piece and give it as doles to airlines of your choice,"" the letter said.
It also said that many employees have been with Jet Airways for 15-25 years.
""We have given our sweat, blood and tears to this company. Many of us who had left this company, have came back not once but twice and thrice,"" it added.
Bogged down by cash crunch, Jet Airways shuttered operations temporarily on April 17. Senior airline officials, including CEO Vinay Dube, Saturday met Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.
Dube said Jaitley had assured to look into the issues that forced the cash-strapped airline to halt operations temporarily.
Maharashtra Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, civil aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola, the airline's chief financial officer Amit Agarwal, representatives of pilots, engineers, cabin crew and ground staff unions were also present at the meeting with Jaitley at his residence in Delhi.
Meanwhile, senior BJP leader Subramanian Swamy has suggested amalgamating Jet Airways with Air India.
""Govt better be careful: Two Ministers are manipulating sale of Jet Airways spoils to Spice Jet whose real owners I will reveal later. Only above board option GOI has is amalgam of Jet with Air India since Bilaterals on airspace involves Govt,"" he said in a tweet.
Lenders of Jet Airways have started the process for stake sale in the cash-strapped carrier.
SBI, the lead lender of the seven-member consortium of domestic banks that have extended loans to the airline, has started the bidding process for stake sale in the carrier and clarity about potential bidders would emerge next month."
556,2019-04-22,State Bank,"Travel credit cards can help you earn rewards which can make your travel cheaper but ensure that these rewards are more than the fees you payThe rate of interest charged by travel cards is as high as that charged by credit cards

It is holiday season and you could be doing all it takes to ensure that your trip is comfortable yet cost-efficient. From booking affordable stays like an Airbnb to using your airline reward points, there’s a lot you can do to ensure you don’t exceed your travel budget. If you are a frequent traveller, a travel credit card can also help you save up, but watch out for the costs and other caveats.
Travel credit cards essentially help you earn rewards you can use to make your travel relatively affordable. Some prepaid travel cards also store money in foreign currency.
According to a report, Moneymood 2019 – How India Will Bank This Year, by Bankbazaar, there was a 59% surge in the number of people applying for travel credit cards from metro cities and an increase of 309% from non-metros in 2018. While more and more people are opting for such cards, it’s important to understand the cost they come at and their benefits.
The cost
The rate of interest charged by travel cards is as high as that charged by credit cards. It’s usually in the range of 36-45% and unless you opt for a no-frills card, you would also have to pay a joining fee with an additional annual fee. “This is usually a sizeable amount in case of co-branded or specialized cards. So, make sure that the cost of the card is recovered before you opt for it,"" said Navin Chandani, chief business development officer, BankBazaar, an online financial services market place.
Some companies waive off annual fees if you spend above the threshold which varies from card to card. “Most reward cards come with a sizeable annual fee. You have to earn more in rewards than you pay for the privilege of having the card. If you spend enough, the rewards you earn often make the annual fees well worthwhile, not otherwise,"" said Chandani.
Also, note that every time you use your travel credit card abroad, you will be required to pay a network fees in the range of 1-2% of the total transaction amount to the bank for facilitating each foreign transaction. In addition, lenders also charge a foreign transaction fee. This can range from 1.5 -3.5% of the total transaction. And then there is a foreign currency mark-up fee which you pay for making the transaction in a foreign currency. While this may not seem like a lot for smaller transactions, it could run into thousands of rupees for bigger ones.
It is always advisable to keep a tab on your foreign transaction fee and cash withdrawal charges when you use your card abroad.
The benefits
Travel credit cards essentially benefit people who travel frequently. People usually associate such cards with air miles and, hence, cheaper air fares, but there’s a lot more to them, including special discounts on select websites, airport lounge access, auto upgrades on flight tickets and excess baggage allowance. Special offers and discounts at partner hotels and restaurants is yet another benefit that comes with using travel credit cards.
Rewards and benefits mostly depend on the kind of card you purchase but most travel credit card issuers collaborate with an airline company or a travel portal. For example, the Air India SBI Platinum card gives 15 reward points for every  ₹100 spent on Air India tickets, eight free airport lounge visits every year and insurance up to  ₹1 lakh on losing your card. Also, on renewing the card you get an additional 2,000 reward points.
The SBI Platinum card is one of the basic travel credit cards available in the market and is predominantly focused on making your flights reasonable.
Some of the premium cards include benefits such as concierge service for pre-trip assistance, base fare waiver on flight bookings, offers on hotel reservation and flight bookings, access to golf lessons at select gold clubs, baggage insurance, entertainment bookings and so on. “A regular credit card usually has a high foreign currency transaction fee, when compared to a travel credit card,"" said Vinay Bagri, co-founder and chief executive officer, NiYO, a digital banking solutions company. “Travel cards also have spending limits that can be configured, and hence, overspending does not really happen, while in case of credit cards, there is availability of more funds.""
Should you get one?
Which travel credit card you must pick and whether you need to get one depends on how frequently you travel and your loyalty towards certain brands, for example a particular airline.
“Travel cards are ideal for those who tend to travel a lot. These are not no-frills cards, and have a sizeable joining fee and annual fees. They offer several benefits and rewards, but they come at a price. If you do not travel frequently, you would not be able to make optimum use of these rewards and benefits,"" said Chandani.
Before opting for such a card, evaluate the spending that you’ll be required to do to get those extra offers and discounts. Don’t get tempted if the card requires you to spend more than what you can comfortably pay back. “If you are an infrequent traveller, you may want to look at other cards that may offer you benefits that suit your requirements but also provide a little extra while you travel,"" added Chandani.
“The risks (of using a travel card) are of losing the card or finding that the same isn’t working because of overuse or damage or, worse, realising that the particular brand does not work in the country you are travelling to,"" said Lovaii Navlakhi, managing director and chief executive officer, International Money Matters Pvt. Ltd, a financial planning firm.
If you are a frequent traveller, opt for a card that has minimal transaction fee. Certain travel cards also come with no foreign transaction fees. Do your research and pick a card that rewards you well for foreign transaction so that the fees get compensated for while redeeming the rewards."

MUMBAI :
In a bid to boost volumes for the struggling electric vehicles segment, State Bank of India Monday launched a discounted loan for buyers of such vehicles pricing 20 basis points lower than its existing auto loans.
Of the 3.6 million (FY19) car industry, EVs constitute around 1,000 units per annum, according to industry data, and together with two-wheelers the industry notches up over 54,000 units annually despite the many policy pushes to promote this segment of transport. But the two-wheeler segment in a 20 million business annually now.
Many in the industry blame the lack of policy clarity for the poor-show by this segment as the government has only been setting deadlines without thinking about the basic infrastructure and the billions of dollars of investments needed for that.
The best example of shifting policy stance is clear from the now-withdrawn mission of 'all-electric vehicles by 2030' by the present government. Another put-downer is the high cost of an EV as the government has not been offering enough tax incentives, leading to higher prices.
In fiscal 2018, electric scooters volume more than doubled to 54,800 from a year ago while electric car fell to 1,200 from 2,000 over the same period, according to data from the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles.
""We believe SBI green car loan (electric vehicle) scheme would act as a change agent in the auto loan segment and encourage customers to switch to electric vehicles which can improve overall air quality and lower carbon emissions,"" managing director, retail and digital banking, PK Gupta said.
The scheme that comes with the longest repayment period of up to eight years is a strategic inclusion to the bank's auto loan segment offered with zero processing fee for the first six months of the launch.

MUMBAI :
The Tata group may revive an attempt to buy Jet Airways (India) Ltd if lenders to the grounded airline fail to find a buyer and are forced to drag the carrier to a bankruptcy court, said two people familiar with the discussions at India’s largest conglomerate.
Last year, the Tata group withdrew from talks to buy the ailing airline once it became clear that Jet Airways founder Naresh Goyal was unwilling to cede control and had opened parallel negotiations with existing investor Etihad Airways PJSC of Abu Dhabi for a potential equity infusion. As part of its initial interest, the Tata group had inspected the books and assets of Jet Airways last November.
As the financial situation of Jet Airways worsened, a State Bank of India-led consortium of lenders forced Goyal and his wife Anita to quit the airline’s board as well as all operational roles.
Despite its early interest in Jet Airways, the Tata group chose to skip an ongoing sale process to find a buyer for the airline, which has received interest from four potential bidders.
“If the ongoing sale process does not succeed, then there is a high possibility that the lenders will take the airline to bankruptcy,"" the first person cited earlier said on condition of anonymity. “The Tatas have explicitly told Jet’s lenders that they will explore a deal once again only if it is available via the bankruptcy courts.""
A Tata group spokesman declined to comment.
Jet Airways flew its last flight on 17 April after lenders declined to provide emergency funds, ending at least temporarily the run of the airline that broke into a state monopoly sector and subsequently became India’s largest airline at one point. The future of the airline and its more than 15,000 employees now hinge on the ongoing sale process that is being run by the company’s lenders.
Mint reported on 19 April that Jet’s potential bidders—Etihad Airways, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners—are likely to ask lenders to take a deep haircut on its outstanding loans of over $1 billion, which may prompt the lenders to approach a bankruptcy court.
“The Tata group feels that there is need for a complete overhaul of Jet’s contracts with all third parties, which the group feels could significantly improve the airline’s bottom line and financial performance,"" said the second person cited earlier. “This, apart from Goyal’s continuity in Jet Airways, were the two key contentious issues then.""
At the time the Tata group pulled back from talks with Jet Airways, Gthe group feels could significantly improve the airline’s bottom line and financial performance,"" said the second person cited earlier. “This, apart from Goyal’s continuity in Jet Airways, were the two key contentious issues then.""
At the time the Tata group pulled back from talks with Jet Airways, Goyal wanted a minimum four-year moratorium on vendor contracts, along with a clawback option to raise his stake in the future, which was unacceptable to the Tata group, the person said, requesting anonymity.
“Acquiring Jet Airways through the bankruptcy process would insulate the acquirer from all of the above risk factors and this is the primary reason why there was no bid from the Tatas,"" said the first person.
Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the group, already has a presence in aviation through budget airline AirAsia India Pvt. Ltd and full-service carrier Vistara, a joint venture with Singapore Airlines Ltd.
Acquisition of Jet Airways will boost the group’s market share.
“However, the main driving factor is clearly Jet Airways’ foreign routes that currently account for roughly 60% of the airline’s revenue,"" said the first person.
Mint reported on 12 April that Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines had infused a combined  ₹900 crore into Vistara, bolstering efforts by the carrier to improve its financial health and take delivery of new planes from Airbus SE and Boeing Co. Of the total, Tata Sons pumped in  ₹459 crore of fresh equity by subscribing to two rights issues—one in December and the other in March."
559,2019-04-22,State Bank,"We have four weeks for the bid process to get completed and we remain focused on it, says Jet CEOPublic sector lenders led by SBI is carrying out the bidding process for new investors

Jet Airways (India) Ltd is confident of the successful outcome of a share sale process initiated by its lenders that will potentially lead to new investors for the grounded airline, chief executive officer Vinay Dube said.
However, with no emergency funds in sight and the likelihood of any investment still a few weeks away, the only task before the Jet Airways management at present is to prepare the groundwork for talks with business partners including aircraft lessors to resume operations once fresh investments are made.
“We have got four weeks plus or minus (a few days) for the bid process to get completed. We remain focused on it. Nothing much is going to happen in four weeks. It is a short period of time,"" Dube said in an interview.
The company has requested government backing in securing funds for paying at least a month’s salary to employees, Livemint.com reported on Saturday.
State-run lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) is carrying out the bidding process for new investors and has shortlisted four suitors who will now submit binding bids. Lenders have told the airline the bidding process will conclude on 10 May. The lenders may however face some hard bargaining from potential investors given Jet Airways has ceased to be a going concern.
The 25-year-old airline halted operations on 17 April after operating its last flight that evening. The airline had an outstanding debt of more than  ₹7,000 crore as on 31 December when it made its first default on loan repayments as it battled rising costs and a squeeze on cash flow.
Meanwhile, Jet Airways is continuing to witness an exodus of employees while its aircraft lessors are in talks with rival airlines to redeploy their planes. The government is separately talking to airport operators and other airlines to temporarily re-assign Jet Airways’ slots at airports so that the current capacity crunch in the industry could be bridged to some extent. Dissatisfaction of customers affected by flight cancellations could also impair Jet’s brand and make its revival hard, something that will impact the company’s valuation, according to industry experts.
Dube said it is difficult for pilots and engineers to not have salaries for three months and that the company is trying its best to find a solution. A Jet Airways official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said some employees have already left the company reluctantly owing to their financial commitments.
“We have had some employees who have left. That is natural considering the circumstances employees face. But we do have sufficient number of employees to see a resurgent Jet Airways,"" said Dube.
He denied knowledge of any company willing to invest in Jet Airways other than those that have formally expressed their interest in response to the bids called by lenders.
In response to a question on whether Air India will be allowed to operate some of Jet’s grounded planes, Dube said the company’s focus at present is to conclude the bidding process.
Mint reported on 20 April that Air India has written to SBI seeking permission to temporarily operate on lease five Boeing 777 aircraft owned by Jet Airways, which are grounded. Jet Airways’ market share has been declining over the last several months. From over 14% market share at the beginning of last year, it declined to 10% in February 2019 before a complete shutdown of operations in April."
557,2019-04-23,State Bank,"Bankers dragged their feet on a Jet Airways resolution plan and refused emergency funding on fears of scrutiny later onBankers could have invoked IBC on Jet Airways at least four months ago and avoided the value erosion that they now stare at

Mumbai: Ever heard the on-flight protocol for times of emergency landing? Perhaps bankers didn’t pay attention to it in the case of Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
While Jet Airways’ troubles began surfacing as early as June last year when the firm postponed its quarterly results announcement, bankers acknowledged the decay only after the airline defaulted on its loans for the first time in January. This is despite Reserve Bank of India (RBI) asking banks to red flag potential stress on their books.
Jet Airways’ nosedive took bankers by surprise somewhat and the scramble for a resolution plan began. But bankers dragged their feet on this and refused emergency funding on fears that they will come under the glare of investigative agencies later on.
It has taken four months for bankers to begin the bidding process, too long for Jet Airways to stay afloat.
In the meantime, RBI’s circular that mandated bankers to put in place a resolution plan was quashed by the Supreme Court. That just made it easy for bankers to extend and pretend.
It is no wonder that the parachute that bankers used was faulty. All they had to do was refer Jet Airways to insolvency courts in the first instance.
The argument that bankers had made against doing so is that a services company has no assets through which recovery is possible.
Why make 50% provisioning against a whopping  ₹9,000 crore overdue of Jet Airways when you know that insolvency would mean a fire sale?
The fallacy in that argument is that Jet Airways has little value left even now.
The real benefit of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) process is that it would have put a timeline on every step, from the appointment of a resolution professional to the framing of a resolution plan. “IBC compels creditors to negotiate rationally in the shadow of a deadline for liquidation,"" said Bhargavi Zaveri, senior researcher at think tank Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research.
Besides, finding a bidder for Jet Airways—as lenders hope—is also something that can happen under the IBC framework. It’s incorrect to state that the process of finding bidders is best done outside of IBC.
The irony of it all is that Jet Airways is likely to find itself in insolvency proceedings now. The Economic Times reports that one of the operational creditors of the airline has threatened to drag it to bankruptcy courts.
Instead of getting emotional about Jet Airways’ nosedive, bankers could have invoked IBC and avoided the value erosion that they now stare at."
554,2019-04-23,State Bank,"Perpetrators of bank frauds are always thinking up new techniques and the only way to prevent it is being watchful, says BhattacharyaThe SWIFT India chairman also stressed on the need for bank mergers to make technology spends viable

Mumbai: Bankers should never let their guard down and should always watch out for fraudulent activities as it is the only way to prevent them, said Arundhati Bhattacharya, chairman, SWIFT India.
Bhattacharya, who retired as State Bank of India chairman in October 2017, said in an interview that if bankers remain on their toes, the possibility of bank frauds comes down significantly. “It is only when our trust levels go up, we become gullible, stop being attentive or suspicious about things, that frauds happen. Bankers have to maintain their focus on what is going on in order to prevent it,"" said Bhattacharya.
Bhattacharya was appointed chairman of SWIFT India in December. SWIFT is short for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, a worldwide messaging platform for banks.
She said perpetrators of bank frauds are always thinking up new techniques to defraud banks and the only way to prevent it is being watchful. “While you are thinking of 1,000 scenarios to prevent it, they (fraudsters) will come up with another one. Bankers have to be very conscious of the fact that some people are trying to penetrate the safeguards they have,"" said Bhattacharya.
In the past, there have been instances of frauds being perpetrated by misusing SWIFT interface. These include jeweller Nirav Modi-perpetrated $2 billion PNB fraud in 2018 and the $81 million heist at the Bangladesh central bank in 2016.
Reuters reported on 5 March 2019 that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) fined at least 19 lenders, including top banks such as ICICI Bank and SBI, for failing to comply with its guidelines on the use of global payments network SWIFT. The penalties added up more than  ₹40 crore and ranged from  ₹1 crore to  ₹4 crore for each bank, according to stock exchange filings compiled by Reuters.
According to Bhattacharya, the Indian banking industry has been using SWIFT for quite some time as a mode of secured messaging. While these banks, she said, are not averse to using technology, the smaller banks do not always have the wherewithal to adopt expensive technologies. 
“That is where the difference lies between small banks and big banks. While large banks have well-established IT departments and they know that when something is being recommended, it needs to be acted upon in the quickest possible manner, some smaller banks may not have the bandwidth to react quickly,"" she said.
Bhattacharya, who oversaw the merger of five SBI subsidiaries and Bharatiya Mahila Bank with the parent in 2017, stressed the need for bank mergers to make technology spends viable. “The smaller units (banks) will not find it viable to spend the amount that technology and compliance need spending on. If you are a very small unit, it will not be worth your while to do it although you have no choice,"" she said, adding that if small banks restrict their activities to narrow banking or some kind of niche work, then they can collapse their technology requirements and compliance requirements accordingly and still be viable.
Bhattacharya said public sector banks take time to adopt technology because of the levels of compliance. “If it is new tech project or a project that requires a lot of enhancement to the existing one, you need to go through the expression of interest (EoI), the request for proposal (RFP) and the negotiation process,"" she said."

Banking stocks led the decline, with Nifty Bank index falling 0.70%. Among banking stocks, HDFC Bank fell 1% while SBI declined 1.4%. Other top losers included Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank, both falling over 2% each.

Bengaluru: mfine, a Bengaluru-based health-tech AI startup, has raised $17.2 million in Series B funding. The investment was led by SBI Investment, a Japan-based venture capital firm and a subsidiary of the SBI Group. Singapore-based SBI Ven Capital, SBI Group’s Southeast-Asian investment arm and tech-focused global venture capital firm BEENEXT, also participated in the round alongside existing investors, Stellaris Venture Partners and Prime Venture Partners.
mfine plans to use the funds to expand its hospital network across the country, build its AI technology and expand the recently launched additional services which include delivering medicines, conducting preventive health screenings and diagnostic tests.
mfine was founded in February 2017 by Ashutosh Lawania (Myntra co-founder) and Prasad Kompalli, a former business head at Myntra. The founders were later joined by Ajit Narayanan, ex-Myntra CTO, Arjun Choudhary, ex-Myntra head of growth marketing. Including the current funding round, the startup has raised over $24 million and has 200 employees in Bengaluru and Hyderabad.
Prasad Kompalli, CEO & cofounder of mfine said the current funding is ""an endorsement to mfine’s unique model of working with reputed and accredited hospitals and using technology to make quality healthcare accessible to millions of people.""
mfine partners with hospitals instead of aggregating individual doctors on its cloud platform. Specialist Doctors from these hospitals are assisted by mfine’s artificial intelligence (AI) system, improving their efficiency & effectiveness dramatically. mfine’s care team of more than 60 in-house doctors work alongside the AI system offering best possible diagnosis and care. The AI engine has the ability to diagnose and triage over 1200 common diseases, read hundreds of health parameters in the diagnostic reports thus saving significant time for the doctors.
Over 100,000 customers have consulted on mfine in the last 15 months and its customer base is growing 30% month over month, claimed the startup in a press statement on Tuesday. It added that more than 500 doctors from over 100 reputed hospitals practice across 20 specialties on mfine.
mfine aims to be one of the largest virtual hospitals in the world with services across primary care, secondary care and chronic care management. In the next 12 months, it hopes to bring together India's top 250 hospitals, from 10 cities with more than 2500 doctors onto its virtual hospital platform. The company will be simultaneously tripling its investments in AI, mobile engineering and hardware integration.

551,2019-04-24,State Bank,"The RBI's 2 rate cuts this year, totalling 50 basis points, have not been followed with moves of a similar magnitude by commercial banksAfter April's cut, RBI Governor said the central bank was 'conscious' that the transmission of rate decisions had to be 'appropriate and effective'

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India's surprise announcement of new open market purchases of government bonds is a sign the central bank is stepping up efforts to increase the economic impact of its policy decisions, analysts say.
The RBI's two rate cuts this year, totalling 50 basis points, have not been followed with moves of a similar magnitude by commercial banks, which are reluctant to take risks while sitting on a pile of non-performing loans.
But RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das, who took over in December, has shown more willingness than his predecessor Urjit Patel to experiment with liquidity management in a bid to smoothen the transmission mechanism of his policies.
If banks don't lower their interest rates, consumers and businesses don't benefit from RBI's moves, and the overall growth impact of rate cuts is less than intended.
In an unexpected move late on Tuesday, the RBI announced a new set of open market operations to purchase a total of  ₹25,000 crore ($3.58 billion) worth of bonds in May, with the first auction for  ₹12,500 crore on 2 May.
While such operations are not unusual, the timing of the announcement took markets by surprise, as it came immediately after the central bank's second ever $5 billion buy/sell swap auction which has resulted in net infusion of nearly  ₹70,000 crore in the banking system.
The swap auctions were introduced last month to ensure banks had enough liquidity to be comfortable with lowering rates for their customers.
""Infusing $2-3 billion of durable liquidity monthly is the only way for transmission of RBI rate cuts to lending rate cuts,"" said Indranil Sen Gupta, chief India economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Sen Gupta expects the RBI to cut rates by another 25 bps in June on the back of benign inflation, which ran below the central bank's target for an eighth straight month in March.
Traders trying to read the tea leaves in the RBI announcement also pointed to the five maturities it picked for the operation: 2020, 2023, 2026, 2028 and 2032. Yields on those bonds have been particularly stubborn.
""Market yields on these papers have moved above the levels which were prevailing before the rate cuts, so clearly the cuts have had no impact,"" a trader at a private bank said.
Broken pipes
After April's cut, RBI's Das said the central bank was ""conscious"" that the transmission of rate decisions had to be ""appropriate and effective.""
Underscoring his frustration, State Bank of India (SBI), the country's largest lender, has only cut its marginal standing facility rate by 5 bps this year.
Analysts say India's interest rates are among the highest in Asia when adjusted for inflation and are weighing on growth. India had the worst quarter in five at the end of last year and economists expect a further slowdown in January-March.
""Banks will not transmit lower rates unless they get easy money,"" said Murthy Nagarajan, the head of fixed income at Tata Mutual Fund."

Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) Wednesday said its board has given its approval to raise up to $2.5 billion (around  ₹17,000 crore) through bonds in FY20. 
In a statement issued Wednesday, SBI said the board has approved “long-term fund raising in single/multiple tranches up to $2.5 billion under Reg-S/144A, through a public offer and/or private placement of senior unsecured notes in US dollar or any other convertible currency during 2019-20.""
In January, SBI had raised $1.25 billion through bonds from the overseas market.
The bank had said in a statement that it concluded the standalone issuance of fixed rate senior unsecured notes in two tranches of $850 million for five years with a coupon of 4.375%, and $400 million for three years with a coupon of 4%, payable semi-annually.
The lender posted net profit of  ₹3,954.81 crore in the December quarter of FY19, the highest ever in seven years. It had posted losses of  ₹2,416.37 crore in the year-ago period. 
Net profit rose on account of improved asset quality and strong net interest income growth. Profit was higher than the  ₹3,270 crore estimated by a Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts.

A savings account is one of the basic financial products that everyone must have. All the major banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Bank Of Baroda (BoB), Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer their customers several variations of savings accounts. These are just basic savings accounts where you can leave your money and earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6%, depending on the amount and the bank. The interest amount then gets credited to the customer on a quarterly basis, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules.
Here are the savings account interest rates for major Indian banks:
SBI: The State Bank of India, the largest one, offers its customers 3.50% interest rates on savings deposit balance of up to  ₹1 crore. Above  ₹1 crore, the interest rate levied on savings balance is 4% per annum. Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4 April, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft rate will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
Kotak Mahindra Bank: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh.

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI :
The grounding of India's Jet Airways is turning into a quick windfall and long-term opportunity for international airlines keen to scoop up nearly a million outbound passengers from what was once the nation's biggest airline.
Jet, which previously had a fleet of around 120 largely Boeing Co planes, was forced to indefinitely halt all flight operations on April 17 after its banks rejected the carrier's plea for emergency funds.
The carrier's descent into crisis has benefited international airlines in the form of rising fares and demand, data showed.
Fares from India to cities such as Dubai, London, New York, Singapore and Bali in the first quarter of 2019 rose between 4% and 32% from a year ago, according to Indian travel portal MakeMyTrip Ltd.
In the peak travel months of May and June, fares to London have spiked as much as 36 % and tickets to San Francisco are up nearly 20 percent from a year ago, according to data from travel portal Yatra.com.
""For the next three months it's actually bonanza time for international players,"" said Ashish Nainan, a research analyst at CARE Ratings. ""At least until the middle of June, the fares are not going to come down.""
Due to rising demand, even before Jet's lessors grounded planes, carriers such as British Airways, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd, Singapore Airlines Ltd and United Airlines saw an up to a 27% increase in passenger numbers from India in the last quarter of 2018, data from India's aviation regulator showed. That is the latest period for which the data is available.
India is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, clocking 15-20% domestic growth in recent years. It has long had only two full-service long-haul carriers, state-run Air India and Jet.
Jet is now hoping to be bailed out by a new investor, with final bids due on May 10.
INCREASING CAPACITY
Before its grounding, Jet had the biggest share of India's outbound international air traffic, carrying 12% of the 7.8 million passengers headed overseas in the Oct-Dec quarter, down from 14% a year earlier, data from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation showed. The total number of passengers travelling overseas with Jet fell 10 percent during the last quarter of 2018 even as the outbound travel market grew about 5%.
Meanwhile, Singapore Airlines posted a 27% increase in passengers from India, Cathay registered 17% growth and British Airways saw a 10%  rise in the same period.
Cathay said the events at Jet combined with increasing demand for travel had led it to deploy larger aircraft with more seats on some Indian routes.
""In the long term we would certainly like to be able to offer more capacity into India, not just on our existing routes but by establishing new services to secondary cities,"" Cathay said in a statement.
Singapore Airlines, in an email to Reuters, said the Indian market is ""very promising"" but declined to give details of airfare levels or demand patterns in the wake of Jet's exit, citing a quiet period before the release of its annual results.
DOMESTIC GAINS
Jet's grounding has also had a big impact on the domestic market, with inter-city air fares to major cities such as New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata soaring more than 20 percent in May and June, according to Yatra.com.
The spike in fares is expected to underpin strong earnings for IndiGo and SpiceJet Ltd, which are set to report results for the quarter ended March 31 in the coming weeks.
""Domestic Indian carriers are the main benefactors, but I suspect if Jet fails to be revived by May 10 then Vistara and other airlines that ply international routes, particularly the lucrative Gulf market, are the main winners,"" said Shukor Yusof, the head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics. Vistara is a joint venture of India's Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines.
Inadequate bilateral traffic rights between India and other countries, however, could be an impediment to foreign carriers' hopes of winning business lost by Jet, some analysts said.
""Even before Jet's operational shutdown, international capacity was significantly constrained,"" said Kapil Kaul, CEO for South Asia of consultancy CAPA. ""We have now more serious capacity challenge ... this is unlikely to be stabilised in the near term.""
A new national government likely to be in place sometime after elections end in May is expected to address the international capacity constraints, and once bilateral agreements are eased airlines including Emirates, Turkish and Qatar would immediately benefit, said Kaul.
""We would love to add more flights but we are at the limit of the allocation granted to us for traffic rights,"" Emirates Chief Commercial Officer Thierry Antinori told reporters in Dubai on Wednesday."

Amazon India is gearing up to host the a summer sale from May 4. The sale will see smartphones including the Apple iPhone X, OnePlus 6T, Samsung Galaxy M20, Honor View 20, Vivo NEX and Samsung Galaxy S9 among others on discounts and offers. The sale will end on May 7.
Amazon has partnered with SBI to offer 10% discount to its debit card users. Additionally, Amazon claims that it will offer up to 40% off on smartphones across categories during the sale.
The OnePlus 6T is considered to be the best bargain of sale. The OnePlus 6T already received a price cut of  ₹4,000 last month. OnePlus at the moment said that the price cut was available for a limited period only.
This means, along with the price cut, OnePlus 6T's base variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage was available at  ₹34,999, down from its original price of  ₹37,999.
The 8GB RAM and 256GB storage model also received the discount of the same amount, and it retailed for  ₹41,999. We expect the smartphone to receive a similar discount during the summer sale. The OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro are due for launch in India on May 14 and the OnePlus 6T's price cut makes sense just prior to the launch of its successors.
Commenting on the upcoming Amazon summer sale Manish Tiwary, Vice President - Category Management of Amazon India said, ""As the most trusted and visited e-commerce destination, we look forward to celebrating every occasion with our customers. Amazon Summer Sale has been curated to offer everything customers are looking for this season and more!

MUMBAI :
In a clear indication of lack of support from the lenders on further funding, Jet Airways chief executive Vinay Dube has said it is painful that there is no commitment on the part of the all stakeholders on paying salaries to the employees which are due in a few days.
The now grounded airline has not paid March salaries to its over 20,000 employees. Jet ceased operations on April 17. April salary is due in a few days.
The airline suspended operations after the SBI-led consortium of lenders rejected its demand for a  ₹983-crore lifeline to help carry out operations and pay to the employees their March salaries.
""While we will continue to support the bank's bid find a buyer or the airline, it pains us to communicate that no clarity or commitment on salaries has been provided by any of our stakeholders so far,"" Dube said in a communication to employees Friday.
Significantly, on Friday the employees had planned to take out a peace walk towards the venue of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's election rally in the BKC are here, but was cancelled at the last minute on request from the police and the state government.
""While on the one hand, we are being told to preserve the value of Jet Airways during the bid process, on the other hand, with no salary payment, some of our colleague have no choice but to find employment elsewhere.
""When we highlight the disappointing irony of this situation to the lenders, we are simply told that this problem is to be addressed by the shareholders, who should and could have agreed on a resolution plan a long time ago,"" Dube lamented in the letter.
He also said though there have been many board meeting, the promoters and strategic shareholder (Etihad) there was no favourable outcome on funding and paying salaries so far.
""We have also approached government at the highest levels seeking intervention and assistance but that too has not yielded any positive results,"" he added.
Dube also said in the past few days the leadership team is trying to convince the lenders to release some funds to the employees, while continuing to support the bank led bid sale process.
""We have told them repeatedly that our employees are facing grave hardships owing to non-payment of salaries and that if this were to continue any longer, our employees will have no option but to find employment elsewhere.
""Unfortunately, the banks have said they are unable to make any salary commitments, until after the bidding process is complete,"" he said."
544,2019-04-27,State Bank,"SBI recurring deposit has terms ranging from 12 months to 120 monthsGenerally, banks offer higher rates when the RD tenure is above 15 months

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) offers several types of deposit schemes for short-term and long-term investments. Fixed deposits (FDs) and recurring deposits (RDs) are two such products offered by SBI that earn higher interest rates. RD is a kind of term deposit which allows the investor to invest a fixed amount of funds every month. You get a fixed rate of return on RDs, which depends on the amount of investment and tenure.
The benefit in RDs is that you would get the same interest rate even on the last installment that you may pay after a year even if the rates are lower. Generally, banks offer higher rates when the RD tenure is above 15 months. SBI RD account can be started with a minimum monthly deposit of  ₹100 and in multiples of  ₹10. However, there is no maximum limit.
SBI recurring deposit has terms ranging from 12 months to 120 months. SBI RD interest rates vary between 6.40% and 6.85% for regular customers and an additional interest rate hike of 0.50 percentage points for senior citizens. For instance, SBI’s 1-year recurring deposit will fetch you a 6.8% interest rate. For the same period, senior citizens will earn 7.30% per annum. For the term period of 1-2 years, the rate of return is 6.8% for general citizens and 7.3% for senior citizens.
For medium-term tenure (3-5 years), the rate of return offered by SBI is 6.80% for general citizens and for long-term investments (5-10 years), the rate of return is 6.85%.
For senior citizens, SBI’s rate of return on RD account is 0.50 percentage points more than that for regular citizens. For a medium-term tenure, the rate of interest for the recurring deposit scheme is 7.3% and for long term tenure, it is 7.35%."

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India (SBI) is planning to optimise costs by rethinking the role of branches to see what activities and processes currently performed there can be centralised.
As part of the exercise, the nation’s largest lender will appoint a consultant to suggest strategies to optimize balance sheet and maximize return on asset and pre-provisioning operating profit, a document seeking bids showed.
This comes at a time when banks are increasingly looking at deployment of technology to cut down on physical infrastructure cost.
As part of its public sector bank reform agenda announced in January 2018, the government said that banking from home and mobile will progressively make brick-and-mortar branch visits redundant.
“Promote digital banking, such as internet banking, mobile banking, integrated mobile apps and phone banking,"" the government said in the reform agenda.
The SBI document added that the consultant would require to identify long-term growth opportunities for the bank, strategies for current account acquisition and increasing its balances.
“The consultant should perform an upfront diagnostic to identify opportunities that have the potential to improve bank’s return on assets (RoA) and pre-provisioning operating profit (PPOP) by performing a detailed design for mutually selected opportunities,"" the bank said.
In this process, the bank wants to benchmark overall portfolio with peer banks, identify opportunities for improvement in share of high-yield products like personal loans and business loans.
SBI posted a net profit of  ₹3,954.81 crore in the December quarter, the highest in seven years. Net profit rose on account of improved asset quality and strong net interest income (NII) growth.
Net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and that paid on deposits, rose 21.42% to  ₹22,690.99 crore, from  ₹18,687.52 crore in the corresponding period last year.
Other income, which includes core fee income, dropped 0.61% to  ₹8,035.23 crore in the three months from  ₹8,084.17 crore a year ago. The state-run lender has deposits of over  ₹28 trillion and advances of more than  ₹20 trillion as on 31 December 2018."

HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s profitability metrics for FY19 outshone those of its closest rivals SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
HDFC Life reported growth of 13% in annualized premium equivalent (APE), slower than its past performance. But its rival ICICI PruLife reported no growth at all. SBI Life did marginally better with 14% growth in APE.
But its value of new business margin of 24.6% was superior compared with SBI Life’s 17.7% and ICICI PruLife’s 17%. But there is no secret sauce here. All insurers have realized that growing the margin-friendly protection business is key to better profitability.
HDFC Life has just been more successful than others in pushing plain term plans. In FY19, more than a quarter of its new business came from selling plain protection products. ICICI PruLife is far behind with a share of 9.3%, while SBI Life had 12% of new business coming from term plans.
So, why are analysts wary on HDFC Life and prefer to be bullish on SBI Life and even ICICI PruLife? Nomura Securities India Pvt. Ltd has a neutral rating on HDFC Life, while Deutsche Bank recommends hold. Both have a buy rating on SBI Life and ICICI PruLife.
According to analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, SBI Life has the muscle for distribution compared with others as it has exclusive access to parent State Bank of India’s (SBI’s) branches. It has also shown superior traction in its protection business and its persistency ratios outshine those of peers.
“(SBI’s) management is confident of growing protection faster than the overall annual premium equivalent. Persistency trends and surrender ratio of SBI Life remains favourable,"" noted analysts at Deutsche Bank.
However, a large part of analysts’ stock preferences within the life insurance space has to do with the valuations of the three companies. HDFC Life has run up 13% over the last two months and trades at a multiple of more than four times its embedded value for FY19.
Compare this to SBI Life’s multiple of about three times and ICICI PruLife at about two times, HDFC Life indeed looks richly valued."

538,2019-04-30,State Bank,"Although there are talks of a rescue being mounted, led by SBI, the longer Jet Airways stays out of operation, the more difficult it is for it to be revivedIn the aviation business, there is no mezzanine level of service, no middle ground. You are either a premium airline or a cost leader

After almost 27 years in business, it looks increasingly likely that aeroplanes painted with the Jet Airways livery have made their final touchdowns.
On April 17, Jet Airways suspended all domestic flights following its inability to obtain interim funding necessary to continue operations. Just 5 days before, it announced the ""temporary"" cessation of its international routes as a stop-gap measure to give itself some breathing space from creditors which are owed some USD 1.2 billion.
In its heyday, it flew to 22 international cities and over 50 local airports. It was once India's most valuable airline, had the largest market share in India and admired by Indians for breaking the monopoly of state-owned Air India and bringing into the market better services, reliability, and nicer aircraft.
Although there are talks of a rescue being mounted, led by State Bank of India, the longer Jet Airways stays out of operation, the more difficult it is for it to be revived. In the meantime, staff - pilots, aircrew and ground staff who have not been paid for months have been leaving and joining other airlines. Competitors like SpiceJet and Indigo have also been using the landing slots in airports that have been vacated by Jet.
So, is there something that Jet Airways and the airline industry in India can learn from Singapore? Following are some generic suggestions. It is not meant to be an analysis of how Jet Airways got into trouble.
Decide on your business model and stick to it
When budget carriers started to emerge in the early 2000s, Jet Airways flirted with the new business model. Initially acquiring Air Sahara for USD 200 million and re-branding it JetLite and later on merging it with another of its brands Jet Konnect. JetLite was positioned somewhere between a low-cost carrier and a full-service carrier. Jet Konnect had similar branding as its parent company but a lower level of service. This brought much confusion into the market.
In the aviation business, there is no mezzanine level of service, no middle ground. You are either a premium airline or a cost leader.
In 2004, when Singapore regulators approved the operations of budget airlines out of Changi, Valuair was one of the few who jumped into the fray. Valuair jointly owned by a Singaporean businessman Dennis Choo and Qantas offered lower fares together with assigned seating and meals. After just slightly over a year it merged with Qantas's Jetstar Asia.
Budget airlines by definition appeal to the budget-sensitive travellers and especially in the cost sensitive Indian market must be prepared for a fight to the bottom. This means embracing the all the features of budget carriers like flying point to point, using a single aircraft type, landing in airports that charge the least for landing rights, high aircraft utilisation and charging for everything like booking fees, meals, luggage, blankets and even hand baggage if possible.
Innovate
Innovation is not just about introducing fancy movie and entertainment experiences onboard, sophisticated and luxurious seats or offering blockchain powered digital wallets and a comprehensive frequent flyer programme. Singapore Airlines (SIA), being a premium airline, offers all of the above.
However, if a decision is made to operate as a discount carrier, then Ryanair, the leading budget airline in Europe is a good example of being innovative. Led by its charismatic founder and CEO Michael O'Leary, it always comes up new ways to shave dollars off air tickets. Whether for publicity purpose or whether they really meant it, there was talk about Ryanair introducing fees for the use of toilets in planes, charging overweight people more for their flights and even making passengers carry their own luggage to the plane. Ryanair has become synonymous with cheap tickets because they go out of their way to save costs, so travellers are somewhat assured they are getting the best deal when flying with them.
Recently, when Italian seat manufacturer Aviointeriors introduced ""standing seats"", at the Aircraft Interiors Expo 2019 (AIX) in Hamburg, Germany, travellers instantly connected this idea with Ryanair.
Build code share alliances
For full-service carriers, connectivity is key. This is especially so for the more lucrative international routes. No airline can fly to every city. Domestic routes might provide the base passenger load, but it is the international ones that earn the most profits. It is thus important to build strong partnerships. SIA has more than 30 code share partners and many of them are not part of the Star Alliance group which it is a member of.
Jet Airways was not decisive enough in this regard. Initially, it thought about joining Star Alliance and for reasons which are not clear, then started working more closely with airlines belonging Sky Team. When Etihad took a 24 per cent stake, it started to work more closely with Etihad and routed its flights through Abu Dhabi.
Watch the bottom line
SIA may be famous for the Singapore Girl, pampering their passengers and promoting the romance and glamour or air travel, but the management keeps a close eye on costs and are not afraid to cut back when required.
First of all, SIA also does not hesitate to terminate routes that are not profitable. Cebu, Chicago, Washington DC, Vienna, Istanbul, and Sao Palo among the almost 50 cities it has stopped flying to in recent years.
After the global financial crisis in 2008, there was a severe softening of demand for air travel and Singapore Airlines went through a brutal cost-cutting exercise, suspending recruitment, and letting go of staff including almost 80 pilots.
In April 2017, after it reported its first quarterly loss in five years for the fourth quarter which ended in March, SIA underwent a review of its operations and came out with a three-year transformation programme. The review included ways of managing costs more efficiently, new pricing policies, ways to improve aircraft usage and the consolidation of some departments. As a result, it was decided to merge its regional brand Silkair with the main airline. Much earlier, it had already merged Tigerair, it's a no-frills carrier with another of its low-cost brand Scoot.
Within a year, it recorded its highest profit in seven years and regained the coveted Skytrax best airlines award from Qatar after last winning it nine years ago.
One of the financial structural problems Jet Airways faced was that it was heavily reliant on leased aircraft. While leasing allows a new airline to get off the ground quickly, as it expanded and grew its fleet, it made it's operating expenses very high. The fact that Jet leases most of its aircraft made it vulnerable to the planes being taken away by leasing companies when it could not pay them and that is what happened. Globally, on average, airlines own half its fleet and leases the rest.
In India, demand for air travel has seen an unprecedented boom. Passenger growth in recent years has been in double digits year on year. By mid-2020s India is forecast to be the world's third largest market for air travel. If, however, airlines do not learn from the troubles at Jet Airways, there will be more airline failures to come in the near future.

MUMBAI :
Patanjali Ayurved on Wednesday sought more time from the National Company Law Tribunal to file a detailed resolution plan for edible oil firm Ruchi Soya which it has agreed to take over for  ₹4,325 crore.
The company owes  ₹9,345 crore to the lenders led by SBI who Tuesday agreed, with around 96% vote, to go with the second revised bid by the company promoted by yoga practitioner Ram Dev.
Its initial offer was  ₹4,160 crore along with an  ₹1,700 crore working capital. The deal leaves the banks with a huge haircut of over 51%  of the debt.
When contacted, Patanjali spokesman SK Tijarawala confirmed the bid approval. ""We are informed about the development. Voting has gone in our favour. Tomorrow they would give us the voting result and then we would proceed further,"" he said.
Granting time to Patanjali, the tribunal comprising VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy posted the matter for further hearing on May 7.
Patanjali almost got a walkover after rival Adani Wilmar decided to pull out from the race late last year despite being the highest bidder. With the acquisition of Ruchi Soya, Patanjali will become a major player in soyabean oils and other products.
In December 2017, NCLT had referred Ruchi Soya for insolvency on applications moved by Standard Chartered Bank and DBS Bank and appointed Shailendra Ajmera as the resolution professional.
Patanjali, the lone player left, had last month increased its bid value by around  ₹140 crore to  ₹4,350 crore. The offer excludes capital infusion of  ₹1,700 crore.
Ruchi Soya Industries owes over  ₹9,345 crore to financial creditors led by the State Bank, which has an exposure of  ₹1,800 crore, followed by Central Bank at  ₹816 crore, Punjab National Bank at  ₹743 crore and StanChart at  ₹608 crore.
Ruchi Soya has many plants and its leading brands include Nutrela, Mahakosh, Sunrich, Ruchi Star and Ruchi Gold and has one of the best functional and the largest infrastructure for soyabean,"" Patanjali's Tijarawala said, as the reason revising the bid upwards.
Adani Wilmar, which sells edible oil under the Fortune brand, was the highest bidder last August after a long-drawn battle with Patanjali. Adani Wilmar had then said the process was getting delayed as Patanjali moved the Mumbai NCLT.
Patanjali approached NCLT challenging the decision of Ruchi Soya's lenders to approve Adani Wilmar's bid. The deal would help the Haridwar-based firm, which is struggling to keep growth momentum that it had seen previously.
Patanjali, which was clocking multi-fold growth in recent years, saw a marginal growth in FY18, hit by GST, finishing at around  ₹12,000 crore. In FY17 it had a turnover of  ₹10,561 crore, registering 111% growth."

New Delhi: The top lender of ailing Jet Airways India Ltd said the burden of reversing the grounded carrier’s negative net worth before it can fly again is the biggest challenge for any potential investor.
“Liabilities and losses are considerable,"" Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India, said in an interview with 'Bloomberg Television' on Thursday. “All these past liabilities and then, profitably, can they fly in future? These are some of the considerations which are weighing upon the minds of the potential investors.""
Creditors led by State Bank of India have put Jet Airways up for sale after the carrier failed to pay back debt. Once India’s biggest airline by market value, Jet Airways has been a victim of a budget airline boom in the fiercely competitive market in the South Asian nation, where carriers offer base fare of as low as 1 cent to lure first time flyers.
The airline, which stopped all flights last month, has made losses in nine of the past 11 years. Jet Airways has seen lessors taking away its aircraft while rivals start services on routes it previously operated.
The deadline for submission of binding bids to take over control and ownership of Jet Airways is 10 May, Kumar said. The lenders, to which the airline owes more than $1 billion, have yet to take a call on how much debt will be forgiven, he said.
Jet Airways, the oldest surviving private airline which broke into a monopoly of Air India Ltd., had a fleet of 124 and flew profitable routes like connecting India with London and Toronto.

""We believe that if the current trend continues, this year's turnout rate may cross the previous turnout, it may, in fact, be the highest since independence. Hence a 1 per cent incremental turnout from current trend of 67 per cent after 4 phases could make it the largest turnout since 1947,"" the report said.
It further said the 2019 general elections are unique in many aspects.
Going by the voter turnout trend over the years, Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat, Karnataka have registered highest ever voter turnout since 1962 or in the last 57 years after independence.
Similarly, Chhattisgarh has seen a 15 years and Maharashtra a 30 years high in voter turnout.
""This particularly suggests that now citizens are more aware about their rights and responsibility, thanks to relentless campaign by multiple stakeholders starting from election commission to civil societies who are encouraging all to cast their vote,"" said Ecowrap.
The SBI's research report also notes that young, elderly and women all seems to taking part in Indian elections.
It said states like Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh (partial) and Rajasthan (partial), where the percentage of younger voters (aged between 18-25) on an average is more than national average, there is a 3.3 per cent increase in voter turnout.
States like Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala, where the elderly population is higher than national average, have also witnessed an increase in voter turnout on an average by 1.8 per cent.
Improvement in women voter turnout could be attributed to measures like Jan-Dhan, Mudra, Ujjwala schemes which lead to women empowerment, it added."
536,2019-05-02,State Bank,"SBI will link interest rate on large savings account deposits to RBI's repo rate from May 1Interest rate on SBI's short-term loans like cash credit and overdraft facilities will also be linked to the repo rate

From May 1, India’s largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) has moved to a new interest rate regime on large savings account deposits as well as short-term loans. In March, SBI had announced that it will link its interest rate on savings account with balance above  ₹1 lakh and short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility to Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) repo rate, effective 1 May 2019. Or in other words, interest rates on large SBI savings account deposits and interest rate on some short-term loans will automatically change as and when RBI changes its repo rate. This will help in better transmission of RBI’s policy rates into the banking system. SBI's domestic savings bank deposits stood at more than  ₹10.64 lakh crore at end-December 2018.
Here are 5 things to know about SBI's new rules on savings accounts and overdraft facility:
1) After back-to-back interest rate cuts by the RBI in February and April, repo rate currently stands at 6%. On savings accounts with deposits above  ₹1 lakh, SBI will be offering interest rate of 275 bps below repo rate from May 1. This means effective rate will be 3.25% per annum. Currently, SBI offers interest rate of 3.5% on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 crore and 4% on deposits above  ₹1 crore.
2) SBI savings accounts with balances up to  ₹1 lakh will continue to fetch interest rate of 3.50% per annum. This comprises about 95% of total SBI savings account holders.
3) Also, from May 1, SBI will link short-term loans such as cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate for better transmission of RBI’s policy rates.
4) All cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh will also be linked to the benchmark policy rate, plus a spread of 2.25%—amounting to 8.25%.
5) SBI will charge a risk premium on these loans, over and above the floor rate of 8.25%, based on the risk profile of the borrower, similar to the current practice.
Analysts are positive about the impact of SBI's move to introduce a rate mechanism that is transparent and that can be quickly transmitted when there is a regulatory change. ""A variable interest rate on assets and liabilities is in the best interest of a bank as it could reduce NIM (net interest margin) volatility,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note earlier.
Earlier, in December 2018, the RBI had in proposed that floating interest rates on personal, home, auto and micro and small enterprises (MSEs) loans should be linked to external benchmarks like repo rate or treasury yields, from April 1, 2019. However, RBI later deferred the deadline saying it will hold further discussions with banks on linking interest rates.
On April 9, SBI had reduced its MCLR by 5 bps across all tenors, with 1-year MCLR coming down from 8.55% per annum to 8.50%."

527,2019-05-05,State Bank,"A home loan is called a ‘good’ loan because it helps you acquire a tangible asset that can appreciate over the long termA look at the latest home loan interest rates of some leading banks

A home loan is probably the biggest loan that most people ever take. Not only in terms of the loan amount, but also tenures, which can easily be of 15 years or more. And the total final amount that one ends up paying by the time the loan ends, can be double of what was borrowed. But, a home loan is among the cheapest loans available, and most often, it is the only way a person can buy a house. A home loan is called a ‘good’ loan because it helps you acquire a tangible asset that appreciates over the long term. 
A point that many to-be borrowers ask is should I rent or should I buy, especially when the amount being paid as rent seems heavy. One of the factors to consider here is whether you want to live in that house or it’s for investment. It makes sense to buy a house if you plan to live in it. This is also the reason, apart from the fact that many housing projects in India continue to be delayed by many years, why financial advisers say that one should buy a ready-to-move-in house.
If you are looking at it as an investment, then one must look at the compounded annual returns the asset can give, and the risk involved, just as you would with any other asset class. Read more here.
But if the reason is to live in the house, then any time is a good time to buy. Here’s a look at the latest home loan interest rates."

With an aim to enable the further recapitalisation of public sector banks (PSBs), the Finance Ministry may seek a relaxation for PSBs in the market regulator Sebi's norms for entities requiring promoters to have 75 % holdings in them, according to a senior official source
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) listing norms mandate that every listed entity will maintain a minimum public shareholding of 25 %.
The government shareholding in many state-run banks is currently above 75 %. In case of their further recapitalisation, this will go up over 90 % in some cases and also touch 99 %.
In prevoius years, the government had taken Sebi approval for recapitalising PSBs which had pushed up the government's stakes in these banks.
""We have taken permission from Sebi on having over 75 % government shareholding in PSBs in the past and if banks are further capitalised , we will do so again. Already the government stakes are above 75 % in many of the state run banks,"" the source said.
Asked if individual banks will take permission for exemption from Sebi's 25 % public shareholding norm, the source said the ministry seeks the approval from the market regulator.
In fact, the government has plans to cut its shareholding in many PSBs to 52%.
Market condition, however, have so far not been suitable enough for banks to move in this direction, the source pointed out.
Banks approaching the market to raise funds and cut government stake is a process in in the pipeline, he added.

MUMBAI :
British entrepreneur Jason Unsworth, who has evinced interest in investing in the now grounded Jet Airways, has claimed that the lenders' consortium leader State Bank of India (SBI) has asked him to formally submit a bid for the airline.
Unsworth is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) at Atmosphere Intercontinental Airlines, a startup he founded four years ago.
An unverified Twitter account of Unsworth said that state-run SBI has confirmed that he can still submit a bid for the airline.
The development comes days after the British entrepreneur evinced interest in investing in Jet Airways.
Last month, Jet had advised the British entrepreneur to formally engage in the matter through the ongoing bidding process.
The airline revealed its advice to Unsworth after domestic stock exchanges sought clarification from the temporarily grounded airline regarding a report which cited a British entrepreneur's offer to take control of the cash-strapped airline.
In its reply, Jet Airways had said: ""Please note that an unsolicited e-mail communication was received by the company...and the sender has been advised to formally engage with SBI Caps Ltd, which is leading the bidding process under the resolution plan initiated by the consortium of domestic lenders led by the State Bank of India.""

New Delhi: Jet Airways (India) Ltd’s pilots union, the National Aviators Guild (NAG), has approached the Supreme Court, asking it to help rescue the grounded airline.
The petition filed by NAG on Tuesday sought an appropriate order from the apex court directing the SBI ‘to provide all necessary interim finance’ to restart the airline.
The petition lists eight respondents, including the government of India, State Bank of India (SBI), directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA), Jet Airways, and the Airports Authority of India, besides Mumbai International Airport Ltd, Delhi International Airport Ltd, and Bengaluru International Airport Ltd.
A copy of the petition, which has been filed days before the 10 May deadline for submission of bids for a controlling stake in Jet Airways, has been reviewed by Mint.
Jet Airways flew its last flight on 17 April after lenders decided not to hand out emergency funds, bringing the curtains down on an era in which it broke into a state monopoly sector to become India’s largest private airline at one point.
NAG in its petition has blamed the SBI-led consortium of banks for failing to inject Rs1,500 crore into the airline, thus forcing the carrier to suspend operations. NAG has asked the apex court to direct the lenders to release money and restart operations immediately.
The pilots’ union said the respondents are acting in a manner that violates the rights of the employees of Jet Airways.

MUMBAI :
Private lender YES Bank Ltd has slipped three notches to 10th spot, in terms of market valuation, for the first time, as its shares slumped over 30% in the last four sessions after the bank reported a surprise net loss in its March quarter earnings.
YES Bank is now the 10th most valued bank from seventh earlier, slipping below market valuation of state-run lenders - Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank.
HDFC Bank Ltd is the most valued Indian bank with a market cap of  ₹6.34 trillion, followed by State Bank of India and Kotak Mahindra Bank with market cap of  ₹2.76 trillion and 2.68 trillion, respectively.
Data from BSE showed that Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) have a market capitalization of Rs.39,720 crore each. Shares of BoB traded at  ₹116.20 on BSE, down 2.31% from previous close, while those of PNB were down 1.03% at  ₹86.30. So far this year, BoB has declined 2.6%, while PNB has risen 9%.
Shares of YES Bank were down 5.3% at Rs.166.30 on Monday after rating agency ICRA downgraded its long-term ratings on the bank along with a negative outlook. Its market capitalization stood at Rs. 38,515.71 crore. The shares were also under pressure after BloombergQuint reported that the lender may see pain emerging from its exposure to the Anil Ambani Group companies. That exposure, according to information provided by the bank’s management in investor interactions held this week, could be close to  ₹13,000 crore
ICRA downgraded Yes Bank’s Tier 2, lower Tier 2, infrastructure bonds to AA- from AA, and cut upper Tier 2, Tier 1 notes to A+ from AA-, citing an increase in its lower-rated advances. ICRA also cited further weakening in the bank’s capital buffers following voluntary provisions and losses in fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.
Last week, YES Bank reported a net loss of  ₹1,500 crore for Jan-Mar, led by elevated credit cost and a steep decline in non-interest income. The bank also reported a new stress book.
""New management will aim for full blown kitchen sinking along with realignment of its business towards more granular business with focus on retail segment. Shift in accounting policies for recognition of fee income will take a toll on medium term earnings. Indicated stressed book will keep credit cost higher. Also its immediate need on raising capital will be an overhang on the stock"", said IDBI Capital in a note.
Both BoB and PNB have not announced dates for releasing March quarter earnings. However 20 Bloomberg analysts expect BoB to report a profit of  ₹913 crore, while PNB is seen reporting a net profit of  ₹9.96 crore.
""We expect a steady performance from PSU banks (PSBs). PSU banks have been benefitted by the recapitalization by the Govt. as well as some marginal benefit from Employee Share purchase scheme (ESPS) as well, which has been another avenue to provide PSBs with capital. As a result, allowing most PSBs to show stable operating performance and also facilitate higher provisions, thereby keeping NPAs under check"", said brokerage firm Sharekhan in a 9 April note.
""However, hobbled with bad assets and constraints on capital, we don’t expect PSBs to be targeting too many growth avenues, which is why we believe their pricing power, and thereby margins are also likely to be tepid, keeping the outlook subdued for most of the PSBs"", a Sharekhan report added."

The bank’s provision coverage ratio, which is a measure of the funds set aside to cover bad loans, increased to 70.6% at the end of the March quarter from 47.7% in the same period last year.
The bank therefore saw improved asset quality on account of higher provisions. Net non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total assets fell to 2.06% as on 31 March from 4.77% in the previous year.
Gross NPAs as a percentage of total assets excluding provisions improved to 6.7% from 8.84% a year earlier and 7.75% in the third quarter.
Fresh additions to bad loans stood at  ₹3,547 crore, which includes  ₹850 crore of exposure to an account in the sugar sector. The bank wrote off nearly  ₹7,300 crore of bad loans in the quarter, taking the total amount of write-offs to  ₹11,000 crore.
The management expects the situation on provisions and slippages to improve in FY20.
“The run-rate for slippages for FY19 itself has come down substantially from  ₹11,000 crore of additions compared to  ₹29,000 crore in FY18. Since slippages have reduced, loan-loss provisions should also reduce going ahead. We are at the end of the asset quality cycle,"" said Sandeep Batra, executive director, ICICI Bank.
On the operational side, the bank improved its margins to 3.72% at the end of March 2019 from 3.24% in the same period last year. Higher margins were on account of a one-time income tax refund of  ₹414 crore in the fourth quarter.
The total loan book grew 14.5% with retail loans growing at 21.7% and corporate loans at 5.7%.
The management of ICICI Bank expects to achieve a return on equity (RoE) of 15% by June 2020, improving from the current RoE of 3.2%.
Another reason for the sharp fall in net profit was higher expenses which stood at  ₹14,680 crore at the end of March 2019 compared to  ₹12,428.99 crore during the same period last year.
The management expects credit costs to normalize from the current level of 3.5%.
“In 4QFY19, ICICI Bank witnessed further improvement in balance sheet outcomes (loan growth and asset quality), adjusted for a special situation account in the sugar sector. While the NPA ratios are beginning to trend lower, suggesting that the impairment cycle is at its tail-end, loan loss provisioning continues to be elevated, largely on account of ageing provisions,"" said A.S.V. Krishnan, analyst at SBICap Securities.
ICICI Bank lost 0.11% to close at  ₹401.40 per share on Monday on the BSE, while the benchmark index, Sensex, lost 0.93% to close at 38,600.34 points. The Banking Index, Bankex, lost 0.98% to close at 33,117.33 points."

MUMBAI :
Naresh Goyal, founder of Jet Airways (India) Ltd, has offered to infuse  ₹250 crore of his own funds into the grounded airline in a new twist to protracted attempts to revive the Mumbai-based carrier.
In a letter addressed to Jet Airways’ employees on Monday, Goyal said he had made the funds available to the banks that now control the airline.
Goyal, who stepped down from the board and chairmanship of Jet Airways in April, said he would invest the funds from Jetair Pvt. Ltd, a company that he controls. Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
“Since stepping down from our respective positions, Neeta (Goyal) and I have had no role at Jet Airways after having made every possible sacrifice and commitment to ensure that the best interests of our Jet Airways family are served,"" Goyal said in his letter to employees, most of whom have not received salaries since January.
Mint had on 14 April reported that Jetair had agreed to provide the airline  ₹250 crore as loan collateral, and had also considered investing in the airline at an extraordinary general meeting on 14 January.
Goyal’s latest attempt to placate the banks comes after they rejected a potential bid by him in April to retain control of the carrier citing non-eligibility conditions for an ongoing bidding process.
In March, Goyal was forced to cede control of the airline he had founded more than two decades ago, after Jet Airways, saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors. Jet Airways eventually suspended operations on 17 April.
The sudden grounding of Jet Airways, which was once India’s largest private airline, has forced the Indian government to take steps to address the shortage in flights and minimize disruptions in the domestic civil aviation market. The government has since alloted slots of Jet Airways at domestic airports to other airlines for a period of three months to start new flights.
The consortium of banks has, meanwhile, thrown open a bidding contest to find a new investor that is expected to be completed in the June quarter. Potential investors have until Friday to submit their bids.
Mint reported on 16 April that Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners had been shortlisted to place binding bids for Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
Three of the four qualified bidders—Etihad Airways, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners—have, however, not signed non-disclosure agreements necessary for conducting due diligence before they can submit final bids, The Economic Times newspaper reported on 2 May, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Separately, a group of minority shareholders and frequent flyers of Jet Airways have reached out to SBI Capital Markets Ltd, which is running the bidding process, on 25 April to present a proposal to lenders that would revive the airline.
In a letter addressed to SBI Caps, Sankaran Raghunathan, representing the minority shareholders and frequent flyers, said that Jet Airways’ lenders should not entertain any proposal or bid from any party that sought haircut from banks on the debt obligations of the airline, as that would result in a loss for the banks.
SBI and Naresh Goyal did not respond to emailed queries seeking comments until press time on Tuesday.
According to the bidding eligibility conditions, strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector. For financial investors, the qualifying conditions are minimum assets under management of  ₹2,000 crore or at least  ₹1,000 crore in committed funds for investment in Indian firms or assets."

Further, the ongoing election season is another major variable that markets are watching closely,"" says Jagannadham Thunuguntla, head of research (wealth) at Centrum Broking Limited.
6) ""Key risks to Indian equities include unfavorable outcome of general elections, further increase in Brent crude price (leading to INR depreciation, widening trade deficit and rising inflation) and waning liquidity from FIIs and domestic mutual funds,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.
7) Neogen Chemicals made a strong debut on exchanges today, ending over 20% higher than its issue price.
8) China said on Tuesday that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit Washington on Thursday and Friday for trade talks, setting up a last-ditch bid to salvage a deal that would avoid a sharp increase in tariffs on Chinese goods ordered by US President Donald Trump.

517,2019-05-08,State Bank,"The petition filed by National Aviators Guild has sought a direction to the Centre and DGCA to disallow slots of Jet Airways to other airlines on permanent basisJet Airways started suffering losses and could not pay the employees from last December

New Delhi: Pilots of grounded Jet Airways moved the Supreme Court Tuesday seeking direction to SBI to provide the assured interim finance for restarting operations, suspension of which has affected the livelihood of around 22,000 employees.
The petition filed by National Aviators Guild has sought a direction to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to disallow slots of Jet Airways to other airlines on permanent basis.
The plea, filed by advocate Gaurav Agrawal, has sought that the airline should not get deregistered.
The distressed airlines, which had 115 aircraft, started suffering losses and could not pay the employees from last December.
The Board of Directors of the company had approved a plan on March 25 which envisaged infusing of  ₹1,500 crore over a period of time by SBI so that the company could be sold as a going concern but the promised funds were not disbursed, the plea said.
It said that SBI's decision not to infuse money was responsible for the operations of the airlines coming to stop and its substantial devaluation.
""The respondents have deliberately, or otherwise brought down the value of Jet Airways and as of now there are no bidders who have submitted the bid to SBI. Consequently the employees of Jet Airwyas have not been paid for last four months and have lost all hope of the revival of the airlines,"" the plea said.
It said the Centre, DGCA, Airports Authority of India and others have failed to appreciate the value of company which lies in the flight slots and the seats available in the international sector through various bilateral agreements.
""Despite the fact that an expression of interest has been invited and bid to process to find a new purchaser is underway, the Centre and DGCA have already started allotting slots of Jet Airways in various airports to other airlines which has seriously undermined the value of the company,"" the plea said.
The petition said that such acts of the Centre and DGCA were highly prejudicial to employees of the company who have been waiting to get paid for last five months and have been looking forward to the resolution in bid process.
""If the value of the company is deliberately undermined, the future of the employees would be at stake as there would be hardly any bidder who would be willing to take up share in the company,"" the plea said.

NEW DELHI :
The Registrar of Companies (Mumbai) has submitted the inspection report of the beleaguered Jet Airways' books to the Corporate Affairs Ministry which will shortly start examining the details.
""Action will be based on the inspection report of Jet Airways' books,"" a ministry source said.
The regional directorate of Mumbai initiated inspection of the books eight months after the ministry directed it for such a probe to ascertain if there was any diversion of funds.
The RoC's inspection of a company's books is akin to a preliminary fact-finding exercise which could lay the ground for further investigation. In the Jet Airways case, the RoC stepped in last August after the company deferred its first quarter FY19 results.
Jet Airways is passing through a critical time but has not yet landed at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). Its share sale process, led by its lenders, is underway and neither the promoters nor lenders are willing to provide the emergency funding needed for it to remain afloat till a turnaround plan is agreed upon between shareholders and lenders.
The airline's shareholders or lenders did not take it to a bankruptcy court in time. Going to NCLT would have meant a court-appointed resolution.
This has led its key lender State Bank of India (SBI) taking charge of the resolution efforts under corporate rescue plan outside the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). But with the airline's operations halted, there is a growing demand to leave it to a bankruptcy tribunal now.
So far no investor has shown any keenness in Jet's expression of interest (EoI) floated by SBI. Jet owes  ₹8,000 crore to the banks."

State Bank of India (SBI) said on Friday it has received two unsolicited bids for ailing Jet Airways, nearly a month after the airline was forced to ground all operations due to funding troubles.
Jet Airways, once India's largest private airline, stopped all flights on April 17 after its lenders, led by SBI, declined to extend more funds to keep the carrier going.
""(We have) made disproportionate efforts to keep Jet flying,"" the bank's chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters in Mumbai.
The SBI announcement comes even as Jet's offices are being vacated at many airports across the country and employee access is being revoked.
SBI has invited binding bids for a stake in the airline that is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion in bank debt and that has been struggling with mounting losses as it tried to compete with low-cost rivals.
All bids were to be submitted by 1800 IST on Friday.
""This world lives on hope so there is hope till 6pm,"" said Kumar. He declined to give any detail on the bidders, how serious the parties were and what terms were being offered by the interested parties.
If a deal fails to materialise the airline could be dragged into bankruptcy by creditors, putting at stake the livelihoods of its 22,000 employees.

Mumbai: The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), chose to take a huge knock on its profits in exchange for a less turbulent future on asset quality.
The lender reported a net profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the March quarter, way below the median estimate of  ₹4840.84 crore according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. That is because the bank set aside 24% more provision against stressed loans than it did in the previous quarter.
It beefed up the provisioning coverage ratio to 79% from 66% a year ago. SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said that accounts such as Essar Steel, Alok Industries and Bhushan Steel have been provided fully and will get the bank decent recoveries. “We have about  ₹16,000 crore recoveries in our pocket,"" Kumar said, but he preferred not to provide a timeframe. These accounts are at various stages of resolution under insolvency proceedings.
Indeed, the bank has been increasing provisions every quarter and preferred to provide 90% on all accounts that are under insolvency proceedings. In short, the bank has left nothing to chance in the future. The move is understandable given that in the past, SBI had suffered unpleasant surprises on asset quality with chunky additions. The bank’s slippages had surged in every quarter in FY18, pushing it into a loss for the year.
Kumar said by March 2020, all of the past bad loan mess would be cleaned up and provided for. To its credit, slippages have reduced sharply for the March quarter and the pipeline of recoveries look promising. Future risk in terms of special mention accounts (SMA) are low.
Investors seem to have liked Kumar’s optimism and SBI’s stock gained over 3%. That said, the lender still faces uncertainty on recoveries, the key risk to its promise of 1% return on its asset ratio."
509,2019-05-10,State Bank,"SBI had earlier cut home loan rate on 10 AprilSBI claims to have around 34% market share in home loans and auto loans

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) today reduced its marginal cost of funds based lending rate, or MCLR, by 5 basis points across all tenors, bringing down the home loan interest rate for its borrowers. After today's rate cut, the one-year MCLR will come down to 8.45% per annum, from 8.50% per annum. As a result, interest rates on all loans linked to MCLR will get reduced by 5 basis points with effect from 10 May 2019.
This is the second rate cut by SBI in a month. After the April monetary policy announcement by the RBI, SBI had cut the one-year MCLR by 5 basis points on 10 April. SBI had also reduced the interest rate by 10 bps on home loans up to  ₹30 lakh.
From May 1, India’s largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) moved to a new interest rate regime on large savings account deposits as well as short-term loans. SBI linked its interest rate on savings account with balance above Rs1 lakh and short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility to Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) repo rate, effective 1 May 2019. Or in other words, interest rates on large SBI savings account deposits and interest rate on some short-term loans will automatically change as and when RBI changes its repo rate. This will help in better transmission of RBI’s policy rates into the banking system.
After back-to-back interest rate cuts by the RBI in February and April, repo rate currently stands at 6%.
All SBI cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh are linked to the RBI's benchmark policy rate, plus a spread of 2.25%—amounting to 8.25%.
SBI charges a risk premium on these loans, over and above the floor rate of 8.25%, based on the risk profile of the borrower, similar to the current practice.
""With SBI having linked its cash credit and overdraft rates above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate for better transmission of RBI’s policy rates, the benefit of reduction in repo rate by 25 bps by RBI with effect from 4th April 2019 will get passed on in its entirety to such customers banking with SBI with effect from 1 May 2019,"" the bank said.
SBI is India's largest commercial bank in terms of assets, deposits, branches, customers and employees. SBI claims to have around 34% of market share in home loans and auto loans.
The public sector lender today posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit partly due to provisions for bad loans but reported an improvement in asset quality. Provisions for bad loans jumped 24% quarter-on-quarter to  ₹17,336 crore, but was still lower than the  ₹24,080 crore. SBI shares today ended 2.5% higher today."

MUMBAI :
The State Bank of India has posted a profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ estimates after making hefty provisions to pare bad debt. In the corresponding quarter last year, the bank had posted losses of  ₹7,718.17 crore.
A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated a profit of  ₹4,840.80 crore in the quarter, but provisions against bad loans surged 24% to  ₹17,335.84 crore in the January-March period from  ₹13,970.82 crore a quarter ago.
Provision coverage ratio, the amount set aside to cover non-performing assets, stood at 78.73%, compared with 66% during the same quarter last year.
The lender said that it has made 90% provisions against all National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, cases to avoid any future shocks.
“For three major accounts—Essar Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel and Alok Industries—that are in very advanced stages of restoration, we have made 100% provision. As a result, almost  ₹16,000 crore is what is recoverable as soon as the judicial process is over. This shows the strength of our balance sheet,"" said Rajnish Kumar, chairman, SBI.
The bank’s asset quality improved during the quarter with additions of bad loans falling sharply. The bank classified its exposure worth  ₹1,125 crore out of  ₹3,487 crore towards Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) as a non-performing asset (NPA) in this quarter.
The lender said it has done 50% provisioning on all the holding companies. It classified a  ₹1,200 crore exposure to Jet Airways as an NPA.
As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 7.53%, compared with 8.71% in the previous three months, and 10.91% in the year-ago quarter.
Net NPAs were at 3.01% in the March quarter against 3.95% in the previous quarter, and 5.73% in the corresponding quarter of last year.
“Profits, which the bank earned during the year, rather than going for any temptation to declare higher net profit, the bank has spared all that money to provide. We have not left anything for future. Now whatever happens, the remaining legacy credit cost will be done by March 2020. From 1 April, 2020, there will be no legacy cost as far as corporate is concerned,"" Kumar added.
Net interest income (NII), or the difference between interest earned on loans and paid on deposits, was up 15% from  ₹19,974.28 crore in the year-ago period to  ₹22,953.83 crore in the three months ended 31 March. Non-interest income was at  ₹12,685.12 crore, compared with  ₹12,494.78 crore during the period under consideration.
Deposits rose 7.58% to  ₹29.11 trillion, while advances increased 13% to  ₹21.86 trillion.
The bank said that it is looking to list two of its subsidiaries–SBI Card and SBI General–in the current fiscal year.
“SBI’s March quarter results validates our view that the worst in terms of asset quality stress is behind for the bank. SBI opted to go for a clean-up (and thereby strengthening) of the balance sheet this Q4 and, thus, the trend of declining incremental slippages ratio, improving PCR are further positives, and explain the higher-than-expected provisions cost. Also, the lender’s up-fronting of provisions for several individual large exposures, helps improve the medium term comfort factors for investors further,"" said Lalitabh Shrivastawa, an analyst at Sharekhan by BNP Paribas. SBI gained 2.94% to close at  ₹308.05 per share on Friday on BSE, while the benchmark index, Sensex lost 0.26% to close at 37,462.99 points."

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd. on Friday said that the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) had during September last year conducted an inspection and sought documents from the airline’s management before approaching the company again last month for seeking further documents and details.
This happened after the Registrar of Companies (ROC), an office under the Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs that deals with administration of the Companies Act, had started probe into Jet Airways books during August last year after the airline delayed the announcement of its quarterly results. Separately a whistle blower had also written to the MCA alleging siphoning of funds by the promoters of the airline.
“..the Regional Director, Western Region, Ministry of Corporate Affairs had, in September 2018, conducted an inspection and sought certain details and documents. Further details/documents were sought in April, 2019,"" Jet Airways said in a statement to the stock exchanges.
“The Company had provided the required details/documents and no further communication has been received by the Company in this matter,"" it added.
Earlier this week, the ROC had submitted a report to the MCA highlighting instances of violation of Companies Act and certain unexplained trail of funds in the books of the airline.
Mint had on Friday reported that the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) may order a probe by India’s fraud investigator after discovering instances of diversion of funds by the promoters of Jet Airways (India) Ltd, a government official said, requesting anonymity.
“MCA will take a call based on the examination of the report. The observations of Companies Act violations are serious in nature and unexplained funds trail does point to fund diversion.

514,2019-05-10,State Bank,"Reliance Securities expects SBI’s credit growth to remain healthy led by retail and corporate creditElara Capital expects SBI to post a net profit of  ₹4,254.2 crore in the March quarter of FY19

Public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI) is expected to report a profit of  ₹4,840.8 crore in the March quarter of FY19 on Friday, over a net loss of  ₹7,718 crore in the same period last year, according to a Bloomberg estimate of 19 analysts.
SBI had reported its biggest-ever quarterly loss on higher provisions in Q4 last year. It had reported a net loss of  ₹7,718 crore for the quarter ended 31 March, the second highest quarterly loss reported by an Indian bank.
Reliance Securities expects SBI’s credit growth to remain healthy led by retail and corporate credit. It added that the lack of large recoveries by the bank will limit improvement in its gross non-performing assets (GNPA) numbers. Moreover, SBI’s credit costs are expected to remain high owing to ageing of NPAs. The brokerage predicts that SBI will report a gross NPA ratio of 8.1% and a net NPA ratio of 3.6%.
In March 2018, the bank forecast that by March 2020, it would bring down its gross bad loan ratio to below 6% from the current 10.91%, and its net bad loan ratio to less than 2.3% from 5.73% now.
Meanwhile, brokerage Elara Capital expects SBI to post a net profit of  ₹4,254.2 crore in the March quarter of FY19.
Another thing to be watched out for in SBI’s results is the impact of the default by Jet Airways on its books. Of around  ₹8,000 crore that the airline owes banks, SBI’s exposure is close to  ₹2,000 crore. While private sector lender ICICI Bank recently said that Jet Airways was classified as non-performing asset (NPA) in the fourth quarter of 2018-19, it is to be seen if SBI takes a similar step. This would add to the bank’s provisions and bad loan numbers."

MUMBAI :
The State Bank of India (SBI) has received two unsolicited bids for cash strapped Jet Airways (India) Ltd., while another bid is expected before the end of the day, the bank’s chairman Rajnish Kumar said on Friday.
Kumar, who didn’t elaborate the names of the bidders, added that a binding bid is expected from one of the four interested parties that had earlier submitted their expressions of interest (EoIs) for bidding for a stake in Jet Airways.
Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners had in April submitted their expressions of interest (EoIs) for bidding for a stake in Jet Airways.
A senior SBI official told Mint that the bidder is likely to be Etihad Airways, which is expected to bid for a controlling stake in Jet Airways along with an Indian partner. The official requested anonymity.
Potential buyers are allowed to bid for as much as 75% of the carrier till Friday evening (6 pm).
Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), TPG Capital and Indigo Partners were not immediately available for comments.
Jet Airways suspended operations on 17 April under more than $1 billion of debt and a severe cash crunch. Lenders led by the State Bank of India have taken control of the airline after the resignation of its founder and chairman Naresh Goyal.
According to bid documents prepared by the lenders, strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector.
For financial investors, qualifying conditions are minimum assets under management (AUM) of  ₹2,000 crore or at least  ₹1,000 crore in committed funds for investment in Indian firms or assets, according to the expression of interest document that was made available to prospective bidders and reviewed by Mint."

Indian markets may be marginally higher on global peers support. Asian shares inched up from two-month lows on Friday just hours ahead of the US President Donald Trump administration's plan to raise tariffs on Chinese imports as investors looked to whether negotiators from the two countries can clinch a deal to avert the hike. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ticked up 0.2% while Japan's Nikkei rose 0.4%.
Trump said on Thursday he had received a ""beautiful letter"" from Chinese President Xi Jinping, stoking hopes that Washington may suspend its plan to raise tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25% from 10%. That provided some support for stocks in early Asian trade though sentiment remains cautious. Trump also said on Thursday he was taking steps to authorise new tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese imports.
Wall Street’s main indexes fell on Thursday ahead of critical trade negotiations between the United States and China, though they pared losses significantly after US President Donald Trump said reaching a deal this week was possible.
Back home, major companies that will announce March quarter results today are State Bank of India (SBI), L&T, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Syndicate Bank, Eicher Motors, Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare and IDFC First Bank among others.
HCL Technologies Ltd is likely to be in focus today after it announced a 3.5% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the January-March quarter, the highest among large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
Meanwhile, concerns about renewed escalation in the trade tensions supported safe-haven assets. The 10-year US Treasuries yield stood at 2.453%, near its lowest levels since late March.
In the currency market, the yen is favoured, with the dollar changing hands at 109.71 yen, having hit a three-month low of 109.47 on Thursday. The euro firmed to $1.12 while the Chinese yuan perked at 6.838 per dollar having hit a four-month low of 6.8638 to the dollar the previous day.
Oil prices held firm after Trump's comments on Xi's letter raised hopes for a deal for now. Brent rose 0.7% to $70.86 a barrel while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 0.9% to $62.24 per barrel.

512,2019-05-10,State Bank,"SBI-led consortium have asked a group of airline employees, seeking to make a formal proposal, to wait to see who remains in the race after the Friday deadline lapsesEtihad Airways, NIIF, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners have been shortlisted as potential investors

Mumbai: A bid being stitched together by pilots of the grounded Jet Airways India Ltd may get a hearing if no binding offers emerge from the four potential investors currently in the race, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Lenders led by State Bank of India have asked a group of airline employees, seeking to make a formal proposal, to wait to see who remains in the race after a Friday deadline lapses, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. SBI Capital Markets Ltd, which is advising Jet Airways’s lenders, has received at least three unsolicited approaches, one of the people said.
Etihad Airways PJSC, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners have been shortlisted as potential investors. Interest in the carrier waned after Jet was grounded in April and some of its landing and parking slots were temporarily allotted to rivals, the Economic Times reported.
Any investors in the debt-ravaged Jet Airways must weigh the sector’s growth prospects against India’s high jet-fuel prices and a crushing fare war worsened by the entry of no-frills carriers. The market, which saw 54 consecutive months of double-digit percentage passenger growth till February, is notoriously difficult to make money in. A staff-led bid would be rare though not without precedent. In a letter to State Bank of India last month, the group said they would model their efforts on employee-led turnarounds like that of United Airlines in 1994.
The group has secured a commitment of about $430 million from external investors and is looking at tying up a further $250 million, people involved in the discussions said, without identifying the investors. Employees will be given a stock ownership plan as part of the management buyout, they said.
Both Jet Airways and SBI Capital declined to comment.
State Bank of India — the top lender to Jet Airways — said the burden of reversing the grounded carrier’s negative net worth before it can fly again is the biggest challenge for any potential investor. Once India’s biggest airline by market value, Jet Airways has been a victim of a budget airline boom in the fiercely competitive market in the South Asian nation, where carriers offer base fare of as low as 1 cent to lure first time flyers.

505,2019-05-11,State Bank,"State Bank of India, Jet's main lender, has invited binding bids for a stake in the airline that is saddled with roughly $1.2 billion in bank debtEtihad Airways is interested in re-investing in embattled Indian carrier Jet Airways for a minority stake

MUMBAI :
Etihad Airways PJSC said on Friday it has submitted a binding bid to retain a minority stake in Jet Airways, raising fresh hopes for a revival of the cash-strapped airline. Etihad owns 24% in Jet Airways and, under current rule, can take this up to 49%.
Friday was the last day for submission of sealed bids to SBI Capital Markets Ltd (SBI Caps) for prospective investors for Jet Airways.
Soon after submitting the sole binding bid, Etihad said in a statement that it has been working consistently with key stakeholders in India over the past 15 months to help find a solution that would ensure Jet’s return as a viable and competitive Indian airline, and continues to do so.
“Etihad Airways today confirmed its interest to re-invest in a minority stake in India’s Jet Airways, subject to conditions,"" it said.
However, the Abu Dhabi-based carrier maintained that it alone cannot revive Jet Airways, which has suspended operations since mid-April due to a paucity of funds.
“Etihad re-emphasizes that it cannot be expected to be the sole investor, and that, among other requirements, additional suitable investors would need to provide the majority of Jet Airways’ required recapitalization,"" it said.
SBI Caps, which is managing the bidding process, confirmed receiving the sealed bid from Etihad Airways and said it will be submitted to lenders for examination.
“Few unsolicited offers have also been received, which the lenders may deliberate upon subsequently,"" SBI Caps said in a statement.
Under foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations, a foreign airline can only have up to a 49% stake in an Indian airline, with the majority control resting with an Indian partner.
Mint reported on 16 April that Etihad Airways, India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners were shortlisted to place binding bids for Jet Airways.
NIIF could partner Etihad to pick up a controlling stake in Jet Airways.
In March, Jet’s founder-promoter Naresh Goyal was forced to cede control of Jet Airways after the airline, saddled with more than $1 billion in debt, defaulted on payments to banks and aircraft lessors.
The carrier eventually suspended operations on 17 April.
The sudden grounding of Jet Airways, which was once the largest private domestic airline, forced the Indian government to take steps to address the shortage in flights and minimize disruptions.
The government has since allocated Jet Airways’ slots to other airlines for a period of three months.
Though the financial details of Etihad’s bid were not immediately known, Mint had reported on 22 April that Etihad Airways had asked Jet Airways’ lenders to take an 80% haircut so that it could make a fresh bid.
If Etihad’s offer is accepted, 11 banks will be forced to make sizeable write-offs to their exposure to Jet Airways."
503,2019-05-13,State Bank,"Among its conditions, Etihad wants a commitment from banks on additional loansEtihad wants exemption from an open offer that may be triggered by a change in ownership

MUMBAI :
Etihad Airways PJSC’s bid for a minority stake in grounded Jet Airways India Ltd is non-binding and subject to fulfilment of certain conditions by Jet’s lenders, two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
Jet Airways, in which Etihad owns 24%, shut operations last month after lengthy talks with Jet’s founder Naresh Goyal, external investors and Etihad were not successful.
Among its conditions, Etihad Airways wants an exemption from an open offer that may be triggered by a change in ownership structure of Jet Airways. More importantly, it wants a commitment from banks on additional loans, once it infuses equity into the company.
In April, three more companies--India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF), private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners -- had submitted their expressions of interest (EoIs) for bidding for a stake in Jet Airways. But none of them submitted a bid by the end of the deadline on 10 May.
In the past, Etihad Airways had aggressively invested in several foreign carriers to expand market share, but things haven’t turned out the way it hoped. In 2015, Etihad had to write off its investment in Italian carrier Alitalia, which filed for bankruptcy after posting a loss of more than $117 million.
It took another hit in 2017 when Germany’s Air Berlin filed for insolvency, after Etihad said that it was no longer in a position to provide financial support to the airline which had run into losses of close to $1 billion over six years.
“However, India remains a lucrative market for Etihad Airways as it is one of the biggest and fastest growing markets for Middle-Eastern carriers,"" said Mark Martin, chief executive of aviation consultancy firm Martin Consulting LLC.
“With Etihad itself in a financial mess, it will have to come in with a strategic partner with deep pockets,"" Martin added.
So far, Etihad has not been able to find a local partner and lenders may need to take about 80% haircut on their outstanding loans (to Jet Airways), two bankers said, requesting anonymity adding that India’s National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) could partner Etihad Airways to pick up controlling stake in Jet Airways.
“Etihad Airways’ decision to bid for Jet Airways could possibly be a way to preserve the bilateral it was given, as well as to protect its India feed. This (decision to place a bid) would have only made sense if Naresh Goyal quit Jet Airways, creditors give a major haircut, and if the Abu Dhabi-based airline found a credible Indian partner. And it seems they have fulfilled all these conditions,"" said a senior official with a full service carrier, requesting anonymity.
“It is, however, a very risky move for them. They have not covered themselves in glory with their investments and have had zero success in turning troubled airlines around,"" the official added.
Another aviation sector official said that Etihad’s latest move could also be a symbolic gesture so that the Indian government does not take back the 60,000 seats (under bilateral) that the Abu Dhabi airline got when they invested in Jet Airways. “Overall, it’s a risky move for Etihad,"" the person added on condition of anonymity.
“Etihad re-emphasises that it cannot be expected to be the sole investor, and that, among other requirements, additional suitable investors would need to provide the majority of Jet Airways’ required recapitalisation,"" Etihad said in a statement on Friday.
It said India is one of the fastest-growing air transport markets in the world, and a significant economic partner of the United Arab Emirates.
“Etihad has been working consistently with key stakeholders in India over the past 15 months to help find a solution which would ensure Jet’s return as a viable and competitive Indian airline, and continues to do so,"" it added.
On Friday, SBI Caps said that as part of the bidding process (for Jet Airways), a sealed bid from Etihad Airways has been received and the same will be submitted to lenders for examination.
“Few unsolicited offers have also been received which the lenders may deliberate upon subsequently,"" SBI Caps added in the statement.
Bidders are allowed to bid for as much as 75% of the carrier. According to bid documents prepared by the lenders, strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector.
For financial investors, qualifying conditions are minimum assets under management (AUM) of  ₹2,000 crore or at least  ₹1,000 crore in committed funds for investment in Indian firms or assets, according to the expression of interest document that was made available to prospective bidders and reviewed by Mint."
502,2019-05-13,State Bank,"The performance of the country’s largest lender shows key signals of how sustainable the economy’s recovery isIf investors need more reason to be sceptical about SBI’s recoveries, they don’t need to look beyond past performance

MUMBAI :
For the chief of the country’s largest lender, hope is a potent motivation to offer optimistic forecasts.
Rajnish Kumar, chairman of the State Bank of India (SBI), is hopeful of better days and his confidence stems from a remarkable improvement in the bank’s asset quality metrics. SBI’s bad loan ratios fell sharply during the March quarter not simply due to higher loan growth, but through actual reductions in the stock of toxic loans. Even fresh slippages reduced by 75% from a year ago, and loans showing incipient signs of stress also declined.
A grounded airline is unlikely to affect bad loan metrics in a big way, although the bank had to set aside a chunk of money as provisioning during the March quarter.
So, when Kumar said the world lives on hope, investors played along and forgave the bank for a woefully small quarterly net profit. SBI’s stock gained nearly 3% on Friday after the quarterly results.
To be fair, the lender gave enough reasons to cheer. Kumar indicated that the bank would be able to recover  ₹16,000 crore from errant borrowers that are undergoing insolvency proceedings. He also said the lender would bring down bad loan ratios further and that the goal of a return-on-assets ratio of 1% could be achieved a year earlier than anticipated.
This optimism stems from the sharp fall in special mention accounts (SMA), which show incipient signs of stress. SBI’s SMA stock has dropped by almost  ₹10,000 crore.
The performance of the country’s largest lender shows key signals of how sustainable the economy’s recovery is. To that extent, SBI’s metrics should mean the economy is turning around.
But here is the catch. A troubling fact is the extent of insurance SBI was raking up through provisioning, the very reason for the low profit. It seems that the lender was not sure of future recoveries. It provided  ₹17,336 crore towards bad loans even though the toxic pile of assets declined 23%. Provisions are lower than those of last year, reflecting the fall in bad loans. Even so, SBI has chosen to forgo profits to buy some peace on asset quality in the future.
In all, its provision coverage ratio went up to 78%. The act of beefing up insurance typically springs from a pessimistic view. It shows that SBI is not sure that errant borrowers would pay up, resulting in high recoveries.
If investors need more reason to be sceptical about SBI’s recoveries, they don’t need to look beyond past performance.
SBI wrote off loans worth over  ₹17,000 crore in the March quarter, taking the full-year write-off to  ₹58,905 crore. That contributes 65% to the reduction of bad loans. This means SBI has not been able to recover money from errant borrowers and has had to just remove troubled loans from its balance sheet.
Further, the fact that the lender doesn’t expect loan growth to rise from 12% is an indication that the recovery will be long-drawn.
Add the latest government data release that shows industrial output shrank 0.1% in March and things don’t look sanguine.
SBI has mended its balance sheet, but it would be better for investors to hold off a while on optimism until clear signs of growth emerge."

MUMBAI :
The markets are likely to stay volatile this week while US-China trade talks continue and India awaits for results of the general elections on 23 May. Corporate earnings of March quarter will also impact investor sentiment this week.
Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote said, “The important question next week would be - Amongst the trio: US China tiff, political outcome or quarterly results which one will dominate the markets and swing the bourses accordingly in their favour. It’s a tough match between the trade war and the elections while the company’s numbers have taken a back seat. Volatility will remain at its peak as the battle intensifies.""
Top US and Chinese trade negotiators concluded the first of two days of talks on Thursday to rescue a trade deal that is close to collapsing as Washington prepares to go ahead with plans to hike tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of goods imported from China. Tension between Washington and Beijing has risen after a major setback in negotiations last week when China revised a draft deal and weakened commitments to meet US demands for trade reform.
US President Donald Trump responded by ordering a tariff hike, and China has said it would retaliate. The 10-month-old trade war has already cost companies in both countries billions of dollars.
Meanwhile, major companies that will announce March quarter earnings this week are HDFC, ITC, Vodafone Idea, Oriental Bank, IDBI Bank, Union Bank, and Indian Bank.
Shares of State Bank of India are likely to be in focus on Monday. It posted a profit of  ₹838.40 crore. Last year, in the same quarter, the bank had posted a loss of  ₹7,718.17 crore. Provisions and contingencies of SBI surged 174.75% to  ₹16,501.89 crore during the quarter from  ₹6,006.22 crore a quarter ago.
Among macros, retail and wholesale inflation data will be released this week. India’s factory output entered negative territory in March after a gap of 21 months, contracting 0.1% to signal a slowdown in consumption, as well as investment. In February, the index of industrial production (IIP) was almost flat, growing at 0.1%.
Data released by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on Friday showed that manufacturing, with 78% weightage in the index of industrial production (IIP), contracted 0.4% in March, while mining and electricity grew 0.8% and 2.2%, respectively.

Shares of State Bank of India or SBI were trading higher today, extending gains to the third day. SBI shares were trading 1% higher at  ₹311, outperforming flat Mumbai markets. The Street’s positive response has been fueled by the state-run bank’s fourth quarter earnings. SBI on Friday posted a net profit of  ₹838.40 crore, which was much below the  ₹4,840 crore estimates of the Street. In the corresponding quarter last year, the bank had posted losses of  ₹7,718.17 crore. What hurt SBI’s net in the March quarter was hefty provisions to pare bad debt.
Provisions against bad loans surged 24% to  ₹17,335 crore in March quarter while provision coverage ratio, the amount set aside to cover non-performing assets, stood at 78.73%, compared with 66% during the same quarter last year. The lender said that it has made 90% provisions against all National Company Law Tribunal, or NCLT, cases to avoid any future shocks.
SBI’s asset quality improved during the quarter with additions of bad loans falling sharply. Net NPAs were at 3.01% in the March quarter against 3.95% in the previous quarter, and 5.73% in the corresponding quarter of last year.
Operationally, it was a good quarter for SBI with revenue retail banking business growing 15.3% to  ₹33,662 crore.

Another brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher has revised target price on SBI shares higher to  ₹427, from  ₹361 while maintaining “buy"". “SBI's core performance was better off than expectations. Also, asset quality improved on back of lower slippages. Going ahead, higher recoveries and lower slippages should improve asset quality, while better provision coverage ratio should translate to normalization in credit cost, helping improve return ratios,"" the brokerage said in a note.
JM Financial has also maintained “Buy"" on SBI shares with target price of  ₹385, with subsidiaries contributing  ₹81 to its target price. “SBI’s credit cost remained high in the quarter (3.5%), although gross slippages continued to remain benign. Management indicated that credit cost was high despite low slippages because of provisioning in the quarter was towards three large NCLT accounts,"" said the brokerage, which expects the lenders credit costs to fall going forward on large write-backs over the next two years."

With a big chunk of bad loans written off in FY19, SBI’s outstanding gross non-performing assets (NPAs) declined 23% year-on-year (y-o-y) to  ₹1.72 trillion.
Meanwhile, SBI’s loan recoveries and loan upgrades (accounts which resumed paying interest) touched  ₹31,512 crore in FY19. To be sure, keeping pace with the increasing write-off, the bank’s recovery and upgrades have also increased during the same period.
While it recovered and upgraded  ₹28,632 crore loans in the three years ended 31 March 2017, in the past two years, SBI could get back  ₹45,429 crore.
It is important to note that banks write off bad loans once it becomes unviable to recover them. Banks have to ensure they fully provide for these loans before they are written off.

While it recovered and upgraded  ₹28,632 crore loans in the three years ended 31 March 2017, in the past two years, SBI could get back  ₹45,429 crore.
It is important to note that banks write off bad loans once it becomes unviable to recover them. Banks have to ensure they fully provide for these loans before they are written off.
However, the provision requirements do not arise suddenly since lenders have to constantly increase provisions on bad loans as they age, under the central bank’s Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms.
That apart, banks recover from written-off loans and these recoveries help shore up their other income. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines technical or prudential write-off as the amount of non-performing loans which are outstanding in the books of the branches, but have been written off (fully or partially) at the head-office level.
Last Friday, after announcing the bank’s FY19 results, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said that while the bank calls it a write-off, it is only an accounting practice. “We have several times clarified that it is just a movement to advances under collection account (AUCA) and the follow-up is with the same intensity. So, it is an accounting entry, nothing else,"" said Kumar. In fact, since FY17, the bank’s presentation to analysts has started calling it “transfer to AUCA"" instead of write-off.
In the past five years, SBI has recovered  ₹22,859 crore from written-off accounts, of which  ₹13,678 crore came in FY18 and FY19.
Moreover, write-offs have clearly outpaced recoveries in the past five years even if recoveries from written-off accounts are considered. While write-offs were over  ₹1.6 trillion, recoveries (including that from written-off accounts) were at  ₹96,920 crore.
Anshula Kant, SBI managing director (stressed assets, risk and compliance), said on Friday that the bank is increasing its provisions, leading to a rise in its provision coverage ratio (PCR), and this allows SBI a chance to clean up its books.
“It gives us the freedom to write-off some accounts from the balance sheet as they are fully provided for. There is no let-up in the recovery efforts. Our stressed asset vertical is equally going after live NPAs and accounts which are transferred to AUCA category. There is no difference in approach at all,"" said Kant.
SBI posted a net profit of  ₹838.40 crore in the fourth quarter of FY19, missing analysts’ estimates after making hefty provisions to pare bad debt. In the corresponding quarter last year, the bank had posted losses of  ₹7,718.17 crore."

496,2019-05-15,State Bank,"The number of ATMs in the country shrank in the past two years despite an increase in transactionsAs security costs swell, ATM operators are being squeezed because the fees they rely on for revenue remain low

Finding an ATM in India is getting tougher even as dependence on cash persists, thanks to tighter regulations that make it more costly to run the machines.
The number of automated teller machines in the country shrank in the past two years despite an increase in transactions, Reserve Bank of India figures showed Saturday. India already has the fewest ATMs per 100,000 people among BRICS nations, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The drop may continue as banks and ATM operators struggle to absorb the cost of software and equipment upgrades mandated by the central bank last year to bolster security. That risks undermining Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s campaign of increasing financial inclusion in a nation where cash remains king less than three years after he pulled most banknotes from circulation.
“Declining numbers of ATMs will impact a large segment of the population, especially those who are socio-economically at the bottom of the pyramid,’’ said Rustom Irani, managing director at Hitachi Payment Services Pvt. Ltd., a provider of the machines. “Penetration in the country is already very low.""
As security costs swell, ATM operators are being squeezed because the fees they rely on for revenue remain low and can’t rise without the approval of an industry committee. ATM operators – which include banks as well as third parties – charge a so-called interchange fee of  ₹15 to the lender whose debit or credit card is used for cash withdrawals.
“Interchange fees are the biggest factor behind muted growth of ATMs. They have to reflect ground reality,"" said R. Gandhi, a former RBI deputy governor. “Banks are finding it cheaper to pay interchange fees to other banks rather than operating their own ATMs.""
Yet not everyone agrees that increasing fees is the solution. If they are raised, banks might pass the higher charges on to customers, according to R. Subramaniakumar, chief executive officer at Indian Overseas Bank.
Access to basic financial services including ATMs has become more crucial after Modi added 355 million people to the banking system since taking office in 2014. Many Indians opened accounts when the prime minister made 86% of banknotes illegal in November 2016. That boosted direct transfers of welfare benefits to people’s accounts, increasing reliance on ATMs.
Branch rationalization by some public-sector lenders is another factor behind the drop in ATMs. State Bank of India cut 1,000 outlets in the first half of fiscal 2018 after acquiring five associate banks and a local lender.
Banks will rely less on branches in the future as digitization changes how the sector operates, said Dinesh Kumar Khara, a managing director at SBI. One in two ATMs are located at bank branches.
The declining number of ATMs is likely to further boost mobile banking, which is growing rapidly in a country with the world’s largest millennial and Generation Z populations. The number of mobile banking transactions grew 65 times in the past five years alone.
“People are shifting to mobile apps,"" said Ashutosh Khajuria, chief financial officer at Federal Bank Ltd. “It’s too early to write an obituary on ATMs but it’s certainly declining. No one will invest in a declining proposition."""
495,2019-05-15,State Bank,"An SBI report said it is penciling a larger rate cut (in excess of 25 bps) by RBI in the forthcoming policyRBI is slated to announce its next bi-monthly policy decision on June 6

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to go for a larger rate cut, of more than 25 basis points, in its June monetary policy review to reverse the current economic slowdown, said an SBI research report.
The RBI had cut the key short-term lending rate (repo) by 25 basis points each in its last two policy reviews. The central bank is slated to announce its next bi-monthly policy decision on June 6.
""Are we currently facing a quasi growth slowdown? The apparent nervousness is clearly reflected in the trends exhibited in key stock indices,"" said the SBI's research report 'Ecowrap'.
As per a report published by ICICI Bank, there is room for the MPC to cut rates (underscored by the growing slack indicated in the diffusion index output gap), in the August policy.
""However, the action would be highly dependent on realised outcomes of monsoons (current forecasts indicate a near-normal monsoons) impacting food prices and trajectory of oil prices. We also think that we are moving towards the last leg of accommodation with both domestic and global growth poised for slight recovery towards the end of the calendar year and our own CPI headline inflation projections averaging 50-60 bps higher than MPC's,"" it said.
ICICI Bank's Research Diffusion Index indicates a slowdown in industrial activity in Q4 FY2019; while services activity is showing mixed results.
Moreover, global indicators of languishing global trade and rising commodity prices are unfavourable, along with sluggishness in rural activity, it said.
""Based on these indicators we expect GDP growth in Q4 FY2019 at ~6.2-6.3 per cent and improve slightly to 6.5 per cent in Q1 FY2020,"" it said.
SBI Report said that the initial trends in fourth quarter of 2018-19 exhibit overall decline in sectors such as telecom equipment and infra services; agro chemicals; petrochemicals; infrastructure developers and castings.
Also, pharmaceutical companies dependent on exports are likely to report poor growth numbers. In January-March 2018-19 quarter, of 384 companies more than 330 companies exhibited negative growth in mid-line and bottomline.
Perhaps, significantly depressed rural prices is disturbing rural income and weak demand is affecting the FMCG sector, the report said.
Overall, the report said: ""We still believe the current slowdown could still be transitory, if proper policies are adopted in interregnum. For example, the high real interest rates are severely acting as a impediment to investment.""
To this end, ""We are thus penciling a larger rate cut (in excess of 25 bps) by RBI in the forthcoming policy"".
However, such larger rate cuts will still not help fully but transmission will, said the Ecowrap.
The RBI should now ensure that asset and liability side of banks move in tandem and ensure repo rate is directly benchmarked to non-volatile bank liabilities/Current Account Savings Account (CASA) that are mostly used for transaction purposes. Otherwise, we would continue to be constrained by lack of transmission, it added.

494,2019-05-15,State Bank,"SBI is the only commercial bank which has been authorised by the Centre to issue electoral bonds ever since it was envisaged last yearNotably, the Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018, notified by the Centre in January last year, has been challenged in the Supreme Court

MUMBAI :
At an average of  ₹48 lakh per bond, the State Bank of India (SBI) has issued 10,494 electoral bonds in nine phases so far, worth over  ₹5,029 crore, an RTI response has revealed.
SBI is the only commercial bank which has been authorised by the Centre to issue electoral bonds ever since it was envisaged last year.
In a response to Mumbai-based RTI activist Manoranjan Roy's query on the total numbers of electoral bonds issued and the names of companies or individuals giving the donations, the bank said it has issued 10,494 bonds worth  ₹5,029 crore till phase nine which was completed on May 4.
Bank, however, did not disclose the names of companies or individuals giving donations to political parties citing it to be ""third party"" information which is exempted under under Section 8(1)(E)(i) of the RTI Act.
Replying to another query on how many of the electoral bonds issued have been submitted for withdrawal, it replied that (out of 10,494 issued) 10,388 bonds have been withdrawn/redeemed till the phase nine.
""The value of these redeemed bonds amounts to  ₹5,011 crore,"" CPIO and Deputy General Manager (TB Sales & SME) Naresh Kumar Raheja further stated.
Commenting on the reply, Roy said, ""Augmentation of electoral bonds are nothing but a legalised route to have an unholy nexus between political parties and corporate entities and it will lead to the highest level of corruption in the country.""
""It can be little less destructive if this is made transparent by revealing the names of bond-seekers,"" the RTI activist said.
Roy further suggested that corporate entities could spend this huge amount of money through their Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) schemes or individuals can benefit the needy and marginalized people in the society rather than donating to political parties ""who spend the amount to woo voters"".
Notably, the Electoral Bond Scheme, 2018, notified by the Centre in January last year, has been challenged in the Supreme Court.
Only those political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (43 of 1951) and which secured not less than one per cent of the votes polled in the last general election to the House of the People or the Legislative Assembly of the state, shall be eligible to receive the bonds.
The bonds may be purchased by a person who is a citizen of India ""or incorporated or established in India,"" the government had said in a statement last year. These remain valid for 15 days and can be encashed by an eligible political party only through a bank account with the authorized bank within that period only.
The Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), a voluntary group working in the field of electoral reforms, has demanded a stay on the sale of electoral bonds while the CPI(M) has challenged it before the Supreme Court in separate petitions."

492,2019-05-16,State Bank,"Jet lenders plan to reach out to unsolicited bidders after Etihad declined to raise its stake beyond 24%First in the line is Jason Unsworth, a former British airline service agent who assisted passengers at check-in desks, drop desks, and self-service kiosks

MUMBAI :
A former air passenger service agent, a professor, a former boss of a software company and a member of a supposedly influential political family have emerged as an unlikely set of suitors for Jet Airways (India) Ltd.
This comes after lenders to the cash-strapped carrier announced that they would soon engage with Jet’s unsolicited bidders to ascertain their seriousness and the viability of a rescue act for the carrier which has been grounded for almost a month.
Lenders to Jet Airways plan to reach out to unsolicited bidders after current shareholder Etihad Airways PJSC of Abu Dhabi declined to raise its stake beyond the current 24% and offered to infuse an additional  ₹1,400 crore, which is much lower than the liabilities of the Mumbai-based carrier.
First in the line is Jason Unsworth, a former British airline service agent who assisted passengers at check-in desks, drop desks, and self-service kiosks.
Unsworth has since founded Atmosphere Intercontinental, a yet-to-be-operational premium airline service, which, he claims, will connect parts of Asia.
He is confident that, given a chance, he can revive Jet Airways. “I have a network of the best and most experienced aviation consultants in the industry, as well as having over 10 years-experience working for numerous different airlines. (During) the last four years, I have been leading a startup team of airline professionals, (and) our airline is expected to launch later this winter,"" Unsworth said in an interview.
Mumbai-based Darwin Group, which is said to run businesses in information technology (IT), pharmaceuticals, power, and shipping, among other sectors, is another unsolicited bidder.
On Wednesday, representatives of the Darwin Group met officials of SBI Capital Markets, which is advising Jet Airways’ lenders, and offered to infuse  ₹14,000 crore into the carrier.
This equity infusion can almost erase the entire existing liability of Jet Airways.
However, not much is publicly available about the Darwin group and a study of the group’s recent financials does not reveal much either.
According to its latest available balance sheet, one of the group companies, Darwin Platform Holding Ltd, reported a meagre net profit of  ₹34,751 and net sales of  ₹17.08 lakh during financial year 2018.
The group’s chairman is Ajay Harinath Singh and its corporate website claims that Singh belongs to a “very influential"" political family from Sultanpur in Uttar Pradesh.
The third suitor in the fray is London-based investment firm Adi Partners LLP, which had placed an initial expression of interest for Jet Airways. The firm was founded in 2012 by Sanjay Viswanathan who, most recently, was the chief executive of Bangalore-based IT firm Sonata Software, which he quit to start Adi Partners.
Not much is publicly known about the transactions undertaken by Adi Partners in the past few years.
“We have strong long-term investors who are renowned for world class governance and impact,"" said Viswanathan. “We would love to back and support Etihad (Airways) in turning around Jet Airways.""
Viswanathan said Adi Partners has hired investment bank Rothschild & Co. for a potential transaction. “We have a strong platform of world class, long-term investors who view this as an infrastructure investment,"" he added.
The fourth unsolicited bidder is a consortium of minority investors led by a Florida-based college professor Sankaran Raghunathan.
Raghunathan, who claims to represent minority investors of Jet Airways, says that the group plans on raising a corpus of  ₹21,500 crore.
“A bridge fund of  ₹3,500 crore will be raised on back of commitments from Etihad Airways and NIIF (National Investment and Infrastructure Fund) for up to  ₹2,000 crore,"" said Raghunath.
“We have had talks with representatives of Etihad Airways, who want to retain 24% stake in the airline. We are also discussing the case with NIIF, who haven’t got back to us yet. If NIIF partners us, it can invest up to 10%, though the maximum investment its corpus allows is about 20%,"" he added.
It could not be immediately ascertained whether Etihad and NIIF—India’s quasi-sovereign wealth fund—have responded favourably."

The asset reconstruction company (ARC) is also in discussions to buy out the loans of Punjab National Bank, Corporation Bank, and IDBI in Indian Steel Corp., which had been incorporated in 2002 by the Ruchi Group of Industries and Mitsui and Co.
“A JV between Piramal Enterprises Ltd and Bain Capital Credit, confirms acquisition of all of State Bank of India’s debt exposure in Indian Steel Corp.

Indian Steel Corp. manufactures cold rolled coils and sheets, besides galvanized plain, galvanized corrugated, and colour-coated galvanized sheets.
The company has a manufacturing facility at Bhimasar, near the Kandla port in Gujarat.
India Steel Corp. had reported net losses of  ₹84 crore in FY18 on an operating income of  ₹1,245 crore, compared to net losses of  ₹198 crore and operating income of  ₹1,533 crore in FY17, according to the most recent credit rating report by Icra, dated August 2018.
Icra had rated the company’s loan instruments D, or default, for more than three years.
India Resurgence Fund was launched in 2016 to invest in special situations and distressed assets across sectors, barring real estate.
The fund looks “to invest in businesses that require balance sheet restructuring with a focus on debt restructuring"" and fund companies with “strong growth prospects linked to India’s infrastructure and consumption needs"", according to its website.
Last November, the fund had invested $156 million via debt and equity instruments, in the marine chemicals business of the Chennai-based Archean Group.

490,2019-05-17,State Bank,"The government is allocating Jet’s flying rights on a temporary basis till the company resumes operationsJet disappearing from the market, has affected the industry’s capacity and has raised airfares

NEW DELHI :
Airlines have staked claim for distressed Jet Airways (India) Ltd’s foreign flying rights, which will be alloted in an open and transparent manner, civil aviation secretary P.S. Kharola said on Friday.
The government is allocating Jet’s flying rights on a temporary basis till the company resumes operations.
With no funds to meet expenses, Jet Airways had suspended operations a month ago and there is no sign of a credible revival scheme in sight for the airline. With the airline losing leased planes for defaulting on dues, airport slots have been reassigned to other carriers and employees have quit.
Lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI) face the risk of having to write off their dues. “We had asked airlines to confirm their requirement of (domestic) slots and (international) traffic rights...Their requests have been officially logged in. Our people will do an analysis now and we will evolve a transparent procedure based on which the rights will be given,"" Kharola said.
He was speaking to reporters after a meeting with senior executives of the airlines, primarily on assigning Jet’s foreign flying rights. IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet, GoAir and Vistara are likely to benefit from the move. Some of Jet’s domestic slots have already been assigned to other carriers. The civil aviation ministry is trying to minimize the impact of Jet’s suspension of operations on passengers.
Jet disappearing from the market, has affected the industry’s capacity and has raised airfares.
“With majority of Jet Airways slots still unused, domestic airfares remain high, showing an average increase of 15% across key sectors. International airfare for long-haul flights in May and June have also increased by 30-35% year on year,"" said Rajnish Kumar, co-founder of travel booking portal Ixigo.
The decrease in available seats for sale and the surge in ticket prices have brought the air travel market growth to a halt in March. Airlines carried close to 1.16 million passengers in March, a paltry growth of 0.14% from a year earlier. This is a sharp slowdown from the 18.6% growth in air traffic reported in 2018 from the previous year. Analysts said traffic growth will further moderate during the current year.
“With Jet Airways’ entire fleet grounded post 17 April, it would take considerable time for domestic airlines to make up for the extinguished seat inventory,"" Care Ratings Ltd said in a note on the aviation industry on Tuesday.

""Various options are being evaluated. Legal opinion is being taken. There are many investors who are showing interest. We have to see whether they have the money and the wherewithal. I think the clarity should emerge in a week's time,"" the SBI top boss told IANS on Saturday.
Asked if there are investors other than those who have submitted unsolicited offers, Kumar said that there are some but their seriousness will have to be checked.
Lenders of Jet Airways, led by the SBI, are currently in the process of selling the airline to recover their dues of over  ₹8,400 crore. Private equity firm TPG Capital, Indigo Partners, National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) and Etihad Airways were shortlisted to submit their bids after they put forward their Expression of Interest (EoI).
But on May 10, the last date for submitting the binding bids, only Etihad gave its offer and that too in the eleventh hour. The other two bids received for the airline were unsolicited. Subsequently, the lenders are learnt to have got an offer from a Mumbai-based business group.
While the lenders are vetting various proposals, most of the top Jet executives, including its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Company Secretary, have resigned from their respective positions citing personal reasons. Close on the heels of the resignation of the airline's whole-time director Gaurang Shetty, Etihad nominee on the board Robin Kamark stepped down on May 16.
Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways, which holds 24% stake in the crisis-hit Jet Airways, is currently the only solicited bidder for a stake in the airline. But experts have found its bid unattractive for the lenders given the multiple riders attached to it.
Besides offering to invest just  ₹1,700 crore against the requirement of  ₹15,000 crore to revive the crisis-hit airline, Etihad has in its proposal put the onus of finding a majority buyer on the lenders. The Gulf carrier also wants exemption from making an open offer in case its stake goes beyond 26%.

488,2019-05-19,State Bank,"The investment banking arm of Deloitte India will invite  EoIs for the exploration and production assets of VOVLThe consortium led by SBI Capital Markets includes 17 banks

MUMBAI :
Lenders to Videocon group’s energy business have hired Deloitte India to find a buyer for its assets in Brazil, Indonesia and East Timor, two persons aware of the development said.
The investment banking arm of Deloitte India will invite expressions of interest (EoIs) for the exploration and production assets of Videocon Oil Ventures Ltd (VOVL), the persons mentioned above said on condition of anonymity.
“The lenders have appointed Deloitte India as the merchant bank for monetizing these assets. They will start the process shortly,"" said a banker, one of the two persons mentioned above. The sale process is expected to be complete in a year, the person said.
The consortium led by SBI Capital Markets includes 17 banks such as Bank of India, Export-Import (Exim) Bank of India, Central Bank of India, IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank, and Union Bank of India. VOVL owes banks $4.5 billion.
“We are looking at both domestic and international oil companies to bid and we are hopeful they will see value in these assets. If that happens, our target is to realise at least 50% of the loan amount,"" said the second banker mentioned above.
VOVL, which is engaged in oil and gas extraction through international subsidiaries, holds shares in Videocon Hydrocarbon Holdings Ltd, a Cayman Islands company formed in 2009 for Videocon’s global oil and gas assets.
SBI Capital Markets did not reply to an email sent on 16 May. Deloitte India declined to comment.
The lenders had given credit facilities to VOVL and IBV Brasil Petroleo Ltd, an equal joint venture with Bharat PetroResource Ltd. Videocon’s Brazil block has turned a non-performing asset (NPA). So far, the Videocon Group has invested around $2 billion in these fields, along with its consortium partners.
The company has interests in four major blocks in Brazil through IBV Brasil Petroleo Ltd. Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras SA, is the operator in three of the four blocks.
The Videocon Group and its consortium partners—IBV Brasil Petroleo Ltd and Bharat PetroResource Ltd—had plans to begin production from its fields in Brazil and Indonesia by 2019, which was postponed to 2021. The company’s share in the oil reserves in Brazil was expected to be one million barrels.
Videocon had acquired 12.5% in the Nunukan Production Sharing Contract on 7 September 2009 from Anadarko Indonesia. The Nunukan Block is located offshore eastern Kalimantan and is the site of the Badik oil and gas discovery. The other partners in the block include Pertamina and Medco from Indonesia, and Bharat Petroleum arm Bharat PetroResources Ltd.
It could be a good time for sellers to find buyers as asset valuations would be good with oil prices expected to go up in the near future, said an analyst.
Videocon ventured into the exploration and production segment in 1994 when the company signed a production-sharing contract for the Ravva oil and gas offshore block, off Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh where it is a 25% non-operating partner with Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Vedanta Resources Plc’s Cairn India Ltd as other partners in the block."

486,2019-05-20,State Bank,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India."

The country's largest lender SBI will conduct a customer outreach programme next week to address their queries and seek suggestions to improve services.
The 'Mega Customer Meet', to be held on Tuesday, is expected to engage with 1 lakh bank customers across 500 locations through 17 local head offices across the country.
SBI customers of Delhi, NCR and Uttarakhand can attend this programme in 41 locations, the bank said.
Under this initiative, customers can interact with the bank staff to discuss their concerns and share feedbacks and suggestions on the bank's products and services, it said in a release.
SBI Managing Director for Retail and Digital Banking P K Gupta said this is part of the bank's regular interaction with the customers.
""We try to do it generally about once in a year on a larger scale and organise it at all our major centres across the country. We have asked our customers to share their views, expectations and feedback how we can improve our services,"" Gupta told PTI.
He also said at times, the concerns of the customers do not get fully resolved at the branches and programmes like these give better opportunity to listen to them and find out solutions.
SBI said the employees of the bank will also inform and educate customers about the features and convenience of using its one-stop platform for digital banking and lifestyle shopping app -- YONO SBI.

A home loan is probably the biggest loan that most people ever take. Not only in terms of the loan amount, but also tenures, which can easily be of 15 years or more. And the total final amount that one ends up paying by the time the loan ends, can be double of what was borrowed. But, a home loan is among the cheapest loans available, and most often, it is the only way a person can buy a house. A home loan is called a ‘good’ loan because it helps you acquire a tangible asset that appreciates over the long term.
A point that many to-be borrowers ask is should I rent or should I buy, especially when the amount being paid as rent seems heavy. One of the factors to consider here is whether you want to live in that house or it’s for investment. It makes sense to buy a house if you plan to live in it. This is also the reason, apart from the fact that many housing projects in India continue to be delayed by many years, why financial advisers say that one should buy a ready-to-move-in house.
If you are looking at it as an investment, then one must look at the compounded annual returns the asset can give, and the risk involved, just as you would with any other asset class. Read more here.
But if the reason is to live in the house, then any time is a good time to buy. Here’s a look at the latest home loan interest rates."

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has revised interest rates on its fixed deposits (FDs) for second time this year. SBI tweaked interest rate on some select maturities, with effect from 9 May 2019. On deposits which are 1 year to less than 2 year, the rate of interest has been increased from 6.8% to 7% according to the SBI website. But across many other maturities SBI has lowered interest rates. 
On FDs which are 2 years to less than 3 years, SBI has cut interest rate from 6.8 % to 6.75%. On deposits, which are 3 years to less than 5 years, the rate of interest has been decreased marginally from 6.8% to 6.70%. And on deposits which are 5 years and up to 10 years, the rate of interest has been decreased from 6.85% to 6.60%.
The rate of interest for FDs ranging between seven days and up to 1 year has remained unchanged. SBI pays interest rates to the tune of 5.75-7% to the general public for FDs over a maturity period of seven days to 10 years. 
Senior citizens will continue to get an additional rate of interest of 0.5 per cent on their deposits.
SBI is India's largest commercial bank in terms of assets, deposits, branches, customers and employees.
Earlier this month, SBI reduced its marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points across all tenors, bringing down the home loan interest rate for its borrowers. 
Starting from May 1, SBI moved to a new interest rate regime on large savings account deposits as well as short-term loans. SBI linked its interest rate on savings account with balance above  ₹1 lakh and short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility to RBI's repo rate, which means that interest rates on large SBI savings account deposits and on some short-term loans will automatically change when RBI changes its repo rate.
Currently, RBI repo rate stands at 6% after two back-to-back cuts in April and February. All SBI cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh are linked to the RBI's benchmark policy rate, plus a spread of 2.25%—amounting to 8.25%.
SBI has fixed its savings account rate on deposits over 1 lakh at 2.75% below RBI’s repo rate."
480,2019-05-28,State Bank,"Hunt on for a local investor who can partner Etihad and NIIF for a stakeAny new investor is expected to seek anywhere between 80% and 90% haircut from the banks

MUMBAI :
Lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd are expected to take a final decision on the fate of the grounded airline in the next two weeks as they hunt for a new domestic investor, before taking up the last option of a bankruptcy filing.
With Etihad Airways willing to invest just enough to maintain its shareholding of 24% and the National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) ready to commit only if a new investor enters, the lenders have initiated the search for a third investor, two people familiar with the matter said.
According to the people cited above, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, lenders are yet to receive a formal offer from the Hinduja Group, which had recently expressed interest in investing in the airline. The London-based group has not yet approached lenders led by State Bank of India (SBI), these people said, adding that there is a possibility of the group making an offer in the coming days.
“Lenders have, meanwhile, agreed to take a significant haircut if the situation so warrants in the coming days. Any new investor is expected to seek anywhere between 80% to 90% haircut from the banks,"" the first of the two people cited above said.
On 21 May, the Hinduja Group had said that it was considering a bid for Jet Airways, which has been grounded for more than a month. While there have been reports which said that the group had begun discussions with Jet’s existing investor, Etihad, for a joint bid, it is yet to make a formal offer or start the due diligence process as per usual practice.
If all else fails, a final solution could include referring Jet Airways to the National Company Law Tribunal for bankruptcy proceedings. However, under the bankruptcy resolution process, lenders may recover only a fraction of the  ₹8,400 crore the airline owes them.
Currently, founder Naresh Goyal holds close to 51% in Jet Airways, while the rest is held by public shareholders, including Etihad. Once banks convert the airline’s debt into equity, Goyal’s stake will reduce from 51% to around 25%, while that of Etihad will fall to 12% from 24%.
“In the new scheme of things, envisaged with the participation of new investors, Goyal’s stake will finally fall to less than 10% which will reduce him to an ordinary shareholder,"" said the second person cited above.
Under foreign direct investment regulations, a foreign airline can hold a maximum stake of 49% in an Indian airline, with majority control resting with an Indian partner.
While Etihad has evinced interest in rescuing Jet Airways, it has refused to increase its stake from the current levels after banks convert debt to equity at  ₹1 per share. “However, the banks do not want to end up as the controlling shareholder,"" said the second person cited above. “They (lenders) will be comfortable with a stake of around 30-35% depending on the final equity infusion by other partners. Meanwhile, NIIF, which, too, has shown interest in investing in Jet, has indicated that it will not be willing to own more than 20% in a revived Jet Airways, with the overall value of its investment not exceeding  ₹1,400 crore.""
NIIF’s investment, however, is subject to lenders finding a third partner. Etihad, similarly, has said that it cannot be expected to be the sole investor, and that, among other requirements, additional suitable investors would need to provide the majority of Jet Airways’ required recapitalization.
Mint reported on 16 April that Etihad, NIIF and private equity firms TPG Capital and Indigo Partners had been shortlisted to place binding bids for Jet Airways.
Separately, a group of minority shareholders and frequent flyers of Jet Airways had reached out to SBI Capital Markets Ltd, which is running the bidding process, on 25 April to present a proposal to lenders for reviving the airline.
According to the bidding eligibility conditions, strategic bidders looking to invest in Jet Airways should have a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore or at least three years of experience in the aviation sector.
For financial investors, the qualifying conditions are minimum assets under management of  ₹2,000 crore or at least  ₹1,000 crore in committed funds for investment in Indian firms or assets."

MUMBAI :
The State Bank of India (SBI) is preparing to raise  ₹15,000 crore to  ₹18,000 crore through what is expected to be India’s largest qualified institutional placement (QIP) in the next few weeks, said three people aware of the development.
In January, SBI’s board of directors approved a plan to raise up to  ₹20,000 crore through various equity and equity-linked instruments, including a QIP.
The state-owned lender, the country’s largest, could launch the deal as early as the next fortnight, according to one of the persons mentioned above.
“SBI was waiting for the elections to get over as political uncertainty is an issue with many investors. The stock has done well since the mandate of the election was announced. They have been talking with investors and they want to launch the transaction soon,"" said this person.
SBI’s stock has seen its value increase by 20.4% since the start of the year. After the results of the general elections were announced on 23 May, it has moved up by more than 5%, data from stock exchanges show.
On Tuesday, the lender’s shares closed the day at  ₹360.40 apiece, down by 0.29% on the BSE, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 39,749.73 points, up 0.17%.
An email sent to SBI enquiring about its QIP plans went unanswered.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Capital Markets have been advising the bank on this fundraise, Bloomberg reported in January. HSBC declined to comment, while emails sent to the other advisors did not elicit a response.
The latest QIP from the lender is expected to be slightly larger than its previous fundraise in 2017 from the public markets when it raised  ₹15,000 crore through the largest QIP witnessed in the country.
A large chunk of that QIP was snapped up by the Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), which accounted for more than 35% of the shares offered in the QIP, while another investor, EuroPacific Growth Fund, subscribed to a little over 10% of the shares on offer, data from stock exchange filings show.
Earlier this month, the bank reported a profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the fourth quarter, missing analysts’ estimates after making hefty provisions to pare bad debt. In the corresponding quarter of the previous year, it posted a loss of  ₹7,718.17 crore.
However, the bank’s asset quality improved during the quarter with new bad loans falling sharply.
The bank classified its exposure of  ₹1,125 crore out of  ₹3,487 crore toward Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) as a non-performing asset (NPA) in this quarter. As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 7.53%, compared with 8.71% in the previous three months, and 10.91% in the year-ago quarter.
Net NPAs were at 3.01% in the March quarter against 3.95% in the previous quarter, and 5.73% in the corresponding quarter of last year.
So far this year, three companies have raised a total of  ₹4,382.4 crore through QIPs, while in 2018, 25 companies raised  ₹16,587 crore through the route, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
A QIP is a capital-raising tool through which publicly traded firms can sell securities such as shares and convertible debentures to institutional buyers."

The growth could come at 5.9-6.1% for the January-March period, getting the full-year growth to 6.9%, an estimate by the economic researchers at the country's largest lender, SBI, ahead of the announcement of official data on Thursday, said.
""We expect GDP growth for Q4FY19 at 6.1%. GVA (gross value added) growth could be at 6 per cent or slip marginally below 6 per cent at 5.9%. FY19 GDP growth will be at 6.9%,"" it said.
However, it added that the current slowdown can be ""transitory"" if proper policies are adopted in the interim.
Calling out the high real interest rates -- the differential between the policy rate and headline inflation -- as an impediment to investment, it said the RBI can cut rates by 0.35-0.5% at its next policy announcement.
RBI's larger rate cut can be effective only if transmission of the rates happens quickly, it said, suggesting a few factors that the central bank needs to keep in mind while delivering a rate cut.
Pointing out to the cumulative rate cuts of 0.5% by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) since February, the note said the median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate by banks has moved down by only 0.07%.
The first will be to ensure adoption of external benchmark rate which moves in with the RBI's repo rate.
""Ensure that asset and liability side of the banks move in tandem and ensure repo rate is directly benchmarked to external benchmark/non-volatile bank liabilities/CASA that are mostly used for transaction purposes,"" it said.
Otherwise, it would continue to be constrained by lack of transmission, even as the RBI will continue to cut rates, it said.
The RBI, which will be undertaking its second monetary policy review on June 6, also has to ensure that liquidity is ""plentiful"" in the system, amid muted government spending and currency leakage due to elections.
It can also use the ""potent"" weapon of cutting the cash reserve ratio (CRR) or merge CRR in liquidity coverage ratio estimation, the note said, calling this as a ""less likely"" measure.
One percentage point cut in the CRR can release  ₹1.28 lakh crore, reduce lending rates by 0.15 per cent and improve banks' profitability by  ₹12,000 crore annually.
Analysts at private sector lender ICICI Bank pointed out that slowdown in growth is a key factor which the new government will have to grapple with and also hinted at help needed from the RBI to tackle the same.
""We expect growth rates to stay weak but a combination of strong government policy support and benign monetary policy environment should lead to recovery in growth prospects towards the second half of this fiscal year (FY20),"" it said.
It can be noted that inflation has been inching up lately and even the RBI, which is mandated to keep the price rise at four per cent in the medium term, has also estimated the same to rise.
Economists at domestic rating agency Care Ratings estimated headline inflation to rise to 4 per cent in 2019-20 as against 3.4% in 2018-19.
GDP growth will inch up to 7.2% in FY20 from the 7% it expects in FY19.
The new government will have to balance policy imperatives to ensure that growth receives a boost in the short term and also continue with more long term reform activity, ICICI Bank report said.
""We believe, post elections, capital flows will pick up materially and thus RBI will be able to recoup dollars and add to foreign exchange reserves and thus attendant domestic liquidity. In fact, since the exit polls and subsequent results, there has been inflow into the market of around  ₹4,000 crore,"" it said.
Commenting on its fourth quarter estimate of a slip in GDP growth to just above 6%, the SBI note said both the investment demand and consumption demand is showing signs of moderation as revealed by various leading indicators.
Performance of the fast-moving consumer goods sector is also ""lacklustre"" with a deceleration in demand for staples such as biscuits and soaps, it said.

478,2019-05-29,State Bank,"The lenders were in talks to buy out a $30 million US Exim Bank loan for which six aircraft were given as collateralJet Airways has not flown since 18 April due to funding woes

MUMBAI :
A plan by domestic lenders to take control of six aircraft owned by Jet Airways (India) Ltd has run into rough weather after a Dutch court ordered bankruptcy proceedings against the grounded airline last week, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
The lenders to Jet Airways, led by State Bank of India (SBI), were in talks to buy out a $30 million loan taken from US Exim Bank for which the six Boeing aircraft were given as collateral, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
“The lenders expected to recover at least $200 million of Jet’s unpaid loans by acquiring the aircraft, each roughly valued between $40 million and $60 million and selling them to a third party if Jet fails to revive,"" said one of the two people cited earlier.
However, in April, cargo handler Worldwide Flight Services approached a court in the Netherlands to seize a Boeing 777 aircraft belonging to Jet Airways hangared at Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, Jet’s hub for its European operations. Following this, the Dutch court has asked local authorities to seize the aircraft.
Jet Airways has not flown since 18 April due to funding woes. Its international operations were reduced significantly before the airline was eventually grounded.
“The Dutch court ruling has made the refinancing deal of the aircraft problematic since the overall recovery will be much less with a plane missing from the original count of six,"" said the first person cited earlier.
In 2005, Jet Airways had placed an order for 10 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft that was funded by US Exim Bank. The current list price of a new Boeing 777-300ER is about $375 million.
Queries sent to US Exim Bank, SBI and Jet remained unanswered till press time.
On 27 May, Mint reported that lenders to Jet Airways were expected to take a final decision on the fate of the grounded airline in the next two weeks as they hunt for a new domestic investor, before taking up the last option of a bankruptcy filing.
The report said that while Etihad Airways PJSC was willing to invest just enough to maintain its shareholding of 24% and the National Infrastructure Investment Fund ready to commit only if a new investor entered, the lenders had initiated the search for a third investor to restart Jet Airways’ operations.
If all else fails, Jet may be referred to the National Company Law Tribunal. However, under bankruptcy resolution, lenders may recover only a fraction of the  ₹8,400 crore the airline owes them."
477,2019-05-29,State Bank,"The use of technology in delivering banking services has become more broad-based, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar saidSBI posted a profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the fourth quarter of FY19

Mumbai: This financial year, FY20, will be a turning point for State Bank of India (SBI) as the bank will direct its efforts to achieve a more sustainable mix of business, domestically and in overseas operations, chairman Rajnish Kumar wrote to shareholders in SBI’s FY19 annual report.
“Taking cues from the last year, the bank has set the goal to achieve a healthy credit growth of 10-12% in FY20. To an extent the credit revival and recoveries in FY19 have already set the tone and the bank is confident of achieving the target set for FY20,"" said Rajnish.
He added that it was envisaged last year that growth in business will be achieved by portfolio re-ordering to reduce the credit risk-weighted assets (RWA) to total advances ratio and internal reorganisation of the corporate banking. “My message this year highlights the progress in the revival strategy,"" he said.
According to Kumar, a sustainable recovery is not just a mechanical arithmetic but it also requires deep structural transformation and strategic shifts in portfolio. Such an exercise, he said, should ultimately improve the return on asset (RoA), minimise asset liability mismatches and reduce the payback period of our investments.
“Accordingly, our transformation strategy going forward will continue to focus predominantly on five areas: customer service, corporate credit revamp, digitisation of banking operations, synergy between subsidiaries and development of our human resource,"" said Kumar.
The use of technology in delivering banking services has become more broad-based, he said. “The bank is already in leadership position in digital channels, ATMs and mobile banking. Asset and liability side product offerings through the YONO platform will be scaled up. Encouraged by successful implementation of e-DFS, our dealer finance scheme, we shall try more technology enabled products for our esteemed corporate clients,"" he added.
Kumar said that since the bank already has a large customer base in every business segment and therefore the benefits of retaining the existing customer base far outweigh the cost of acquiring new.
“Accordingly, in the coming year the bank will roll out revised customer satisfaction measures to gauge customer satisfaction. Our unique training programme - ‘Nayi Disha- Phase 2’, will be focusing on a customer-centric approach for employees, thus linking our human resource training with customer service,"" he said.
Moreover, since the corporate credit area of the bank attracted considerable attention in the last two years, the bank has started revamping of corporate credit structure and system within the bank on lines that will widen the universe of clients and focus on new segments.
“Strengthening of credit processes and increased product penetration across high priority relationships has been and will be our guiding principle going forward,"" said Kumar, adding that deficiencies in human resource, if any, will be mitigated and human resources will be strengthened by on-boarding sector specialists.
SBI posted a profit of  ₹838.40 crore for the fourth quarter of FY19, missing analysts’ estimates after making hefty provisions to pare bad debt. In the corresponding quarter last year, the bank had posted losses of  ₹7,718.17 crore."
476,2019-05-29,State Bank,"RBI has changed the rules for RTGS transfers The new rules will be applicable from 1 June

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has announced that the time window for Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system will be extended by one-and-a-half hour for bank customers. Under RTGS, there is a continuous and real-time settlement of fund transfers, individually on a transaction by transaction basis (without netting).
1) Previously the timing for any RTGS transaction was till 4:30 pm. Now it has been extended to 6 pm. The final cut-off for inter-bank transactions will be 7:45 pm.
2) The new RTGS timings will be applicable from 1 June.
3) The time-varying charges for transactions in RTGS from 1 pm to 6 pm shall be  ₹5 per outward transaction.
4) Transactions from 8 am to 11 am will have no charges. From 11 am to 1 pm the charges will be  ₹2 while after 6 pm the transaction charges will be  ₹10.
5) The RTGS system is primarily meant for high-value transactions. The minimum amount to be remitted through RTGS is  ₹2 lakh with no maximum limit.
Apart from RTGS, National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is another popular form of fund transfer. There is no limit for the minimum/maximum for fund transfer. NEFT operates in hourly batches.
While the timings may vary slightly from bank to bank, NEFT transactions are less restrictive when it comes to timing. RTGS transactions, on the other hand, happen in real time. Here the beneficiary bank receives the instruction to transfer funds immediately when you carry out the transaction, and the transfer is instantaneous.
At present, the largest lending bank of the country, State Bank of India (SBI) provides 12 settlements from 8 am to 7 pm on weekdays and five settlements from 8 am to 1 pm on Saturdays."

472,2019-05-30,State Bank,"The firm plans to incur capital expenditure of  ₹15,000 crore in FY20, less than  ₹21,800 crore it spent last year﻿The company reported a 52% jump in profit and revenue gained 18% for the March quarter

Steady financial performance notwithstanding, shares of Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd trailed behind broader markets by a big margin. The stock lost about 9% in the past year in contrast to the 5% rise in the Nifty 500 index.
The company reported a 52% jump in profit and revenue gained 18% for the March quarter. But the stock was little changed on Thursday as investors seem to take no cheer from this.
That is because the performance is partly supported by prior period income. Weighing on the Power Grid stock is weakening growth outlook. Project starts or capitalization during the year dropped 29% at the stand-alone level, showed data compiled by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
Capitalization is down 17% during the March quarter and a slowing capitalization doesn’t augur well for growth momentum.
The company expects to capitalize projects worth  ₹20,000-24,000 crore in FY20, more than the  ₹19,200 crore worth of projects it capitalized in the year gone by. But outlook beyond the current year is not benign. Power Grid plans to incur capital expenditure, a lead indicator for project additions, of  ₹15,000 crore in FY20 less than  ₹21,800 crore it spent last year. This indicates a noticeable slowdown in project additions in FY21.
The reduced intensity in capital expenditure is driving Power Grid to give more cash to shareholders. Dividend payment in FY19 was 58% higher than FY18 and hence dividend yield now stands at 4.5%.
In a conference call with analysts, the company said it does not plan to add more cash to its books and would rather pare debt or give dividends. “Clearly, the reduction in capex outlay has resulted in increased dividend payout,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note. “Though the near-term slowdown in capex/capitalization will lower profit growth, valuation/yield remain attractive.""
But the Power Grid stock is cutting no ice with investors even though valuations at 1.5 times estimated book value of FY20 are not expensive. That said, for growth-focused investors all is not over. The current work in hand (projects worth  ₹61,000 crore) should hold Power Grid in good stead for at least two years.
Further, the country continues to see sizeable investments in the transmission sector. Renewable energy projects are seen as a major opportunity and Power Grid aims to capture a chunk of the estimated  ₹19,000 crore worth of project awards for the sector. These projects are expected to be awarded over the next three-six months.
“Projects in hand impart healthy two years’ earnings visibility, though new project awards will be a key variable,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note. Perhaps a healthy order win could fire up the Power Grid stock in the coming months."
474,2019-05-30,State Bank,"India’s shadow lenders have been under pressure since last yearPrivately-owned banks are also showing greater caution, providing another opportunity for SBI, chairman Rajnish Kumar said

Mumbai: India’s largest lender is hoping to capitalize on the country’s shadow banking crisis by building its mortgage and small business loan book as the non-banks are forced to pull back.
State Bank of India, which is slowly emerging from a period of massive provisioning on loans to large corporates like Essar Steel India Ltd., sees opportunities in taking business from the shadow banks without creating new asset quality problems, according to Chairman Rajnish Kumar.
“We are not shying away from any business but that does not in any manner mean that we are going to dilute our underwriting standard,"" Kumar said in an interview. 'And I believe there is sufficient business that meets our underwriting standards.'
India’s shadow lenders have been under pressure since last year, when a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services forced the government to intervene and exposed weaknesses in the sector. The crisis has forced non-banking financial companies to sell assets and restrict new loans, giving state-owned lenders an opportunity to claw back market share they have lost over the past decade.
Kumar said SBI’s strong capital gives it the leeway to seek more mortgages and small business loans, which had been a focus for the NBFCs before the crisis erupted. That should help the bank attain its target of 11% loan growth for the year to March 2020, Kumar said, slightly lower than the 12% growth of the previous fiscal year.
Privately-owned banks are also showing greater caution, providing another opportunity for SBI, Kumar said. “In a situation where many private sector banks have become very, very cautious, it has opened up lot of headroom available for corporate credit growth for the bank,"" he said.
Home loans and other consumer lending accounted for 6.48 trillion rupees ($93 billion), or 32.5%, of SBI’s total domestic lending as of March 31. Advances to companies in India accounted for another 43% of the book, while SME lending was 14.5%.
Government Measures
Despite seeing opportunities in the problems faced by shadow lenders, Kumar said the government needs to take steps -- such as providing partial credit guarantees to the NBFCs -- to prevent wider damage to the economy. The loans provided by India’s shadow banks can’t fully be substituted by the regular banks, he said.
SBI had outstanding loans to NBFCs of 1.87 trillion rupees at the end of March, the majority of which were backed or owned by the central and state governments or by large private sector institutions.
“We recognize that NBFCs were a good conduit for credit growth, and incremental lending has slowed down,"" Kumar said. The banks are unlikely to resume lending to weak NBFCs unless the government provides backstop measures such as partial guarantees, he said.
If SBI or other banks are required to provide such loans “then probably lenders will be looking for some comfort from the government,"" Kumar said.

Mumbai: Jet Airways (India) Ltd., on Thursday, said that the airline is not in position to consider and approve the audited financial result for the financial year that ended on 31 March, the company said in a stock exchange notification.
""This is to inform that, in view of the ongoing bidding process undertaken by the domestic lenders for change in management of the company, coupled with resignation by members of the board of directors, its key managerial personnel and other employees across functions, the company is not in position to consider and approve the audited financial result for the year ended 31 March 2019,"" the airline said.
Jet Airways, which has not flown since 18 April due to funding woes, has seen the exit of its top executives from its management and board of directors, in the past few months, following the exit of founder Naresh Goyal from the chairman's position in the company in March.
During May the airline saw high profile exits that include Robin Kamark, Etihad Airways PJSC’s nominee director to the board of Jet Airways, chief executive officer Vinay Dube, chief financial officer Amit Agarwal and whole-time director Gaurang Shetty.
Lenders to Jet Airways, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), are seeking investors to recover their dues. The airline’s total liability, including unpaid salaries and vendor dues, is nearly  ₹15,000 crore. If all else fails, Jet may be referred to the National Company Law Tribunal.

471,2019-06-03,State Bank,"SBI has lowered the rate of interest on medium-term and long term recurring depositsSBI recurring deposit (RD) interest rates vary between 6.4%-7% for general public

The country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has revised interest rates on its recurring deposits (RDs) with effect from 9 May 2019, according to the bank’s website. SBI RD interest rates vary between 6.4%-7% for general public and an additional interest rate hike of 0.50 percentage points for senior citizens. SBI recurring deposits has terms ranging from 12 months to 120 months. The rate of interest on SBI’s 1-year recurring deposit remain unchanged at 6.4% for general public and 6.9% for senior citizens.
For the term period of 1-2 years, the interest rate is 7% for general citizens and 7.5% for senior citizens. Earlier, the bank was offering 6.8% and 7.3% interest rates for general public and senior citizens, respectively.
SBI has lowered the rate of interest on medium-term and long term recurring deposits.
For medium-term tenure (3-5 years), SBI has lowered the rate of interest marginally. The rate of interest offered by SBI is 6.75% for general citizens and 7.25% for senior citizens. Earlier, it was 6.8% for general public and 7.30% for senior citizens.
For long-term investments (5-10 years), the rate of interest is 6.6% for others and 7.1% for senior citizens. Earlier, the bank was offering 6.85% and 7.35% interest rates, respectively, to general public and senior citizens.
SBI RD account can be started with a minimum monthly deposit of  ₹100 and in multiples of  ₹10. However, there is no maximum limit. Generally, banks offer higher rates when the RD tenure is above 15 months. Recurring deposit interest rates, once determined, do not change during the tenure of the deposit.
SBI has cut its marginal cost-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points on loans of all tenors. The lender has also revised interest rates on its fixed deposits below  ₹2 crore, according to the bank's website. The new FD rates came into effect from 9 May 2019."
470,2019-06-03,State Bank,"Half of the experts surveyed say that RBI will stick to its neutral stanceRBI cut its repo rate by 25bps each in the last two bimonthly policies of February and April

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) monetary policy committee (MPC) will cut the key policy rate by 25 basis points (bps) as inflation cooled and economic growth slowed to a five-year low, according to economists and bankers surveyed by Mint.
Seven of the 10 economists and bankers polled expect the RBI to cut the repo rate by 25bps, one expects a rate cut of more than 25bps and the rest say RBI will pause this time.
Half of the participants surveyed said that the central bank will stick to its neutral stance in the upcoming policy. One of them said he expects RBI to either change it to accommodative or do away with the practice of declaring a stance.
If there is a rate cut this time, the stance should move to accommodative since a neutral stance is not in line with three consecutive rate cuts, said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank of India (SBI).
However, Ghosh said RBI might as well do away with the practice of spelling out a stance. “I am not sure if the stance will be retained in the policy because it is creating a lot of problems for markets to decipher. Instead, I think, that the language might be tweaked to a more dovish one but the stance segment might not be retained,"" said Ghosh.
RBI cut its repo rate by 25bps each in the last two bimonthly policies of February and April. In the last monetary policy on 4 April, RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said that with several uncertainties facing the economy, it is appropriate to maintain the neutral stance of monetary policy. “With the inflation outlook looking benign and headline inflation expected to remain below target in the current year, it becomes necessary to address the challenges to the sustained growth of the Indian economy,"" Das had said.
Participants also said that the slowdown in the economy and in consumption should prod RBI to lower rates in June.
Ashutosh Khajuria, chief financial officer at Federal Bank, said, “The economy is slowing down, consumption growth is falling and a rate cut could boost growth and make loans cheaper.""
Khajuria, who headed the bank’s treasury team for many years, added that the central bank’s stance will continue to be neutral as there are inflation risks from a possible monsoon deficit and from uncertainty in crude oil prices as well.
Gross domestic product (GDP) data, released by the government on 31 May, showed growth in the fiscal fourth quarter of FY19 slowing to 5.8%. The National Statistical Office (NSO) also slashed full-year economic growth for 2018-19 to 6.8% from the 7% estimated earlier.
Meanwhile, Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) said in a report that it is confident that the RBI MPC will cut rates by 25bps on 6 June, with April inflation, at 2.9%, well within its 2-6% mandate. “If rains are normal, the RBI MPC should cut in August too,"" the report said, adding that it expects the RBI to continue to inject $2-3 billion a month and the money market should slip to surplus repo mode in end-May as cash demand abates after the elections and summer rabi harvest.
Some also believe that global factors like the declining trend in US interest rates could weigh in on the policy decision of the MPC, coupled with a benign inflation print. “More than local, there would be weighing in of the global factors. US interest rates are collapsing and that I think will be a big plus. Secondly, inflation is behaving well below 4% and therefore providing room for a rate cut,"" said Harihar Krishnamoorthy, head of treasury operations at FirstRand Bank.
On the problems emanating from the liquidity crunch, Krishnamoorthy said, liquidity was strained for the last few months but after the elections results the government spending seems to have resumed and the market overnight liquidity has gone back to flat from the deficit mode.
“Separately, the RBI has announced the first OMO of  ₹15,000 crore after quite some time. So that has put in hopes in the market that they would address the liquidity problem. Earlier, the central bank was talking only of forex swaps and now the market feels that OMOs will make a comeback like last year,"" added Krishnamoorthy.
However, others also believe that the central bank will factor in the inadequate transmission of policy rates into bank lending rates and keep rates on hold this time. A report by Goldman Sachs said banks have barely transmitted the RBI’s prior policy actions and cited publicly available data till April to suggest that while policy rates have been reduced by 50bps since February, average bank lending rates have declined by only 5bps.
“Banks are not willing to cut rates as deposits and household financial savings are at historical lows. In addition, a predominant fraction of bank deposits are on fixed-rate terms, and are totally unrelated to the policy rate,"" Goldman Sachs said in its report."

Life insurance is not about investing your money to earn a return on it, it’s about financial protection for your loved ones. The most efficient way to do that is through a term insurance policy. You pay only for insurance and after the policy term ends, you don’t get any money back. But on death during the policy term, it pays a huge corpus to the nominees.

468,2019-06-04,State Bank,"State Bank of India reported the highest asset quality improvementApart from reporting lower slippages, banks have also written off several loans from their books after setting aside an equal sum of money as provisions

MUMBAI :
Aggregate bad loans of state-run banks declined 12% to  ₹7.17 trillion in the year ended 31 March as the rate at which loans turned bad slowed and lenders accelerated a long-running clean-up by writing off soured assets.
For private sector banks, the reduction in gross non-performing assets (NPAs) was 1.3% during the same period, according to data collated by Capitaline. The data was compiled from 18 public sector banks and 17 that were outside state control.
Fiscal year (FY) 2018-19 marked the first year of improvement in impaired loan ratios, giving comfort that Indian banks are on a path to recovery in terms of asset quality, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.
“Stressed asset recognition of corporate assets is broadly complete (barring few select names) and slippages have normalized,"" the 3 June note said.
State Bank of India (SBI), the nation’s largest lender, reported the biggest asset quality improvement. The bank brought bad loans down 23% to  ₹1.72 trillion as of 31 March from  ₹2.2 trillion at the end of the previous financial year. The bank also saw a decline in its share of total NPAs in the sector to 19% in FY19 from 22% in the previous year.
SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar told analysts after announcing the fiscal-fourth quarter earnings that the bank had controlled fresh slippages, or good loans turning bad. “For all past legacy accounts, we have made more than required provisions. It is reflected in provision coverage ratio, it is reflected in net NPA ratio,"" he said, adding that the bank will recover  ₹16,000 crore from three large accounts in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and has set a recovery target of  ₹35,000-38,000 crore in FY20. The  ₹16,000-crore recovery, Kumar said, “can happen in this quarter, it can happen in the next quarter. I’m very confident that it will happen in this calendar year"".
Apart from reporting lower slippages, banks have also written off several loans from their books after setting aside an equal sum of money as provisions. Bankers call it a technical write-off where the loans are taken of the books of banks but are still subjected to recovery mechanisms. For instance, SBI wrote off  ₹61,663 crore in the previous fiscal and Punjab National Bank wrote off  ₹12,253 crore. These two banks wrote off  ₹40,809 crore and  ₹7,407 crore, respectively in FY18.
While slippages in state-run banks have been declining, this is not the case with private banks which saw an increase in the March quarter. Reliance Securities said in a report that after declining for the last three quarters, aggregate slippages increased marginally for banks to 3.2% in the March quarter from 3.1% in the preceding quarter, led by the private banks which saw an increase of 34% sequentially.
“For PSBs, slippages continued to decline, albeit at a slower pace. Higher quarterly slippages can mainly be attributed to recognition of residual IL&FS and Jet exposures as sub-standard by banks,"" the report said.
State-run lenders also witnessed a decline in their provisions for the full year, showed Capitaline data. Total provisions for these banks stood at  ₹2.3 trillion in the previous fiscal, down 11% from the previous year. After accounting for private sector lenders, the total provisions for the banking industry fell 5% to  ₹3.13 trillion. Provisions is the amount of money banks set aside as buffer for each loan they disburse, with the quantum changing with the changing quality of the underlying asset.
On the profitability front, PSBs have reported aggregate losses in FY19 whereas private banks have remained profitable. The total losses of PSBs stood at  ₹57,835.23 crore in FY19, down from losses of  ₹75,936.49 in FY18. Meanwhile, private banks posted a net profit of  ₹28,610.16 crore in FY19.
However, analysts expect public sector banks to perform better in terms of profitability in FY20 while remaining cautious on slippages in non-corporate loans. The Reliance Securities report said that for PSBs, moderation in credit costs and write-backs from large NCLT recoveries are expected to aid FY20 earning, though ageing related provisions could continue for some.
“We remain cautious on PSBs (except SBI) as we expect subdued loan growth and weak spreads to limit expansion in return on assets (RoAs). Moreover, while concerns in the corporate book are largely factored, slippages from agri and SME portfolio remain elevated for many,"" the report said."

Mumbai: A worrying slowdown in India's economy makes a cut in the central bank's benchmark interest rate highly likely this week, but analysts say policymakers should also find ways to boost banks' liquidity to ensure they drop their lending rates too.
Beginning a three day review on Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of India's six-member monetary policy committee (MPC) can draw comfort from subdued inflation. Running at 2.92 % annually in April, it has stayed below the medium term target of 4% for the past nine months.
Two-thirds of 66 economists polled by Reuters expect the MPC to wrap up on Thursday by cutting the repo rate by 25 basis points, but that survey was taken even before India released far worse than expected economic growth numbers, so expectations for a cut have probably hardened.
If they are right, and the RBI does lower the repo rate to 5.75% it will be the third meeting in a row since February that India has cut interest rates. The last time it moved this quickly to lower rates was in 2013 to revive the moribund economy from growth rates that had slipped to a decade low.
The trouble is banks are laden with bad debt and are scared of losing customers if they cut deposit rates, constraining their ability to cut lending rates despite all the prods from the RBI.
State Bank of India, the country's largest lender by assets, has cut its key lending rate by only 10 basis points in response to the 50 bps cuts by the RBI.
A series of defaults at lender Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Service Ltd last year has raised concerns about the country's shadow banking industry with other lenders also facing trouble accessing capital and rating downgrades.
The RBI had retained its ""neutral"" stance after the rate cut in April but traders said a change in this stance to ""accommodative"" will be more comforting for markets than just a rate cut, especially after the recent GDP numbers.
""Liquidity woes in banking system are far from over,"" said Lakshmi Iyer, Chief Investment Officer (Debt) at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company.
""Given the global as also domestic scenario, the MPC may well choose to gratify the markets with a benchmark rate cut. What is more important for markets is the MPC guidance than the actual rate action.""
The economy really does need help.
Data out on Friday showed annual economic growth running at 5.8% in the January-March quarter, sharply down from 6.6% in the previous quarter, well below forecasts and the slowest in more than four years.
""The market is expecting RBI to cut the rates by at least 25 basis points, and we will not be surprised if they decide to cut the rate by even 50 bps, to infuse liquidity and push growth,"" said Romesh Tiwari, head of research at CapitalAim.
Fiscal, rain and oil uncertainties
Re-elected last month for a second term regardless of the slowdown, Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to stop the rot, and his economic strategists are working on big-bang reforms.
New Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is due to present a budget on July 5 that many analysts expect to be expansionary, though the she cannot afford to let the deficit slip too much.
Until then the RBI will have to live with the uncertainty over the new minister's fiscal plans, while knowing that when the government does boost spending it will go some way to boosting banks' liquidity.
Also, the effect of the drain on banks' liquidity from political parties' demand for cash during the election campaign should begin to fade.
Oil prices and the monsoon rains are less predictable. The central bank had lowered its Jan-March 2020 inflation forecast to 3.8 percent but warned it could be higher if food and fuel prices rise abruptly or if the fiscal deficit overshoots targets.

466,2019-06-04,State Bank,"SBI has registered recoveries of 57 per cent in written-off accounts during the fiscalSBI said it expects to continue with better recoveries in the current financial year

NEW DELHI :
The country's largest lender SBI has targeted to grow 10-12 per cent in the current financial year, on the back of green shoots of revival in credit demand and better recoveries of loans.
In the latter part of 2018-19, State Bank of India (SBI) witnessed early signs of the turnaround that the bank had diligently and systematically been working for, and multi-pronged strategies yielded the desired results.
Looking forward, the bank is well-positioned on the back of strong business growth, capital and liquidity, and the ability to charge spreads to be in leadership positions, SBI said in its annual report 2018-19.
""Taking cues from the last year, the bank has set the goal to achieve a healthy credit growth of 10-12 per cent in 2019-20. To an extent, the credit revival and recoveries in FY19 have already set the tone and the bank is confident of achieving the target set for FY20,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said in his message to shareholders.
After a significantly low credit growth in the previous couple of years, the banking industry witnessed a pick-up in credit growth during 2018-19 due to strong revival in credit to the corporate sector driven largely by government investment and continued demand from personal loan segment, Kumar said.
In the financial year ended March 2019, SBI posted a standalone profit of  ₹862 crore and a consolidated profit of  ₹2,300 crore.
Also, it registered recoveries of 57 per cent in written-off accounts during the fiscal.
SBI said it expects to continue with better recoveries in the current financial year.
On the asset front, the lender adopted a strict monitoring mechanism, helping it bring down gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio to 7.53 per cent in 2018-19 from 10.91 per cent in the previous fiscal.
Likewise, the net NPAs or bad loans also declined by 272 basis points to 3.01 per cent.
Besides, the bad loans in the corporate segment declined from 21.92 per cent in 2017-18 to 13.62 per cent in 2018-19.
Despite the ups and downs, the average recovery rate in stressed accounts under the NCLT route was in excess of 60 per cent, said the annual report.
Kumar said 2019-20 will be a turning point for SBI.
""Not only will the financials improve going forward, efforts will also be directed to achieve a more sustainable mix of business, both domestically and in overseas operations,"" he added.

465,2019-06-06,State Bank,"From May 1, SBI moved to a new interest rate mechanism for large savings accounts and short-term loansUnder this mechanism, the interest rate on these products is linked to RBI's repo rate

The interest rate offered by SBI on large savings accounts will go down from today, after Reserve Bank of India cut its repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.75%. Similarly, SBI will also bring down the interest charged on short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility.
From May 1, SBI had moved to a new interest rate regime on large savings account deposits as well as short-term loans. Under this mechanism, whenever there is a change in RBI repo rate, the change gets automatically reflected in these SBI products.
SBI has linked its interest rate on savings account with balance above  ₹1 lakh and short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility to Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) repo rate. This has been done for better transmission of RBI’s policy rates into the banking system.
Also read: RBI delivers another rate cut, shifts policy stance to 'accommodative'
On savings accounts with deposits above  ₹1 lakh, SBI is offering interest rate of 275 bps below repo rate from May 1. This means effective interest rate on large SBI savings accounts will get automatically changed to 3%.
SBI savings accounts with deposits below  ₹1 lakh will continue to fetch 3.5% interest rate. This comprises about 95% of total SBI savings account holders.
Other products where SBI has linked repo rate are short-term loans such as cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh. All cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh is linked to the RBI's repo rate, plus a spread of 2.25%—amounting to 8%.
SBI charges a risk premium on these loans, over and above the floor rate of 8%, based on the risk profile of the borrower.
Analysts say that this rate mechanism is ""transparent"" and that can be quickly transmitted when there is a regulatory change."

An SBI spokesperson said: “SBI has been receiving queries on the impact that recent developments in accounts like DHFL could have on the Bank and on the system.
SBI has been very closely monitoring its exposures in the NBFC sector for the past 10 months and taking action as deemed appropriate.""

The bank said it will pass on the 25 bps repo rate cut, announced by the Reserve Bank of India yesterday, to some cash credit borrowers.
SBI also announced slashing of effective repo-linked lending rate for CC/OD (cash credit/overdraft), which will be in effect 1 July onwards.

462,2019-06-08,State Bank,"The rate of interest offered on an RD is similar to that of fixed depositsTDS is applicable on RDs

Recurring Deposit (RD) is a type of term deposit offered by banks and non-banking financial services. RD schemes allow customers to build up their savings through regular monthly deposits of fixed sum over a fixed period of time. An RD account allows you to deposit a pre-specified amount at pre-decided intervals. The installment amount once fixed, cannot be altered. For instance, if you sign up with a bank to invest 1,000 every month for 12 months in a regular RD, you will have to invest the specified amount at a fixed date every month.
The rate of interest offered on an RD is similar to that of fixed deposits. However, you should know that since RDs come under the definition of time deposits, the interest earned will attract tax deducted at source (TDS).
An RD account can be opened with a bank or a post office. Both State Bank of India (SBI) and post office offer RD options to their customers.
Here is a comparison of RD accounts offered by SBI and post office:
-SBI RD interest rates vary between 6.4% and 6.85 % for regular customers whereas post office RDs offer a quite high interest rate of 7.3% per annum, compounding quarterly.
-For an SBI RD account, the term of deposit may vary between 12 months and 120 months, but post office offer RDs for a tenure of 5 years only.
-An SBI RD account can be opened by cheque/cash, but an RD account in a post office can be opened by cash only.
-Other than visiting the branch to open an RD, nowadays you can open an SBI RD account online through net banking facility as well, but for opening a post office RD account you have to visit the post office branch.
-In SBI RD account, customers are required to make monthly deposits of minimum of  ₹100 and in multiples of  ₹10. There is no maximum limit on the deposits. But the minimum amount required for opening a post office RD is  ₹10 per month, or any amount in multiples of  ₹5. However, there is no maximum limit on investment.
-SBI imposes penalty charges for non-deposit of monthly installments in case of an RD account. For account of period five years and less, the bank charges  ₹1.50 per  ₹100 per month and for above five years, SBI charges  ₹2 per  ₹100 per month. In case of a Post Office RD account, if the subsequent deposit is not made up to the prescribed day, a default fee of  ₹0.05 for every  ₹5 is charged. After four regular defaults, the account is discontinued and can be revived in two months but if the same is not revived within this period, no further deposits can be made."
461,2019-06-08,State Bank,"The Income Tax department has revised Form 15H to incorporate changes made in the interim budgetThe old Form 15H did not took into account the maximum allowable rebate of  ₹12,500

The income tax department has issued a revised Form 15H, using which senior citizens with taxable income of up to  ₹5 lakh can claim TDS exemption on interest from deposits.
As announced in this year's interim budget by the then finance minister Piyush Goyal, individuals with annual taxable income of up to  ₹5 lakh will get full tax rebate. In the last financial year, the limit for seeking tax deducted at source (TDS) exemption was  ₹2.5 lakh.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has recently issued a notification amending Form 15H according to the budget announcement.
The finance ministry has now amended Section 87A of the Income Tax Act under which a resident individual, having total income of up to  ₹5 lakh, shall be entitled to a rebate of an amount being the amount of tax chargeable or  ₹12,500, whichever is less.
The amendments by the CBDT states that banks and financial institutions would accept Form 15H from assessees whose tax liability is 'nil' after considering rebate available under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The old Form 15H did not took into account the maximum allowable rebate of  ₹12,500.
The revised Form 15H can now be submitted in banks and post offices to claim exemption from TDS on interest income on deposits. Senior citizens, above 60 years of age, have to submit Form 15H to banks at the beginning of a financial year to ensure that no tax is deducted at source on interest income.
Nangia Advisors (Andersen Global) Executive Director Neha Malhotra told PTI that had this change not been brought, taxpayers earning income up to  ₹5 lakh would have suffered TDS on interest from banks and would have had to file a tax return to claim refund of such TDS.
""This change not only saves the taxpayer from the hassle of filing ITR to claim refund but also reduces the administrative burden of CPC (central processing centre) to process such returns and issue refunds,"" Malhotra said."
460,2019-06-08,State Bank,"A dream home may be on top of your to-do list, but you should factor in job transferability, loan and affordability before making a decisionIn case of salaried individuals, a house is likely to be the most expensive buy

MUMBAI :
When city-based financial planner Melvin Joseph, now 52, started working 25 years ago, he had made up his mind that he would not buy a property. “Immediately after my wedding, I got transferred from my home town in Kerala to a hill station while working for an insurance company. Since then, I have always stayed on rent as I knew I would be changing cities owing to my work profile,"" says Joseph. In the past 25 years, he has shifted multiple cities across Kerala and Tamil Nadu, before winding up in Mumbai. Not owning a property has actually given him the freedom to explore his career without any restrictions, says Joseph. “Had I purchased a house in Kerala 25 years ago, then my career would have been limited, as I would be thinking about my real estate investment and would have been locked into an EMI [equated monthly instalment],"" he says.
Unlike Joesph, who was clear about his decision, majority of salaried individuals, at some point or the other, have to tackle this common dilemma—to buy a house or rent one. Once you keep your emotions aside, it gets easier to decide this. Here are some key questions you need to ask yourself to make an informed decision on property for self occupancy:
PLAN TO LIVE IN THE CURRENT LOCATION FOREVER?
Today, most individuals tend to change cities for better opportunities. “Don’t purchase a house in the early part of your career if you are likely to move cities or if there is no job certainty,"" says Joseph. Real estate is an illiquid asset and you also can’t predict the growth on it. Plans to sell and buy properties at your convenience may not work. “With the need for flexibility being paramount in careers and the requirement to reskill at multiple stages, the flexibility of renting and not having EMIs can be very advantageous,"" says Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house if you don’t plan to live in the city for long.
CAN YOU AFFORD IT?
Real estate is an expensive asset. In case of salaried individuals, a house is likely to be the most expensive buy. Hence, you need to ask yourself if you can afford to buy a property. “A house requires a huge amount of capital and for most of us it entails taking a loan. Buying a house to live may make sense if you are going to be in the city for long, travel time to work place is less and have at least 25% of the amount available as down payment,"" says financial planner Deepali Sen.
Verdict: If the rent is 1-2% of the property value and EMI is likely to be 1.5 times above monthly rent, stay on rent.
SETTLE FOR A SMALL HOUSE?
To woo homebuyers amid high prices, developers reduce the size of the property to try and fit the house in your budget. But do you actually want to live in it? Besides location and affordability, you also need to factor in the property size. Just because you can afford only 280 sqft for  ₹1 crore in Mumbai, you shouldn’t lock yourself in. Similarly, just because you fancy a big house, you shouldn’t go for it if you can’t afford it.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house which doesn’t fit your requirement.
CAN YOU REPAY THE LOAN?
Remember that home loans are of longer duration and are large ticket-size loans. And you should have the long-term ability to service these loans. You have to make sure your home loan repayment is cushioned against job loss, loss of income due to medical emergency, and any other unforeseen circumstances.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house if you don’t have the ability to repay your loan.
CAN YOU MEET OTHER GOALS?
Remember, buying a house is only one of the financial goals. You will also have other goals to fulfil, such as higher education, child’s education, buying a car, travel plan and retirement. You have to ensure you are able to meet these goals too. “You should think of buying a house without hurting your lifestyle and your other goals.
Usually, a bigger home loan means the future cash flow gets used up for at least two decades. This leaves little room for other key goals,"" says Sen.
Verdict: Buy a house only if it doesn’t hurt your lifestyle and other goals."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

458,2019-06-10,State Bank,"Despite the repo rate dropping from 6.5% to 5.75%, banks haven’t cut their lending and deposit ratesMint looks at whether RBI will be lucky the third time around

1) How do interest rates of banks look since the beginning of 2019?
Two different interest rates need to be considered. First, the rate at which banks have been borrowing and second, the rate at which they have been lending. The weighted average interest rate on term deposits of banks was 6.91% in January. By April, it had fallen by six basis points to 6.85%. One basis point is equal to 0.01. During the same period, the weighted average lending rate of banks has risen by four basis points from 10.38% to 10.42%. What this tells us is that in terms of outstanding loans of banks, the interest rates of both borrowing and lending have barely moved.
2) Why is that the case with banks?
Since January, the credit to deposit ratio of banks has been 77% or more, except on one occasion—the fortnight ending 10 May—when it stood at 76.9%. Banks need to maintain a cash reserve ratio of 4% with the central bank. They also need to maintain a statutory liquidity ratio of 19% by investing in approved government securities. After adjusting for cash reserve ratio and statutory liquidity ratio, it is clear that banks are lending out almost all the deposits they have. Hence, they are not in a position to reduce interest rates on their deposits as they need fresh deposits to keep funding their loans.
3) What does this mean?
With banks not being in a position to cut interest rates on their deposits, the question of reducing interest rates on their lending does not arise. Deposit growth stood at 15.3% in 2016-17 due to demonetization. It fell to a more than five-decade low of 6.2% in 2017-18. Deposits gathered in 2016-17 helped banks for a while. After that, the deposit growth slowdown started to hurt and that has primarily led to a situation where banks have not been able to cut down their borrowing and lending rates despite RBI’s repo rate cuts. To enable banks to cut rates, deposits need to grow faster, so as to bring down the credit-deposit ratio.
4) How has deposit growth fared in the recent past?
In 2019, deposit growth of banks has been close to 10%, much better than in 2018. The annual deposit growth needs to increase a little more and reach around 12-13% before banks feel confident about cutting interest rates. In 2017-18, interest rates on deposits had crashed in the aftermath of demonetization, leading investors to look at other avenues.
5) Are lending rates likely to be reduced?
One impact of the crisis at non-banks is that more money will now move into banks. This should help in faster deposit growth. But this will take time. Banks need to hold on to the interest rates on their deposits for the next few months, so that their deposit growth is robust enough to get the credit-deposit ratio below 75% and help them cut interest rates after that.

MUMBAI :
The National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) said on Wednesday that shares of Jet Airways (India) Ltd will be removed from daily trading of futures and options effective 28 June, citing the embattled carrier’s failure to respond to queries about persisting rumours in the market.
Shares of the Mumbai-based carrier fell 1.38% on Wednesday to  ₹106.3 on the BSE, compared with a 0.48% decline in the benchmark Sensex.
The company’s shares have shed nearly 71% in a year, underperforming the Sensex’s 11.39% gain.
Jet Airways has deferred interest payments to banks and dues to fuel suppliers, oil marketing companies, and aircraft lessors.
As a result, lessors of the airline had grounded most of its 119 planes.
The debt-ridden carrier has also not paid some employees since March. Jet Airways spent  ₹781.19 crore as remuneration for its employees during the October-December 2018 quarter.
NSE also cited the company’s failure to submit financial results for the year ended 31 March, as well as observations made by its auditor, as reasons for its decision.
Several people from the top management and board of directors of the carrier, which has not operated a flight since 17 April, have left the company in the past few months, following the departure of founder and chairman Naresh Goyal in March.
Lenders to Jet Airways, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), are seeking investors to recover their dues.
The airline’s total liability, including unpaid salaries and vendor dues, is nearly  ₹15,000 crore. If all else fails, Jet Airways may be referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
However, under bankruptcy resolution, lenders may recover only a fraction of the  ₹8,400 crore the airline owes them.
Mint reported on Tuesday that the Hinduja Group and Etihad Airways PJSC may not proceed with plans to resurrect the airline, dealing a severe blow to rescue efforts.
The pilots union of Jet Airways will file a plea against the grounded airline at the NCLT for non-payment of salaries and not providing a provision for gratuity payment to its staff, two senior members of the union said on Tuesday .
The union, the National Aviators Guild (NAG), counted about 1,100 of the airline’s 1,600 pilots as its members before the grounding of the carrier.
Two operational creditors of Jet Airways, Shaman Wheels Pvt. Ltd and Gaggar Enterprises Pvt. Ltd, had on 10 June filed separate insolvency pleas against Jet Airways at NCLT, Mumbai, for recovery of their dues.
Shaman Wheels is motor dealership in Mumbai and Gaggar Enterprises is a mineral producer in Ahmedabad, according to the ministry of corporate affairs website.
Shaman Wheels, a vendor for trucks and trailers for the airline, has dues of  ₹6.28 crore pending from Jet Airways. Gaggar Enterprises sold packaged drinking water to the carrier and the money owed to it could not be ascertained immediately.
The plans of the National Aviators Guild to approach the NCLT could further impact lenders’ recoveries from Jet Airways. In case Jet Airways is not liquidated and insolvency is resolved, the new investor who bails out the carrier would need to take on the liability, including salaries."

Inflows into Indian equity mutual funds in May rebounded from the smallest in 31 months as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comfortable electoral win spurred appetite for risk assets.
They took in 54.1 billion rupees ($778 million), according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. That’s an increase from 46.1 billion rupees that the funds received in April, the least since September 2016, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

That Life Insurance Corporation of (LIC) India is losing market share to private insurers hand over fist over the last several years is well known.
The insurance behemoth’s market share in adjusted individual business premium was 42.4% in May, a decline from the previous month.
Analysts at Kotak Securities noted that LIC reported 3% decline in retail annualised premium equivalent.
But the battle within the private sector life insurance pie is getting interesting with smaller players gaining heft. The latest monthly business data from the insurance regulator shows that smaller insurance players such as India First Life Insurance, Canara HSBC Life Insurance and Tata AIA Life Insurance have grown exponentially in the month of May.
Of course, a low base has contributed to the high percentage growth. Even so, Tata AIA Life has managed to garner a higher share in the market. “A low base and focus on ULIPs coupled with moderate appetite for equity investments were the likely reasons,"" said analysts at Kotak Securities.
That said, the top three insurers—SBI Life Insurance Co, HDFC Standard Life and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance still hold a lion’s share of the private sector life insurance market.
ICICI PruLife has seen its annualised premium equivalent (APE) growth collapse over the last several months. This stems from the change in approach by the management after the life insurer’s leadership change last year.
ICICI PruLife has consciously focussed on small ticket sized policies and begun to stay away from selling bulky products. As are result, its market share has come down marginally while the growth rate of its retail portfolio was a mere 1% in May.
Rival HDFC Standard Life has reported a surge in growth to 59% in May for retail APE. Even SBI Life Insurance Co saw its retail APE growth surge to 37%.
LIC, however, continues to dwarf others in group business segment with a market share of over 80%."
451,2019-06-13,State Bank,"Rajnish Kumar after meeting with Finance Minister for pre-Budget consultations said the SBI doesn't need any capital from the govtIn March this year, SBI raised  ₹1,251 crore in bonds to boost its additional tier 1 capital ratio while its board has extended the deadline to raise  ₹20,000 crore till March next year

New Delhi: State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar on Thursday said the bank does not need any capital from the government.
""SBI doesn't need any capital from the government,"" Kumar said after a meeting with the Finance Minister for pre-Budget consultations with bankers where capital infusion in PSU banks was discussed.
In March this year, the SBI raised  ₹1,251 crore in bonds to boost its additional tier 1 capital ratio while its board has extended the deadline to raise  ₹20,000 crore till March next year.
The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer. Tier 1 capital is calculated as Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital plus Additional Tier 1 (AT1) capital.
In 2018-19, the government had pumped in  ₹1.6 trillion, the highest ever, into public sector banks, helping five lenders come out of the PCA framework and to meet regulatory and growth capital.
The interim budget presented in February did not provide any allocation for recapitalisation. In February this year and in the last fiscal, the government approved and later infused  ₹48,239 crore recapitalisation plan for 12 public sector banks (PSBs), including the fraud-hit Punjab National Bank (PNB), to help them avoid and come out of the prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.
State Bank of India's balance sheet has been fully repaired in FY2019 even as it recorded a turnaround performance in the fourth quarter.
In Q4, the country's largest bank had reported a net profit of  ₹838 crore against a net loss of  ₹7,718 crore in the same period the previous year. It reported a substantial improvement in the asset quality, with lower fresh slippages and better recoveries.
The profit in the reporting quarter came on the back of a 15% year-on-year (Y-o-Y) increase in the net interest income (the difference between interest earned and interest expended) at  ₹22,954 crore and lower loan-loss provisions of  ₹17,336 crore (down 28 per cent Y-o-Y).
For the full-year ended March, the bank reported a net profit of  ₹862 crore against a net loss of  ₹6,547 crore in FY18. Gross NPAs declined from 10.91% of gross advances as at end-March 2018 to 7.53% as at end-March 2019 and the net NPAs fell from 5.73% of net advances to 3.01%.
The PCR improved from 66% to 79%. The bank said recovery in FY19 was at an all-time high of  ₹31,512 crore. Of this,  ₹13,836 crore came through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Resolution process."

Mumbai: India’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) has not stopped lending to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), but does so after considering the risk perception of the borrower, said Arijit Basu, managing director, SBI.
“SBI is already lending to NBFCs and we continue to do so. Our decisions are taken based on risk perception that we have on a particular entity,"" said Basu on the sidelines of IMC’s Banking and Finance Conference.
Basu added while NBFCs face difficulties, these are not extremely grave. “There are one or two entities that are more severely affected and they need to address it. Both the RBI and the government have taken a few steps, and are contemplating taking some more. We will have to wait and see,"" he said.
As of 31 March, SBI’s NBFC exposure stood at  ₹1.87 trillion, of which housing finance companies (HFCs) comprised  ₹62,511 crore, central and state government-backed NBFCs  ₹63,033 crore and those backed by large private sector institutions  ₹67,226 crore.
On 6 June, SBI said that it had been closely monitoring its exposures in the NBFC sector for the past 10 months and taking appropriate action. It added that the overall quality of the NBFC asset portfolio in its books continues to be good.
“Challenges faced by accounts like DHFL have already been factored in when we have given our estimate for the stress that the bank would have to deal with in FY20, and included in our estimates for slippage and loan loss provisioning for the current financial year,"" it said.
Basu said the Reserve Bank of India’s 7 June circular on stressed assets is just a guidance and that SBI would like to resolve these cases as soon as possible.
“That process never stopped. For us it is never a challenge because it strengthens our hand,"" he said, adding that timelines prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India should never be a challenge for banks.
“The intent of RBI is to say that you act fast, and having learnt their lessons, banks are doing that.""
Basu said banks have learnt lessons from the difficulties of the last 5-10 years and that they need to address those and continue to step up.
“The government is doing a lot. It has come up with an environment which is more meaningful. You have various mechanisms such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) which are falling into place."""
449,2019-06-16,State Bank,"To be eligible to take a repo rate-linked home loan, you need to have a minimum annual income of  ₹6 lakhThe total loan tenor cannot exceed 35 years. The bank will charge a premium of 20 bps above applicable interest rate if the loan-to-value is greater than 80%

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, has launched repo rate-linked home loan product effective 1 July. So far, all new floating rate home loans were linked to marginal cost of fund based lending rate (MCLR) since August 2016.
From 1 July, you will have the option to choose between MCLR linked home loan rate and repo rate linked home loan rate. “Customers coming to us for floating rate home loans will be offered both options— MCLR-linked home loans as well as repo rate-linked home loans,"" said PK Gupta, managing director, SBI.
If you opt for the repo rate-linked home loan, you will see a direct impact whenever the repo rate changes. Here is how the product works and what it means for you:
What is on offer?
To begin with, let’s first understand the policy rate. Repo rate or the repurchase rate is the interest rate at which the central bank lends short-term money to commercial banks. When there is a cut in the repo rate, the banks get money at a cheaper rate. This should mean that banks will pass on the benefit of cheaper money to the home loan consumers.
However, transmission of rate cut continued to remain slow as banks’ cost of funds also came into play while calculating loan rate. To bridge that gap, SBI launched repo rate linked home loan.
However, it is not directly linked to the repo rate number. The loan is linked to repo-linked lending rate (RLLR). “RLLR is 2.25% over repo rate. So right now repo rate in 5.75% and hence RLLR is 8%,"" said Gupta. There is a spread of 40 basis points (bps) and 55 bps above the RLLR. So effectively, your home loan rate for amount up to  ₹75 lakh will be 8.40%-8.55%. Currently, home loan linked to MCLR is 8.55% to 9.10%.
To be eligible to take a repo rate-linked home loan, you need to have a minimum annual income of  ₹6 lakh. Also, in case of repo rate-linked home loan, you have to repay a minimum 3% of the principal loan amount every year in equated monthly instalments. The maximum loan tenor is 33 years over and above maximum moratorium permitted of two years for under-construction properties. The total loan tenor cannot exceed 35 years. The bank will charge a premium of 20 bps above applicable interest rate if the loan-to-value is greater than 80%.
Should you go for it?
If you just look at the interest rate, the loan-linked to repo rate is 15 bps cheaper if your credit worthiness is higher. “This product is different. We will see how people receive it and whether we have to tweak it depending on the response,"" said Gupta.
In case of repo rate-linked loan you will see the change in rate immediately as there is no reset clause like MCLR, he added. On May 1, the bank had linked its savings account deposit and cash credit and overdraft to repo rate. It was a strategic plan of the bank to first link products from liability side to repo rate and then the assets side.
“For us to link products to repo rate on the asset side we should have some liabilities also linked to it. Hence, we first linked our savings rate with repo rate and now we have linked some of the asset side products to repo rate. Ultimately we need to balance on both sides of the balance sheet,"" said Gupta.
The bank said in this product it will segregate the equated monthly instalment (EMI) amount. “We are segregating the EMI. Earlier, EMI was interest and principal. Here, the principal EMI will be fixed at principal instalment and interest will be in actuals. If you take this loan, 3% of the principal has to be repaid every year. For example, for a  ₹10 lakh loan, 3% or  ₹30,000 will have to be repaid every year plus the interest. Only interest rate varies every year. The EMI will in a way vary. We will be announcing basic parameters in a few days,"" he added."

INDORE :
Electoral bonds worth over  ₹5,800 crore were bought by donors to fund political parties between March 1, 2018 and May 10, 2019, a Right to Information reply has said.
Seventy-six per cent of these bonds, worth  ₹4,444.32 crore, were bought in the sale of last three tranches, which took place between March 1 and May 10 this year at the height of Lok Sabha campaigning and polls, the RTI reply furnished by the State Bank of India said.
As per the Union government's Electoral Bond Scheme 2018, only 29 branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) were authorised to issue and encash these bonds in ten phases.
The reply said people bought electoral bonds worth  ₹5851.41 crore between March 1, 2018 and May 10, 2019, of which those worth  ₹1,407.09 crore were purchased by anonymous donors in the first seven phases between March 1 last year and January 24 this year.
The RTI was filed by a Neemuch-based activist Chandrashekhar Goud.
The bonds are valued at  ₹1000,  ₹10,000,  ₹one lakh,  ₹10 lakh and  ₹one crore.
As per provisions of the scheme, electoral bonds may be received by political parties registered under Section 29A of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 and those which have secured not less than one per cent of the votes polled in the last general of state elections.
The Supreme Court, which is hearing a petition against these bonds, in April this year directed all political parties to furnish receipts of funding received through electoral bonds and details of identity of donors in a sealed cover to the Election Commission.
The Centre contends electoral bonds are an attempt at bringing greater transparency, ensuring KYC compliance and keeping an audit trail in comparison to the earlier opaque system of cash donations.

446,2019-06-16,State Bank,"SBI has deferred its fundraising plan via QIP to a later date, citing no need for fresh capitalInvestors still cold to state-run bank shares, reflected in Nifty PSU Bank’s 7% fall in last two months

Capital has been a challenge for public sector banks. A decade ago, they had too much of it, which only made their inefficiencies look stark. Today, they have too little to keep them afloat or grow.
But balance sheets are healing and fresh money from the government has meant many of them won’t starve. Add the prospects of higher loan growth, and investors should be attracted towards public sector banks. But that is not playing out yet.
The largest of them, State Bank of India (SBI), has deferred its plans to raise money through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) issue, according to an IFR Asia article. The lender had secured approvals from its shareholders in December to raise about  ₹20,000 crore by issuing equity shares.
The story quotes SBI’s deputy managing director and chief financial officer Prashant Kumar as saying that the lender has no burning need to raise capital immediately.
This may well be a case of calling the grapes sour when they are out of reach. Mint reported late last month that SBI was close to raising capital, since the elections were out of the way. It’s likely demand in the primary market hasn’t picked up post-elections, as issuers such as SBI had hoped.
Thankfully for SBI, it has a comfortable Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.62% and a total capital adequacy ratio of 12.72% as of March. That is above the regulatory minimum for both, and enough to fund 12% credit growth. Its toxic loans have been reducing as well.
Indeed, SBI’s stock has gained more than 9% in the last two months and now trades at 1.3 times its estimated book value for FY20. Considering the heft it has because of the balance sheet size, the bank’s valuation is reasonable compared with its closest peers.
But if SBI is looking at a valuation of  ₹3.5 trillion, as said in IFR Asia, which is roughly 16% higher than the current level, the bank will have to wait.
What about the other public sector banks?
Analysts believe that the drag on earnings would continue as banks are yet to fully insure their balance sheets through provisioning. Coverage ratios began to rise only in the fourth quarter for most lenders. Moreover, even if the corporate loan book heals, many banks are likely to see increased stress in agriculture and small business loans.
The Nifty PSU Bank index has dropped nearly 7% in the last two months, a sign that investors will give a cold shoulder to any attempts from lenders to raise money from the market. After all, public sector banks are still loss-making entities with negative return on assets, a combination that would keep investors away.
Hence, investors don’t see a big revival in the earnings of public sector banks. Perhaps the responsibility of removing the curse of capital would fall into the hands of the government again."

Mumbai: Lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd on Monday decided to start bankruptcy proceedings against the grounded airline, all but ending hopes of a recovery.
The consortium of lenders, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), chose to refer Jet Airways to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), the state-run bank said in a statement.
“A meeting of lenders was held today to consider the way forward in respect of Jet Airways. After due deliberations, lenders have decided to seek resolution under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016) since only a conditional bid was received and requirement of the investor for Sebi exemptions and resolution of all creditors is possible under IBC,"" the statement said.
“Lenders led by State Bank of India have been taking efforts to find a resolution for Jet Airways outside IBC but in view of the above, lenders have decided to seek a resolution within the IBC process,"" the bank said.
A senior banker involved in the discussions said one or two parties have indicated their interest in Jet Airways once it reaches the bankruptcy court although they did not offer any assurance. The banker requested anonymity.
Mint was the first to report on 11 June that London-based Hinduja Group had decided to halt negotiations to buy a stake in Jet Airways, while Etihad Airways of Abu Dhabi put on hold a plan to add more investments in the Mumbai-based airline.
“They cannot invest at  ₹150 or  ₹200 per share in this company. When they are putting in money, then they need to know if it is safe,"" said the banker.
Last week, two operational creditors, Shaman Wheels Pvt. Ltd and Gaggar Enterprises Pvt. Ltd, filed separate insolvency pleas against Jet Airways at NCLT, Mumbai, for recovery of their dues.
“The onus of settlement cannot be on lenders. We can settle our dues. But we cannot settle operational creditors. So, one more option was Section 230. For that, if everybody agrees, i.e, 75% technically agrees, you can file a scheme for arrangement. But the option of dissenting lenders to take the company to NCLT would still remain,"" said the banker cited earlier.
The pilots’ union of Jet Airways, National Aviator’s Guild, also plans to file a plea against the grounded airline at NCLT for non-payment of salaries and not providing a provision for gratuity payment to its staff.
Aviation analysts said it is unlikely that the lenders will be able to recover a substantial portion of their dues by referring the airline to NCLT.
“Jet Airways doesn’t have many assets left as most of their aircraft were inducted on a sale and leaseback mechanism,"" said an analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity. “The properties owned by the airline are also mortgaged as security for loans.""
Jet Airways owns about 13 aircraft, including 10 Boeing 777s and three Boeing 737 aircraft, most of which are mortgaged to financers, said Mark Martin, founder and chief executive officer of aviation consultancy firm Martin Consulting.
“Since these planes are old, lenders can raise at least $40-50 million per aircraft by selling the Boeing 777 aircraft owned by the airline,"" Martin said.
A brand new Boeing 777 has a list price that ranges from $300 million to $400 million depending on its make and specifications, according to Boeing Co.’s website.
The Export-Import (Exim) Bank of the US could, however, initiate proceedings to take back at least six planes it financed for Jet Airways. This could worsen the situation for the Indian lenders to recover their loans.
“At present, Exim has not taken steps regarding deregistering of the six Boeing aircraft. Exim continues to seek a full recovery of the remaining debt owed,"" a spokesperson said.
Queries sent to Jet Airways seeking comments on the decision of lenders to approach NCLT to recover their dues didn’t elicit a response till press time.
“In the current situation, it is very unlikely that Jet Airways will get a buyer as a going concern, so most likely it will be liquidated,"" said Ravi Kini, managing partner at M.V. Kini and Co. “The money received from the asset sale will be distributed as per the waterfall mechanism provided in Section 53 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.""
A second banker aware of the discussions at Monday’s meeting said none of the bids received for Jet worked out owing to the range of haircuts sought by bidders, among other issues.
The banker, who requested anonymity, said that net present value of the loan will be eroded over time and bankers expect that a quicker resolution process under IBC could help protect the value of the asset.
With the company now going to NCLT, lenders may be able to recover only a fraction of the  ₹8,400 crore it owes them. The total liabilities of the airline, including unpaid salaries and vendor dues, are nearly  ₹15,000 crore.
Jet Airways’ lenders, led by SBI, have been trying to resolve the insolvency crisis at the airline outside NCLT due to fear of little or no recovery. Under the bank-led resolution process, Etihad, which owns a 24% stake in Jet Airways, had earlier agreed to invest in the airline, provided it remained a minority investor.
Jet Airways hasn’t flown since 17 April after it grounded all its operations due to a severe cash crunch.
Shares of Jet Airways fell nearly 17% on Monday to  ₹68.30 on the BSE, widely underperforming the benchmark Sensex’s 1.25% fall. The shares have fallen 82% in the past 12 months, compared with a 9.6% rise in the Sensex.

Multiple investigations and parallel bankruptcy filings by operational creditors will cast a shadow over the insolvency proceedings of Jet Airways (India) Ltd that its lenders have decided to initiate, experts said.
A consortium of lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday decided to approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) after efforts to recover dues and revive the airline outside the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) failed.
This has added to the woes of the beleaguered airline. The income tax department is investigating Jet Airways for alleged tax evasion of  ₹650 crore, while the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) is probing alleged fraud at the airline, and the enforcement directorate is investigating Gulf airline Etihad PJSC’s 2013 investment in Jet.
The investigations will continue even as the insolvency process gets underway.
“These are statutory bodies investigating criminal aspects such as alleged fraud and tax evasion. These will continue and would not be impacted by the insolvency plea,"" said Vineet Naik, a senior advocate at Bombay high court.
The I-T probe is being conducted on the basis of an internal report that alleged that funds sent by Jet Airways to some Dubai-based entities were linked to promoters and purportedly meant to evade taxes.
The probe by the MCA is on some violations of the Companies Act 2013 and to verify some suspect transactions.
“Investigations will fasten liability on the beneficiary and will come back only on the promoters/ beneficiaries if proved. Any incoming investors, though it looks difficult at this time, will have indemnity from any liability arising out of these investigations. The company law investigations will be theoretical as the company would be wound up till then,"" said Ravi Kini, founder, M.V. Kini and Associates.
The investigations will continue separately but no monetary demand will be raised during the moratorium of 180 days, extendable up to 270 days.
“Though the investigations will continue, no demand can be raised against the company during the moratorium period. For instance, if the tax authorities give a final assessment of tax demand, these will be added to pending dues. These will be then settled as per the waterfall mechanism, making the government dues at par with those of unsecured creditors,"" said Manoj Kumar, partner, Corporate Law Professionals."
439,2019-06-18,State Bank,"The lenders have been trying to sell the airline as a going concern since the past five months, but failed due to many a reasonJet Airways stopped flying on 17 April after it ran out of cash and the unpaid lessors took away most of its 100-odd operational airplanes

Mumbai: The consortium of 26 bankers led by State Bank of India (SBI) on Tuesday took the grounded Jet Airways to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to recover their dues of over  ₹8,500 crore. The tribunal will hear the matter on Wednesday.
Jet Airways, started over 25 years ago by airline- ticketing-agent-turned-entrepreneur Naresh Goyal, stopped flying on 17 April after it ran out of cash and the unpaid lessors took away most of its 100-odd operational airplanes.
The lenders have been trying to sell the airline as a going concern since the past five months, but failed due to many a reason.
Apart from banks, the airline also owes over  ₹10,000 crore to its hundreds of vendors, primarily aircraft lessors and over  ₹3,000 crore to around 23,000 employees who have not been paid since March.
The airline has been having negative networth for long and has run a loss of over  ₹13,000 crore in the past few year. Thus it has over  ₹36,500 crore of dues and being a services company negligible assets to recover.
Also, most of its domestic airport slots have been given away to other airlines by the government and so are some of its slots at some key international airports.
On the aeroplane asset side, Jet had only 16 on its book which are valued around  ₹5,000 crore as per some media reports, as the rest of its 123 fleet were on lease and most of them have been de-registered or taken away by the foreign lessors already.
The Jet shares are at multiyear lows and plunged 41% on Tuesday to close at  ₹40.45 on the BSE. During the day, it tanked 52.78% to hit an all-time low of  ₹32.25. In the past five trading sessions alone, the shares lost over 73% of their value.
When banks converted a part of their debt into equity when the stock was trading over  ₹250 apiece. The conversion price was fixed at a nominal Re 1, though.
Following a meeting of the lenders Monday, SBI had said that ""after due deliberations, the lenders have decided to seek resolution for Jet Airways under the bankruptcy code since only a conditional bid was received"".
The statement further said the move was necessitated as the prospective investor (a consortium of Etihad Airways and Hinduja group) wants some Sebi exemptions waiving the open offer requirement, which can be worked out better under the bankruptcy laws.
The decision of the lenders to seek bankruptcy comes exactly two months after the airline stopped flying on 17 April, after being on the fringe since last July.
Two operational creditors--Shaman Wheels and Gaggar Enterprises-- had already taken the airline to the NCLT on June 10, which will hear the pleas on 20 June. The airline owes  ₹8.74 crore to Shaman Wheels and  ₹53 lakh to Gaggar Enterprises.
As the cash crisis worsened and lenders refused any lifeline to the airline under promoter chairman Goyal, who was forced to give up control on March 25, when lenders had in principal agreed to infuse  ₹1,500 crore for equity.
But that never materialised, as bankers were chary of the fate of the February 12 circular of the RBI which was being heard at the Supreme Court. Finally on April 2, the apex court struck down the contentious circular, sealing the bank- led process to resolve the crisis at the airline.
With the March 25 resolution, Etihad's 24% stake was halved and it lost its board representation as well along with Goyal and his wife Anita.
Finally the airline was grounded on April 17, leaving over 23,000 employees unpaid for months in the lurch, and also sending airfares soaring by over 40 percent on average.
It can be noted that on 8 April through 12, bankers had put the airline on sale-offering 33 to 75% stake-of which the lenders own 51% now-to interested parties and received four preliminary bids and had planned to close the sale process by 30 May."
443,2019-06-18,State Bank,"Founder Goyal repeatedly upped his asking price and refused to give up control, effectively scuppering any hope of a revival for JetAround August last year, there were telltale signs of financial distress in the airline

When lenders of Jet Airways finally decided to refer the cash-strapped airline to the bankruptcy court on Monday, it capped months of intense negotiations during which the airline had come close to being revived on several occasions.
However, revival efforts floundered over the failure of stakeholders to agree on common terms even as the airline ran out of cash before grinding to a halt.
Around August last year, there were telltale signs of financial distress in the airline. In private, the top management had begun telling employees of an impending cash crunch that they said had left the airline with barely enough cash reserves to sustain operations for a few weeks.
In public, however, founder-promoter Naresh Goyal, who held sway over every aspect of the carrier’s operations, denied reports of a cash crunch, calling them propaganda by vested interests. Goyal, a veteran of many past crises, thwarted efforts by lenders to broker a solution based around Goyal giving up significant control.
Several people close to the discussions recounted that Goyal had several offers on the table and many a time, after showing interest, he would simply increase the asking price, making a deal virtually impossible.
“Jet Airways had received serious buyer interest in 2017 when several foreign carriers had shown interest in acquiring it, but Goyal wanted at least twice the prevailing market price,"" a senior banker who was involved in the discussions told Mint.
Things had changed dramatically in less than a year for Jet. It posted a loss of  ₹636.45 crore in the year ended 31 March 2018 and had a gross debt of  ₹8,425 crore. At the same time, India’s largest airline IndiGo, run by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, posted a net profit of  ₹2,242.37 crore. “The lenders sensing the gravity began reaching out to potential suitors, who included the Tata, Adani and a few other business groups,"" said a second person, also a banker. “But the Tatas, wary of Goyal’s continued presence in the airline, made his exit a precondition to which the banks were agreeable. However, things changed when the Tata group began the due diligence process, which threw up potential conflict of interests among stakeholders,"" the second person said.
The Tatas opted out but said they may come back if Jet were to file for bankruptcy in the future, as it would grant them indemnity from any legal troubles.
With Tata’s exit, the focus shifted back to Jet’s existing shareholders Etihad Airways and Naresh Goyal. In January, local lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd, led by State Bank of India (SBI), proposed a $900 million resolution plan, comprising a fresh equity infusion and restructuring of $450 million of its loans.
The turnaround plan, if approved by all stakeholders, would have triggered a change in Jet Airways’ shareholding, with chairman Goyal’s stake falling below the current 51%. However, once again, neither Goyal nor Etihad were willing to make firm commitments.
Etihad had invested in Jet Airways in 2014 but had never got around working smoothly with Goyal. “Like Tata, Etihad too wanted Goyal out and initially offered to provide guarantees for any additional borrowing by Jet, which was by then already in the ICU gasping for breath,"" said a third person aware of the matter.
However, Etihad dithered on the offer and the promised guarantees never came, leaving the lenders to look for another buyer for the airline through a competitive bidding process. The bidding process received initial interest from some well-known names such as private equity funds TPG Capital and Indigo Partners, but there was no final offer. Etihad which, too, placed a non-binding bid aimed at retaining its stake at the existing 24% made it contingent on the lenders finding an Indian partner for the airline. The lenders finally found some success when the Hinduja group agreed to look at a potential investment.
“The Hinduja brothers, especially Ashok Hinduja, had been on excellent terms with the ruling monarchy in UAE, where it has significant business interests. It seemed like a workable plan,"" said the first person mentioned above. “Etihad would have invested to retain its 24%, while National Infrastructure Investment Fund (NIIF) in which the UAE government is a shareholder would have bought a 20% stake. The remaining investment was to come from the Hindujas. The talks were progressing well and the group had begun talking to international lenders to raise funds for the investment,"" the first person said.
However, finally it turned out to be a risky proposition for the Hindujas, too, and the group walked away leaving Jet’s lenders to their own devices."
441,2019-06-18,State Bank,"Domestic investors in mid-and small-cap stocks pumped  ₹27 billion into the nation’s equities last monthHDFC Securities has joined a growing chorus to invest in smaller stocks after their share prices declined

A year ago, India’s third-largest brokerage advised investors to load up on shares of the nation’s biggest companies. Now, it’s telling them to shift holdings to mid- and small-sized counterparts after a steep decline made the stocks cheaper.
“Mid- and small-cap indexes have slumped from their peak in January 2018 and, because of the time and price correction, there’s an opportunity in these stocks,"" Dhiraj Relli, chief executive officer at HDFC Securities Ltd., said in an interview at his office in Mumbai. “There’s limited prospects in large-caps as they are quoting at all-time high valuations.""
The brokerage has joined a growing chorus to invest in smaller stocks after their share prices declined, citing the prospect of a rebound triggered by expectations of better earnings growth. Since Relli gave his previous advise about a year ago, the NSE Nifty 50 Index has gained about 8%, a measure of mid-sized companies fell more than 7% and that of small-cap shares slumped 19%.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election with an even bigger majority last month has spurred hopes that the new government will take steps to boost economic growth and increase spending on infrastructure, while giving more cash to consumers to help bolster demand. Lower borrowing costs, a reduced oil price and slowing inflation have also improved the earnings outlook for Indian companies.
“If we get a ‘high teens’ kind of earning growth, there will be a huge catch-up for mid- and small-caps,"" Relli said. He sees individual investors continuing to pump more money into stocks as returns on equities are still seen beating other assets, such as property and gold.
Domestic investors in mid- and small-cap stocks pumped  ₹27 billion ($387 million) -- about half the total inflows from funds -- into the nation’s equities last month, data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India show. Local funds are the largest investors in shares of India’s smaller companies as their foreign counterparts stick with larger stocks due to risk concerns.
HDFC Securities’s shift in strategy was prompted by the Nifty MidCap 100 Index’s more than 20% tumble from a January 2018 record and a more than 35% slide in the Nifty SmallCap 100 Index as the Nifty 50 climbed by nearly 9%, Relli said. The brokerage advises selectively buying stocks of smaller companies with good governance, stronger earnings outlook, and those that are gaining market share.
“Investors need to do enough due diligence and take reasonable care to enter and book profits at or near the right times,"" Relli said. HDFC Securities had more than 650,000 trading accounts out of the nearly 9 million total active profiles in India as on May 31, according to data provided by the National Stock Exchange of India.

MUMBAI :
Shares of Jet Airways (India) Ltd crashed nearly 53% during the day before closing 41% lower at  ₹40.45 apiece on Tuesday a day after lenders decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings against the debt-laden airline. This is Jet Airways’ steepest-ever single-day fall as the consortium of lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) chose to refer the carrier to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
In the year so far, the stock has plunged more than 85%, including more than 72% in June alone. Shares of rivals meanwhile gained investor confidence as Jet Airways struggled to find a buyer, finally leading to its suspension of flights on 17 April.
SpiceJet Ltd rose 53.5% while InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs IndiGo, jumped nearly 43% so far in 2019.
With Tuesday’s purge, shares of Jet Airways have fallen more than 96% from its initial public offering price of  ₹1,100 on 14 March 2005. On 26 April 2005, the stock touched an all-time high in intraday of  ₹1,379 a share and has since then dropped 88.1%.
Stock exchanges will impose restrictions on trading in Jet Airways shares from 28 June as part of preventive surveillance measures to curb excessive volatility, according to a circular issued last week.
The NSE said in a circular last week that shares of Jet Airways would be shifted from “Rolling Segment to Trade for Trade Segment, wherein the settlement in the scrip will take place on gross basis with 100% upfront margin and 5% price band"". There are trading restrictions in shares under Trade for Trade Segment.

MUMBAI :
Lenders to Jet Airways (India) Ltd have named Ashish Chhawchharia of Grant Thornton India as the resolution professional (RP) for the airline’s bankruptcy proceedings, three people aware of the matter said. Law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas will represent the interests of the lenders’ consortium.
The consortium led by State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday decided to start insolvency proceedings against the debt-laden airline which last flew on 17 April.
Chhawchharia is partner and head of restructuring services at Grant Thornton, according to his LinkedIn profile, which also states that he is an Insolvency Professional registered with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI).
Spokespersons at Grant Thornton and Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas declined to comment.
The case will be heard by the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for the first time on Wednesday.
“The petition for insolvency was filed on Tuesday morning and would be mentioned for an early hearing on Wednesday,"" said the first of the three persons cited above, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. Grant Thornton will assist the RP in finding a prospective buyer for Jet Airways and recover dues for the lenders, this person added.
Last week, two operational creditors of the airline—Shaman Wheels Pvt. Ltd and Gaggar Enterprises Pvt. Ltd—filed separate insolvency pleas against Jet Airways to recover their dues. The NCLT is expected to hear their pleas next week.
Meanwhile, Jet Airways pilots’ union National Aviator’s Guild also plans to file an insolvency plea for non-payment of salaries and for not providing for gratuity.
“The airline (Jet Airways) currently has no assets and operations to speak of, so finding a buyer is a tall task. And if a buyer comes in, he will demand a huge haircut. The only assured asset that can fetch some money is the brand, but this may not fetch huge value,"" said the second person cited above.
“There are a couple of foreign airlines we are looking at who could potentially revive the airline, but for now, it appears to be a tall task,"" said this person, who is directly involved in the matter.
A senior official at a public sector bank involved in the discussions, said about two parties have shown interest in bidding once the company is in the bankruptcy court.
“These parties haven’t given us any assurances yet,"" the senior banker said without elaborating.
Meanwhile, two independent directors of Jet Airways—former bureaucrat Ashok Chawla and Sharad Sharma—resigned from their positions on Tuesday as the airline’s board is non-compliant with provisions of the Companies Act and as the bank-led resolution plan is not moving forward.
Lenders led by SBI have been trying to resolve the insolvency crisis at Jet outside the NCLT due to fear of little or no recovery.
With the company in NCLT, the lenders face the possibility of recovering a fraction of their dues worth  ₹8,400 crore. Jet’s total liabilities, including unpaid salaries and vendor dues, are nearly  ₹15,000 crore. The carrier grounded flights in April due to a severe cash crunch.
“I feel sad and deeply distressed mainly for our loyal employees who have waited months and were anxiously and hopefully awaiting a positive outcome to the Bank Led Resolution Plan,"" the airline’s founder Naresh Goyal said in a statement on Tuesday.
“I can only hope and pray that even now, a solution can emerge and Jet can fly and fulfil the needs not only of employees but of air travellers who feel the absence of the Joy of Flying,"" Goyal added.

437,2019-06-19,State Bank,"'It’s time to take some money out of equities because valuations are looking stretched,' Gopikrishna Shenoy, SBI Life InsuranceSBI Life expects earnings at India’s top 50 companies to rise as much as an average of 14% in FY20

After a rally of about 10% in Indian stocks over the past year, the nation’s second-biggest life insurer has one message for investors: it’s time to take some profit.
“It’s time to take some money out of equities because valuations are looking stretched,"" Gopikrishna Shenoy, chief investment officer at SBI Life Insurance Co., which has most of its equity assets in larger stocks, said in an interview at his office in Mumbai. “There’s no immediate indicator of a return to sound earnings growth and it will take some time,"" he said.
Uncertainty about the poll outcome that culminated in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s re-election last month prompted investors to shift into shares of top Indian companies over the past 18 months from their smaller counterparts. During the period, the key S&P BSE Sensex and NSE Nifty 50 indexes rose at least 12%, while the NSE measure of mid-sized companies fell by 15% and a small-cap gauge plunged 29%.
As the euphoria generated by Modi’s re-election settles down, investors are turning their attention to how the new government plans to bolster a slowing economy and curb a cash crunch that has led to some companies delaying or defaulting on interest payments.
Shenoy, who oversees nearly 1.4 trillion rupees ($20 billion) of assets -- of which 23% is in equities, has reduced his shareholdings in top automakers, cement producers and consumer-staples companies. The life insurer also sold some shares in software exporters, barring the top two.
Still, he’s looking to reinvest the cash back into equities. Even as SBI Life continues to remain upbeat on banking stocks, it plans to buy into any dip in consumer and automobile stocks, mainly those of utility vehicles and motorbike makers, as it sees a recovery in demand from this year’s last quarter.
SBI Life expects earnings at India’s top 50 companies to rise as much as an average of 14% in the financial year that started April 1, boosted mainly by banks as they’re expected to set aside fewer provision for bad debts as non-performing loans fall.
The insurance firm has reduced its holding in shares of mid-sized companies in its equity funds to 9% from about 22% in 2017 and doesn’t see any immediate reason to change the balance. “We see a lot of value in mid-caps, but we won’t make a major shift to them, at least for the time being,"" Shenoy said.
SBI Life held 2.1% of India’s total 331 million life insurance policies as of March 31, 2018, according to the latest data on the insurance regulator’s website, second only to state-owned behemoth Life Insurance Corp. of India’s nearly 88% share.

Private sector lender Axis Bank has revised fixed deposit (FD) interest rates on select maturities with effect from 15 June 2019. Axis Bank has lowered the FD interest rates applicable on the maturity periods of two years to less than three years, according to the bank's website, axisbank.com. The bank is offering an interest rate of 7.3% now. Previously, the bank paid an interest rate of 7.5% to general public on fixed deposits below  ₹2 crore for maturity periods between 2 years to less than 3 years. This comes after SBI and ICICI Bank cut its deposit rates in select buckets. The move by lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank come within days of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this month.
Axis Bank is offering an interest rate of 6.25% on FDs with maturity between 7 days and 6 months, 6.75% for FDs maturing between 6 and 9 months and 7.1% for between 9 months and 1 year. Axis Bank is offering 7.3% for fixed deposits maturing in one and two years.

For FDs with maturity between five years and 10 years, Axis Bank offers an interest rate of 7%.
Largest private sector lender HDFC Bank also seems to have done a review of its deposit rates and the revised rates are applicable from 12 June 2019, according to the lender's website. The bank offers fixed deposit maturities ranging from seven days to 10 years. It offers interest rates in the range of 3.5% to 7.5% for the general public.

State Bank of India (SBI) also tweaked interest rate on some select maturities, with effect from 9 May 2019. On deposits which are 1 year to less than 2 year, the rate of interest has been increased from 6.8% to 7%, according to the SBI website. But across many other maturities SBI has lowered interest rates.

435,2019-06-19,State Bank,"The shadow lenders have a record  ₹1.1 trillion of local-currency bonds due next quarter'It will take at least a year for the crisis to settle down,' says Gopikrishna Shenoy of SBI Life Insurance

Facing a record amount of debt that’s about to mature, India’s non-bank financing companies are finding their troubles worsening as a crisis of credibility starts to bite.
The shadow lenders, which have been under increased strain after the collapse of IL&FS Group last year, have a record  ₹1.1 trillion ($15.8 billion) of local-currency bonds due next quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Refinancing the obligations poses a challenge as investor concerns flare amid mounting problems such as auditors quitting, repayment problems and allegations of embezzlement.
“The refinancing risk is becoming bigger for those NBFCs with a larger quantum of repayments coming due,"" said Rajat Bahl, chief analytical officer at Brickwork Ratings in Mumbai. “The only options for them are the selldown of loan portfolios, securitization and zero-to-no growth in new loan disbursements.""
A financing crunch may hurt India’s economic growth that the non-bank financing companies have helped underpin by providing financing for smaller businesses including restaurant owners, rickshaw drivers and merchants. Such lending, which traditional banks may have avoided, has essentially run on leverage -- the shadow lenders get money from banks or by issuing bonds, and use that for other types of financing.
India’s NBFCs also have more than one trillion rupees of bonds to refinance in both the first and second quarters of 2020, the data show. Maturities will climb to about 3.9 trillion rupees in 2020, an all-time high.
Lenders led by Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. and tycoon Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Capital Ltd. are seeking to accelerate asset sales including subsidiaries to meet rising debt commitments. The resignation of one of Reliance Capital’s auditors, delayed payments by Dewan this month and allegations against Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. are hurting an already rough credit environment.
It will take at least a year for the crisis to settle down, and lending to NBFCs will only return if liquidity issues at some companies are resolved, said Gopikrishna Shenoy, who oversees $20 billion as chief investment officer at SBI Life Insurance Co., one of India’s largest private life insurers.
“The larger NBFCs are going to banks for fundraising and crowding out the smaller ones, which have very limited choices to raise money,"" Brickwork’s Bahl said.

The insolvency process will allow lenders led by State Bank of India to sell the company as a whole or sell its assets and bring to an end weeks of uncertainty over the airline's future.
NCLT instructed Interim Resolution Professional (IRP) to finish insolvency process for the airline in three months since matter is of national importannce.

MUMBAI :
State-run SBI on on Friday said Etihad Airways had sought waiver of open offer and assurance of flying slots for take over of Jet Airways, but the lenders to the debt-ridden carrier had no authority to accommodate the relaxations sought.
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar had Thursday defended the lenders' decision to take Jet Airways for bankruptcy saying ""it was their last effort to find a resolution"" for the grounded airline and also did not rule out the possibility of liquidation.
Earlier this week, SBI-led consortium of 26 lenders had decided to seek resolution under IBC as they had received only a conditional bid.
In a filing to stock exchanges Friday, SBI said financial position of Jet Airways (lndia) Limited (JAL) being weak, lenders were continuously trying for viable resolution for last one year on account of operational losses.
ln this regard, it added reputed consultants -- SBICAPS, McKinsey -- were roped in as process advisors/advisors. lt was also decided to initiate a bidding process to bring in new investors, SBI said.
As part of the bid process, Expression of lnterest (Eol) for investment in Jet Airways was sought from interested participants. Etihad, NIIF, TPG Capital and Indigo Partners had expressed their interest on April 10,2019. The bidding process closed on May 10, 2019.
Subsequent to the closure of the bidding, as no binding bids were received, discussions were held with Etihad (EY) and other prospective investors to find a way for infusion of funds, it said.
""EY had sought certain relaxations viz. waiver of open offer, assurance of flying slots etc. As the lenders did not have any authority to accommodate some of the relaxations sought by EY, it was not considered feasible to negotiate on the conditions laid by EY,"" the SBI told exchanges.
It further said that since a sustainable resolution plan could not be devised and two operational creditors have already approached NCLT, ""the member banks agreed in-principle, to approach NCLT, pursuant to the statutory right available to them"" under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
Accordingly, an application for Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) was filed with NCLT, Mumbai on June 17, it said.
""That bank is only a lender to Jet Airways (India) Ltd and is not involved in or responsible for the management of the affairs of the said company.
""It is the responsibility of Jet Airways (lndia) Ltd being the listed entity to disclose required information under Regulation 30 of SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,"" SBI said.
The state-own bank also said that initiation of instant lnsolvency proceedings is just a step for Resolution/Recovery under the statutory right available to the Lenders.
Jet Airways, which was grounded on April 17, owes more than  ₹8,500 crore to a consortium of banks led by State Bank o, which now run the airline, while it has a much larger debt pile by way of accumulated losses to the tune of  ₹13,000 crore and vendor dues of over  ₹10,000 crore and salary dues of over  ₹3,000 crore."

Singapore: The State Bank of India is planning to expand its market in Singapore by enhancing its relationship across small and medium enterprises (SMEs) some of which have strong footholds across Asia Pacific.
Acknowledging the stiff competition from Financial Technology (FinTech) companies, the SBI is also contemplating introducing its YONO SBI app while having opened remittance services to all bank accounts through eRemit and remittance kiosk channels in the city state.
""We are working on extending credit to Singapore-based SMEs, supporting their businesses both locally and regionally,"" said SBI Country Head Kishore Kumar Poludasu, who recently took charge of the bank in a marketplace with global trading and financial links.
Singapore SMEs accounts for 65% of employment and contributed SGD 196.8 billion or 49 per cent to the economy in 2017, according to the Department of Statistics here.
""We see the potential of further expanding our services to SMEs,"" added Poludasu, anticipating SBI's growth in line with Singapore's expansion as an Asian financial hub.
The SBI has served the Singapore retail and corporate sectors as a qualified full bank since 2008.
It has six branches and offering ATM services under ATM5 network across the island state and two remittance centers, especially serving the large pool of Indian workers at dormitories in the industrial sectors.

Singapore regulatory clearance will be sought to introduce YONO, he added.
During his visit to Singapore on May 31, 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched three Indian apps - BHIM, Rupay and SBI app - at a 'Business, Innovation and Community Event'.
RuPay digital payments system is linked up with Singapore's Network for Electronic Transfers (NETS), allowing both to be used for payments in the two countries.
""Disruptive technologies are fast changing the marketing of services across the globe. We in the banking sectors are working hard on innovations and maintain a lead in applying these technologies across our network of global businesses,"" stressed Poludasu.
The SBI has also opened its ATMs for remittances for account holders.
""This makes it easy for industrial workers here to transmit money back home quickly through our ATM located at strategic points,"" he said.
Poludasu underlined the importance of remittances, which, according to the World Bank, was India's top earnings at USD 80 billion in 2018 from the global Indian diaspora.
Poludasu said the SBI has served the Singapore businesses community steadily over 42 years, having started as an offshore bank in 1977.
""We are serving the credit needs of Indian businesses and will continue to do so, but we are also scaling up our services with non-Indian businesses,"" he said. PTI GS AQS"

The charges you pay for using Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) may change soon. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 11 June constituted a six-member committee to review the ATM interchange fee structure. Currently, the State Bank of India (SBI) offers eight free transactions to regular savings bank account holders, including five transactions at SBI ATMs and three at other bank ATMs. In non-metros, such account holders get 10 free transactions, including five at SBI ATMs and five at others. Thereafter, it charges  ₹20 plus GST per financial transaction and  ₹8 plus GST for non-financial transaction as mentioned on the bank's website. The bank currently allows unlimited free transactions at State Bank of India Group (SBG) ATMs to its customers who have maintained an average balance above  ₹25,000 in their savings bank account in the previous month.
Normally, all major banks allow a certain number of free transactions at their own ATMs every month but for transactions at ATMs of other banks, there is a certain limit. If the transactions exceed the limit then the banks charge a fee which might vary from bank to bank.
RBI took the decision to set up the committee in view of the growing demands to change the ATM structure and fee. This fee structure determines the charges you pay for using your ATM card at the ATMs of banks other than the issuing bank.
""Usage of Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) by the public has been growing significantly. There have, however, been persistent demands to change the ATM charges and fees. In order to address these, it has been decided to set up a Committee involving all stakeholders, under the chairmanship of the Chief Executive Officer, Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), to examine the entire gamut of ATM charges and fees,"" RBI said in a press statement.
There are about 2 lakh ATMs in the country. At end-April, there were about 88.47 crore debit cards and 4.8 crore credit cards. As per the latest RBI data, 80.9 crore transactions were done through debit cards on ATMs during April.
In order to promote digital transactions, RBI in its monetary policy review also abolished charges for NEFT and RTGS money transfer systems."

After the Supreme Court quashed RBI's guidelines on stressed assets, released in February 2018, the central bank on June 7 came out with revised norms which gave more room to lenders for resolution of bad loans.
DHFL earlier this week said it has defaulted on 60% of  ₹375-crore commercial papers due for repayments on June 25, while the rest of the payment has been made.

After announcing its decision to waive all charges on fund transfer through RTGS and NEFT systems from 1 July, the Reserve Bank of India had also asked banks to pass on the benefits to customers from the same day.
The Real-time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system is meant for large-value instantaneous fund transfers, while the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system is used for fund transfers of up to  ₹2 lakh.
""With a view to push the digital transaction, the RBI has decided not to charge the RTGS and NEFT transactions. This would help banks reduce the fees from customers for these transactions,"" Indian Banks' Association chairman Sunil Mehta said in IBA's newsletter.
The country's largest bank SBI charges between Re 1 and  ₹5 for transactions through NEFT and between  ₹5 and  ₹50 for RTGS route.
To provide an impetus to digital funds movement, the central bank had decided to do away with the processing charges and time-varying charges levied on banks by the RBI for outward transactions through the RTGS, as also the processing charges for transactions processed in NEFT will be waived by the Reserve Bank of India.
Currently, the RBI ""levies minimum charges"" on banks for transactions routed through its RTGS and NEFT system.
Banks, in turn, levy charges on their customers.
The RBI has also constituted a high-level committee under IBA Chief Executive V G Kannan to examine ATM charges and fees by banks amid demands for reviewing the levies.
The use of automated teller machines (ATMs) has been growing significantly and there have been persistent demands to change ATM charges and fees."

Observing that arguments in the matter have already been completed, a three-member NCLAT bench headed by Chairman Justice S J Mukhopadhaya asked the lenders to inform it, if the NCLT does not pronounce its order within three weeks timeframe.
""In the facts and circumstances consideration of process of 15 companies has already been raised and argued. Taking into consideration the nature of the matter, we direct the Adjudicating Authority (NCLT), Mumbai Bench to pronounce its judgment on an early date preferably within three weeks...,"" said NCLAT.
The appellate tribunal further said that it appears that even on April 16, 2019, when the matter was listed, order has not been pronounced.
""If it is not pronounced within three weeks, the parties may bring this fact to the notice of this Appellate Tribunal,"" said NCLAT in its order on July 4.
The lenders informed the NCLAT that arguments have already been completed at the NCLT on January 25, 2019, and an order has been reserved and no judgement has been delivered till date.
According to them, the fate of 15 companies is not decided because no order has been passed in the case.

KRISHNA,
		             ANDHRA PRADESH :
A State Bank of India (SBI) cashier was arrested on Saturday from Vijayawada for allegedly swindling the account holders' money and gold amounting to  ₹80 lakh, police said.
According to the police,  ₹20.75 lakh in cash, 2,200 gram gold worth  ₹61 lakh and a car worth  ₹6 lakh were recovered from the possession of G Srinivas Rao, the cashier.
Rao, who works at Paritala branch of SBI, used to handle cash and gold transactions. He was so close to erstwhile branch manager, Yogita, that she let him keep keys of the bank locker which is against the norms, the police said.
According to rules, only the bank manager can keep the locker keys with them.
""Taking advantage of the situation, Rao stole  ₹19 lakh cash kept in the locker. He also stole three bags having gold kept in it from the locker. He stole a piece of gold kept as mortgage and took a loan on it with a fake name,"" Superintendent of Police Raveendra Baby said.
The accused used many other fraudulent ways to steal customers' money instead of depositing it in their name, the police said.
The matter came to light when a new branch manager who took charge found  ₹19 lakh cash missing from the locker.
G Omprakash, the new manager, lodged a complaint with the police. During the course of the inquiry, the crime was exposed.

MUMBAI :
Going public with his anguish and disappointment over secured creditors' rights not being enforced, State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday said lenders will soon be moving the Supreme Court against NCLAT awarding higher payout to Essar Steel's operational creditors and treating them on par with secured lenders.
While approving ArcelorMittal's  ₹42,000-crore bid for the bankrupt flagship company of the Ruias-led Essar Group, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had last Thursday gave operational creditors equal status as the secured lenders.
The appellate tribunal said secured creditors will get only 60.7% of their  ₹49,473 crore claims and the rest will go to operational creditors, treating them at par with the financial creditors.
Drawing from the statutes, including the provisions in the Companies Act, Kumar pointed out that there is a distinction between secured and operational creditors, and that the former have a greater right on an asset at par with the employees of the crippled company.
""If secured creditors are given the same treatment as operational creditors, then it is a huge disincentive for secured creditors and an incentive for operational creditors,"" he told reporters after launching a book on HDFC Bank.
He warned that with this ruling, bankers will be hesitant to use the IBC provisions for resolving bad asset till such a time that the principles of the law are clearly laid out and hoped that the Supreme Court will clarify the same once they challenge the Essar Steel order by the NCLAT.
Kumar suggested that the lack of distinction between secured and operational creditors only aggravates the situation around resolution, pointing out that already, there is a lot of extra time taken for resolutions.
For instance Essar Steel resolution has crossed even 600 days, while the IBC mandates only 380 days and is set to delay further as both the bankers and the Ruias are set to challenge the NCLAT order.
""The effectiveness of IBC option is quick resolution,"" he said and exuded confidence that there will most likely be an amendment to the IBC law and asked everybody to be ""patient"" on the issue.
On inter-creditor agreements, which were to be signed by July 7--on completion of one-month period since the new NPA recognition rules came into effective--he said if all banks have signed the agreement, then it means that at least prima facie they are convinced that these assets can be resolved.
""Banks have not signed inter-creditor pacts in all cases, and wherever it is felt that it cannot be resolved and despite Essar Steel order, if banks still have felt NCLT is a better option, they have taken such accounts to NCLTs,"" the chairman added.
On the reports of a forensic audit finding Anil Ambani group companies indulging in frauds worth thousands of crores, Kumar limited himself to saying that the audits were ordered as part of a standard operating procedure for exposure of over  ₹50 crore.
He said once fraud has been detected, which becomes criminal act, the law of the land will take its own course.
""Fraud is a crime against the state. Lenders have no choice. Crime is not committed against lenders, it is committed against the state. Anything that falls under the criminal law, the law will take its own course,"" he said.
He maintained the same stance when asked about forensic audit on DHFL as well but declined to speak on specific accounts.
Kumar said State Bank has a 100% provision on Bhushan Steel, where a fraud has been found, which is as per RBI provisions.
The bank is yet to formulate a target for NBFC portfolio buys for this fiscal, he said, let the assets comes to come to the market first before deciding on any targets."
404,2019-07-10,State Bank,"SBI has reduced its MCLR by 5 bps across all tenors with one-year MCLR coming down from 8.45% to 8.40%, effective 10 JulyIf you have a home loan from a NBFC or a bank that charges a significant spread over MCLR, then you can look for a cheaper home loan

India’s largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) has reduced its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points (bps) across all tenors with one-year MCLR coming down from 8.45% to 8.40%, effective 10 July. One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. This is the third, though minor, reduction in MCLR by SBI in the current financial year.
This will benefit borrowers from SBI having MCLR-linked floating rate loans, like home loans. However, this might not reflect in savings for all home loan borrowers.
Gradual cut in MCLR
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has reduced the benchmark repo rate by 75 bps over the last three monetary policy reviews; in the same period, SBI has reduced its MCLR three times by 5 bps each. Other banks too have been reducing their MCLR only by 5-10 bps at one go.
RBI has constantly expressed concern over slower transmission of changes in interest rates to end customers by banks.
The reason for the slower transmission in rates is primarily faster growth in demand for credit (loans), while growth in deposits is comparatively slower. Banks use the deposits collected to give out loans. As growth in deposits is slow, banks are reluctant to sharply reduce deposit rates, which could further reduce growth in deposits. The interest that banks pay on deposits they collect is reflected in their cost of funds which in turn is reflected in MCLR. Hence, as deposit rates are not going down sharply, MCLR and MCLR-linked loans will also see slower transmission of reduced interest rates.
What should you do?
As a consumer, your interest rate does not change every time RBI changes the repo rate. Similarly, it does not change each time your bank revises its MCLR. Banks, typically, review MCLR every month and the change, if any, is announced.
For you, as a consumer, it makes a difference only if the date of revision in MCLR is closer to the date of your interest rate reset. For instance, if your loan agreement states that your rate will be reset once a year based on one-year MCLR, and your reset is scheduled in May, then the changes made to MCLR in July will not impact your loan and its interest rate until May next year. The change accumulated in MCLR over the period, positive or negative, will be reflected after the reset date.
Should you look for cheaper options? If you have a home loan from a non-banking finance company or a bank that charges a significant spread over MCLR, then you can look for a cheaper home loan, like the one from larger public sector banks like SBI. However, make sure that the switch effectively results in savings for you as a switch might involve documentation and processing charges that could negate your savings. It is important that you clearly understand the charges and make sure that the net gains that will accrue to you after the switch are higher than the switching charges.
Though even a minor change in effective rate will result in some savings over the loan repayment period, one way to ensure that the savings are worth the effort is to see if your net savings in the first year after switching the loan is higher than the costs that you pay for the switch. Financial advisers suggest that a difference of 50 bps or above in the effective interest rate usually makes the loan switch worthwhile"

India's largest bank, State Bank of India (SBI), has lowered its lending rates by 5 basis points (bps) across all tenors with effect from today (10 July 2019). With this, the one-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) now stands at 8.40 %. ""1 Year MCLR coming down from 8.45 per cent p.a. to 8.40 per cent p.a ,"" SBI said in a statement. With this MCLR cut, home, car and other retail loans will get cheaper. ""As a result, interest rates on all loans linked to MCLR stand reduced by 5 basis points with effect from July 10, 2019,"" the SBI said in a statement.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
This development comes a day after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das said he expected faster transmission of the three successive repo rate cuts.
This is the third rate cut in the current financial year. With Tuesday's MCLR cut, the reduction in the home loan rates since 10 April 2019 is 20 basis points, noted SBI.
From 1 July, the bank had also introduced repo rate-linked home loan products. So far, all new floating rate home loans were linked to marginal cost of fund based lending rate (MCLR) since August 2016. You will see a direct impact whenever the repo rate changes in case of repo rate-linked home loan.
After the 25 bps repo rate cut in RBI June policy, top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank revised rate of interest on fixed deposits, while Bank of Maharashtra, Corporation Bank, Oriental Bank and IDBI Bank had reduced their MCLR by 5-10 bps.

Explaining how HDFC Bank had refused loans to the ex- liquor barren Mallya, Puri said, ""a banker can have a coffee with any person and then do what he wants,"" stressing that it was his long time colleague Paresh Sukthankar who actually declined the loan to Mallya.
""If you are a bad risk, you are a bad risk. You can be my good friend, I can give you coffee and send you away. Just for your information, they (Mallya's officials) came to me for a loan and I gave them coffee and told them that I will consider the loan. And then Paresh turned it down,"" the HDFC Bank chief said, at function of launching a book on the bank by journalist writer Tamal Bandopadyay here this evening.
Every time the call came, Mallya used to abuse and his blood pressure would go up. So, friendship and banking is not co-related, he stressed.
Such clear thinking about lending and risk management has never disappointed the lender, whose stock command one the highest premia across global banks and has been known for having one of the lowest NPA ratios in the industry and consistently clocking over 20%  profit growth in the past 10 years and more.
For March 2019 quarter, the bank reported a 23% spike net income, while its gross NPAs came down to a paltry 1.36%, while the industry average is close 10 percent.

Mumbai: For the first time ever, you will get tax benefit for buying a car on loan. The government has decided to provide an additional income tax deduction of  ₹1.5 lakh on the interest paid on loans taken to purchase electric vehicles. A new section 80EEB has been proposed to provide for this deduction to individual taxpayers with respect to interest on loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle from any financial institution. Let’s take a look at how the math will work out for you:
About the tax benefit
Tax incentive on electric car loans is to spur investments in the segment. “It will encourage automobile companies to manufacture more electric vehicles as this additional tax deduction introduced may spur the demand for electric vehicles,"" said Rachit Chawla, founder and CEO, Finway. However it is a chicken-and egg situation. This amounts to a benefit of around  ₹2.5 lakh over the loan period to the taxpayers who take loans to purchase electric vehicle, notes the finance minister in the budget. “If there is no infrastructure, customers may not buy an electric vehicle. In the other way, manufacturers won’t make electric vehicles if there are no customers. Hence, it is a good enabling clause but it is still unclear who will benefit from this move. Due to lack of good infrastructure such as availability of charging points, the demand has been slow,"" said Suresh Sadagopan, founder, Ladder7 Financial Advisories.
The math
To get a sense of the cost and deduction, let’s take a look at a base model electric car. For Mahindra e2o plus P4 base model, the ex-showroom price for Mumbai is around  ₹7.46 lakh, according to cardekho.com.
If you take a loan on the entire amount, at an interest rate of 10.25% and take a loan tenure of five years, your EMI will be  ₹15,947 in which around  ₹9,500 will go towards principal and  ₹6,374 will go towards the interest payment, according to Bankbazaar.com’s car loan EMI calculator.
“This deduction is available for loans sanctioned by a financial institution (including a NBFC) during the period beginning on April 1, 2019 to March 31, 2023. It has also been provided that no deduction for such interest will be allowed for the same or any other assessment year. The proposed section will be effective from April 1, 2020 and will accordingly apply from AY 2020-21 onwards,"" said PwC in a note.

MUMBAI :
he Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Jet Airways (India) Ltd on Friday approved an interim funding of $10 million (about  ₹69 crore) for the airline, which will be used for the corporate insolvency resolution process, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
During the past two days, the airline’s CoC, led by the State Bank of India (SBI), also voted on other resolutions, including calling for bids for bankrupt Jet Airways’ asset sale and admission of claims by creditors.
“The CoC has today voted in favour of a $10 million interim debt infusion by bankers, which will help start the insolvency resolution process,"" said the first person.
“$10 million will be used to hire people on contracts to verify claims made by different creditors of the airline,"" said the second person.
Jet Airways was grounded on 18 April.
On 20 June, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted Jet Airways under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after lenders referred it to the bankruptcy tribunal.
“The CoC has also decided to allow bids (for Jet Airways) from investors with a minimum net worth of  ₹1,000 crore,"" the first person said, adding that advertisement seeking expressions of interest (EoI) will be published within a couple of days.
“The decision was taken so that frivolous bidders stay away from the process,"" the person added.
On 18 July, the resolution professional (RP) appointed by lenders said that the financial creditors who have the first right to proceeds from Jet Airways’ bankruptcy resolution, have claimed  ₹10,231 crore, while 2,400 operational creditors have claimed  ₹12,372 crore.
The RP of Jet Airways said out of the  ₹24,887 crore, it has admitted claims of  ₹8,462.79 crore from the financial creditors.
Claims of about  ₹15,044 crore are under verification, while those of  ₹1,380.82 crore were rejected.
The steep claims push the airline closer to liquidation.
A consortium of 26 bankers, led by the State Bank of India, had approached the tribunal to recover dues of over  ₹8,500 crore.
The lenders had been trying to sell the beleaguered airline as a going concern for the past five months.
The National Company Law Tribunal will hear the insolvency case and the progress report by the insolvency resolution professional on 23 July.

391,2019-07-20,State Bank,"If you are an existing home loan borrower, a cut of 5-10 bps on MCLR will not bring down your home loan interest rate immediatelyIf you are about to take a floating rate home loan, you are set to get relief. Banks have cut interest rate marginally

MUMBAI :
Recently, State Bank of India (SBI) cut its one-year marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points (bps) to 8.40%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. This month, banks including ICICI Bank Ltd, Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce, have cut their MCLR by 5-10 bps. The move comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rate for the third time in June. Here is what it means for you:
HOME LOAN RATES WILL NOT FALL IMMEDIATELY
If you are an existing home loan borrower, a cut of 5-10 bps on MCLR will not bring down your home loan interest rate immediately. If you have a floating rate home loan and your loan is linked your MCLR, you will have a reset clause linked to the tenure of the MCLR. For instance, if your loan is linked to one-year MCLR, you will have a one-year reset clause. Now, if the reset clause is in May and the MCLR cut happened in July, your home loan will not change till next May. If your loan has a reset clause of July or August, you will see a fall in your home loan rate. Also, your equated monthly instalment (EMI) will not go down as banks usually adjust the tenure of the loan instead of the EMI.
SOME RELIEF FOR NEW BORROWERS
If you are about to take a floating rate home loan, you are set to get relief. Banks have cut interest rate marginally. Considering that it is a falling interest rate environment, you will get a better interest rate than the last couple of months. However, it is difficult to predict whether you should wait and watch for another rate cut before taking a loan. New borrowers should instead compare home loan rates across financial institutions before taking a loan. Usually, home loans come with a spread on MCLR. Try opting for loans that are on MCLR without spread.
OPT FOR ALTERNATIVE FLOATING RATE OPTION
You now also have the option to go for loans linked to repo rate or other external benchmark rates instead of MCLR for floating rate loans. For instance, SBI this month launched a floating rate linked to the repo rate. The rate has a margin and a spread making it 10bps cheaper than MCLR. In these loans, your interest rate will fluctuate in case of any change in repo rate. In the case of MCLR, the impact of change in repo rate comes with a lag considering the banks also have to evaluate their cost of funds.
AVOID FIXED RATE HOME LOANS
In the current interest rate environment, you should avoid opting for fixed-rate loans. Fixed rate home loans are usually fixed for a certain duration of the loan. Considering that the interest rate is falling, it is possible that you may get locked into a higher interest rate for your home loan and getting out of it will be expensive since you have to pay a higher penalty to switch loans from fixed to floating."

388,2019-07-22,State Bank,"In the latest application this week, they are seeking full disclosure of the complex ownership structure of many of the assets they believe ultimately belong to MallyaAmong the assets in question include the Force India and Indian Empress superyacht – which was fitted with an Elton John piano

LONDON :
Two superyachts, a game reserve, numerous undeclared high-value and vintage cars, valuable paintings and a piano previously owned by Elton John are among the assets in contention as part of a latest legal claim by Indian banks against embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya in the UK High Court on Monday.
Justice Robin Knowles, presiding over the hearing in the Commercial Court division of the High Court, ruled that he was satisfied that a consortium of Indian banks led by SBI have a right to the documents they are seeking to establish the true ownership of the assets they believe are linked with the Mallya.
""I consider the test to be satisfied and I don't take that view lightly. I do take the view that without this disclosure the consequences are highly unsatisfactory for a judgment creditor [Indian banks] and from the vantage point of progressing towards a fair conclusion of the matter and a conclusion that is cost effective,"" said Judge Knowles in his ruling.
""Frankly, the answer needs to be known as to which assets are that of Dr Mallya, both for the purpose of the worldwide freezing order and enforcement of the judgment,"" he noted.
The consortium of PSU banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) have been pursuing the 63-year-old former Kingfisher Airlines boss in their attempt to recover some of the funds owed to them under a 1.145 billion pounds worldwide freezing order.
During Monday's hearing, they sought the disclosure of crucial documentation that would establish the true ownership structure of the VMDS Trust, named after Mallya's father Vittal Mallya (VM), in which Vijay Mallya claims he has no ""beneficial interest"".
""We, that is the courts in India and here [UK], are not being told the full story,"" barrister Nigel Tozzi told Justice Robin Knowles on behalf of the Indian banks.
He informed the court that TLT LLP, the law firm acting for the Indian banks, had asked continuing questions regarding who controls VMDS Trust after it emerged that most of the assets in contention are held by the Trust, which is associated with Mallya's family members.
""All roads lead to VMDS… But the attempts to get fundamental information is quite clearly being obstructed, which supports the assertion that Dr Mallya has a beneficial interest (in the Trust),"" said Tozzi, as he laid out the banks’ side of the arguments.
He told the court that the ""contradictory answers"" received by the banks in their queries to the true ownership of assets indicates that Mallya was trying to distance himself from an image of his own creation for the world of being a ""fabulously wealthy individual"".
The TLT LLP have applied for a series of orders in the wake of the worldwide freezing order dating back to May last year to track down and prevent the dissipation of assets by Mallya.
In the latest application this week, they are seeking full disclosure of the complex ownership structure of many of the assets they believe ultimately belong to Mallya.
Among the assets in question include the Force India and Indian Empress superyacht – which was fitted with an Elton John piano around 2015 after being reportedly acquired by Mallya at a charity auction.
A fleet of high-value cars acquired from the sale of a 1956 Porsche Spyder for 4.1 million pounds by a consultancy named TBL and some artwork from Mallya’s Ladywalk property in the English village of Tewin in Hertfordshire were also referenced during the latest hearing, alongside a game reserve in South Africa and properties in London and Hertfordshire, near London.
All of these have been claimed by Mallya to be owned by either members of his family or ultimately by the VMDS Trust, which he dissociates himself from – a factor which is contested by the banks.
To establish their case, the banks’ counsel referenced a series of declarations made by Mallya before the Supreme Court in India as well as information available in the public domain.
Qatar National Bank and Barclays Bank - linked with the mortgages associated with the superyachts - and Bonhams and RM Auctions Ltd - linked with some of the other assets in contention have expressed their willingness to share information to comply with any court order to be made in the case this week. However, they are seeking their legal costs in the matter as interested parties.
Force India Limited and Indian Empress Limited – which respectively claim ownership rights over the Force India and Indian Empress superyachts respectively – had challenged the disclosure of certain documents.
Tierra Blanca Ltd (TBL) also contested the demand for more documents from them as the claimed owners of the posh cars in question.
The opposing counsels in the case questioned the necessity and legality of the demand for the various documentation and branded it a ""fishing expedition"" by the banks to cast the net as wide as possible to get their hands on information.
Ultimately, the judge ruled that the Indian banks' case outweighed their assertions of confidentiality."
387,2019-07-23,State Bank,"Payments bank face a blanket ban on any type of lendingThe payments bank model was conceptualised by RBI

Mumbai: The future of payment banks is uncertain and while the business will expand and evolve in time, they would require regulatory and government support to achieve their objectives, said a report by State Bank of India (SBI).
The report said that recently, Aditya Birla Payments Bank (ABPB) announced shutting down its operations from 18 October, 2019 citing unanticipated developments in the business landscape that have made the economic model unviable. On 15 July, Vodafone m-Pesa had also shut shop.
The payments bank model was conceptualised by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on recommendation of the Nachiket Mor committee for furthering financial inclusion by providing small savings accounts and payments services to unorganised sector entities.
“However, it seems to have failed to achieve the stated objectives, as only 4-PBs are operational out of the 11 licensed players. In 1990s also, RBI had made an attempt to create Local Area Banks (LABs) that are currently facing a host of issues,"" the report said.
Payments bank face a blanket ban on any type of lending and are required to maintain a cash reserve ratio (CRR), statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) on the outside liability. Moreover, they cannot accept deposits higher than  ₹1 lakh.
It said that the payments bank model could still be a success - but only with the universal banks and telecom companies working together having strong infrastructure, deep pockets and network in place. Some of the suggestions to revive the banks, according to the SBI report, include arrangement with universal banks to automatically transfer funds in accounts exceeding  ₹1 lakh; access to Aadhaar-based KYC, as manual KYC is at least three times in terms of cost to e-KYC; RBI should allow payments banks to tie up with third-party services to cross sell products, as margins are small, so scale is very important.
“Though the business of payments banks is free from credit risk and face relatively lower market risk, but is subject to operational and liquidity risk. Perhaps an unintended consequence of a large SLR requirement is the implication of payments banks acting as a captive source of finance for the government,"" it said."
386,2019-07-24,State Bank,"Business growth continued to be strong for the insurer with total APE growing at a brisk pace of 67%The force behind HDFC Life's margin spike was the non participatory product

Mumbai: New product launch meant private life insurer HDFC Life had spectacular profitability and growth metrics for the June quarter.
The company trumped analysts’ estimates on value for new business margin (VNB), a key indicator of profitability. VNB for June quarter was 29.8%, sharply higher than 24.2% a year ago.
The non participatory product that HDFC Life had launched was the force behind this margin spike. Sale of non-participatory policies surged which nearly halved the share of market linked products to 26% in overall portfolio.
Unit linked insurance products or ULIPs are low margin business and also carry market risk. But they bring immediate growth during bull market times.
Non participatory products on the other hand carry balance sheet risks unless the life insurer is adequately hedged.
Therefore, it is obvious that the outlook on margins depend on the sustained success of this product. “Key to watch out for, is thus, how does this segment scale and effectiveness of relying on flows from shorter duration products to hedge re-investment risk,"" said Jefferies in a note.
The management said that ULIPs share will be far lower than it was in previous quarters. However, there is no guarantee that the overall product mix would change.
Ergo, analysts believe that margins have peaked. “HDFCL’s margins have peaked out for now, given a skewed product mix toward non-par savings (largely due to Sanchay plus sale) and should normalize to c. 27% in FY20E from 29.8% in Q1FY20,"" said analysts at Emkay Global in a note.
Business growth continued to be strong for the insurer with total annualised premium equivalent (APE) growing at a brisk pace of 67%.
Larger rival SBI Life Insurance Co also released its results which showed growth has surprised on the upside. The insurer’s APE grew at a robust 41% and given the size of the company, the double digit growth is impressive.
SBI Life’s portfolio continues to have a large share of ULIPs but its protection business has grown by leaps and bounds. The margin friendly protection business formed 14% of new business premium but is still just 4.4% of the total product mix.
Perhaps this explains why HDFC Life’s valuations are higher than the larger SBI Life.
While SBI Life’s strength lies in its access to the largest branch network of its parent State Bank of India, HDFC Life too has ramped up its distribution. In fact, online sales that typically result in better persistency ratios have been higher for HDFC Life.
Indians not only buy insurance online but also stick with their purchases.
Shares of both the life insurers have gained today but the key question is sustainability of these growth rates and margins."
385,2019-07-24,State Bank,"The liabilities and debt of the airline are over  ₹36,000 croreThe National Company Law of Tribunal (NCLT) adjourned the matter for 8 August

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India, the lead lender to the bankrupt Jet Airways, Wednesday moved an intervention application against mortgage lender HDFC's plea claiming rights over a portion of the airline's BKC property.
The National Company Law of Tribunal (NCLT) adjourned the matter for 8 August.
On July 4, the mortgage lender HDFC had moved the NCLT seeking to keep the airline's BKC property out of the bankruptcy process saying three floors of the BKC property are mortgaged with it as collateral for over  ₹400 crore loan.
Meanwhile, the tribunal approved Ashish Chhawchharia of Grant Thornton as the resolution professional for Jet Airways which stopped flying since April 17.
Chhawchharia, who got 81% votes of the committee of creditors, was the interim RP since June 20, when the airline was admitted for insolvency.
The liabilities and debt of the airline are over  ₹36,000 crore.
On July 18, the RP had said he received claims worth  ₹24,887 crore in 16,643 claims, including  ₹8,462 crore by financial creditors, against the company as of July 4.
Significantly, he rejected a claim of  ₹229 crore from JetAir, the privately held company of founder Naresh Goyal, which was the general sales agent of Jet Airways and the holding company the Goyals's stake in the airline.
The lenders, who control 50%ownership of the airline, after failing to get a buyer, was forced to sent it for bankruptcy on June 17, and on the 20th of the month the Mumbai NCLT admitted the plea.
Last Saturday, the lenders in renewed bid to sell the remaining assets invited expression of interest from interested parties with a deadline of August 3.
Financial creditors, who also include banks, have made 37 claims worth  ₹10,231 crore as of July 4, he said. The list of financial creditors, whose claims have been admitted include 14 domestic banks and financial institutions, 12 foreign banks and eight lessors, the RP said.
State Bank has made a claim of  ₹1,644 crore, including cash credit inclusive of interest, term loans and bank guarantees issued but not invoked, it said, adding its claims worth  ₹19 crore were rejected. Private sector lender Yes Bank has claimed  ₹1,084 crore, followed by PNB's  ₹963 crore and IDBI Bank's  ₹594 crore.
Operational creditors excluding workmen and employees have made a claim of  ₹12,372 crore, with the entire amount being under verification, while the workmen and employees have made a claim of  ₹443 crore which is also under verification, Chhawchharia said.
Apart from this, authorised representatives of workmen and employees have made 11,965 claims of  ₹735 crore, he said, adding other creditors, including other financial creditors and operational creditors, have made 121 claims amounting to  ₹1,105 crore."

Chennai: Opposition parties, including DMK, on Wednesday came out against lower cut-off mark for economically weaker sections (EWS) than BCs and SC/STs in a recent SBI recruitment examination and demanded repeal of the new quota, alleging it went against social justice.
DMK president M K Stalin said the cut-off mark for the posts of junior associates in the State Bank of India was 61.25 for Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes and 53.75 for Scheduled Tribes out of 100 marks whereas the qualifying mark for EWS was only 28.5.
The SBI has conducted the preliminary exam for over 8,500 posts of junior associates in the clerical cadre.
The lower cut off mark EWS quota 'exposed' the BJP-led Centre burying social justice through the new quota regime, Stalin alleged in a Facebook post.
He demanded that the Centre scrap the 10 per cent EWS quota, alleging it shattered the social justice ecosystem and further eroded job opportunities for BCs and SC/STs in the services to Central government and public sector enterprises.
DMK's ideological fountainhead Dravidar Kazhagam's chief K Veeramani said his outfit had warned introducing economic criterion in reservations would break up the very foundations of social justice and ""this has now been proved."" He wanted the MPs from the state to raise the demand for repealing the quota in Parliament.
CPI State Secretary R Mutharasan said the bank exam results were 'shocking' and has proven that the new EWS quota would bury social justice and blunt the very meaning of reservations.
Demanding scrapping of the 10 percent quota, he wanted all democratic forces to work for safeguarding social justice and throw out the Centre's ""injustice against social justice, (the EWS quota)."" CPI(M) State Secretary K Balakrishnan claimed the cut-off mark structure was ""pure injustice,"" and added the qualifying score for EWS aspirants should have been fixed more than that of those belonging to OBCs, SCs and STs.
Condemning the bank for fixing such a cut-off structure, the Marxist party leader urged the Centre to immediately undo the ""partiality."" PMK leader Anbumani Ramadoss said aspirants under the EWS category, though had scored pretty less than SC/ST candidates, have now qualified for the main examinations.
""The opportunities of backward classes, SCs and STs have been usurped and passed on to poor in the forward castes. What can be a more brutal form of social injustice,"" he asked and demanded withdrawal of EWS quota.

Mumbai: American private equity major KKR has sold one-third of the shares it held in life insurance company SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd through a block deal on the market, data from stock exchanges shows.

Before the sale KKR held a total of 19.5 million shares in the company, representing a 1.95% stake in the life insurer.
The PE firm had acquired the SBI Life stake in December 2016, when it, along with Singapore state-owned investor Temasek bought 19.5 million shares each in the insurance company from its promoter State Bank of India for a total of  ₹1,800 crore.
KKR and Temasek had bought the shares at a price of  ₹460 per share. The stake sale to these investors was a precursor to the initial public offering of the company.
In September 2017, SBI Life went public in an IPO that saw its promoters SBI and BNP Paribas Cardif sell shares worth  ₹8,400 crore. Shares of the company were sold in the IPO at a price of  ₹700 per share."

Country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) has revised their export related service charges. This has been done to improve the ease of doing business and provide clear visibility of cost structure to exporters. While revising the charges, SBI has taken into consideration the views from various export promotion councils.
The revised service charges will be payable upfront once in a year as against existing practice of collecting multiple charges for every transaction. This will result in bringing about operational conveniences to the exporters. 
SBI expects that the revised charges will help the exporter community at large and will help in improving the exports. The revised charges are effective from 1 September 2019.
SBI is also the largest mortgage lender in the country. As on 31 March 2019, the bank has a deposit base of over  ₹29 lakh crore with CASA ratio of 45.74% and advances of over  ₹22 lakh crore.

MUMBAI :
Diversion of funds is a big concern for banks and 83 oversight agencies have been empanelled to continuously monitor end-use of bank loans, said Rajnish Kumar, chairman, State Bank of India (SBI).
“So, hiring oversight agencies is one of the things being done. Even the methods of lending will have to undergo change. The consortium discipline or the multiple banking discipline has to be improved and, there, the regulator also has to play a role,"" said Kumar.
He added that there have been instances, wherein an individual borrows from one bank, while having a current account in another bank that is used to divert funds.
Kumar was speaking at the launch of Sahamati, an umbrella organization for account aggregators, a new class of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs).
The aggregators would act as intermediaries between financial information users and financial information providers after getting a digital consent from the consumer. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has already granted in-principle approval to seven such aggregators.
Speaking on problems of non-banks, Kumar said entity-level difficulties and resolutions will have to be dealt with.
At the sectoral level, he said there was enough liquidity in the system, as the Reserve Bank announced measures immediately after the budget to improve liquidity for the NBFC sector.
“So, at entity level, if there is an issue, it cannot be resolved by any measure at the macro level,"" he said.
On credit growth, Kumar said the second half of every financial year is busy, and the first half is always the easy season.
“If you look at year-on-year growth, we are seeing growth of 13%. Hopefully, if this trend continues and it remains 13% in the second half, we will be very happy. We will know only in the second half of how much credit is coming,"" said Kumar."

New Delhi: Fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the confiscation of properties owned by him and his relatives.
In his plea Mallya has said that he wanted attachment of only those properties related to Kingfisher Airlines facing cases of alleged irregularities.
The matter is listed for hearing on July 29 before the apex court.
A consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) had in 2016 filed a petition in the Supreme Court against Mallya for his failure to repay the loan amount of more than  ₹8000 crore to various banks.
Mallya had allegedly failed to pay dues to more than 15 banks.
The liquor tycoon had taken loans in order to pay dues of his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.
The consortium of banks had urged the court to direct Mallya to return to India and repay the loan.
On 11 July, the Bombay High Court had dismissed Mallya's plea seeking stay on the procedure for the confiscation of his properties by government agencies.
Mallya had fled India in March 2016 and has been living in the United Kingdom since then.

MUMBAI :
India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday said it will reduce interest rates on retail fixed deposits with longer tenors by up to 20 basis points (bps) and on bulk deposits by 35 bps, with effect from 1 August.
For shorter tenors of up to 179 days, the public sector bank said it will slash deposit rates by 50-75 bps.
“In view of the falling interest rate scenario and surplus liquidity, (SBI) realigns its interest rate on retail term deposits (less than  ₹2 crore) and bulk term deposits ( ₹2 crore and above) from 1 August. For term deposits with longer tenors, there is a reduction upto 20 bps in the retail segment and 35 bps in the bulk segment. Interest rates have been slashed by 50-75 bps for time deposits with shorter tenors, up to 179 days,"" the bank said in a statement.
In May, the bank had hiked interest rates on term deposits below  ₹2 crore, between 1 year and less than 2 years, from 6.8% to 7%, according to SBI website. But across many other maturities SBI had lowered interest rates.
On fixed deposits, maturing between 2 years and less than 3 years, SBI had cut interest rate from 6.8 % to 6.75%. On deposits between 3 years and less than 5 years, the rate of interest was decreased marginally from 6.8% to 6.7%.
Meanwhile, the bank linked its savings deposits above  ₹1 lakh and short-term loans like overdraft with RBI’s repo rate to improve interest rate transmission for consumers."
374,2019-07-30,State Bank,"While it is known that several Indian banks have broadly tightened lending to the auto sector, specifics have not been disclosedMonthly passenger vehicle sales in June fell by the biggest margin in 18 years

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India (SBI) has tightened lending terms dramatically for auto dealerships, according to a source and an internal memo seen by Reuters, seeking to reduce its exposure to risk from a sector in the midst of a sharp downturn.
The shadow banking crisis that began to unfold in India during mid-2018 has deepened this year. The liquidity crunch in non-bank financing, higher insurance costs and rises in taxation have served to increase the pressure on the car sector, with monthly auto sales falling by 17-20% since April.
Monthly passenger vehicle sales in June fell by the biggest margin in 18 years.
In one internal memo for financing dealers selling vehicles made by Hyundai Motor Co's India unit, SBI said it is revising the lending terms because of ""growing stress"" in the carmaker's portfolio.
Similar memos have been sent to dealerships for all other brands, said a senior SBI official aware of the matter, though Reuters has not seen memos relating to other carmakers.
As part of the revised terms, the country's largest bank by assets has decided to halt lending to dealers of Hyundai Motor India unless they provide a minimum of 25% collateral, it said in the memo.
Hyundai dealers that had already received loans from the bank will also have to provide security of between 25% and 50% of the loan amount, SBI said in the memo dated March 27 and signed by the chief general manager for supply chain financing.
Hyundai did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment outside business hours.
The company is India's second-largest carmaker with more than 16% of a market accounting for 3.3 million passenger vehicles in the year to March 31.
Japanese carmaker Suzuki Motor Corp's Indian business, Maruti Suzuki, dominates with a 50% share while rivals including Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford and Nissan also produce and sell cars in the country.
While it is known that several Indian banks have broadly tightened lending to the auto sector, specifics have not been disclosed.
""There is an auto sales slowdown and we have substantial exposure to autos. We want to stay safe and this was done to mitigate risk and protect us,"" said the SBI official, who asked not to be named because the details had not been made public.
SBI's loan exposure in the auto retail market was 718.8 billion rupees ($10.5 billion) at the end of March, according to regulatory filings.
""In view of the current slowdown in the auto sector, the bank is continuously reviewing its exposure,"" SBI told Reuters, adding that it is evaluating the situation and engaging with dealers to ensure the sector does not face any undue stress."
373,2019-07-30,State Bank,"Liquidity position comfortable when compared with May, and interest rates are also coming down, says CFOFor shorter tenure deposits of up to 179 days, SBI will slash deposit rates by 50-75 basis points

A steep cut in deposit rates by State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday has raised hopes of a corresponding lending rate cut by India’s largest bank in August.
SBI said it will reduce interest rates on retail fixed deposits with long tenures by up to 20 basis points (bps) and 35 bps for bulk deposits with effect from 1 August. For shorter tenure deposits of up to 179 days, the state-run bank will slash deposit rates by 50-75 bps.
The liquidity position has become comfortable compared with the situation in May, and interest rates are also coming down, said Prashant Kumar, chief financial officer of SBI. In a phone interview, Kumar said that this move will definitely lead to lower lending rates for borrowers and the extent of the cut will be decided after the bank’s asset-liability committee meets in August.
Earlier this month, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das called for quicker transmission of interest rate cuts after the central bank lowered the key repo rate by 75 bps in 2019. Das is trying to boost investment and consumption after quarterly economic growth slowed to a five-year low in the quarter ended 31 March.
With India’s largest bank slashing deposit rates, other lenders are likely to follow suit.
SBI’s latest move reverses a 20 bps increase in the fixed deposit (FD) rate in May for deposits of less than  ₹2 crore in the one- to two-year bracket. SBI’s rate now stands at 6.8%. While smaller state-run rival Bank of Baroda (BoB) pays 6.45-6.6% to depositors in the same maturity basket, private sector lender ICICI Bank pays between 6.9-7%. These rates for ICICI Bank and BoB are for fixed deposits with premature withdrawal facility, and they pay a higher rate for FDs without premature withdrawal.
Since a large bank like SBI relies heavily on deposits to fund loan disbursal, this move is expected to lower the bank’s cost of funds and translate into lower lending rates. As on 10 July, SBI’s one-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) was at 8.4% after three 5 bps rate cuts since January.
The bank has been able to consistently reduce its cost of deposits over the past couple of years, taking advantage of the falling interest rate scenario. Its cost of deposits declined from 5.84% in FY17 to 5.3% in the following fiscal year and to 5.1% in FY19. The bank held total deposits of  ₹29.11 trillion as on 31 March, an increase of 7.6% from the end of the previous fiscal. Of this, term deposits constituted 52% at  ₹15.26 trillion. “In view of the falling interest rate scenario and surplus liquidity, SBI realigns its interest rate on retail term deposits (less than  ₹2 crore) and bulk term deposits ( ₹2 crore and above) from 1 August. For time deposits with longer tenors, there is a reduction of up to 20 bps in the retail segment and 35 bps in the bulk segment. Interest rates have been slashed by 50-75 bps for time deposits with shorter tenors of up to 179 days,"" the bank said in a statement.
This move comes a week before the RBI monetary policy committee meeting. While the median one-year MCLR rate for public sector banks ranged between 8.35% and 8.75% from January 2018 to June 2019, the rates for private banks were at 8.95-9.45%, according to RBI data.
Anil Gupta, vice president of financial sector ratings at Icra Ltd, said that wholesale deposit rates have come down in the last one month because of the surplus liquidity conditions.
“A reduction in deposit cost will benefit the ability of banks to reduce their MCLRs, but it is difficult to say at this point if this will lead to an increase in investment activity. The investment appetite still continues to remain weak for corporates along with weak demand from retail customers as well,"" said Gupta."
372,2019-07-30,State Bank,"The restructuring could include easier repayment terms, such as longer tenure and reduced interest ratesDHFL's core lender group consist of seven banks, with nearly two dozen other lenders in the wider consortium

India's debt-laden shadow bank Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) has submitted a restructuring plan to its core committee of creditors (CoC), two sources involved in the matter said, adding that lead lenders were deliberating over the plan.
DHFL, the fourth-biggest housing finance company in India, has roughly 1 trillion rupees ($14.5 billion) of debt and is in the process of seeking lender approval on a restructuring designed to help it ride out a liquidy crunch and restart its lending business.
Several Indian non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), including DHFL, have been stung by an acute credit crunch sparked by the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services late last year.
The restructuring plan submitted by DHFL includes the founder's family reducing its stake and a restructuring of loans, said one of the sources aware of details of the plan.
The restructuring could include easier repayment terms, such as longer tenure and reduced interest rates, the source added.
Both the sources asked not to be named because details of the plan had not been made public. DHFL did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.
Of the total debt, DHFL owes banks approximately 380 billion rupees. The core lenders, including Union Bank and State Bank of India, are planning to call a meeting with the wider consortium of lenders in the first week of August to discuss the DHFL proposal, one of the sources said, adding that banks are not keen to inject any more capital.
SBI and Union Bank did not immediately reply to emails seeking comment outside business hours.
DHFL's core lender group consist of seven banks, with nearly two dozen other lenders in the wider consortium.
DHFL's plan is complicated by the need to secure approvals from mutual funds, insurers and pension funds that have also invested in the company's debt.
According to Indian central bank's regulations, three quarters of lenders by value of outstanding credit and 60% by number must agree on a restructuring plan for it to be cleared.
The Mumbai-based housing finance company is fairly confident of getting its rescue package approved soon, a company source had previously told Reuters. However, its auditors had recently raised red flags over the company's financial health, which could complicate its plans."
371,2019-07-31,State Bank,"India’s mutual fund industry is going through a rough patch with both equity and debt markets posing challenges.At the sixth Mint Mutual Fund Conclave, held in Mumbai on 26 July, experts debated how the industry can address these and live up to the promise of ‘Mutual Funds Sahi Hai’

The topic of the second panel discussion at the sixth edition of Mint Mutual Fund Conclave was: Refining Differentiators: Time to Look Beyond Returns. The panellists were: Ashwani Bhatia, managing director and chief executive officer, SBI Mutual Fund; Chandresh Kumar Nigam, managing director and chief executive officer, Axis Mutual Fund; Kalpen Parekh, president, DSP Investment Managers; Radhika Gupta, chief executive officer, Edelweiss Asset Management; and Vishal Kapoor, chief executive officer, IDFC Asset Management. The discussion was moderated by Sunita Abraham, consultant, Mint. Here are the edited excerpts:
Sunita Abraham: Chandresh, you have been a vocal advocate of looking beyond performance, specifically returns. Why do you think that’s important for investors and the mutual funds industry?
Chandresh Kumar Nigam: This is a long-standing thought. Mutual funds are largely invested in capital markets instruments which see volatility. There are various risks that need to be managed. As any responsible asset management company (AMC), it is important for us to ensure that we have the right approach and institutionalisation of “investment management"" to ensure that we deal with these risks. We should also ensure that we have the right “institutionalised"" approach to delivering what in our parlance is called alpha, and that too on a sustainable basis. We should also have the strategies spelt out for investors to give them confidence that they will be able to navigate volatile asset classes or markets and will meet their goals over three to five years (medium-to-long-term horizon).
We must not forget that the intermediary plays an important role because we can’t always expect investors to understand all that.
Abraham: What is a simple yet not simplistic way of communicating risk to the investor? Advertisements from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) link it to investment horizon. What are some other ways?
Radhika Gupta: Firstly, I think the traditional definitions of risk—things like standard deviation and Sharpe ratio—are realities I don’t think any lay investor understands. I think in the case of equities, for instance, you have to talk about risk in the context of what it means for an investor. So, in very simple terms, risk is really what can go wrong. One is loss of capital and over what time horizon. You can illustrate that through a lot of mediums we have now because of digital. You can illustrate— through factsheets, presentations, literature and videos—what you can lose in six months, in one year, two years, and what the rolling performance of the fund has been. For instance, a lot of our factsheets publish one-month, three-month, six-month returns. But those do not match investors’ experience. They should see rolling returns, which is what different investors at different points in time have earned. The second thing that we don’t talk about is liquidity risk. We started doing this in our own equity presentations, where we talk about things like, if I had to liquidate a mid-cap portfolio, how many days could I do it in reasonably. These are metrics that are at least more consumable to an investor.
I think this is more challenging for fixed income, as we have seen in the last nine months. But illustration of what is duration risk and matching your time horizon to your investment, what does it mean to borrow at 9% versus 10% versus 11%, what we commonly call credit risk, and so on is important. I think that basic illustration needs to be done and communication is a very powerful tool.
Abraham: Ashwani, if returns are not the focus, then what will be the differentiators? What is it that the investor should be looking at when evaluating an investment option?
Ashwani Bhatia: So, typically when an investor comes in, he has a certain expectation of return. When you talk to a fund house, those returns may come later. The fund house is actually looking at risk, timing, process, system and the company, holistically. So there are factors that the investor doesn’t even understand. And understanding of risk is, of course, very tiny as far as the customer is concerned. If I can communicate to the investor that what he is doing with a mutual fund is different than a bank, perhaps we have taken the first step.
So, where do you go from here and what does a customer get and what are the tangible and intangible returns? Investors don’t understand proxy voting, ESG or the framework that a fund house brings. Look at youngsters today. They are not buying a product, but generally buying a brand. So how do you generally develop the brand over the next five to 10 years is going to be important. If you are rigorous in your processes, you’ll thrive.
Abraham: Vishal, your views on what the differentiators should be?
Vishal Kapoor: I have a couple of additional takes. Firstly, do we really expect the average investor to understand all of what we put out on factsheets? I would say they don’t. But they (factsheets) should be there because there is a group of investors who are sophisticated and will understand. But the bulk of our investors are relying on our intermediaries as well as independent researchers to decide what they want to buy. So what can we do to make sure that these intermediaries are best placed to provide an objective and expert guidance? I think what’s important is the entire process of transparency around what the investment strategy is and how we are going to manage our products. The two areas of focus could be defining the product as tightly and clearly as possible and being transparent.In defining the product, regulatory intervention last year really helped because now at least you have got buckets within which some rules are defined, while maintaining a fair amount of flexibility. By being transparent about what your fund team intends to do gives the intermediary as well as the end investor a fair chance of getting the probability of success better.
Abraham: Kalpen, DSP has clearly marked out investment manager styles. Is that meant for internal processes or for investor consumption? If it is for investors, how would you ensure that investors actually understand and implement that in the investment decisions?
Kalpen Parekh: While different views were being expressed, it was making me go back to the same framework. So fund managers are told to answer four questions; what’s your source of alpha, why do you say that is the source of alpha, is that evidence-able, and are you reflecting that in the portfolio? Or is the alpha coming out of randomness? Now the whole idea of this exercise was not intended initially for the consumer; it was more for our internal reference point and investors who understand it. So our attempt is that whatever we say, we should do that and if we are not doing it, we should not say it and gradually move towards style purity and style clarity so that when advisers mix and match portfolios, they can pick the right funds. The need for simplicity is extremely vital, more so now when more and more customers are joining the bandwagon. A year back someone from my marketing team who comes from a consumer lens said what is risk at the end of the day? The risk is how much money can you lose either temporarily or permanently. We say that markets are volatile, so the losses are temporary if you don’t book them. If you stay put, you’ll make up. But how do we convey that? And this guy came up with a very simple articulation of risk. He looked at one of the most popular funds, which we were talking about, and he just wrote a number—minus 67%. And what was that minus 67%? It was the one-year worst case return that fund had witnessed. When we digitally communicated it, we had lots of interactions and we realised the maturity of the customers also. We also realised maturity of the advisers when they recognise that understanding of what can go wrong upfront is given in a very simple crisp tangible way.
Abraham: If you had to nudge the investor to look beyond the six-month or one-year return, what is it that you think would work for their investment decision?
Bhatia: I give my own personal examples. The biggest mistake perhaps I made in the ’80s was not to invest in mutual funds. Just give an example and if the returns are there, people get convinced by the simplicity.
Nigam: If we give little information to investors and advisers, they have no other choice but to talk about short-term returns. We also need to say why something is going to happen. People won’t believe that just because it has happened in the last 20 years, it’s going to happen in the future too. If you make the connection that it has happened due to of an underlying fundamental, people may stop taking short-term numbers as a proxy.
Parekh: First of all, we also have to ourselves start respecting time the most. The portfolio turnovers have to be lesser and not close to 60% or 100%. Because ultimate compounding comes from time which we speak; so start the change from ourselves to showcase benefits more than the features. I think we have not done justice in telling investors basic things like, you have a portfolio of  ₹10 lakh and you need  ₹1 lakh out of it, you can take it. Benefits of indexation—for example, in fixed income, most people don’t know what indexation is and how it works. A very simple example to highlight what are the benefits if you stay for longer. Third is, how do we reward investors if he crosses five years and then 10 years and then 15 years. Can I give him some incentive in terms of lower fees over time if I am willing to stay longer? Or bundle up products where there are some examples of innovation done in the past and I have seen it work in the years 2008-09-10 when markets were very rough. Products which were bundled with insurance gives investor a hook to stay longer because I know that if I exit right now, I am going to lose this other advantage.
Gupta: Interestingly, we did a session for our financial advisers and we just released a video on the power of nudges for investors. While I take all the points, I think, markets and investments are a part of life and they can sound very complex and also very dull. Nudge tells you one thing, like if you take the example of megapixels in a phone camera, nobody understands what a megapixel is. But if you say, a higher megapixel camera will take a 5x7 photo more clearly and lower megapixel camera will take a 4x6 photo more clearly, it suddenly becomes a lot more real. The other simple example is that if you ran a business as a business on yourself and it had two bad quarters, would you shut the business down? Probably not, right? You would continue it and you would try. Same thing; you are investing in underlying companies.
Kapoor: If I understand correctly, it’s about nudging the investor to not look at the one year, or the recent performance. I think we need to communicate better. Whether it is simplifying some of these complex things or communicating how we want to manage, what is the investment thesis, how we want to manage the money because there is a very evolved, expert group of advisers, and intermediaries, who are looking at that input. Along with continually refining a process and admitting to ourselves what we did not do very well, what did we do well etc; so these are the two things that the manufacturer should do better. But for the investor, while technology has helped a lot across many areas, going back to allocation and the importance of allocation, which is so fundamental to a portfolio, is something that often gets overlooked.
Abraham: So the conversation seems to be coming back to the adviser so we should deal with that question before we go on to the rest. Ashwani, obviously they are one of the most important links in getting your message across to the investor. Is the industry empowering the adviser enough? If we ask the advisers here today, do you think they would say that they’re getting a fair deal from the industry since the bulk of the responsibility seems to be lying on their shoulders.
Bhatia: See, the problem is everyone is impatient. The investor is impatient, the adviser is impatient, the IFA is impatient and we as an industry looking after AUM and numbers are looking for a bigger piece from the banks or the insurance industry. Finally, it is a game of patience and whatever changes Sebi has made over the last year or whatever has been implemented, they’ll take time to settle down. But finally, I think it is going to be a volumes game. It is a challenge today to ask a customer to open a folio. Once he has one product, it is a bigger challenge to get a second product, a third product. So what you got to reinforce again and again is your value system, how important that is to us, the processes as far as the investment is concerned, the vintage of the investment team.
Kapoor: I don’t think it is an additional role. I think that has been the role right through. And you know, clearly the community has done a great job in taking that responsibility. Proof of the pudding is, if the millennial chooses them despite the Google generation, it is telling something about the value that they bring. But maybe for sometime, we’ve been very focused on one part of a small problem or a limited problem, which is mis-selling and then taking certain decisions around it. I almost think that as an industry, including us as manufacturers, as the information becomes freely available and lot of this data is getting put up, including performance data etc, we should actually worry about the opposite end, which is someone mis-buying. You know this case in point where we are seeing this 5X jump in our ten-year constant maturity guilt fund; why? Because it suddenly has a one-year return which is 20%. If someone is going to look at that and buy it and suddenly we are seeing five times, ten times the volumes in that fund, no one is selling that. But it’s mis-buying them; so maybe that’s the other part of the problem we’ve got to tackle.
Abraham: Kalpen?
Parekh: I think I’ll just give you a story of the first adviser of the world. This was 700 years before Christ and there was this man called Joseph, who was the adviser to the Egyptian Pharaoh, the king there. The king used to get these dreams everyday, and these dreams were very weird. His dreams were of two types—one where he would see seven very healthy cows and then immediately he would see seven very thin cows and it would keep repeating. And then, the next day the cows stopped coming; he saw a great harvest of crops and then immediately after few minutes, he saw famine. So these dreams were recurring to him. So he goes to Joseph and says that I am getting these dreams; can you cure me, or can you solve this? It’s very disturbing. And Joseph who was the adviser to the kingdom said that these are nothing but nature giving you a signal of cycles; like markets have cycles, asset classes have cycles, you have seven good years and then seven bad years and the same is reflected in every asset class where we invest. So he said that this is a learning for you and these dreams will keep coming till you don’t make changes in your behaviour or in the way you are ruling the country because there will be seven years of good crops and then when the famine hits, you won’t be prepared for it because you’ll extrapolate the seven years into the future; hence, from now on, every year, create storage systems and keep 20% aside every year so that we’re ready for bad times. I think the real advisory is about preparing for the cycle to change. Like we say, the four most powerful words are—this too shall pass. So in good times, we need to recognise that bad times will come and how do we prepare for it. How do we make people aware about it and not just extrapolate good times. Likewise, in bad times, not extrapolate pessimism alone. So if investors are coming on our websites and buying volatile funds, which are giving highest returns, what stops us from just putting a banner there and saying that this fund is going to be volatile, don’t get carried away by last one-year returns or used to happen even in our funds and we said let’s stop putting this highest return as a tag in itself.
Abraham: Yes, Chandresh
Nigam: I think what you’re trying to say is how do we help our adviser community to do what is right for their customers. There are two parts to it. One is obviously what the manufacturer does. Responsible manufacturer has right products, manages in the right way and that’s a communication which needs to go to him so that he is able to evaluate what are the products which he should be ultimately going out and pitching to his customers. It’s relatively easy to start talking about goal-based investments. It is easier said than done; the first thing is that significant amount of effort is required to understand each of your customers. There are two aspects to it. How effective an adviser is in understanding his customer and able to communicate what the right investment or portfolio strategy is. The second aspect is, as compared to effectiveness in an adviser dealing with his clients problems, is efficiency. If I am able to do it only with 10 clients, I won’t have a business. I have to probably be able to do 500 clients, it’s an issue of efficiency. We’re talking about CRM (customer relationship management) solutions. So I think there is an embrace of technology. But I think what I’ve seen over the last 5-7 years is that a large number of advisers have their realisations that if I do the SIP route, ultimately my client is going to happy; so that’s kind of already going to be done. How do I engage with my customers? Do I still go back to the return number, or do I engage on a much more emotional platform to say that I’m going to talk to you about your future.
Gupta: I just have one point. While there is a lot we can do to educate our advisers and our brand campaign is “advice zaroori hai"". To what Vishal said, we only have 2 crore odd investors, and one of the big challenges and needs is also to educate investors that they need advisers and also what advisers can bring to the table. The advisory community is quite competent. We’ll do a lot to educate them, but from mis-buying to just telling investors that you need advice and this is what advice can do for you, is also something we can do as an ecosystem.
Abraham: The SIP was the last blockbuster idea. What is the next big idea from the industry?
Bhatia: Index funds.
Nigam: I think any product that can harness volatility as an advantage will be a great idea. Some part of it is already being done through multi-asset products, which have the ability to move allocations, through simple formulae like time-based rebalancing and so on.
Parekh: I hope SIP is not the great product of the past because when we sold it in the last few years, it was with permanency in mind and we have said it was forever. It is an evergreen product and belief. So that will remain. I agree with Chandresh—asset allocation funds
Gupta: Passive fixed income products and not active ones. And SIP was not a product, it was a feature. As my product head says, feature is the future. So, more innovative features.
Kapoor: Not really products. I would like to focus on simplicity as the big idea—whether it is in buying or meeting your goal or the way you interact or the way you understand or transact. I think there is humongous scope for simplifying what is intrinsically a complex market."

MUMBAI :
As many as four potential bidders have evinced interest in Jet Airways (India) Ltd, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, though talks for a potential bid are still in early stages.
SBI Capital Markets, which is advising the lenders in the process of finding new investors for the grounded airline, has reached out to as many as 20 potential investors, the person said, requesting anonymity.
“Among these, four parties have shown initial interest to bid for Jet Airways,"" the person cited above said on condition of anonymity.
The airline’s committee of creditors (CoC) met on Thursday to discuss issues related to its insolvency proceedings. The lenders decided that they would extend the deadline for bids if the airline failed to attract suitors by Saturday.
State Bank of India (SBI), which leads the lenders’ consortium for Jet Airways, has sanctioned  ₹10 crore as a part of the approved interim funding of $10 million (about  ₹69 crore) for the airline, which was decided by the lenders earlier in July. “Other banks are expected to follow suit and sanction their part of the funding in the coming days,"" the person added.
Besides maintaining Jet Airways’ planes and other assets, the interim funding will also be used to hire people on contract to verify various creditor claims.
The lenders, however, have reservations about releasing a month’s salary for Jet Airways’ staff as sought by several worker unions, said another person aware of the matter.
Jet Airways, which grounded its operations in April, due to an acute fund crunch, is yet to pay salaries since January to a section of its staff such as pilots, engineers and general managers. The airline hasn’t paid salaries to the rest of its staff since March.
On 20 June, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted Jet Airways under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after lenders referred it to the bankruptcy court.
The group of 26 banks, led by SBI, have approached the tribunal to recover dues of more than  ₹8,500 crore. The lenders have been trying to sell Jet Airways for the past five months without success."

The country’s largest bank SBI has lowered its bank fixed deposit or FD interest rates with effect from today. Also from today, SBI will remove charges on money transfer through IMPS or Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) to boost digital transactions. IMPS, an interbank electronic instant money transfer service, is available 24x7, throughout the year including on bank holidays and Sundays. The beneficiary’s account is credited immediately when a fund transfer request is made through SBI's mobile phone or internet banking or YONO.
More than 6 crore customers use SBI's internet banking facility. SBI will also waive IMPS charges for fund transfer up to  ₹1,000 through branch banking.
SBI has slashed interest rates on fixed deposits by 20 to 75 basis points across all maturities amid a fall in the interest rate across the financial system and improving liquidity in the banking system. Analysts say that other banks are also expected to follow suit and may consider reducing their fixed deposit rates later.
Indeed, many banks like HDFC Bank, PNB, Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank had revised FD interest rates in July.
SBI’s move comes days ahead of the RBI’s monetary policy review due August 7. The RBI, which has already cut repo rate by a combined 75 basis points this year, is widely expected to deliver another rate cut. The government has already reduced interest rates on small savings schemes such as the National Savings Scheme (NSC), Public Provident Fund (PPF) for the July-August quarter.
SBI offers 50-basis-point higher interest rate to senior citizens across all FD maturities than what others get.
SBI latest fixed deposit or FD rates
﻿SBI, which offers fixed deposits with maturity ranging from 7 days to 10 years, made the biggest cuts on shorter-term deposits. Interest rate for 7-45 days FDs has been cut to 5% (annual) from 5.75%. SBI FDs with maturity between 46 days to 179 days also saw a sharp cut, with interest rate falling to 5.75% from 6.25%.
Watch: SBI slashes fixed deposit rates, other banks may follow
For deposits of 180 days to 1 year, SBI has reduced interest rate to 6.25%, from 6.35-6.40% earlier.
For fixed deposits between 1 year and less than 2 years, SBI has kept interest rate steady to 6.7%. SBI’s 2-3 year FDs will fetch 6.70%, as compared to 6.75% earlier.
For deposits between 3 years to less than 5 years, SBI has lowered interest rate to 6.6% from 6.8%. Also, on fixed deposits between 5 years and up to 10 years, SBI has cut interest rate to 6.5% from 6.6%. This also means that SBI’s tax-saving fixed deposits, which have a lock-in period of 5 years, will also fetch lower rate of interest.
SBI has also cut interest rate on bulk deposits ( ₹2 crore or above)."

SBI has also slashed the interest rates on its long-term deposits. For deposits maturing in two years to less than three years, the bank has slashed the interest rate by 5 basis points, now these FD will fetch you an interest rate of 6.70%.
For FDs maturing in three years to less than five years, SBI will offer an interest rate of 6.60%, earlier these FDs were fetching an interest rate of 6.70%. For deposits maturing in five years to ten years, SBI has reduced the interest rate from 6.60% to 6.50%
SBI had earlier tweaked interest rate on some select maturities effective from 9 May 2019.
Watch: SBI slashes fixed deposit rates, other banks may follow
Many banks have been reducing the interest rates on fixed deposits due to a fall in interest rate in the financial system and surplus liquidity. HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, PNB, BoB, and Kotak Mahindra, among others, had revised their fixed deposit rates rates this month.
SBI's cut comes days before the RBI is set to decide on its monetary policy. The central bank is widely expected to lower interest rates in next month's policy meeting. The RBI so far this year cut the repo rate by a combined 75 basis points, leading to a sharp fall in bond yields.

While SBI’s total provisions more than halved on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis from  ₹19,228 crore to  ₹9,183 crore in the June quarter, its other income rose 20% to  ₹8,015 crore during the period under consideration.
SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the bank’s primary focus is on increasing its core operating profit or pre-provisioning operating profit.
The lender’s operating profit grew 10.6% to  ₹13,246 crore in the quarter.
Kumar added that the growth in operating profit came off a higher base in the year-ago quarter, when the bank had recovered  ₹1,900 crore from two accounts under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
“There (operating profit), I would say, we have been fairly successful,"" said Kumar.
SBI’s net interest income— the difference between interest earned and expended— rose 5% y-o-y to  ₹22,939 crore and its net interest margin (NIM) rose 6 basis points y-o-y. NIM fell 1 basis point sequentially to 3.01%.
“In the current scenario where credit growth is muted, I think it will be very difficult for the bank to push up the NIM in a very significant manner. We expect domestic NIM to be at 3.1% by the end of FY20,"" said Kumar.
The bank’s asset quality improved, as the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio — gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans—declined 316 basis points y-o-y, but remained unchanged sequentially at 7.53%.Fresh additions to bad loans, however, rose to  ₹16,212 crore in Q1, up from  ₹9,984 crore from the same quarter last year.
Kumar said that one large account slipped in the quarter because a member bank of a particular consortium could not implement the resolution plan under the terms of the 12 February circular of the Reserve Bank of India, which meant that all banks had to classify it as an NPA.
Another contributer to higher slippages was the agriculture book, particularly because of one state, which had declared a loan waiver, leading to fresh bad loans, he added.
SBI saw corporate slippages of  ₹5,354 crore; small and medium enterprises (SME) slippages of  ₹3,964 crore; and agriculture slippages of  ₹4,239 crore during the quarter.
“In the last five quarters, the bank has seen cumulative slippages of  ₹56,700 crore. It has written-off  ₹74,000 crore and has recovered and upgraded loans of  ₹37,300 crore, thereby helping to build the reduction in bad loans as the write-offs and recoveries have been greater than the slippages,"" said an analyst at a domestic broking firm.
The bank improved its provision coverage ratio (PCR) to 79% in the June quarter of FY20, up from 69% in the same quarter of FY19. PCR is the proportion of money set aside to cover NPAs.
“In respect of two accounts, fairly large, we have provided about  ₹ 2,300 crore which is not coming in to our PCR since these are not NPAs, but are currently under resolution,"" said Kumar.
He added that if these two accounts get resolved within the next six months, then the bank’s gross slippages position will be comfortable.
The bank’s recoveries and upgradations stood at  ₹5,769 crore, while recoveries from written-off accounts were at  ₹1,358 crore. Kumar said the bank expects a recovery of  ₹16,000 crore from three accounts— Essar Steel, Bhushan Power and Steel and Alok Industries —that are in the final stages of resolution at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
“Every quarter I am looking towards the sky and God (to ask when) will we get all those decisions and recover that amount. Every morning I pray to God,"" said Kumar.
SBI has exposure of  ₹1.13 trillion to 453 accounts in the NCLT, of which  ₹59,000 crore is classified as non-performing. The remainder,  ₹54,809 crore, has been put in advance under collection account (AUCA).
Moreover, another 123 accounts have been referred to the NCLT, but are yet to be admitted. The bank has either signed or is likely to sign inter-creditor agreements for 18 bad loans and 20 standard loans.
On the slowdown in the auto sector and reports of tightening lending norms for auto dealers, Kumar said SBI is very supportive of the sector and is not panicking. In these circumstances it does not help that you squeeze everything, he said. The bank has an exposure of  ₹11,500 crore to auto dealers.
SBI’s total deposits rose 7.32% y-o-y to  ₹29.48 trillion and its total loans (including foreign advances) rose 12.47% y-o-y to  ₹22.38 trillion. Its capital adequacy ratio under Basel III guidelines rose 6 basis points y-o-y to 12.89%.
“While we were not ruling out volatility in corporate slippages, higher slippages across segments (including retail) remains a concern. Nonetheless, SBI’s strong liability franchise and better capital position differentiate it from other public sector peers,"" said a report by Reliance Securities.

MUMBAI :
The last date to submit expressions of interest (EoIs) for Jet Airways has been extended to 10 August after the company received interest from only a “couple of investors"" by Saturday, the original deadline.
A person aware of the development said on the condition of anonymity that since the insolvency resolution process is keeping pace with the prescribed timelines, it has been decided to wait for a few more days and gather more resolution proposals.
“This is to bring to the attention of all interested resolution applicants that the revised deadline for submission stands at 4 pm (India time) on 10 August, 2019,"" said Ashish Chhawchharia, Jet Airways' resolution professional in a note on Saturday.
The note said that on basis of requests received from prima-facie credible interested resolution applicants for some additional time, the deadline for submission of EoI is being provisionally extended, subject to formal ratification by the committee of creditors.
“The proposed extension is to ensure the objectives of the IBC are achieved and we are able to maximise the value of the assets of the corporate debtor and achieve a better outcome for all stakeholders in this fast-track process,"" the note said.
The invitation for EoIs in the ongoing corporate insolvency resolution process of Jet Airways, released by the resolution professional on 20 July, 2019 had specified the deadline to be 3 August, 2019.
Mint reported on 1 August that as many as four potential bidders have evinced interest in Jet Airways (India) Ltd. SBI Capital Markets, which is advising the lenders in the process of finding new investors for the grounded airline, has reached out to as many as 20 potential investors.
State Bank of India (SBI), which leads the lenders’ consortium for Jet Airways, has sanctioned  ₹10 crore as a part of the approved interim funding of $10 million (about  ₹69 crore) for the airline, which was decided by the lenders earlier in July.
At the meeting on 1 August, lenders, however, have reservations about releasing a month’s salary for Jet Airways’ staff as sought by several worker unions.
Jet Airways, which grounded its operations in April, due to an acute fund crunch, is yet to pay salaries since January to a section of its staff such as pilots, engineers and general managers. The airline hasn’t paid salaries to the rest of its staff since March.
On 20 June, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) admitted Jet Airways under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) after lenders referred it to the bankruptcy court."

358,2019-08-05,State Bank,"To reduce toxic loans, SBI needs the resolution process to quicken and the economy to recoverThe lender’s write-offs were nearly three times of recoveries and upgrades

India’s largest lender is in a bind. After having knocked on all doors, including the presumably empowered insolvency courts, State Bank of India (SBI) has now fallen on divine intervention in search of resolution.
Chairman Rajnish Kumar said every morning he looks at the sky and prays for the resolution of big accounts that are doing the rounds of insolvency courts. He is quick to add, though, that he is hopeful resolution will happen. “There are many accounts in the final stages of resolution in NCLT,"" he explained as reason for his confidence.
Whether Kumar’s prayers will be answered depends on a host of factors. The key is how fast insolvency courts resolve big cases, such as Essar Steel, which have stretched beyond the 270 days stipulated by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The wheels of 14 insolvency courts are grinding rather slowly on 2,192 insolvency cases, with many of these cases languishing in litigation.
To be sure, SBI has provided for nearly 90% of the large accounts admitted to insolvency courts. That said, future recoveries will be crucial for a whiplash effect on interest income and in bringing down the toxic loan pool.
SBI’s recoveries also rely on peers agreeing to the contours of a resolution plan in cases that are outside the insolvency courts. Inter-creditor agreements facilitate this, but the lender also saw a  ₹2,000 crore loan slip into the non-performing category in the June quarter, because its resolution was not implemented in a timely manner by another bank.
Since many of the stressed accounts are still a work-in-progress with regards to resolution, SBI has fallen on its tried-and-tested method to shore up as much insurance as possible through provisioning. The public sector bank had to set aside  ₹11,648 crore as provision towards bad loans during the June quarter. In addition, it has provided around  ₹2,300 crore towards two large stressed accounts, which includes defaulter Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd.
In cases where provisioning hasn’t been enough, SBI has written loans off. For the June quarter, write-offs amounted to  ₹15,482 crore, nearly three times the amount of loans it recovered or upgraded.
Be that as it may, SBI is still facing challenges on asset quality. Slippages surged in the June quarter, thanks to the emerging stress from non-banking financial companies and conglomerates such as the Essel Group.
For stress to reduce on its books, SBI also relies on a recovery in economic activity and the current deepening slowdown isn’t helping the lender at all. It is understandable that Kumar was non-committal on the pace of recovery, and even growth. Loan growth forecast is a modest 12% for the current year, and this hinges on the hope that the busy season in the second half of FY20 will give opportunities.
Meanwhile, investors pushed the stock down nearly 3% on Friday because of the disappointing results. SBI’s net profit missed estimates by a wide margin and even core income left much to be desired."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) on Saturday said the Reserve Bank has imposed a penalty of  ₹50 lakh on it for non-compliance relating to reporting of frauds.
RBI in exercise of the powers conferred under various sections of the Banking Regulations Act, has slapped penalties on eight commercial banks, including, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda, for a host of violations, including delay on the reporting of fraud in the account of Kingfisher Airlines in case of two lenders.
These lenders in separate regulatory filings said that the penalties have been imposed on them for delay in reporting of frauds.
PNB said the RBI has imposed a penalty of  ₹50 lakh on it for delay in reporting of fraud in the account of Kingfisher Airlines.State-run lender Oriental Bank of Commerce said that the RBI has imposed a fine of  ₹1.5 crore on it for delay in reporting fraud in the account of Kingfisher Airlines.
United Bank of India and Punjab & Sind Bank said they have been fined 1 crore each by the RBI.
Bank of Baroda and Federal Bank reported a fine of  ₹50 lakh each on them for delay in reporting fraud in an account.

Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) has invited bids for overseas oil and gas assets of Videocon Industries Ltd, a newspaper advertisement showed on Monday, as India seeks to recover billions of dollars in loans from the beleaguered private firm.
Consumer electronics firm Videocon Industries is one of the most indebted companies in India, with outstanding loans worth around  ₹60,000 crore ($8.53 billion) from its financial and operational creditors.
In October, SBI Caps, the investment banking arm of State Bank of India, was appointed to start the process of valuation and monetisation of the firm's oil and gas assets overseas.
SBI said it had appointed consultant Deloitte to find buyers for Videocon's exploration assets in Brazil and Indonesia.
""It is a process where qualified parties from India and overseas will be invited to bid for the assets,"" said a banker involved in the process, adding that expressions of interest would be received until 22 August.
Videocon did not immediately reply to calls seeking comment.
Videocon Industries has oil and gas assets in India, Brazil and Indonesia, in addition to its now-defunct consumer electronics business in India.
The company ventured into Brazil and Mozambique oil and gas assets over a decade ago, buoyed by its experience in oil production in India's east coast.
However, burgeoning debt forced the company to sell its coveted asset in Mozambique to a consortium of Indian state-owned companies led by Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd in 2014 for $2.4 billion.

355,2019-08-05,State Bank,"Most credit cards that charge a fee come with extra benefits, but do you need them?This (no-fee card) can help build your credit score and history, and your pathway to more premium and specialized cards

If you are in the market looking for a credit card, you are probably prepared to shell out an annual fee for the same. But why should you pay a fee when the market has zero-fee credit cards too? While paying a fee may entitle you to extra benefits, a zero-fee credit card may suffice if you do not use it a lot or are a new user. We explain why but first let’s start with the basics.
Types of credit cards
Credit cards give you free credit for 45-55 days after which it charges a monthly interest. Apart from this, there is an annual fee to pay, regardless of your usage pattern. Zero-fee credit cards, on the other hand, don’t levy any annual fee.
Then there are credit cards that are sandwiched between an annual fee and no-fee cards. These cards charge an annual fee initially but waive it off eventually after the user crosses a certain threshold of spends. For instance, State Bank of India’s (SBI) SimplyClick card charges an annual fee of  ₹499, which is reversed if you spend  ₹1 lakh through the card in a year. HDFC Freedom Credit Card charges  ₹500 as annual fee but waives it off after you cross the  ₹60,000 spending threshold in a year.

“Even in case of premium credit cards that involve a relatively higher annual fee, card issuers usually offer annual fee waiver if you spend beyond the minimum threshold amount in the previous year,"" said Naveen Kukreja, chief executive officer and co-founder, Paisabazaar.com, an online marketplace for financial products.
Some banks also waive the annual fee against a security deposit. For instance, Axis Insta Easy Credit Card is issued against a minimum fixed deposit of  ₹20,000, and SBI Card Unnati against a minimum FD of  ₹25,000.
I like plain vanilla
Mrin Agarwal, financial educator, founder director of Finsafe India Pvt. Ltd and co-founder of Womantra, said, “A cashback, no-fee credit card which offers decent benefits is a good choice. Many fail to even redeem rewards and benefits of credit cards, so it makes sense to go for no-fee cards and get a cashback that reduces your amount due. Those who want to go for an annual fee card must see if the rewards they get in return are worth a high annual fee and whether they are actually using the rewards and benefits.""
Go for zero-fee cards if you are using a credit card for the first time and figuring out how it works, how often you need to use it and the like. “This can be the stepping stone to building your credit score and history, and your pathway to more premium and specialized cards. It would also be an inexpensive way to increase your credit limit,"" said Navin Chandani, chief business development officer, BankBazaar, a loan aggregator.
Also, if you use your credit card sparingly, you should pick a plain-vanilla, zero-fee credit card. “No-fee credit cards are best for users who seldom use credit cards for making big-ticket expenditures,"" said Gaurav Chopra, founder and chief executive officer, IndiaLends, a financial technology startup.
If you have a bad credit score and are trying to repair it, go for a no-fee card and use the card for nominal expenditures.
I am ready for more
If you are a savvy credit card user, who knows how to use the rewards and benefits that cards offer, you could look beyond zero-fee cards. Cards that charge an annual fee, initially or otherwise, usually come with better reward features.
However, that will be suitable only if you have the financial discipline to not let your credit spiral into a debt trap. “The benefits of annual fee cards are endless as compared to zero-fee cards, especially for those who can afford them or are eligible for premium cards. The typical individual seeks travel, entertainment, dining, retail, and curated experiences. Premium cards may help them access these in a rewarding manner,"" said Chandani. While the annual fee may range from  ₹1,000 to  ₹10,000, the customer usually gets benefits in the form of vouchers, discounts and so on, added Chandani. “People looking for specific benefits may seek these cards.""
Comparing flavours
We compared two credit cards from the same bank, one that charges no annual fee and another that charges a fee of  ₹3,500. The zero-fee credit card gives regular benefits such as rewards points, cashback offers, discount offers, fuel surcharge waiver, complementary lounge access at select airports, and so on. The other card, however, has several other features besides the regular ones, including a chance to earn unlimited miles which never expire, award miles, priority pass membership and complimentary lounge access to a number of airports across the world, miles redemption in the form of free flights, upgrades, hotel accommodations, car rentals, 24X7 concierge services and the like. You even get insurance covers for baggage delay, checked-in baggage loss and personal accident cover, to name a few.
Clearly, you can’t expect no-fee cards to compete with annual fee cards in terms of reward points, but you need to evaluate if you really need these benefits. “A number of additional benefits, rewards and offers are directly linked to the annual fee. If a credit card provider is not charging any annual fee, then the number of benefits a user can avail on such a card will be way less when compared to a credit card that charges an annual fee,"" said Chopra.
Mint Money take
While standard no-fee cards too offer a wide range of benefits, annual fee cards work well for heavy spenders and those who want high-value rewards in return.
“Most of the top-rewards credit cards waive off the annual fee in the first year. In this period, one can identify one’s consumption pattern and dependency on credit cards. If consumption is less, one can opt for no-annual fee credit cards and if the consumption is higher one should opt for a credit card with an annual fee, as one can enjoy additional rewards associated with it,"" said Chopra.
A plain-vanilla credit card works for most, but if you want to upgrade, be ready to spend some time analyzing the trade-off."

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the government plans to take policy measures “fairly quickly"" to address the challenges plaguing the industry. She said also that the government is open to hearing out the grievances of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The minister was speaking to reporters after meeting chief executives of private and state-run banks as she kicked off a series of meetings planned with various industry heads. She met the heads of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank among others. The meeting also discussed the credit requirements of non-bank lenders, automobile industry and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and the transmission of interest rate cuts to the economy.
“Behind the series of meetings is to hear them out and fairly quickly after that come out with something that will help those sectors...We are getting inputs from various sectors and trying to respond so that the confidence of those sectors is being restored,"" Sitharaman said.
Over the next few days, the minister will meet representatives from several sectors —FPIs, automakers, industry associations, financial markets, MSMEs, industry associations and real estate to listen to their challenges. This is the first time the finance minister is meeting top executives in the second term of the National Democratic Alliance government, in a way acknowledging the ongoing economic slowdown and the government’s willingness to take inputs from businesses.
Sitharaman said the economic affairs secretary will soon hold talks with FPIs on their problems. There has been a massive outflow of overseas funds following the Union budget announcement to impose higher surcharge on some of these investors.
Bankers who attended the meeting sought the government’s intervention on tax notices asking lenders to pay service tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) on minimum balance accounts. Banks will soon respond to the notices, Sitharaman said, adding Jan Dhan accounts and basic deposit and savings accounts do not attract any charges.
On the decision to borrow overseas in foreign currency, Sitharaman said she will not speculate on the number of tranches and the finance ministry has done nothing in this regard, besides the announcement in the budget, owing to commitments in the ongoing Parliament session.
During the March quarter, India’s economy grew at 5.8%, the slowest in five years. Growth in 2018-19 was 6.8%, down from 7.2% a year ago. Besides the slowdown in fresh private investments, subdued demand and stress at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are affecting growth.
In signs of a persistent slowdown, India’s automobile makers are finding it hard to sell vehicles, and NBFCs and MSMEs are struggling to access credit.
Overall credit growth continues to be at 12%, which is marginally lower than 13.3% at the end of March, the finance ministry said in a statement after the meeting.
“At the same time, with turnaround in the NPA cycle, high provision cover of over 75%, and record recovery, banks’ balance sheet are healthier than before. Banks are now, therefore, in position to step up lending,"" said a finance ministry statement.
MoS for finance Anurag Thakur, finance secretary Rajiv Kumar, economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty, expenditure secretary G.C. Murmu, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, RBI deputy governor NS Vishawanathan, were among those who attended the meeting."

The bank offers interest rates ranging from 3.50% per annum to 7.30% per annum on deposits maturing in seven days to 10 years, across various tenures.
For deposits maturing in seven days to 6 months, the interest rates remain unchanged at 6.00% for general public and 50 basis points higher, i.e. 6.50% for senior citizens. The bank is offering an interest rate of 6.75% to general public and 7.25% to senior citizens on fixed deposits of seven days to less than 1 year.
HDFC Bank has reduced the interest rate by 10 basis points on deposits maturing in one year to two years. On deposits maturing in one year to 1 year 16 days, HDFC Bank has lowered the interest rate to 7.00%. FDs maturing in one year 17 days to 2 year will fetch an interest rate of 7.10% instead of 7.20%.

These rate cuts come just before the Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy review scheduled on 7 August, amid expectations of yet another 25 basis points cut in lending rate. RBI has already reduced the repo rate three times in the last three MPC meetings. In its June policy review, while reducing the rate for the third time in a row, the RBI had signalled more easing as it looked to boost the slowing economy."
349,2019-08-07,State Bank,"Further initiatives are needed to boost consumption and investment to stimulate economic growth, said the expertsReduction in risk weightage for consumer credit will free up capital from the banking sector for productive use, said SBI chairman

New Delhi: Terming the RBI's decision to reduce repo rate by 35 basis points as unconventional, banking and financial experts on Wednesday said the intent is to support growth while keeping inflation at sub-4% level.
They also pointed out that further initiatives are needed to boost consumption and investment to stimulate economic growth.
SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said the RBI's decision to cut repo rate by an unconventional 35 basis points is perhaps a recognition that the monetary policy works best with unanticipated surprises to the market.
""The RBI has unveiled a host of bazooka measures to arrest the recent growth pangs even as it has marginally lowered its growth forecast for FY20. On the development and regulatory front, the decision to make available the NEFT platform on 24/7 basis, coupled with on-tap authorisation will add depth to retail payments (currently around 85 lakh transactions on a daily basis),"" Kumar said.
Yes Bank Chief Economist Shubhada Rao said that growth concerns ""beget unconventional monetary easing"".
""In a departure from usual convention of changing benchmark rates by 25 bps (or multiples thereof), the repo rate was reduced by 35 bps to 5.40% (the lowest since Jul-10).""
While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expects risk on inflation forecasts to be evenly balanced, it anticipates some downside risks to its FY20 growth estimate, she said.
""The departure from taking conventional steps towards changes in the benchmark policy rate potentially opens the door for a future encore,"" Rao said further.
Also watch: MPC lowers repo rate: How does it affect you?
Kotak Mahindra Bank, President - Consumer Banking, Shanti Ekambaram said the monetary policy committee has ensured an all-round accommodative framework to support growth.
""This is against the backdrop of global interest rates easing, slowing global growth amidst rising trade wars, benign domestic inflation, a fall in imports and exports, and slowing urban and rural consumption demand in India ... the central bank has provided adequate measures through the monetary policy,"" Ekambaram said.
What is required now are further initiatives to boost consumption and investment to stimulate economic growth, she added.
ICRA said the unconventional 35 bps rate cut is a clear signal that the increasing evidence of a pervasive slowdown in economic growth has emerged as the MPC's chief concern, given that it expects inflation to remain under its medium-term target.
""The focus will now shift to improving transmission to bank lending rates, with the systemic liquidity surplus in excess of 1% of net demand and time liabilities (NDTL),"" said Aditi Nayar, Principal economist, ICRA.
George Alexander Muthoot, MD - Muthoot Finance said RBI's mandate to open up lending to NBFC sector will boost the consumer spending like auto sales, real estate and others.
""We expect the rate cuts to encourage the banks for a faster transmission thereby providing much needed relief to the cost of funds. The policy clearly focuses on managing inflation and reviving the economy. The overall investment demand and the credit environment of the economy will pick up,"" Muthoot said.
Reliance Home Finance ED & CEO Ravindra Sudhalkar said RBI's decision to cut rates by 35 basis point is a positive decision.
The move to allow banks to lend to priority sectors, including to housing sector of up to  ₹20 lakh loans, through NBFC arms will kickstart credit flow especially to affordable housing sector, he said.
Measures to improve credit flow to NBFCs, unsecured borrowers and priority sectors with lowering of risk weight will complement the overall stance of adequate liquidity and lower rates, said R K Gurumurthy, Head - Treasury, Lakshmi Vilas Bank.
Rate transmission is expected to improve significantly in the coming days. Deposit rates should continue to drift lower, he said.
Kotak Institutional Equities said the RBI continued with the rate cut cycle but in a surprise change to the quantum,however, transmission to lending rates will likely remain weak unless there is a clear visibility of adequate liquidity sustaining over the medium term.
""The MPC remains sanguine on inflation with projections up to Q1 FY2021 remaining well under 4%....Steps to enhance the credit flows to NBFCs and classification of certain sectors to the priority sector lending through NBFC on-lending are also welcome,"" said B Prasanna, Head – Global Markets group, ICICI Bank.
Reduction in risk weightage for consumer credit will free up capital from the banking sector for productive use. Similarly, permitting Banks to on-lend through NBFCs will facilitate credit flow to priority sectors, the SBI chairman noted.

The interest rate on SBI's large savings accounts (deposits over  ₹1 lakh) will automatically come down as the Reserve Bank of India cut its repo rate by 35 basis points to 5.4%. On the other side, the interest charged by SBI on short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility and a repo rate linked home loan product will also go down. Repo rate is the key policy rate at which the RBI lends to commercial bank.
From May this year, SBI had switched to a new interest rate regime on large savings accounts (balance above  ₹1 lakh) as well as short-term loans like overdraft and cash credit facility, linking them to RBI's repo rate. Whenever there is a change in RBI's repo rate, the change gets automatically reflected in these SBI products. This has been done for better transmission of RBI’s policy rates into the banking system.
SBI's large savings accounts will offer an interest rate which is 275 bps below repo rate. This means effective interest rate on large SBI savings accounts will get automatically changed to 2.65%. SBI savings accounts with deposits below  ₹1 lakh will continue to fetch 3.5% interest rate.
On July 1, SBI had also launched a repo rate-linked home loan. The home loan-linked to repo rate is actually in sync with repo rate-linked lending rate (RLLR), a rate linked with repo and a margin of 2.25%. Also, SBI charges a spread above the RLLR.
All SBI cash credit accounts and overdraft facilities with limits above  ₹1 lakh is linked to the RBI's repo rate, plus a spread of 2.25%. SBI charges a risk premium on these loans, over and above the floor rate of 7.65%, based on the risk profile of the borrower.
Effective from August 1, SBI sharply cut its fixed deposit (FD) rates sharply by 20-75 basis points. Many banks including HDFC Bank and PNB have also revised their interest rates lower this month."

India's biggest bank State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday cut its marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) by 15 basis points across all tenors, just hours after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its repo rate. SBI's new MCLR rates will be effective from August 10, 2019. After the latest revision, SBI's one-year MCLR will come down to 8.25% per annum from 8.40% earlier.

Oriental Bank of Commerce and IDBI Bank on Thursday announced a cut in the range of 0.05 to 0.15 percentage points in the marginal cost of funds based lending rates (MCLR) for various tenors.
SBI, which claims to be largest mortgage lender in the country, said this is the fourth cut in MCLR in FY 2019-20.
If you are an existing home loan borrower from SBI, the latest cut of 15 basis points on MCLR will however not bring down your home loan interest rate immediately.
If your SBI floating rate home loan is linked to MCLR, you will have a reset clause. For instance, SBI's floating rate home loans are typically linked to to one-year MCLR and it will have a one-year reset clause. If the reset clause is in July and the MCLR cut happens in August, your home loan rate will not change till next July. Moreover, banks typically adjust the tenure of the loan instead of the EMI, based on the movement of rates.
Last month, SBI had launched a new home loan product linking its interest rate with RBI's repo rate. This new home loan product from SBI has a maximum tenure of 33 years. Under this new mechanism, the interest rate on this home loan will change upwards or downwards, in line with movement of RBI's repo rate. The loan is linked to repo-linked lending rate, which is 225 basis points over repo rate. The bank also charges a spread above the repo-linked lending rate.
From May this year, SBI had linked all cash credit and overdraft accounts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate, plus a spread of 2.25%. For savings deposits above  ₹ ₹1 lakh, it had set its savings deposit rates to 2.75% below the repo rate."

Mumbai: Consumers are spending much more than their income and also resorting to loans to fund their lifestyle since the past few years, resulting in a ""serious slowdown"" in consumption, a leading asset management company said Tuesday.
Given the concerns like weak auto sales which slumped to a 19-year-low in July, SBI Mutual Fund refused to give an outlook on the markets for the near-term, pointing to the ""volatilities"" on both the domestic and global fronts.
""Consumers were dis-saving and consuming more than their income, helped by increasing access to the leverage. Such growth has its own limits,"" the fund house's chief investment officer Navneet Muhnot told reporters.
He said personal consumption spend has outgrown household income, leading to the household savings plummeting to a low 21 percent in FY18 from 34 percent in FY10, while the share of consumption has gone up 290 bps to 59.1 percent of GDP in FY18 during this period.
At the same time, annual household liabilities have been building up at 3-4% of GDP annually or 4-5% of the disposable income, he said.
""Given the limited social security net, there is a natural floor to the levels to which savings can fall, which in turn will put a natural break to the consumption growth,"" he said.
When asked about the auto sector, he said no one expected a ""collapse"" in the sector like this and blamed the same to a shift to the shared-mobility economy and the continuous talks on electric mobility. Next few weeks will be critical which will shape the future of the sector, he added.
The government needs to put road projects on a fast track by focusing on two-three big projects, fast track the PM's Kisan Yojana to boost rural consumption and work on taxation through simplification and also lowering rates, he said.
Early resolution to the NBFC crisis, which fuelled a part of the consumption in the last few years, is also ""critical"", Muhnot said.
While declining comment on the outlook which the house keeps on equities till December, he sought to cite a silver lining. Usually, the markets price in a slowdown before it hits the real sector, he said, and pointed out to the recent slump in market indices as an indication of the risks being priced in, he said.
SBI Mutual Fund also said it has been able to change the perceptions on how it votes and companies are discussing proposals with it before hand because of the fear of a negative voting when it is taken to the shareholders.
He cited the case of a company whose stock tanked 20% after an announcement of diversifying into the tyre business only to retract it a day later, to claim that the markets are punishing the wrongdoers on environment, social and governance front.

New Delhi: Retirement fund manager EPFO is likely to appoint next week at its trustees' meet asset management firms HSBC AMC, UTI AMC and SBI Mutual Fund as its fund managers for a three-year term. The Employees' Provident Fund Organisation's (EPFO) advisory body Finance, Audit and Investment Committee (FAIC) has finalised and recommended the names of three asset management firms - HSBC AMC, UTI AMC and SBI Mutual Fund - for appointment as fund mangers of the retirement fund of the body for a three-year term beginning October 1, 2019, a source said.
Now the proposal finalised by the FAIC would be placed before the EPFO's apex decision-making body Central Board of Trustees (CBT) headed by Labour Minister on August 21, 2019 for final approval, the source said.
The appointment of the fund managers for another term of three years has been pending with the EPFO since April last year. The body had appointed SBI, ICICI Securities Primary Dealership, Reliance Capital and HSBC AMC for a three-year term, starting April 1, 2015.
Thereafter, the EPFO gave many extensions to the five fund managers. Now the extended term of the five fund mangers would expire on September 30, 2019.
Earlier this year, the EPFO had made it clear that the SBI as a bank could not continue as the fund mangers of the body. Therefore SBI's asset management firm SBI Mutual Fund had submitted bids in this round of bidding for appointment as fund manager.
The source said that the names of three asset management firms have been finalised by the FAIC on the basis of their performance in the past years.
The EPFO had appointed multiple fund managers for the first time in July 2008, for earning better rate of return on deposits for its subscribers. Before that, SBI was the sole fund manager for the retirement fund body since its inception in 1952.

NEW DELHI,
		             MUMBAI :
India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is extending loan repayment time for stressed automobile dealers by 15 to 30 days amid slowing car sales, a top bank official said.
“Normally, the repayment period is 60 days. So, we extend it to 75 days for some dealers and to 90 days for a few others,"" P.K. Gupta, managing director of SBI, told reporters.
The bank has an exposure of  ₹11,500 crore to auto dealers.
Gupta said that currently, some automobile dealers are facing difficulty in repaying loans as per schedule.
“We are talking to each dealer and had meetings with all the industry majors and with the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (Fada). We are very actively engaged with all of them on a case-to-case basis. We have been working out solutions along with other banks for dealers facing problems on account of higher inventory,"" said Gupta.
He summarized the slowdown in the automobile sector as a problem of inventory piling up at dealerships amid falling car sales.
India’s passenger vehicle industry recorded its worst performance in nearly 19 years in July as sales fell 31% to 200,790 vehicles from 290,931 units a year earlier, showed data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).
“Our discussions with dealers’ associations suggest that the festive season is going to start soon and then they will be able to clear most of the inventory and most of the accounts may not turn into NPAs. But it will all depend on what kind of demand revival takes place,"" said Gupta.
Meanwhile, SBI on Sunday, like several other public sector banks, said in a statement that it has conducted sessions with officials starting from the branch level to chalk out a roadmap for reviving credit flow.
The flurry of meetings follows a nudge from the central government asking them to come up with suggestions on the future of the banking industry.
News agency PTI reported on Friday that the finance ministry has asked public sector banks to initiate a month-long consultation process with officers starting from the branch level to seek suggestions for streamlining banking and achieving a $5-trillion economy in five years.
Gupta said the consultation was conducted to review the performance of the bank on various parameters; to look at issues where the bank has done well and look at the areas where performance has not been up to the mark.
“The intention is a bottom-up approach. This conclave comprised branch managers all across the country and they were all overseen by the top management, starting from the chairman, the managing directors, deputy managing directors and chief general managers,"" he said.
Areas specifically looked at in the conclave, Gupta said, included digital payments, corporate governance in public sector banks (PSBs), credit for India’s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and enabling India to become a $5-trillion economy. Meanwhile, a statement from the bank said it collectively identified many implementable and innovative suggestions which can help to improve the bank’s performance and establish a future roadmap.
“These suggestions were collated and have been sent to the regional/zonal level for further discussions at the state level bankers’ committee, along with comparative performance assessment of the branches under each region,"" it said."

Indian equities may tick higher on Monday riding on optimism in global markets. Asian stocks rose on Monday as hope of more stimulus from central banks around the world and steps being taken by major economies such as Germany and China soothed investors' fear of a sharp global economic slump.
Over recent weeks, recession anxiety - triggered by an inversion in the US bond yield curve - has led to a shakeout in financial markets. That has driven speculation of more support from policy makers, including the US Federal Reserve which last month cut rates for the first time since the financial crisis.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.25%. Australian stocks added 0.7%, South Korea's KOSPI advanced 0.5% and Japan's Nikkei rose 0.7%.
Wall Street stocks had rebounded on Friday after a report said Germany's coalition government was prepared to set aside its balanced budget rule in order to take on new debt and launch stimulus steps to counter a possible recession.
Moreover, in a move viewed as a guided rate cut China's central bank on Saturday unveiled key interest rate reform to help steer borrowing costs lower for companies and support a slowing economy caught in the grip of a bruising trade war with the US.
Back home, India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) is extending loan repayment time for stressed automobile dealers by 15 to 30 days amid slowing car sales, a top bank official said.

Investment, merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the roads sector has picked up pace this year as foreign investors pump in millions of dollars to acquire operating roads and developers look to sell assets to pare debt. So far this year, road deals worth around $1.8 billion have been announced. That compares with the entire last year’s deal activity of $2 billion, according to data from consulting firm EY and Mint analysis.
Among primary markets, Spandana Sphoorty Financial Ltd will make stock markets debut on Monday with a share price of  ₹856 per share.
In currencies, the yen, a gauge of risk sentiment due to its perceived status as a safe haven asset, weakened for the third successive session. The Japanese currency last traded at 106.440 per dollar, having pulled back from a seven-month peak near 105.000 reached a week ago when events including unrest in Hong Kong and a meltdown in Argentina's markets triggered a fresh bout of anxiety in markets already shaken by the US-China trade war.
Elsewhere in currency market, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies, hovered near a two-week high of 98.339 climbed on Friday. The index was supported as US Treasury yields bounced back from recent lows in the wake of German stimulus hopes.
The 10-year US Treasury yield stood at 1.575%, having pulled away from a three-year trough of 1.475% marked last week. The euro was steady at $1.1089 while the Australian dollar nudged up 0.15% to $0.6786.
Brent crude oil futures gained 0.68% to $59.04 per barrel, following improved equity markets, with an ebb in recession concerns easing fears of weak global demand for commodities. The longer-term outlook for the crude oil market, however, remained somber, with the OPEC on Friday painting a bearish outlook for oil for the rest of 2019.

327,2019-08-19,State Bank,"RBI on its part has announced several measures to support the NBFC sectorKumar ruled out the need for any further measures for the non-banks

Mumbai: State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar on Monday said the government and Reserve Bank of India are unlikely to come out with any stimulus package for the non-banking finance (NBFC) sector. Kumar also ruled out the need for any further measures for non-banks.
""For the NBFC sector, the government and Reserve Bank of India have done enough. It is now only the execution and roll out by the lenders. NBFC sector I don't think there is anything remaining which can be done by the government. Partial credit enhancement, interest rates have moderated. So what else can you demand,"" said Kumar on the sidelines of FIBAC2019, a banking conclave organised by Indian Banks’ Association and industry body FICCI.
In the Union budget, the government had announced a partial credit guarantee scheme which encouraged banks to buy high-rated pooled assets of up to  ₹1 lakh crore of financially sound NBFCs, for which the Centre will provide a one-time six-month partial credit guarantee for the first loss of up to 10%.
To support this measure, RBI tweaked banks’ bond-holding norms, allowing them to classify government securities of up to 1% of the deposit base as high-quality assets under Basel III norms. This will allow banks to borrow an additional  ₹1.34 lakh crore exclusively for buying such pooled assets and giving loans to NBFCs.
The government also amended the RBI Act, giving the central bank power to remove any director and supersede the board of directors of NBFCs for five years if the affairs of non-banks are conducted in a manner detrimental to the interests of creditors or depositors, or financial stability.
RBI on its part also announced several measures to support the sector, including increase in the ceiling for bank’s exposure to a single NBFC to 20% of its Tier I capital from 15% earlier. The central bank has also allowed bank lending to NBFCs, excluding microfinance institutions, for on-lending to certain sectors to be classified as priority sector loans."

Under the India income tax law, exchange rate for conversion of income earned in foreign currency into Indian rupees is the telegraphic transfer buying rate (TTBR) issued by State Bank of India. For rental income earned in foreign currency, TTBR of last day of the financial year needs to be considered.

MUMBAI :
If the largest lender SBI has its way, it may herald the beginning of the end of the ubiquitous debt cards from the banking system as the bank plans to promote more digital payment solutions and eliminate the plastic cards.
This is despite the huge reliance on debit cards by customers of SBI which services a fifth of the population.
""...it is our wish to eliminate the debit cards, and am sure we can eliminate them,"" chairman Rajnish Kumar said, speaking at the annual Fibac here Monday.
He said there are around 90 crore debit cards in the country as against 3 crore credit cards, and pointed out to digital solutions like its own 'Yono' platform as the key for achieving a debit card-less country.
Kumar said through the Yono platform, one can withdraw cash at the automated teller machines or pay for purchases at a merchant establishment without having a card at all.
He said the bank has already set up 68,000 'Yono cashpoints' and is in the process of scaling it up massively to over 1 million in the next 18 months, which will make the necessity to have a card even less.
Additionally, the Yono platform can also give credit for buying certain merchandise, making the credit card in the pocket also as a ""stand-by"", Kumar said.
In the next five years, there will be a limited need to have any plastic cards in your pocket, Kumar said, pointing out that virtual coupons is the future.

MUMBAI :
Even as RBI governor Shaktikanta Das pitched for a system-wide adoption of repo-linked pricing of loans and deposits, private sector lender Axis Bank on Monday said it is not the only measure for better transmission of central bank's policy moves.
The third-largest private sector lender's executive director for corporate lending Rajiv Anand blamed liquidity issues prevented banks cutting the lending rates till June and that with better liquidity conditions since then, banks have been passing on the benefits of the RBI rate cuts.
With the further easing in liquidity conditions as seen in the recent days through the excess availability of  ₹2 trillion per day, banks will do more rate cuts, Anand said.
""It's not necessary to use only external benchmarks, there are multiple avenues to meet the requirement that the RBI wants us to do... What RBI is essentially looking at is that the rates are being cut and there should be better transmission,"" he said.
Anand was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual industry conference Fibac, hours after Das made the suggestion that the time has come to formalise the external benchmark or repo-linked system for new loans, which will ensure faster transmission of rates.
The comments come at a time when pushing up the sagging economic growth has become the biggest focus for the policymakers, which has ensured rate cuts of 110 bps by the RBI in four simultaneous rate cuts.
Anand also flagged the risks of such a move of linking interest rate to the repo rate set by RBI for the customers.
""Remember that repo rates typically will be more volatile than MCLR for example,"" he said, speaking in support of the present marginal cost of funding based lending rate being followed at present.
""Generally, we've seen that retail customers, when the rates are falling, they want to see faster transmission but remember that faster transmission will happen on the way up as well,"" he said.
Anand said the retail customers do not wish for volatilities in their loan pricing and hence, such linkage will be more useful for the corporate borrowers.
""As long as banks are able to meet the requirement as to transmit faster, I think there are multiple roads to achieve that,"" he said.
It can be noted that market leader SBI has been the first to move by linking its loan pricing to newer borrowers to the repo rate, while its closest rival Bank of Baroda has also followed suit.
State-run PNB managing director Sunil Mehta told reporters that the lender will also be making a shift in the next seven days and added that there is adequate liquidity in the system.
Declining to spell out whether his bank is planning to offer repo linked loans, Anand said Axis Bank's asset liability committee will take a call on the same.
To a question about the fate of existing borrowers, and if they also get to enjoy the benefits of lower repo rates, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said all of it will depend on how soon the banks are able to reprice its old liabilities, but declined to give a timeline for the same.
It can be noted that till the last rate cut of 0.35%, the banks have passed out only 0.29% of the 0.75% in rate cuts initiated by the RBI to the final borrowers. However, RBI's last cut delivered earlier this month has led to a rash of rate cuts by the lenders by up to 0.10%."

NEW DELHI :
Public sector banks are gearing up to introduce retail products, including housing and auto loans, on 'psbloansin59minutes' portal with a view to expand their retail loan business.
Currently, the portal gives in-principle approval for loans of up to Rs1 crore to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in just 59 minutes or less than an hour.
However, some of the banks including State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, and Corporation Bank decided to extend in-principle approval to loans of up to Rs5 crore through the portal.
Bank of India is now planning to onboard some of the retail products on the portal for easier access to loan products.
The bank is working on this and home and auto loan will be onboarded on the portal going forward, Bank of India General Manager Salil Kumar Swain told PTI.
Another state-owned lender Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) also plans to offer retail loan products on the portal.
IOB has been actively participating on the portal for sanction of MSME loans and the bank has achieved a remarkable improvement in sanctioning of loans, as the number of cases and amount sanctioned shows a manifold increase since its inception, the bank said in a statement last week.
""As the scheme has drawn healthy response from the borrowers, bank is in the process of extending in-principle sanction for loans up to Rs5 crores under MSME. In due course of time, bank will also offer retail products (housing loan & personal loan) under this platform,"" it said.
The platform has helped in expediting loan disbursement and bringing ease in banking process by saving time for both bankers and customers, a senior official of another public sector bank said.
If other products are introduced on the platform, it will help expand the retail business of the bank and also bring down the transaction cost, the officer said.
The platform has helped reduce turnaround time for loan processes in such a way that MSMEs get an eligibility letter and in-principle approval in 59 minutes and can choose the bank of their choice. After the approval letter is received, the loan is expected to be disbursed in 7-8 working days.
Touted as country's largest online lending platform, the portal was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2018 with an aim to make credit access and banking for MSMEs transparent and hassle-free.
The portal sanctioned loans worth over Rs35,000 crore in less than four months from its launch.
As on March 31, 2019, more than 50,706 proposals had got in-principle approval and 27,893 proposals had been sanctioned."

For effective transmission of the RBI's lower policy rates, the country's largest lender SBI on Tuesday suggested the regulator should ask banks to link incremental bulk deposits to repo rate as it would help in reducing cost of funds without hurting small depositors and senior citizens.
Reserve Bank of India Governor Shaktikanta Das has stressed the need for the entire banking system to link their loans and deposits pricing to the repo rate (short-term borrowing rate) prescribed by the central bank. A dozen public sector banks, including State Bank of India (SBI), have voluntarily linked their interest rates to repo.
""However, for external benchmarking, it is not possible for banks to only link the asset side of the balance sheet to an external benchmark creating significant asset-liability management (ALM),"" SBI said in its research report 'Ecowrap'.
About 35% of bank liabilities are savings bank (SB) deposit.
Further, the banks are also not able to link external benchmark to the entire liabilities (especially time deposits), as the floating term deposits are not accepted by the Indian depositors and have already been unsuccessfully experimented by some peer banks in the country, it added.
""The key to effective transmission, thus we believe, is adjusting either SB or time deposits,"" the report said.
SB deposits typically serve the transaction needs of the depositor. The option is always available with the customer to transfer the surplus SB balance to time deposits.
However, the problem is it cannot be done in isolation by any one bank and has to be enforced by the regulator, it said.
""The best option we believe could be that regulator enforces all incremental bulk deposits henceforth to be repo linked/flexible,"" SBI's Ecowrap said.
In India, single rupee deposits of  ₹2 crore and above are considered as bulk deposits and banks have discretion to offer differential rate of interest on bulk deposits.
According to the report, the share of bulk deposits in banks' total deposits could be around 30 per cent after the definitional change.
Most of the bulk deposits are from institutions, the report said, adding that it is thus logical that large institutions could afford to take interest rate risk as this would spare the retail depositors from taking the same.
As per the study, bank deposit rates remain the largest constraining factor in rate transmission.
For example, a 100-basis point cut in deposit rates could result in 45-50 basis points reduction in lending rates.
""Interestingly, small savings rate is not a constraining factor as incremental small saving collections are merely 11 per cent of incremental deposits!
""However, in a developing country like India, cutting deposit rates always remains a challenge given that a large populace of senior citizens depend on interest income from deposits as a source of livelihood!,"" it said.
Timely transmission of the monetary policy rate in its entirety is imperative to ensure that the beneficiaries are receiving or bearing the effect of the changes of the bi-monthly monetary policy, the report said.

The fund managers invest 85% of the EPFO money in debt investments and the remaining 15% in equity through exchange traded funds (ETFs). The new fund managers will be the custodians of the EPFO corpus and its investments from October this year. Every year, EPFO gets deposits of more than  ₹1.2 trillion from its subscribers.
In end-March, SBI said that as a bank it cannot be a fund manager and hence ceased to be a fund manager of EPFO from the current financial year. Later, SBI’s asset management firm, SBI Mutual Fund, submitted bids and was selected as one of the fund managers. The performance of a portfolio manager is key to getting good returns on EPFO investments.
Dias said that EPFO officials and the labour ministry also reiterated the commitment to pay 8.65% rate of interest to the subscribers.
“The ministry is not going back on the interest rate announced and said that they are confident of the finance ministry giving them a go ahead soon,"" he said after the meeting in Hyderabad."
316,2019-08-21,State Bank,"RLLR-based home loan will ensure faster rate cut transmissionIn the past, there has been a lot of talk of banks not being able to effectively transmit rate cuts to customers

Moving away from a system of home loans linked to marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR), several banks launched repo-linked lending rate (RLLR) products after the monetary policy committee cut repo rates by 35 basis points in August. In the past, there has been a lot of talk of banks not being able to effectively transmit repo rate cuts to their customers.
State Bank of India (SBI) launched RLLR-based home loan on 1 July. This home loan will be explicitly linked to the RBI’s repo rate and one can directly benefit from a rate cut. SBI has also linked the interest rate on savings bank balances above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate.
Bank of Baroda (BoB), too, announced a new home loan product linked to RLLR on 11 August, as did Oriental Bank of Commerce. Other banks are also likely to follow suit soon. For the time being, the new products are largely restricted to home and auto loans. If you have been wondering why you have not benefited from rate cuts as a borrower, read on to find out why these new products may just be the answer.

Necessary shift
The repo (or repurchase) rate is the rate at which the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lends money to other banks. Ideally, all interest rates including home loan rates are supposed to be linked to this rate. Hence, cuts in the repo rate are meant to lead to cuts in home loan and other lending rates as banks get to borrow money cheaply from the RBI. However, under the MCLR system, these cuts linked to repo rate (called transmission) were not happening despite RBI rate cuts of 1.1% cumulatively in calendar year 2019. RBI’s statement in June noted that a 0.5% cumulative cut in February and April resulted in only 0.21% average reduction in fresh rupee loans. On past loans, the weighted average lending rate actually went up by 4 basis points or 0.04%. Even if banks were to cut rates, for MCLR-linked loans, there is a reset clause, which means that there can be a lag in your home loan rate being changed even if the MCLR changes. But, in the case of RLLR, this won’t happen and the change will happen from the first day of the following month. The RBI is also reportedly mulling making such a linkage compulsory for all banks.
According to Adhil Shetty, chief executive officer, BankBazaar, the RLLR has been on the cards for some time. “With the repo-linked rate, there will be greater transparency about how the rates are fixed and the transmission of the change in repo rates will be more prompt, enabling greater benefits for customers,"" he said.
What it means for you
Note that the SBI RLLR includes a “spread"" or margin above the RBI rate. This is 2.25% at present. In addition, the bank will charge another 0.40% or 0.55% depending on the borrower’s creditworthiness. This means that the current repo rate of 5.40% translates to 8.05% or 8.20% as your home loan rate. For loans above  ₹75 lakh, the spread for creditworthiness ranges from 0.95% to 1.10% (see graphic).
“Fresh borrowers should absolutely go for these repo rate-linked loans since the rate transmission is so transparent,"" said Gaurav Gupta, chief executive officer, Myloancare, an online lending platform. However, for existing borrowers he struck a more cautious note. “The rate cut should be at least 0.5% lower than the existing loan cost for a switch to be worthwhile as customers face costs like processing fee and stamp duty while switching,"" he said. Your existing bank may soon launch such a product allowing you a cheaper and more hassle-free switch into it."
318,2019-08-21,State Bank,"In July, SBI was the first bank to introduce home loan rate linked to RBI's repo rateUnder the new home loan product from SBI, the interest rate changes automatically from the next month of RBI's repo rate cut/increase

India's biggest bank SBI or State Bank of India became the first bank to offer a home loan product where the interest rate was linked to RBI's lending rate, repo rate. This new home loan product was launched by SBI in July. Earlier, from May, SBI had linked large savings account (balance above  ₹1 lakh) and all cash credit and overdraft accounts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate. After SBI, some other banks like Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and Bank of Baroda have come up with new home products, linking them to RBI's repo rates. Recently, Reserve Bank of India chief Shaktikanta Das urged banks to link their loans and deposits pricing to the repo rate for better transmission of interest rates across the banking sector. More banks are likely to follow SBI in launching repo rate linked products.
How SBI's repo-linked home loan works
1) This new home loan product from SBI is linked to the bank's repo rate lending rate (RLLR), which in turn is linked to RBI's repo rate. RLLR is 225 bps over repo rate. As and when there is a change in RBI's repo rate, SBI's RLLR changes automatically and thus the home loan rate.
2) In case the RBI changes the repo rate, SBI's repo rate lending rate will change from the first day of the following month. For example, RBI cut repo rate by 35 bps earlier this month and accordingly SBI's RLLR will change from September 1.
3) SBI's repo rate lending rate was 8.00% as on 1 July 2019. From September 1, after the RBI's 35 bps cut on 6th August, SBI's RLLR will fall to 7.65%.
4) SBI then charges a spread, depending on the borrower's credit score (RLLR+40 bps or RLLR +55 bps) for home loans up to  ₹75 lakh.
5) So, from September 1, for borrowers with good credit score, SBI will charge 8.05% (RLLR of 7.65% + 40 basis points) on this new scheme.
6) The spread fixed at the time of first disbursement in home loan will remain fixed for the entire tenor of the home loan, says SBI.
7) The spread increases to RLLR + 95 bps or RLLR +110 bps in case of home loans above  ₹75 lakh.
8) SBI claims that currently it offers ""cheapest home loan with interest rate of 8.05% as repo rate linked home loan and this rate will be applicable to all existing and new loan from 1st September.""
9) For SBI customers, whose home loan rates are linked to the MCLR or Marginal Cost of fund based lending rate, the bank had reduced one-year MCLR to 8.25% per annum effective from 10 August, from 8.40% earlier.
If your SBI floating rate home loan is linked to MCLR, you will have a reset clause. It is typically linked to one-year MCLR and thus you will have a one-year reset clause. If the reset clause was in July and the MCLR cut happened in August, your home loan rate will not change till next July. MCLR is linked to the bank's actual deposit rate.
10) So basically, the transmission of change in RBI's repo rate is immediate in case of SBI's repo linked home loan while there is a lag in case of MCLR-linked loans."

Jaipur: SBI or State Bank of India has no plans to discontinue debit cards but increased use of the digital platform will itself reduce the requirement of the debit cards, said its chairman Rajnish Kumar. SBI is planning to establish nearly 10 lakh YONO Cash Points in the country over 18 months. The platform is secure and will eliminate the requirement of using debit cards, Kumar said. 
""A customer can make bill payments and can do digital transactions by using the YONO cash feature. We are considering establishing close to 10 lakh YONO Cash Points in 18 months. Nearly 70,000 Cash Points have already been established,"" he said at a press conference.
YONO is a digital banking platform of State Bank of India (SBI) and customers can use it on their smartphones to withdraw cash, make transactions and payments.
He added that the bank's new offer about repo rate-linked home loan is getting good response from customers. It is the customers' choice either to go with the new product or with the MCLR-linked home loan, Kumar added.
Talking about the slowdown in the automobile sector, he said there are certain trends in the market and they need to be analysed.
""It is an apparent global trend now that people are shifting from vehicle ownership to vehicle rental model due to several reasons like uncertainty of jobs and convenience. The trend should be analysed to figure out how much it is impacting the automobile industry,"" he said.
He also said there was a need to look into the agriculture sector in order to make it commercially viable sector.
""Due to issues in productivity, it sometimes becomes difficult for farmers to repay the loan. The government takes decision for loan waiver but despite the loan waiver, the condition of farmers does not improve, therefore, it should be looked into to ensure that the sector becomes commercially viable and the condition of farmers also improves,"" he said.
The banker also highlighted the advantages of YONO app for the agriculture sector. He said fertilisers, seeds, agriculture tools and equipments can be purchased on reasonable price by using YONO Mandi app."

1) “Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over one and a half percent, in continuation to prevailing corrective phase. The recent fall is a result of growing uneasiness among the participants as they are keenly awaiting some action from the government to boost the market sentiment. Besides, feeble global cues are further adding to the negativity,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking.
2) “Nifty has now reached closer to its immediate and critical support of 10,750 so we may see some consolidation or pause ahead. We suggest continuing with “sell on rise"" approach and focusing more on stock selection now,"" he added.

311,2019-08-24,State Bank,"Financial planners suggest continuing with your investmentsYour mutual fund SIP investments should continue as you are getting more units for the same money

MUMBAI :
The economic indicators are signalling a prolonged slowdown in the economy. The unemployment rate in India is at 6.1%, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The liquidity crunch, NBFC crises and credit downgrades in the financial services sector have spurred some serious downturn in consumption. “There are evidences of a serious slowdown in consumption as reflected in sales of automobiles, FMCG, air travel, textiles and other discretionary products amid patchy monsoon,"" said Navneet Munot, chief investment officer, SBI Funds Management Pvt. Ltd.
The sale of passenger vehicles declined 21.56% in April-july 2019 from the same period last year, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). Credit-rating agencies have projected a negative outlook for the overall growth rate in India.
Global factors have also played a huge role. “The dollar has been so strong meaning that the money flowing into emerging markets will slow down,"" said Manish Gunwani, Cioequity investments, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd.
Two things that have been hit hard are industries and investment, said Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. In this time, analysts and financial planners suggest continuing with your investments. “The long-term structural growth story looks intact. However, the near-term outlook does not look favourable because of which we are seeing some volatility and outflow from the market,"" said Swarup Mohanty, chief executive officer, Mirae Asset Global Investments.
It is an opportune time for equity investors to accumulate. “Markets being low translate to an appropriate time to accumulate your equity investments to record strong returns. Your SIP investments should continue as you are getting more units for the same money,"" he said. With lump sum investments too, you are getting more value for your money during this time. It is not a bad time for new investors to enter either. “You should stick to asset allocation. A new investor can maintain 65:35 ratio between large- and mid-cap investments for equity investments,"" said Mohanty.
The large-cap investments can take care of the stability, while the mid-cap investment can take one or two kicks to the returns of your overall portfolio. However, you should consult with your financial planner or financial advisor before investing.
When it comes to the debt markets, there has been a significant rally and the money market yields have gone down. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen 11.02% since January and 6.3% since June according to data retrieved from the Bloomberg Terminal. “That is what happens. In a low inflationary environment and low growth period, debt funds investments do well. The reason is people want to move to safe investments and the demand for bonds pushes the prices up, leading to capital gains for debt fund investors,"" said Hajra.
He further said that it cannot be ruled out that the 10-year bond yield can breach 6% and the yield curve will go down."

309,2019-08-26,State Bank,"Growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio more stable and increased marginsThe growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio of life insurers more stable and increased margins

Selling life insurance has never been easy, but getting investors to buy their stocks is becoming all too easy for life insurers. A booming business and a growing market share have led to big gains for the three listed life insurance companies in India.
Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd have surged 33.59% and 37.37%, respectively, so far this year. Even ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd hasn’t fared badly, with returns of 19.14%, although its growth in the past two quarters has been wanting. In comparison, the Nifty Financial Services index has risen about 4.27% in 2019.
There are several factors that seem to have worked for life insurance companies. But, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd highlighted the main reason.
“Private insurers (excluding ICICI Prudential Life) continue to deliver robust growth in spite of volatile markets; this, coupled with increasing protection share in the business mix, justifies the re-rating in the last four months, in our view,"" it said in a note to clients.
In the first four months of FY20, private sector insurers saw 23% new business growth in retail, in terms of annualized premium equivalent, even as the overall industry growth was 15%, primarily due to Life Insurance Corporation of India’s (LIC’s) 5.5% growth.
This growth was led by non-participatory and annuity products.
Aggressive marketing of term plans in the past two years has helped HDFC Life and even its peers corner market share from the country’s largest life insurer, LIC.
“Shrinking profitability of linked business has made it a mere revenue driver, edging players to move towards non-linked products (protection, annuities and return-guarantee) for profitability,"" said Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note.
The growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio of life insurers more stable and increased margins.
Life insurance stocks are likely to continue to enjoy investor attention over the next few quarters, too, though analysts warned that the profitability metrics may have peaked for some firms."

307,2019-08-27,State Bank,"The RBI has approved a record  ₹1.76 lakh crore payout to the governmentThe rupee and bond market also cheered the higher-than-expected RBI payout

Favourable domestic cues along with higher global markets helped Indian stock market benchmarks Sensex and Nifty rise for the third straight day. The Sensex ended 147 points higher at 37,641 while Nifty settled 0.43% higher at 11,105, driven by gains in banking, auto and energy stocks. Some selling in IT stocks capped gains. The Reserve Bank of India on Monday approved a record  ₹1.76 lakh crore payout to the government, boosting the Centre's coffers at a time when it is under pressure to provide a stimulus to the economy. The rupee and bond markets also cheered the higher RBI payout.
The market breath was also strong with BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising 0.53% and 1.6% respectively.
Among the Sensex stocks, Tata Motors surged 9% while Tata Steel, NTPC, IndusInd Bank, Vedanta and M&M gained between 2% and 4%. Frontline IT stocks were under pressure today with Infosys, Tech Mahindra and TCS declining between 1.5% and 2.5%.
""The recent announcement made by the finance minister and the outcome of RBI board meet are definitely positive for the Indian markets. This is likely to lift domestic sentiments in the near term. Going forward, the market participants would keep a close watch on currency movement and upcoming Q1FY20 GDP data. Globally, trade tensions between US-China is likely to induce volatility into the Indian markets. Hence, it would be prudent to stick with quality names while investing or trading,"" said Ajit Mishra,  vice president for research at Religare Broking.
The RBI's transfer of  ₹1.76 lakh crore to the government included  ₹1.23 lakh crore as dividend and  ₹52,640 crore from its surplus capital. The dividend payment includes  ₹28,000 crore already transferred to the government as interim dividend in February.
This  ₹1.76 lakh crore payout is much higher than the government’s budget estimate of  ₹90,000 crore as dividend from the RBI this year. The RBI pays dividends to the government every year, based on the profits from its investments and printing of notes and coins.
The record transfer of dividend and surplus capital will ease the fiscal pressure of the government, say economists.
The rupee today strengthened to 71.60 today as compared to its previous close of 72.02. 
 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week announced various steps to spur growth including upfront capital infusion of  ₹70,000 crore in state-run lenders.
Moody’s Investors Service's vice president for Sovereign Risk Group, William Foster, said: ""We expect the measures to provide some support to investor and business sentiment, and the acceleration of the capitalization of public sector banks to help improve the provision of credit and transmission of monetary policy easing. However, we also expect domestic and external headwinds to persist over the course of the year, resulting in 6.4% real GDP growth in the fiscal year ending in March 2020, before growth picks up to 6.8% next year.""
Global markets were mostly higher today as investors turned cautiously optimistic about the prospects of a breakthrough in the US-China trade war. US President Donald Trump on Monday flagged the possibility of a trade deal with China and said he believed Beijing was sincere in its desire to reach an agreement. (With Agency Inputs)"

305,2019-08-29,State Bank,"Air India Assets Holding’s debt repayment will sharply lower interest obligations of the national airlineProceeds of issue will be used to retire working capital debt parked in the special purpose vehicle

NEW DELHI :
Lenders to Air India Ltd are set for major relief as Air India Assets Holding Ltd (AIAHL) is expected to repay  ₹22,000 crore of its  ₹29,464 crore of its working capital debt next month, a move that will also sharply lower the interest obligations of the national carrier, said two people with direct knowledge of the matter.
AIAHL, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) created to warehouse the debt of Air India, will raise the money through a government-guaranteed bond issue, said one of the persons mentioned above, requesting anonymity.
The proceeds of the bond will be used to retire working capital debt parked in the SPV, the person said.
The rupee-denominated bond issue and the subsequent repayment of the working capital debt will nearly halve the interest servicing outgo for Air India from  ₹4,500-5,000 crore a year to about  ₹2,700 crore a year, said the other person, who also did not want to be named.
Air India’s lenders include state-run banks such as Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank, State Bank of India, United Bank of India, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, and Punjab National Bank, and private lenders such as Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered and JPMorgan.
Air India’s net debt swelled from about  ₹55,000 crore at the end of March 2018 to  ₹58,351.93 crore at the end of March 2019. Aircraft debt makes up the difference between total debt and the working capital debt of  ₹29,464 crore.
Air India is expected to have incurred a loss of  ₹7,365 crore in the year ended 31 March 2019, compared to the  ₹5,337 crore loss it reported in the previous year, according to provisional figures issued by the government in June.
The losses can be attributed to a weak rupee, higher fuel prices and the high-interest rate burden on its debt, said the second person mentioned above.
“Air India will become more efficient if its net debt is reduced by about half as this will leave more cash in the airline’s hands to spend,"" the person said.
Air India, which has about 128 aircraft, began operations on 13 new domestic routes and six international ones in the last fiscal.
The cash-strapped airline, which is surviving on government bailout, has received an equity infusion of  ₹30,520.21 crore from the government so far as a part of the 2012 Turn Around Plan (TAP).
AIAHL was set up by the government in February 2019 to park accumulated working capital loans not backed by any asset along with four subsidiaries of the airline, Air India Air Transport Services Ltd (AIATSL), Airline Allied Services Ltd (AASL), Air India Engineering Services Ltd. (AIESL), and Hotel Corporation of India Ltd (HCI), non-core assets, painting and artefacts and other non-operational assets of Air India Ltd.
As of now, only one subsidiary of Air India, namely AIATSL, has been transferred to AIAHL, in line with the share purchase agreement between Air India Ltd and AIAHL subject to conditions which include the approval of lenders."

Mumbai: SBI Card & Payments Services Ltd, the credit card subsidiary of State Bank of India (SBI), plans to raise about 80 billion Indian rupees ($1.12 billion) via an initial public offering this year, a senior SBI executive involved in the process said.
SBI has already tapped banks to run the IPO process and a listing is expected to happen in the last quarter of this financial year, bank officials have previously said.
""Roughly about an 8% stake will be divested and after seeing the valuations and the inputs we are getting it would translate to 80 billion rupees,"" said the source directly involved in the process, who asked not to be named as the details are not public.
This would value the overall business at about 1 trillion rupees ($14 billion).
SBI and SBI Card did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
At the end of March 31, 2019, SBI Card, which is 74% owned by SBI and 26% by U.S private equity firm Carlyle Group, had total assets worth 195.93 billion rupees.
India's credit card market is still small compared to its debit card market. The latest regulatory data shows that there were 49.6 million credit cards in circulation in the country, compared with 836 million debit cards.
SBI Card is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country, with 8.8 million outstanding cards as of June 30. It only trails private lender HDFC Bank in terms of the number of cards issued.
Earlier this year, home-grown ride hailing company Ola had partnered with SBI Card to launch a co-branded credit card, allowing the company to expand its customer base.
SBI's management has been looking at selling its investment in non-core assets to raise capital.
SBI Card will be SBI's second subsidiary to be listed. In 2017, the bank's life insurance usiness SBI Life Insurance was listed in a 84 billion rupees IPO.
It was the biggest IPO after Coal India's in 2010.

New Delhi: SBI Card will soon launch RuPay credit cards, a development which will give a boost to the homegrown payment network in the fast growing segment.
Presently, the credit card segment is dominated by the US-based payment gateways like Visa and Mastercard.
RuPay is the first-of-its-kind domestic debit and credit card payment network of India developed by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), an umbrella organisation for operating retail payments and settlement systems.
""We will be (launching RuPay based credit card) soon. There is a last agreement that is left out at the end of NPCI level. I think NPCI is going to send it any day and we will be launching some products,"" SBI Card MD and CEO Hardayal Prasad said in an interview to PTI.
Expressing confidence that RuPay credit card will be launched in this fiscal only, Prasad said, ""It's just a matter of time. The Rupay will become very popular and will be used in India aggressively. I have no doubts on it"".
He said that there is a big ""nationalistic segment"" which is insisting on RuPay cards. About one-third of the cards being issued by India's largest lender State Bank of India are RuPay cards, he said.
""There are class of customers who want RuPay card. There are those nationalistic people who say 'give us only Rupay cards'. So I am very upbeat,"" he said.
The company may issue both RuPay as well as Visa/Mastercard to its customers, specially who travel abroad, Prasad said.
As of now, RuPay cards are accepted only in few countries, including Singapore and Bhutan. Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently launched the card in UAE.
RuPay has also tied-up with international players like Discover, Japan Credit Bureau and China Union Pay to enhance its international acceptance.
Prasad further said that SBI Card has rolled out its chatbot 'ILA' (Interactive Live Assistant) on its mobile app to further enhance consumer experience.
ILA has 40 plus innovative features making SBI Card one of the first in the industry to offer a complete suite of self-service functionalities increasing convenience for the customers, he said.
""Since its release, SBI Card's chatbot has successfully resolved over 14 million queries with over 97 per cent accuracy,"" he added.
SBI Card had 90 lakh customers at end-July with a market share of 17.9 per cent.
According to Prasad, the company has been adding 3 lakh cards per month since December 2018.

302,2019-09-01,State Bank,"Under SBI's repo-linked home loan, the interest rate is linked to RBI's policy rateInterest rate on this SBI home loan product helps in immediate transmission of RBI's rate cuts to borrowers

State Bank of India or SBI was the first bank in India to offer a home loan product in which the interest rate is linked to the Reserve Bank's repo rate, when it launched the scheme in July this year. Subsequently, many banks, including PNB and Bank of Baroda, have come up repo-linked home loan products and more banks are expected to offer such products in near future. Interest rate under SBI's repo-linked home loan product will fall to 8.05% from today (September 1), from 8.4% earlier, after RBI last month reduced repo rate by 35 basis points. This rate will be applicable to all existing and new repo-rate linked loan customers of SBI.
SBI's chairman Rajnish Kumar has said that the new bank's new offer on repo rate-linked home loan is getting good response from customers. 
How SBI's repo-linked home loan rate works
The lending rate of SBI's repo-linked home loan is based on the bank's repo rate lending rate (RLLR), which in turn is linked to RBI's repo rate. SBI's RLLR is fixed 225 bps over RBI's policy repo rate (currently at 5.4%). 
When the RBI changes the repo rate, SBI's RLLR changes automatically and thus the effective home loan rate.
In case of SBI's repo-linked product, the RLLR will change from the first day of the following month of RBI's rate revision. For example, RBI cut repo rate by 35 bps on 7th August and accordingly SBI's RLLR changes from September 1.
So from September 1, SBI's RLLR will fall to 7.65% (5.4% or 540 bps + 225 bps).
SBI then charges a spread, depending on the borrower's credit score (40 bps to 55 bps) for home loans up to  ₹75 lakh.
So, from September 1, for borrowers with good credit score, SBI will charge 8.05% (RLLR of 7.65% + 40 basis points). The spread increases to RLLR + 95 bps or RLLR +110 bps in case of home loans above  ₹75 lakh."
299,2019-09-02,State Bank,"A hefty injection of  ₹55,250 crore of taxpayers’ money into the merged banks will only help them provide for the bad loans that will get lumped togetherThe  ₹98,200 crore collected in August via GST, was the smallest in six months

With every passing day, India’s economic indicators are turning a little bleaker. The situation is bad enough to warrant using the word “crisis,"" arriving just as the government’s fiscal ammunition is spent.
The announcement Friday of 5% GDP growth in the June quarter showed the economy growing at its weakest pace in six years. On Sunday, the top six carmakers reported a 29% drop in August sales, stoking fears that the slowdown could get still worse.  The  ₹98,200 crore ($13.7 billion) collected in August via the goods and services tax, the main tax on consumption, was the smallest in six months. 
This adds pressure on the central bank — both to cut its policy rate and to ensure that commercial lenders pass them on to borrowers. To the extent that the more inefficient state-run banks are a drag on credit, central government said on Friday that as many as 10 of them will be merged into four.
Whether folding one weak bank into another will make the combined entity any stronger remains to be seen. What’s clearer is that these lenders will spend the next six months on integration. Putting their balance sheets to work may take a backseat. Pending consolidation, the lenders might also be hesitant to issue new bank guarantees, especially to private-sector bidders for road projects. Thus, one of the few areas where there’s new investment may be affected, especially with a sharp rise in debt levels of the government agency that gives out the contracts. 
A hefty injection of  ₹55,250 crore of taxpayers’ money into the merged banks will only help them provide for the bad loans that will get lumped together. Capital for growth remains elusive. State Bank of India, the largest lender, will require  ₹15,000 crore in the current fiscal year, according to ICRA Ltd., an affiliate of Moody’s Investors Service. 
The benefits will only be evident in a few years. The new round of consolidation will bring down the number of state-run banks to 12 from 27 just a few years ago. These lenders will have no choice but to become more competitive because they’ll have to price consumer loans by linking them to the central bank’s policy rate. Since they aren’t very good at lending against cash flows, the government wants them to originate loans together with non-bank financiers. Currently, even the shadow banks are stressed. Over time, though, this should help boost the underwriting standards of state-controlled lenders. Credit flows to smaller firms, which supply goods and services to larger companies, will improve. 
Making the most of vendor finance will require plugging India into global supply chains first. By offering the likes of Apple Inc. and Ikea less restrictive access to its billion-plus population, the central government is hoping for long-term sourcing wins from the rapidly deteriorating trade relations between Washington and Beijing.
But while taking much-neglected steps to position India as an alternative to China is a welcome move, the gains won’t be immediate. Before committing to a new factory in India to both sell locally and to export, investors will want to see steadier final demand in the domestic economy. Maruti Suzuki Ltd., the nation’s biggest carmaker, is struggling to push out 100,000 cars in a month to dealers ahead of the festival season. That isn’t exactly a great advertisement to dangle before new entrants.  
Good things will come from all the tinkering – just not now. Weakening global growth means India can’t even use a weak currency to export its way out of trouble. This isn’t the time to talk loudly about wanting to become the next China. A hawkish Washington won’t want to see mercantile strategies being deployed by yet another large labor-surplus nation. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s best hope will be to use the crisis to mend his government’s frayed relationship with the private sector. Giving startups a reprieve from a seven-year-old law, one that was used by tax authorities to harass them with impunity, is a good move.
Admitting that there are design flaws in the consumption tax and fixing them — perhaps by bringing separately taxed petroleum products into its ambit — should be the next step. Like with the bank mergers, the gains will take time time to become evident, even as the pain gets visibly worse.

As per the request for proposal for book running lead managers (BRLMs) floated by the SBI Card, the company intends to tap capital markets via IPO through 'offer for sale' by dilution of up to 14% of the issued and paid up capital (up to 13.05 crore) equity shares and primary issuance of up to  ₹1,000 crore.
India's largest bank State Bank of India (SBI) holds 74% stake in the SBI Card and the rest is held by Carlyle Group.
""As we go forward, we will actually take a call (on IPO) and that call is to be taken by the promoters...at some point of time this decision will be taken,"" SBI Card Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Hardayal Prasad said.
Currently, the market is volatile and the timing of hitting the market would depend on how it is panning out, he added.
The company floated expression of interest for selection of BRLMs, Domestic Legal Council (DLC) and International Legal Council (ILC) for the proposed share offering last month.
Talking about the strengthes of the company, Prasad said SBI Card has made massive investment in digitisation and technology.
According to him, the credit business has huge potential to grow in view of very low penetration in the country.
He said there were only three credit cards for a population of 100, while it was 165 in Singapore and 250 cards in Hong Kong.
So, there is a lot of scope for growth of credit cards in the country, he added.
As per the RBI, SBI Card ranked second with the credit card base and credit card spends capturing 17.6% and 17.1% market share in the respective categories.
The company posted year-on-year growth of 32.17% with the credit card base of over 8.27 million as on March 31, 2019 as compared to 6.26 million as on March 31, 2018.
It posted an annual credit card spends (excluding cross sell) of  ₹103,170 crore as on March, 2019, up 34.9% over March 2018."
297,2019-09-02,State Bank,"Public sector bank mergers could likely derail credit flow to an already slowing economyPast mergers like SBI-associates; Vijaya Bank, Dena Bank and BoB show a sharp fall in loan growth

Weddings require attention, which means the focus on everything else is minimal.
The government’s move to merge 10 public sector banks and form four big lenders risks starving the Indian economy of credit. That is because the management and the staff at these banks would be preoccupied with integration, rather than going out and lending.
“In the short run, consolidation may divert attention of PSBs (public sector banks) away from growth towards merger,"" analysts at Nomura Research said in a note to clients.
Recall that State Bank of India (SBI) had reported a sharp drop in loan offtake after its associate banks were merged with it in FY17. At that time, the SBI management had said that since a large part of energy was invested by its staff into the merger process, monitoring of credit and lending took a back seat.
The more recent merger of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank into Bank of Baroda (BoB), too, hasn’t raised much hope among investors. The latter’s shares have underperformed peers in the past year, as the chart shows.
The 10 candidates for merger this time around together account for nearly a quarter of bank credit to the economy. Most of these lenders are critical sources of loans to small businesses.
While analysts point out that other lenders such as SBI and private sector banks can step in to make good the shortfall, overall systemic credit growth is unlikely to be left unscathed. Small businesses will be particularly hit.
“Synchronised, smooth mergers across multiple entities is a tall ask that can hurt credit growth, stall recoveries, gift market share to private banks in the short run,"" wrote analysts at BOB Capital Markets Ltd.
Already, bankers have sounded a caution on overall loan growth for FY20, with SBI’s chief indicating it won’t be more than 12-15%. As per the latest data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the banking sector’s credit growth stood at 11.6% in end-August, compared to 14.2% a year ago.
An improvement in credit growth is needed now more than ever, simply because the gross domestic product (GDP) growth dropped to a six-year low of 5% in the June quarter. Nominal GDP growth was as low as 8%.
Willingness to lend is critical if RBI’s rate cuts and the surplus liquidity in the banking system are to reach the real economy. After all, the central bank and the government’s efforts in the past have been singularly to revive growth.
The government risks wiping out the salutary effects of its own policies if bank mergers clog loan flow to the economy.
It is clear that the benefits of the mergers would accrue only beyond two-three years. Meanwhile, the short-term pain should not be debilitating to lenders and the economy."
296,2019-09-03,State Bank,"The merger is unlikely to meaningfully revive the flow of credit to the liquidity pressed NBFCs, the report addedRecent experience of SBI and Bank of Baroda indicates focus on integration impacts near-term growth, the report said

Mumbai: The merger of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four entities is unlikely to revive credit growth or have meaningful cost synergies, said a report by Credit Suisse.
""Coupled with the ongoing moderation in growth for private banks led by auto sector slowdown and increased cautiousness, credit growth, thus, is unlikely to be revived by PSB mergers,"" it said in a report dated 2 September.
The merger is also unlikely to meaningfully revive the flow of credit to the liquidity pressed non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) as given the already high share of NBFC exposure in constituent banks, all four merged entities will have more than 10% of their loan exposure towards NBFCs, the report added.
""Hence, credit flow to NBFC will remain a challenge even as bond market access continues to remain differentiated for them,"" said Credit Suisse.
Given the limited flexibility on restructuring and rationalisation, meaningful cost synergies from PSB mergers are unlikely, it said. While the large recapitalisation improves the capacity for banks to grow loans, recent experience of State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BOB) indicates that focus on integration impacts near-term growth, the report said.
""While the recap amount puts all four merged entities comfortably above the regulatory threshold of 8% common equity tier 1 (CET1), given the recent experience of SBI and BOB, we believe focus on integration affects near-term growth, and hence, expect growth to be impacted for them too,"" it said, adding that even as size and scale of operations increase, core profitability for these banks is likely to remain weak.
""Hence, they will continue to depend on external infusions inviting frequent dilutions,"" said Credit Suisse.
Last Friday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the merger of Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank with business worth  ₹7.95 lakh crore to make India’s second-largest bank. The other merger will be between Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank, which will make the country's fourth-largest bank, with  ₹15.2 lakh crore in business.
Also, Union Bank of India will be merged with Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank to build India’s fifth-largest public sector bank with  ₹14.59 lakh crore in business. Indian Bank will be merged with Allahabad Bank to make India’s seventh-largest PSB with a business of  ₹8.08 lakh crore."

Mumbai: Close to half of the 36 banks had non-performing asset (NPA) ratio of above 10% in, said a report by Care Ratings. Of these 17 banks with bad loan ratio of above 10%, 16 were public sector banks (PSBs), while only one was a private bank.
“Three of the PSBs had NPA ratio of above 20% (IDBI Bank, UCO Bank and Indian Overseas Bank) and one was very near at 19.9%. Three PSBs had NPA ratios of less than 10% - State Bank of India (SBI), Indian Bank and Canara Bank. Three private banks had NPA of less than 2% and eight had between 2-5% and five between 5-10%,"" it said.
The report said the Indian banking system was traversing an interesting phase handling issues such as capital, quality of assets, deposits and credit allocation.
“The process of recognition of NPAs gained in precedence when the asset quality review system was invoked. NPAs have been increasing subsequently as banks progressively recognized their stressed assets,"" the report said, adding that this process has been more or less completed for most banks and that the NPA levels have stabilized in the last couple of quarters.
Gross NPAs of a set of 36 banks increased from  ₹6.71 lakh crore in March 2017 to a peak of  ₹9.66 lakh crore in March 2018 and subsequently moderated to  ₹8.70 lakh crore in March 2019 before increasing to  ₹8.97 lakh crore in June 2019.
“The differing trend that can be seen is that the NPAs for private banks have been increasing continuously over the quarters whereas for the PSBs they rose up to March 2018 and then declined in the next four quarters before increasing again in June 2019,"" the report added."
294,2019-09-04,State Bank,"Interest rate of SBI's repo linked home loan starts from 8.05%Many banks, including Bank of Baroda, have launched repo linked home loans after SBI launched the product in July

After India's biggest bank State Bank of India (SBI) launched India's first repo-linked home loan product in July many banks including Bank of Baroda have also come up with repo-linked home loan offers. Under this repo-linked home loan product, the effective home loan rates are linked to the banks' repo-linked lending rate, which in turn is linked to the RBI's repo rate. The government has asked banks to come up with repo-linked loan products for faster transmission of Reserve Bank's rate cuts to borrowers.
The interest rate of SBI's repo-linked home loan starts from 8.05% while the interest rate of Bank of Baroda's repo-linked loan from 8.35%. When the RBI changes the repo rate, the interest rate of these products change automatically.
SBI repo-linked home loan - How it works
The interest rate of SBI's repo-linked home loan is based on the bank's repo rate lending rate (RLLR) which is currently at 7.65%. SBI's repo-linked lending rate is fixed 225 bps over RBI's policy repo rate (currently at 5.4%) which works out to be 7.65% (repo rate of 5.40% or 540 bps + 225 basis points).
SBI then charges a spread of 40 bps to 55 bps above its RLLR, depending on the borrower's credit score for home loans up to  ₹75 lakh. This spread increases to 95 bps to 110 bps for home loans above  ₹75 lakh.
In case of SBI's repo-linked product, the RLLR changes from the first day of the following month of RBI's rate revision. For example, RBI cut repo rate by 35 bps on 7th August and accordingly SBI's RLLR changed from September 1.
Bank of Baroda (BoB) repo-linked home loan - How it works
Bank of Baroda, India's second largest public sector bank, last month introduced a new variant of home loan product linked to RBI's repo rate. New Bank of Baroda home loan customers get the option to select between MCLR-linked rate, which is indexed to the bank’s cost of funds or a repo rate linked to RBI's repo rate.
Currently, Bank of Baroda's repo-rate home loans start from 8.35%, which is 295 basis points above the RBI's repo rate. Bank of Baroda may charge up to 100 basis points more depending on the risk profile of the borrower.
Experts say that when RBI cuts its benchmark rate, repo rate-linked home loan schemes offer the benefit of immediate transmission of rate cuts as compared to MCLR-based home loans. But in case when RBI increases rates, home loan rates go up faster as compared to MCLR-based rates."
290,2019-09-05,State Bank,"Housing  finance  firms  also  may  see  profits  narrow  as  they  move  to match  ratesAmong private banks, only Federal Bank and IDBI Bank have linked rates to external benchmark

Mumbai: The retail and small business loan portfolio of private banks, wherein they had a competitive edge over state-run banks, could turn out to be a drag on their margins, if interest rates keep falling, analysts said after the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) mandate to link lending rates to an external benchmark.
The central bank has lowered its repo rate by 110 basis points (bps) since January.
Although the RBI rule does not apply to housing finance companies (HFCs), they are also expected to see a margin squeeze considering that they will have to try and compete with the rates offered by banks.
Margins of private banks seem more susceptible to interest rate volatility because of their greater exposure (as a percentage of their total loans) to retail and small business loans compared to their state-run peers. Among the private banks, only Federal Bank and IDBI Bank have so far linked their lending rates to an external benchmark.
An analysis by Kotak Institutional Equities on 4 September showed that retail and small business loans formed 65% of ICICI Bank’s loan book at the end of fiscal year 2018-19, while it was 41% and 34% for State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB), respectively.
Among public sector banks, SBI, BoB, Allahabad Bank, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, United Bank of India and Central Bank of India, among others, have started offering external benchmark-linked products to borrowers.
To be sure, the external benchmarks will only apply to fresh loans from 1 October. Existing borrowers will have to approach their banks to shift to the new rate.
The RBI has allowed banks to decide on the spread, or the risk premium they charge to a particular borrower, and there are concerns that banks might tweak the spread to guard themselves against volatility. “We can look at increasing risk premia and also tweaking fees on these loans to protect the margins,"" a private bank chief executive said on the condition of anonymity.
Brokerage firm CLSA said in a 4 September report that ICICI Bank has a higher share of housing and small business loans, while IndusInd Bank and HDFC Bank have a lower exposure.
Banks can choose the repo rate, the government’s three-month and six-month treasury bill yield published by the Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd (FBIL), or any other benchmark market interest rate published by FBIL.
“We believe that banks may prefer repo rate as it is less volatile and can be used to benchmark deposit rates,"" CLSA said, adding that risks could arise from a sharp cut in repo rate, conversion of loans from old marginal cost of funds based lending rate to new benchmarks and a slower fall in funding costs.
According to Kotak, HFCs could face high volatility in net interest margin after banks migrate retail floating rate loans to external benchmarks. “Large HFCs like HDFC, LIC Housing Finance and PNB Housing Finance compete with banks closely in their retail home loan segment and will need to catch up with their banking peers on any movement in home loan rates,"" Kotak said in its report.
While the linking of lending rates to an external benchmark will ensure quicker transmission, both during falling and rising interest rate periods, it would also lead to more volatility for retail borrowers. Anil Gupta, vice president of rating agency Icra Ltd, said chunky changes in RBI repo rates could lead to volatility in monthly repayment obligations of borrowers.
With the RBI issuing guidelines on this, the next step for banks is to link their savings deposit rates to an external benchmark as well to avoid asset liability mismatches. “Banks will look at linking their savings bank account rates to repo rate to ensure that margins remain stable. Since savings bank accounts are sticky in nature, our asset liability will be better managed,"" said Papia Sengupta, executive director, Bank of Baroda."

Infrastructure developer Ashoka Buildcon and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (MIRA), one of the biggest foreign infrastructure investors in India, are seeking buyers for their $2 billion roads portfolio, Ashoka Concessions Ltd, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
In 2012, along with State Bank of India, Macquarie, through its first India-focused fund, purchased a 34% stake in Ashoka Concessions, a platform to own and operate toll-earning road assets, for  ₹800 crore. The remaining stake was held by Ashoka Buildcon. Mint had reported on 29 May that Macquarie was looking to exit its roads portfolio in India.
“The formal process to sell the roads under Ashoka Concessions was launched recently. EY is managing the sale of the portfolio,"" said the first person cited above.
The second person said Macquarie and Ashoka are seeking an enterprise value of $2 billion for the roads portfolio, making it one of the largest roads portfolio on sale in the market. “They have reached out to Canadian pension funds and other sovereign wealth funds, since the investment ticket size is more suitable for these investors. Talks are at an early stage,"" the person said.
Spokespersons at Macquarie and EY declined to comment. Ashoka Buildcon did not respond to emailed queries.
Ashoka Concessions’ roads portfolio comprises 15 assets, including six operational BOT (build, operate, transfer) toll projects, one operational BOT annuity project and eight under-construction hybrid annuity projects.
In 2016, Macquarie sold two operational toll road assets in south India—the Farukhnagar-Jadcherla highway in Andhra Pradesh and the Trichy Tollway project in Tamil Nadu—to Spain’s Abertis Infraestructuras SA for  ₹1,000 crore.
Last year, it won rights to manage 648km of national highways for  ₹9,681.5 crore in an auction conducted by the National Highways Authority of India."

The board of public sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) is meeting today to consider the amalgamation of the Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and United Bank of India into PNB. Last week, the government had announced the series of mergers involving 10 state-owned banks, a move which will reduce the number of state-run banks to 12 from 27 in 2017. Under this arrangement, Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and United Bank would be merged with New Delhi-based Punjab National Bank to create India's second largest lender after State Bank of India.
The combined entity of PNB, OBC and United Bank will have a size of about  ₹18 lakh crore, with PNB being the anchor bank.
The board of PNB will also consider today capital infusion up to  ₹18,000 crore by Government of India by way of preferential issue of equity share and fixing date of extra ordinary general meeting (EGM) for obtaining shareholders' approval in this regard.
Meanwhile, United Bank has informed stock exchanges that its board will not be deliberating on the amalgamation with PNB on September 6, 2019 and will discuss the matter on a later date.
Meanwhile, global rating agency Moody's on Wednesday upgraded the outlook on Punjab National Bank (PNB), which will merge OBC and United Bank of India with itself, to 'positive' from 'stable'.
The affirmation of PNB's ratings with a positive outlook reflects Moody's view that the bank's baseline credit assessments will likely improve after the capital infusion from the government, and that its financial metrics will gradually improve, it said.
After the merger, PNB will become the second-largest public sector bank (PSB) in India with a deposit market share of 8%, compared to its standalone market share of 5.2 per cent as of March 2019.
Moody's, however, added that it could lower PNB's BCA and ratings or change the rating outlook to stable if its asset quality, profitability and capital deteriorate on a standalone basis or as a result of the merger. (With Agency Inputs)"

287,2019-09-08,State Bank,"Data shows that the bank started seeking LoC from the Bureau of Immigration from April this yearThe Finance Ministry transferred the application to the Home Ministry and Public Sector Banks to furnish the information

NEW DELHI :
The Country's largest public sector bank -- State Bank of India -- sought issuance of 147 Look Out Circulars (LoC) in the last five months in connection with bank fraud cases, an RTI response from the bank said.
Data shows that the bank started seeking LoC from the Bureau of Immigration from April this year.
Between April and August, it issued request seeking LoC against 147 individuals to prevent them from leaving the country, the bank said in response to a Right to Information query filed by Pune-based activist Vihar Durve said.
On October 12, 2018, the Home Ministry included Chairman, Chief Executive Officers and Managing Directors of public sector banks in the list of individuals who can seek issuance of Look Out Circulars against offenders to prevent their escape from the country, it said.
According to data provided in Parliament in December last year, about 49 economic offenders have escaped to different countries and the government is making attempts to bring them back.
Fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya, diamantaire Mehul Choksi and his nephew Nirav Modi, industrialists Nitin and Chetan Sandesara are among 58 economic offenders probed by the CBI, Enforcement Directorate and other agencies who have escaped abroad, it says.
Although top officials of public sector bank were empowered last year to seek issuance of LoC against individuals, relevant guidelines were framed by the Indian Banks' Association in March this year, the Association told Durve.
The guidelines were considered necessary after public sector banks approached the Association seeking legal protection and immunity available to police and the CBI while issuing the LoCs, it said.
Durve had approached the Finance Ministry seeking to know details about the request for issuance of LoC received from various authorities between 2017 and 2019, action taken on them among other things.
The Finance Ministry transferred the application to the Home Ministry and Public Sector Banks to furnish the information.
The Home Ministry then transferred the application to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), which works under the Intelligence Bureau. The BOI sought refuge from disclosure under the Section 24 of the RTI Act which exempts it from the ambit of the transparency law.
However, State Bank of India in its response to Durve said it has sought issuance of 147 Look Out Circulars while Union Bank of India replied the information was not in its domain.
UCO Bank said it does not issue Look Out Circulars while Punjab and Sindh Bank said their MD and CEO were authorized to issue the LoCs but ""there is no such data"" available.
Bank of Baroda said the information does not pertain to it and Canara Bank said no requests for LoCs were made by it in the period.

Cheating and forgery were the major component, followed by misappropriation and criminal breach of trust. Fraud cases involving an amount of less than  ₹1 lakh (i.e., small-value frauds) were only 0.1% of the total amount involved in 2018-19, the report showed. PTI ABS TIR TIR"

284,2019-09-09,State Bank,"SBI will revise its MCLR or marginal cost of funds based lending rate from tomorrowOther banks are also likely to lower their MCLR rates

India's biggest lender State Bank of India or SBI has reduced its MCLR (Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate) by 10 basis points. This will come into effect from September 10. The one-year SBI MCLR will be 8.15% per annum with effect from 10 September. This is the fifth consecutive reduction in MCLR from SBI so far in FY 2019-20. Other banks are likely to follow SBI's lead and could lower their MCLR rates. SBI also lowered its fixed deposit or FD rates by 20-25 basis points.
SBI claims to have around 35% and 36% of market share in home loans and auto loans respectively. 
MCLR rates are based on the bank's own cost of funds. If you are an existing home loan customer of SBI, the latest cut of 10 basis points in MCLR may not lower your home loan interest rate or EMIs immediately. 
SBI's floating rate home loans are typically linked to its one-year MCLR and it will have a one-year reset clause. If the reset clause is in August and the MCLR cut happens in September, your home loan rate will not change till next August. 
The RBI recently directed all banks to link all new floating rate personal or retail loans (housing, auto, etc.) and floating rate loans to Micro and Small Enterprises from October 01, 2019 to external benchmarks, saying banks had not satisfactorily passed on the benefit of recent policy rate cuts to consumers.
The RBI, which has reduced its benchmark repo rate by 110 basis points since February, has pushed for better transmission of rate cuts. Under the new mechanism, the RBI said banks are free to decide the spread over the external benchmark.
Under this new loan regime, borrowers will get the immediate benefit of RBI's rate cuts but when the rate cycle turns, they will be hit by rising interest rates faster than the MCLR-based loans. 
SBI already has a repo rate-linked home loan product, which is linked with RBI's repo rate. The interest rate on this SBI home loan product changes upwards or downwards, in line with movement of RBI's repo rate. The loan is linked to SBI's own repo-linked lending rate, which is 225 basis points over repo rate. The bank also charges a spread above the repo-linked lending rate."

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India (SBI) Monday cut its lending and deposit rates across all tenures, the second such reduction in the past one month. The country’s largest bank said it has reduced lending rates by 10 basis points across all tenors. The one-year marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) will stand reduced to 8.15% from 8.25% with effect from 10 September.
This will be the fifth consecutive cut in MCLR in 2019-20. During the same period, RBI has the cut repo rate by 85 basis points.
SBI also reduced its deposit rates by 20-25 basis points and bulk deposit rates by 10-20 basis points across tenures. “In view of the falling interest rate scenario and surplus liquidity, SBI also realigns its interest rate on term deposits w.e.f. September 10,"" the bank said in a press release. For FDs maturing in one year to less than two years, SBI has cut the rate by 20 basis points to 6.50% from 6.70%.
Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have also revised their FD interest rates in select buckets.
The linking of retail floating loans to an external benchmark kicks in from 1 October, which will be applicable to new loans. SBI’s reduction of its MCLR rate is to keep retail interest sticky during the intervening period. “Liquidity position has been comfortable for the bank. Depending on the banks’ requirement of funds, we have been reducing MCLR and also repo-linked rates. We are hoping that this will spur some demand during the festive season,"" said Praveen Kumar Gupta, managing director, retail and digital banking, SBI.
“The bank (SBI) has increased the transmission of monetary policy by reducing MCLR by 25bps again over the last 1 month. Further, it has reduced deposit rates in different buckets so that margins remain intact. However, we see margin pressure in the second half of the current financial year,"" said Asutosh Mishra, head of institutional research, Ashika Stock Broking.
The cut in rates comes in the backdrop of a consumption slowdown and a deteriorating global environment. The government is looking to front-load capital spending this fiscal to support growth. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced a reversal in tax increase on FPIs, and steps were also taken to boost the auto sector and deepen the bond market. She also promised to infuse  ₹70,000 crore into state-run banks to improve balance sheets and help finance new projects, apart from merging 10 banks into four large institutions for greater efficiencies of scale.
The Reserve Bank of India too announced measures such as asking banks to mandatorily link all new floating rate loans with an external benchmark from 1 October.
The new rule will be applicable to floating rate loans to retail, personal and MSME borrowers. Banks will have the option to benchmark the loans either to the repo rate, and the government of India’s three-month or six-month Treasury Bill yield, or any other benchmark market interest rate published by the Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd.
On 5 September, Mint had reported that private sector banks could see a margin squeeze after the RBI move. Margins of private banks seem more susceptible to interest rate volatility because of their greater exposure (as a percentage of their total loans) to retail and small business loans compared to their state-run peers. Among private banks, only Federal Bank and IDBI Bank have so far linked lending rates to an external benchmark.
With the RBI issuing guidelines on linking loans to an external benchmark, the next step for banks is to link savings deposit rates to an external benchmark. Since savings bank accounts are sticky in nature, banks believe that their asset liability will be better managed.
Separately, Bajaj Housing Finance Monday announced a cut in home loan rates from 8.8% to 8.6% for amounts of up to  ₹30 lakh."

278,2019-09-10,State Bank,"While SBI will hire 477 candidates for information technology roles, Bank of Baroda will hire 15 sector specialists to market its MSME productsAccording to the SBI, the proposed lateral hires are in the grades of assistant manager, deputy manager, manager and chief manager

MUMBAI :
Public sector lenders State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) are looking outside their ranks to hire nearly 500 people for specialist roles, ranging from information technology to managing the small business segment.
While SBI will hire 477 candidates for information technology roles, Bank of Baroda will hire 15 sector specialists to market its MSME products, two separate newspaper advertisements on Tuesday showed. According to the SBI, the proposed lateral hires are in the grades of assistant manager, deputy manager, manager and chief manager. These include developer, database administrator, cloud administrator, infrastructure engineer, IT security expert, cyber security - threat hunting and cyber security - and digital forensic, among others.
Of the 477 vacancies in SBI, 248 are for candidates belonging to the general category, while the rest are reserved. The highest number of vacancies is for developers (181), followed by IT security expert (94) and 47 system or server administrator. At present, SBI hires a mix of probationary officers, junior associates, lateral hires and management trainees.
According to the bank’s website, lateral hires typically include chartered accountants, analysts, statisticians, risk raters, economists, lawyers, engineers and system engineers.
Meanwhile, Bank of Baroda said in its notice that it is looking to support small businesses under the Uttar Pradesh government’s One District One Product scheme, and will create separate verticals for products. The scheme is an initiative of the UP government to promote micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME)-based manufacturing through organized support in the areas of finance, marketing, production, policy and technology.
“The bank is creating separate verticals for some of the key products under the scheme and to support this key initiative for furthering the growth of the MSME sector,"" it said, adding that it was looking for 15 experienced sector specialists to market its MSME products.
Lateral hiring is the process of recruiting an expert for a specific role from another organization.
Last month, while announcing the merger of 10 public sector banks (PSBs) into four, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said the banks will also recruit a chief risk officer at market-linked compensation to attract talent.
Employees hired laterally are typically remunerated at prevailing market rates, higher than that in public sector banks. Mint reported on 26 August that the gap between the remuneration of chief executives of state-run banks and their private counterparts has widened in the last two years. The average daily remuneration of a public sector bank chief was  ₹8,541 in FY19, while a private bank chief executive officer (CEO) earned  ₹2.48 lakh per day in the same period.
A major component of the remuneration in private banks is through stock options for senior executives. Public sector banks have also been toying with the idea of employee stock option schemes to bring in a performance-linked incentive structure.
The idea was mooted by the Banks Board Bureau (BBB), a government body tasked with looking into the performance of public sector banks. It also received the finance ministry’s nod in March 2017 and some banks such as Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India and Union Bank of India are implementing this scheme."
277,2019-09-11,State Bank,"SBI cut interest rate on retail fixed deposit by 20 to 25 basis points, with effect from 10th SeptemberPost office term deposit schemes are similar to bank FDs

State Bank of India or SBI cut interest rate on retail fixed deposit or FDs by 20 to 25 basis points, with effect from 10th September, the second revision in about two weeks. The interest rate on term deposits at Post Offices, which are revised every quarter, are due for revision this month-end. Many banks have been lowering their FD rates amid surplus liquidity and sharp cut in RBI repo rates. Analysts say that the interest rates on post office term deposits and other small savings schemes are also set to come down amid falling interest rate scenario.
Post office term deposit schemes are similar to bank FDs. Post offices offer term deposits ranging from one year to five years. Like bank FDs, investors earn a guaranteed return through the tenure of the post office term deposit. The interest on Post Office deposits was revised on 1 July 2019. For one-year time deposit, Post Office offers an interest rate of 6.9%. For time deposit for a tenure of 2 and three years, it offers an interest rate of 6.9%. For five year time deposit account, Post Office offers an interest rate of 7.7%.
Here is a comparison of FD accounts offered by SBI and Post Office:
1) For an SBI FD account, the tenures may vary from 7 days to 10 years, depending upon the need of investment, whether it is for short-term or long-term. But Post Office term deposit schemes are either for 1 year, or 2, 3 or 5 years.
2) SBI FD interest rates vary between 4.50% to 6.70% for general customers. Post Office FDs offer interest ranging between 6.9% to 7.7%.
3) You can open an SBI FD account online through net banking facility, but for opening a Post Office term deposit account you have to visit the post office branch.
4) The USP of the Post office term deposit schemes is that it is backed by the government and rates are revised every quarter. But in case of SBI, there is no such rule. Bank FD rates gets impacted after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) changes its repo rate.

I have about  ₹2 lakh in three equity funds. I have stopped the SIPs (systematic investment plans) now. I have another  ₹1 lakh in SBI Liquid Growth Direct. Also, I want to start investing  ₹40,000 a month in funds. I need about  ₹6 lakh by next year. I have a moderately high-risk profile. Please advise.
—Ojas
You require  ₹6 lakh in a year’s time. Currently, you have  ₹2 lakh in existing investments and another  ₹1 lakh in a liquid fund. On top of this, you are planning to save  ₹40,000 a month. My advice to you would be to accumulate  ₹6 lakh in secure savings and keep it aside before you consider moving to moderately high-risk options. This is because one year is too short a time frame to take any risk. So, keeping it safe in short-term debt instruments (like savings account, fixed deposits or liquid funds) would be prudent. You should move your current equity investments to liquid funds in the respective fund houses, leave the SBI liquid fund where it is, and invest  ₹40,000 a month for seven to eight months either in a liquid fund or an ultra short-term fund (like a Kotak Savings fund or L&T Ultra Short Term fund). Once you have ensured that you have met the need for  ₹6 lakh in a year, you can start investing in a riskier portfolio for the longer term. Such a portfolio can take diversified risks in the form of different types of equity funds and some debt funds, the blend of which can be determined by factors such as age, the time frame of your investments, and your risk profile.
We have around  ₹70 lakh in fixed deposits and liquid cash that we want to invest to buy a flat three years later. Can you advise the best asset allocation mix and funds?
—Kirti Krishnan
For a medium-risk appetite and a three-year time horizon, your investment portfolio cannot afford to be too adventurous. From an asset allocation perspective, I would recommend a 40:60 allocation between equity and debt. You may want to keep 50% of your debt portfolio—that is 30% of your overall portfolio—in fixed deposits. The remaining 50% can be invested in liquid and short-term funds (since your investment time frame is three years, you can reap some tax benefits for your long-term gains by virtue of indexing your cost of investment). The equity portion (40% of your overall portfolio) can go to a mix of three to four funds in the large- and multi-cap spaces. Funds such as Reliance Large Cap fund, Invesco India Growth Opportunities fund and Principal Multi-cap Growth fund will fit the bill nicely.

275,2019-09-12,State Bank,"Weighted average lending rate on private banks’ outstanding loans rose when the policy rates were cutPrivate sector lenders are reluctant to pass on rate cuts on worries over borrower risk profile

Private sector banks have been more reluctant to pass on policy rate cut benefits than their public sector peers. Is it defiance or defence?
Perhaps it is more the latter, as a look at the weighted average lending rate (WALR) for both groups of banks goes to show.
Cast your eyes on the adjoining chart.
WALR on outstanding rupee loans of private sector lenders rose by 16 basis points between February and July, when policy rates were slashed by 50 basis points. WALR on such loans for public sector banks rose by 3 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Outstanding rupee loans represent old loans and, therefore, also represents, to a great extent, those beleaguered corporates who are suffering from overleverage, and had defaulted on their repayments. Surely, they do not deserve a discount on their loan rates because the credit risk associated with them has gone up.
When it comes to pricing of risk, private sector banks have fared far better than public sector ones, even though both lent to the same set of corporate borrowers in many cases.
If we go further back over a longer period to the asset quality review of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in August 2015 as a starting point, the trend supports that private sector lenders are savvier in assessing risks. The review laid bare the fact that Indian banks were hiding troubled loans under the carpet of forbearance.
Since the asset quality review, WALR on outstanding rupee loans for private sector banks has dropped by only 74 basis points in response to a 100 basis point fall in RBI’s policy rates. For public sector banks, the fall was 141 basis points.
Of course, policy rates did not follow a singular path, but have also been raised at intermittent times since 2015. Nevertheless, in sum, private sector lenders have kept their loan rates from falling sharply, which indicates that they are not comfortable with the risk profile of their borrowers.
That said, lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI) and other public sector banks have been proactive in adopting the external benchmark method to price loans, while their private sector peers have been not so forthcoming. Now that the use of external benchmarks for retail and small business loan rates is mandatory, all lenders will have to fall in line by October.
“The external benchmarked products are likely to be introduced in the next quarter and we need to see their relative pricing as compared to MCLR, which is high today but converging,"" analysts at Kotak Securities Ltd wrote in a note. MCLR stands for marginal cost of funds based lending rate.
It would be interesting to see how private sector banks continue to price risk, while adopting an external benchmark for loan rates."
274,2019-09-12,State Bank,"FY20 has started well for the company, what with a robust volume growth of 9.6% in the June quarterAnalysts say the company aspires to make its brands more relevant for millennials

For all the talk of a consumption slowdown, shares of Dabur India Ltd have put up a decent show. The stock has risen almost 10% in FY20 so far. FY20 has started well for the company, what with a robust volume growth of 9.6% in the June quarter, easily one of the best in the consumer space.
Recently, analysts met Dabur India’s management and returned pleased with their commentary. “A subtle but significant change from the previous analyst meet in August 2018 was the company’s stance: less bullish on the short term but decisively more certain of the long-term strategic direction of the company,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 9 September.
Here, Dabur India stressed that it is looking to shift its focus back to its core strength, which is Ayurveda. This is helpful given the consumer’s increasing awareness and affinity towards natural products. The company will increase its focus on nine power brands from its product categories, which constitute about 65-70% of its sales.
“These brands would receive the maximum management bandwidth and resources,"" said the Kotak report. Power brands are expected to grow at a relatively faster pace and add to incremental growth meaningfully given their big contribution in the overall pie.
“A commitment to create a vibrant and dynamic new company was clearly evident,"" said analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd in a report on 9 September. “This has, hitherto, been an area of concern; for instance, notwithstanding more than 100 years of Ayurvedic heritage, Dabur moved to boost its Ayurvedic momentum only after Patanjali’s aggressive foray into Ayurvedic products,"" they added.
Dabur India will also consider stepping up innovation and renovation as a part of its strategy. Analysts say the company aspires to make its brands more relevant for millennials.
After underperforming the Nifty 200 index in the initial months of FY20, the Dabur India stock has outperformed the index in recent months. Not surprisingly, valuations aren’t particularly cheap, with the stock trading at 48 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data.
Also, after experiencing solid volume growth in the June quarter, the company’s investors would do well to keep expectations low for the current quarter. While Dabur India’s clear long-term vision can be appreciated, it’s worth noting that the demand slowdown would hurt in the near future. During the analysts’ meet, the management said the current quarter remains challenging. This should keep big upsides in the share price limited for some time."

271,2019-09-12,State Bank,"At the floor price, State Bank of India will fetch  ₹3,465 crore if it sells the entire 4.5% stake in SBI Life Insurance CoStock exchange filings show, SBI is looking to sell up to 3.5% through the OFS, with an option to sell an additional 1%.

State Bank of India (SBI), India’s largest lender, on Thursday launched a two-day offer for sale (OFS) to sell a 4.5% stake in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
Stock exchange filings show, SBI is looking to sell up to 3.5% through the OFS, with an option to sell an additional 1%.
SBI Life started as a joint venture between the public sector lender and France’s BNP Paribas Cardif.
It has priced the secondary share sale at  ₹770 apiece, a discount of 3.6% to the stock’s closing price of  ₹798.75 on Wednesday. Shares of SBI Life closed at  ₹791.9 apiece, down 0.86% on the BSE on Thursday.
At the floor price, SBI will fetch  ₹3,465 crore (about $487 million), if it sells the entire 4.5% stake.
The stake sale will help the company comply with minimum public shareholding norms (of 25%), SBI said in exchange filings.
The secondary share sale, which opened for institutional and non-retail investors on Thursday, was subscribed 2.7 times.
For retail investors, the share sale will open on Friday.
Investment banks Sbicap Securities Ltd, HSBC and Nomura are managing the share sale.
SBI Life went public in September 2017 with an initial public offering, which saw SBI selling 8% and BNP Paribas Cardif selling a 4% stake. The total IPO size was worth  ₹8,400 crore, with SBI raising around  ₹5,600 crore and BNP Paribas Cardif around  ₹2,800 crore.
In December 2016, SBI had sold a 3.9% stake to investors KKR and Co. LP and Temasek Holdings. To meet the minimum public shareholding norms, BNP has sold parts of its stake thrice this year.
This is the first time that SBI is selling its stake in the life insurer since it went public.
On 1 March, global private equity firm Carlyle Group had acquired a 9% stake in SBI Life from BNP for around  ₹4,600 crore.
In March-end, BNP sold another tranche of over 50 million shares, while in June it sold a 2.5% stake through the OFS route at  ₹650 per share. As on 30 June, SBI held a 62.1% stake, while BNP held 5.2%
While BNP’s stake sale to Cardif reduced promoter shareholding to 75%, thus achieving minimum public shareholding of 25%, the stake sale did not fit with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s regulations. Hence, SBI and BNP were required to sell more stakes to comply with the Sebi norms."
272,2019-09-13,State Bank,"SBI will roll out new service charge from 1st October 2019SBI ATM withdrawal: The bank charges a fee for additional transactions beyond a specified limit

Country's largest lender State Bank of India or SBI has come out with details on its website regarding revison of service charges with effect from 1st October. The bank allows free transactions to its customers at ATMs for 8-10 times in a month. Over and above these mandated number of free transactions, SBI charges a certain amount to its customers. Effective 1st October, SBI will also charge for transaction decline due to insufficient balance and cardless cash withdrawal at ATMs.
Five things to know about SBI ATM withdrawal charges:
1) Regular savings bank account holders get eight free transactions, including five transactions at SBI ATMs and three transactions at other bank ATMs. In non-metros, such account holders get 10 free transactions, including five at SBI ATMs and five at other bank ATMs.
2) SBI charges a fee ranging from  ₹5 plus GST to  ₹20 plus GST for any additional transactions beyond this limit.
3) Effective 1st October, SBI will charge  ₹20 plus GST for transaction decline due insufficient balance
4) SBI will also charge  ₹22 plus GST for cardless cash withdrawal at ATMs.
5) For all salary accounts at all locations, SBI offers free unlimited transactions at State Bank Group (SBG )ATMs and other bank ATMs.
However, maintaining a certain minimum balance in your account, you can do unlimited transactions at SBI ATMs and even at other bank ATMs. The bank currently allows unlimited free transactions at State Bank of India Group (SBG) ATMs to its customers who have maintained a monthly average balance above  ₹25,000 in their savings bank account in the previous month."
270,2019-09-13,State Bank,"The bank hopes to garner  ₹3,465 crore, and institutional demand showed it can easily mop up the amountSBI Life Insurance Co.’s business growth has been fairly impressive compared with its peers

Life insurance stocks have been a bright spot in an otherwise lacklustre movement in financial shares. All three listed insurance companies have returned handsome gains to investors over the last six months and have outperformed the Nifty Financial Services index.
Therefore, the timing couldn’t have been better for State Bank of India (SBI) to offload stake in its insurance arm.
On Thursday, India’s largest lender offered for sale 4.5% of its stake in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd at a floor price of  ₹770 per share. The bank hopes to garner  ₹3,465 crore and institutional demand showed it can easily mop up the amount. Institutional subscription amounted to about 2.7 times the shares on offer to them.
The proceeds will give SBI capital to grow. But the primary motive behind the offer for sale is to abide by the rule of retaining a minimum public shareholding of 25%.
Will investors find it rewarding to put money in SBI Life Insurance Co.? The insurance company gives many reasons in its favour.
SBI Life Insurance Co.’s business growth has been fairly impressive compared with its peers.
For the June quarter, the insurer reported a net profit of  ₹372 crore and annualized premium equivalent growth of 41%. And much of the incremental sales have been in margin-friendly protection products.
In August, the insurer reported new business premium growth of 26%, which was lower only to HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s among the top five insurers.
But SBI Life Insurance Co.’s strength lies in its access to a vast network of branches of its parent through which it can sell its wares. Notwithstanding this, the insurer has also tied up with other banks to sell its policies.
But the decision to invest is also governed by valuations. Despite the 33% rise in the stock so far in 2019, SBI Life Insurance Co. trades at a modest multiple of about 3.3 times its estimated embedded value for FY20. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimate the insurer’s embedded value to grow by 16% to  ₹26,000 crore in FY20. In comparison, HDFC Life Insurance Co. trades at a multiple of over 4.5 times its estimated embedded value.
“It is a game of both growth and valuation. At these levels, it is a good valuation for SBI Life and we have been bullish on the stock for quite sometime now,"" said Neeraj Toshniwal, analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.
SBI Life Insurance Co.’s stock slipped over 1% on Thursday adjusting to the offer-for-sale supply. Analysts believe that further upside the stock now hinges on the sustainability of its double digit growth metrics in the coming quarters."

Kolkata: The amalgamated entity of United Bank of India (UBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) will come into effect from 1 April next year, a top official said on Saturday.
The merged unit, likely to have a new name, will be the second largest bank in the country after State Bank of India (SBI) with a total business volume of  ₹18 trillion.
""The amalgamation process will take some time and the new entity will start functioning from April 1, 2020,"" MD and CEO of UBI, Ashok Kumar Pradhan, said.
The three banks held a customer meet here, which was attended by Chander Khurana, GM of Punjab National Bank and Binay Kumar Gupta, GM of Oriental Bank of Commerce.
The lenders said that there will no retrenchment of staff in the merged entity, and also ruled out the possibility of bringing in Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS).
Pradhan later told reporters that the combined staff strength post the amalgamation will be 1 lakh with 11,400 branches.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on 30 August announced the consolidation of 10 state-run banks into four large-scale lenders.
Pradhan said the amalgamation process will require legal and regulatory compliances, besides approval of the three banks' boards.
""During the interim period, the three will continue to function independently,"" he said.
The government has already announced a capital infusion of  ₹16,000 crore into PNB and  ₹1,600 crore into UBI.
""The merged entity will be adequately capitalised and comply with basel requirements for the next three years,"" the senior UBI official said.
To a query, Khurana said the average net NPA of the three banks is 6.67 per cent, which is expected to fall below 6 per cent post the amalgamation.
On the share-swap ratio, Pradhan said that valuers will be appointed separately, following which a merchant banker will determine the fair value. ""After that, the swap ratio will be decided,"" he said."

Mumbai: Former State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Arundhati Bhattacharya is looking to start a general insurance business, along with Sunil Mehta, former country head and chief executive of American insurer AIG, and Deepak Ishwarbhai Amin, a former director of SBI, a person aware of the development said on condition of anonymity.
On 3 September, Bhattacharya and Mehta registered their company, Welmo Fintech Pvt. Ltd. The insurer has a paid-up share capital of  ₹1 lakh, according to data from the ministry of corporate affairs.
“They will soon be approaching the insurance regulator to obtain an R1 approval,"" the person said. R1 is the first stage of approval by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) to start an insurance company. It is followed by R2 and R3 approvals.
Welmo will, however, be required to have a minimum of  ₹100 crore as paid-up equity share capital to obtain the second stage of regulatory approval.
“They are looking to raise capital from venture capital investors,"" said the person cited earlier.
While Bhattacharya declined to comment, emailed queries sent to Mehta and Amin remained unanswered.
After stepping down as SBI chairperson in 2017, Bhattacharya had stints as directors of seven Indian companies, including Ajay Piramal-led Piramal Enterprises Ltd and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. She is an additional independent director at rating agency Crisil Ltd and an adviser to homegrown private equity firm ChrysCapital Advisors Llp.
Recently, Irdai granted licences to a host of general insurers, mostly promoted by insurance veterans. In 2017, four companies—Go Digit General Insurance Ltd, Acko General Insurance Ltd, DHFL General Insurance Ltd and Edelweiss General Insurance Co. Ltd—secured regulatory approvals.
Former Bajaj Allianz chief executive officer Kamesh Goyal’s Go Digit General Insurance is backed by Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax Financial Holdings. Acko General Insurance, started by Varun Dua, the founder of online insurance broking firm Coverfox, has also received its licence from Irdai.
In April, Irdai gave preliminary approval to Indiabulls General Insurance Ltd, a subsidiary of Indiabulls Integrated Services Ltd.
As of March last year, 68 insurers were operating in India, including 24 life insurers, 27 general insurers and six health insurers. As of 2017, general insurance penetration in India was a meagre 0.93%, compared to 2.76% for life insurance, according to Irdai.
The penetration of general insurance, measured as the ratio of premium (in US dollars) to gross domestic product (in US dollars) stood at 2.8% globally in 2017, more than three times that of India—a clear indication that the country has a vast growth potential considering its large population."
259,2019-09-16,State Bank,"Currently, SBI does not have a fixed rate home loan productSBI offers floating rate home loan products linked to its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate and RBI's repo rate

India's largest bank SBI will seek clarifications from Reserve Bank of India or RBI whether it can offer 'fixed-floating' home loan product, Press Trust of India reported, citing chairman Rajnish Kumar. This new home loan product will have fixed rates in the beginning and later it will convert into floating rates. SBI chief said there is a lack of clarity on how it can go ahead with the fixed rate products, after the RBI’s new regulations on floating rates.
From October 1, the RBI has mandated banks that new floating rate home loan products should be linked to external benchmarks like RBI repo rate. Banks can charge a spread over the benchmark. And the interest rate under external benchmark shall be reset at least once in three months.
Analysts say that the EMIs under these new schemes turn volatile, depending on the movement of the benchmark. 
Hinting at the volatility in the repo rate, SBI chief, as quoted by PTI, said some home buyers may want their loan rates to be fixed.
For such buyers, it can offer a 'fixed-floating' product, wherein the rates are locked in for an initial period of say five to ten years, and then turns floating.
The need for making the product floating in the latter part arises out of the bank's inability to project the liability movements in the future, he said, adding typically, home loans are for about 30 years.
Currently, SBI does not have a fixed rate home loan product. At present, SBI has a floating rate home loan product linked to its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate. 
SBI also has a repo-rate linked home loan scheme. Interest rate of this home loan product is linked to RBI's repo rate and is revised from the 1st of  next month, as and when the RBI revises its benchmark rate. 
SBI was the first bank to come up a repo-linked home loan product and many of its products like savings account deposits above  ₹1 lakh is linked to repo rate. 
The SBI chief said that from an asset liability management perspective, it is difficult to have a fixed rate product for a long term like 30 years. (With PTI Inputs)"
260,2019-09-16,State Bank,"Other measures, to reverse slowdown, include increasing consumption and identifying other sources of infrastructure fundingThe introduction of such tax has significantly impacted the return on household financial savings

Mumbai: Saying that the slowdown in the economy cannot be addressed by monetary policy in isolation and also needs fiscal policy focus, a State Bank of India (SBI) economic research report on Monday called for abolition of capital gains tax.
“Abolish capital gains tax to boost financialization of savings that gained momentum in FY18, but might have lost pace in FY19,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI, in the report cited above.
Ghosh said abolishing capital gain tax will boost households’ savings and encourage people to invest more in financial assets than physical assets.
“Past trend also suggest, financial assets have grown at a faster pace than last year and a bulk of this comes from equity. We expect this pattern to remain inclined to equities and removing long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax will again give a boost to financialization of savings,"" he said.
In the Union Budget for 2018-19, the government proposed reintroducing long-term capital gains tax (LTCG) after a gap of 14 years, on gains arising from transfer of listed equity shares exceeding  ₹1 lakh at 10%.
“If we look at the data on asset under management (AUM) and its flows to equity segment, it suggests that post demonetisation to till the introduction of LTCG tax (prior to February 2018), the total assets grew at 36% while the flows of funds to equity grew at 68%. However, post LTCG tax, both total assets and its flow to equity segment is almost flat and the growth was less than 10%,"" said Ghosh.
He added that the introduction of such tax has significantly impacted the return on household financial savings and it is most likely that gross financial savings, especially shares and debentures, stagnated in 2018-19.
Other measures, to reverse the slowdown, include increasing consumption and identifying other sources of infrastructure funding. “The government must address demand weakness by continuing to meaningfully frontload expenditure say through PMKISAN and MGNREGA (PM-KISAN portal shows the number of beneficiaries is only 6.89 crore till July 2019 against the target of 14.6 crore due to slow validation in farmer data),"" the report said.
For infrastructure, setting up of a development financial institution could be an effective solution, the report added."

The largest lender State Bank of India will be seeking clarifications from the Reserve Bank whether it can offer long-term home loans with fixed rates in the beginning and convert the same into floating rates later, chairman Rajnish Kumar has said.
The move comes after the Reserve Bank has mandated banks to shift all retail lending to floating rates that will be determined by external benchmarks like the repo rate.
Kumar said there is a lack of clarity on how it can go ahead with the fixed rate products, after the RBI’s new regulations on floating rates.
Hinting at the volatility in the repo rate, he said some home buyers may want their loan rates to be fixed.
For such buyers, it can offer a 'fixed-floating' product, wherein the rates are locked in for an initial period of say five to ten years, and then turns floating.
The need for making the product floating in the latter part arises out of the bank's inability to project the liability movements in the future, he said, adding typically, home loans are for about 30 years.
It can be noted that the repo rate at which the central bank lends to the system is at a nine-year low of 5.40%.
Speaking to reporters here over the weekend, Kumar said the central bank’s recent guidelines on floating rate products for the retail segment has necessitated the need for the clarity.
Kumar has clarified that from an asset liability management perspective, it is difficult to have a fixed rate product for a long term like 30 years, the maximum tenor of a home loan now from the bank now. Some private sector peers offer up to 35 years of home loans depending on in the age of the borrower, though.
At present, SBI has a floating rate home loan product linked to its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate and it recently withdrew one linked to the repo rate. It does not have a fixed rate home loan product at present.
As of now, under the marginal cost of funds based lending, floating rate loans are re-set as when the interest rates fall or rise, but fixed rate loans are reset in 9-12 months. But when the loans are linked to the repo rate, the rates can change sharply, depending on how RBI acts on the rate front.
Many mortgage borrowers normally choose fixed rates, as that helps them better manage their finances because of the certainty about the EMI outgoes.
Kumar said the bank does not have adequate liabilities linked to the floating rate which makes such a floating product difficult.
Speaking on the RBI-mandated systemic shift to external benchmarked lending rates, he said SBI will have minimal issues with the same.
He said the industry leader was the first to move on to the repo-linked loans and deposits since May, and has many of its products aligned to the external benchmarks now.
However, he said such shifts make asset liability management ""challenging"" as there lack of floating rate liabilities now.
About the impact of the mega bank mergers on SBI, he said it will not impact the nation’s largest bank as SBI has specified business model and target segments, and will continue with the same."

LEH :
State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar has slammed a “selfish"" private sector lender for the crisis at Altico Capital, as its unilateral move to secure its own money can potentially cause troubles to the wider financial system.
The realty-focused non-banking lender Altico, which owes over  ₹4,500 crore to the system (mostly banks), defaulted on a nearly  ₹20 crore interest payment late last week on an external commercial borrowing (ECB) loan. The default by Altico has resulted in concerns over the wider implications.
According to reports, a leading private sector bank allegedly moved in to secure its exposure by “netting-off"" money from a fixed deposit maintained by Altico.
“If any bank makes a selfish move, it can have a negative impact on the rest of the system,"" State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar told reporters here over the weekend.
“You have taken care of the  ₹50-100 crore (exposure), and felt happy for saving your money, but if you are damaging the system, then it is not proper,"" Kumar said, without naming the private sector lender.
“Even in the case of the biggest of the companies, if a bank pulls the trigger or stops credit flow, the negative impact can come,"" he added.
The need is for bankers to mount coordinated efforts which help the entire financial system, he said, pointing out that the same is being used for biggest of the stressed cases.
The comments from the SBI chairman come days ahead of a bankers' meeting to find a solution.
Altico owes  ₹660 crore to the UAE-based Mashreq Bank,  ₹400 crore to SBI, and  ₹200 crore to UTI MF and  ₹150 crore to Reliance Nippon, as per India Ratings estimates.
Altico has defaulted on interest payment of  ₹19.97 crore to Mashreq Bank last week. On September 3, it was downgraded to junk status by rating agencies India Ratings and Care Ratings.
Altico is backed by marquee investors like Clearwater Capital Partners, Abu Dhabi Investment Council and Varde Partners.
The default was on the troubled company’s ECB loan, but was not reportedly allowed by the Reserve Bank of India to be used for interest repayments, leading to the default. As per they central bank's norms, ECBs by lenders can only be used for on-lending.
According to reports, the ECB money was kept with the private sector lender as a fixed deposit and it moved in swiftly to secure its loans on the news of its default."

NEW DELHI :
In its bid to create ""NextGen banks"", the finance ministry has decided to merge 10 public sector banks into four. The merger of United Bank of India (UBI) and Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) with Punjab National Bank (PNB) will give birth to India's second largest public sector bank after the State Bank of India (SBI). The PNB merger, which will make the bank bigger than Bank of Baroda (BoB), will come into effect from April 1 next year, according to a recent PTI report.
Hit by a $2 billion fraud and money laundering case centering around fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, the merged PNB's deposit market share will jump to 8% as compared to its standalone market share of 5.2% as of March 2019.
10 things to know about PNB merger:
1) PNB's total business after the merger will increase to  ₹17.95 lakh crore. Together, the merged entity will have 11,437 branches. Amongst all public sector banks, PNB will be smaller in size only after SBI. PNB will also have the second-largest branch network.
2) From April 1, when the merger comes into force, PNB is likely to have a new name.
3) Although bank unions have called for strike to protest against the merger, banks have made it clear that there will no retrenchment of staff in the merged entity, and also ruled out the possibility of bringing in Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS). PNB's CEO and MD Sunil Mehta said every employee is going to gain from the merger.

8) Last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that 10 public sector banks would be merged into four. Besides PNB, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank will also be merged into one. Union Bank of India will amalgamate with Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank while Indian Bank will merge with Allahabad Bank.

Piramal raises  ₹690 crore from Credit Suisse through NCDs
Piramal Enterprises Ltd has raised  ₹690 crore in debt financing from Credit Suisse, Mint reported citing regulatory filings. Separately, its financial services unit, Piramal Capital and Housing Finance Ltd, too, has raised  ₹300 crore through the sale of non-convertible debentures (NCDs). The debt raised from Credit Suisse will mature in September 2020. The fundraisings follow the firm’s bid last month to raise around  ₹3,000 crore by selling NCDs (including an option to retain over-subscription of up to  ₹2,500 crore). However, on 28 August, the company told the stock exchanges that the administrative panel of Piramal’s board had decided to defer the issue of privately placed NCDs to a future date.

255,2019-09-18,State Bank,"The discussion around teaser loans started after RBI directed banks to link their floating rate retail loans to an external benchmark earlier this monthThe central bank has not been in favour of these products ever since SBI first introduced them in 2009-10

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is not likely to allow the return of teaser home loans, following the introduction of the external benchmark-linked loan pricing, a central bank official said, requesting anonymity.
State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar had earlier said he will seek a clarification from the central bank on long-term home loans initially with fixed rates, and floating rates later.
“We have had difficulties with those products, as we had said back then when we prescribed higher risk weights. It’s basically pushing risk to a later date,"" the official added.
The SBI had tried to bring back teaser loans several times in the past. However, the RBI has not been in favour of it, ever since the SBI first introduced such products in 2009-10. The RBI felt banks could use the low interest rates to lure customers into taking these loans and then move to a higher market rate later. In 2011, the central bank had increased the provisioning on these loans to discourage banks from offering them.
Kumar, however, said the need to make the product floating in the latter part arises out of the bank’s inability to project the liability movements of the future.
The discussion around teaser loans started after the RBI directed banks to link their floating rate retail loans to an external benchmark earlier this month. The RBI felt the move came after the central bank felt that linking all new floating rate personal or retail loans or micro and small enterprises smalls could improve transmission of monetary policy.
Banks will have to adopt a uniform external benchmark within a loan category and they are free to decide the spread over the benchmark. The credit risk premium can be changed only when the borrower’s credit assessment sees a substantial change
Last week, credit rating agency Moody’s Investors Service said external benchmarking will be credit-negative for banks as it will limit their flexibility in managing interest rate risk.
According to the credit rating agency, under the new regime, while the floating rate loan book will get re-priced, only the non-CASA (current account savings accounts) deposits will see a repricing on deposits.
The new external benchmark-linked loan pricing was introduced after the central bank realized that transmission of policy rates to customers under the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) framework had not been satisfactory."

253,2019-09-19,State Bank,"SBI was the first bank to introduce home loan linked to RBI's repo rateFrom October 1, RBI has mandated banks to link new floating rate home, auto loans with external benchmarks

State Bank of India (SBI) has withdrawn the repo-rate linked home loan scheme. The country's largest bank said this on Twitter while responding to a customer's query. SBI was the first bank in India to introduce a home loan scheme linked to Reserve Bank of India's repo rate when it launched the new product in July. A Twitter user @yashuk22 wanted to know modalities and charges (if any) of converting his existing home loan to the repo-rate linked product. SBI responded: ""Kindly note that RLLR based home loan scheme have been withdrawn. You can get the home loan migrated to MCLR based home loan."" RLLR refers to repo-linked lending rate.
The withdrawal of repo rate linked home loan scheme from SBI comes ahead of the RBI's mandate to banks to link new floating rate home, auto loans with external benchmarks, from October 1.
Kindly note that RLLR based home loan scheme have been withdrawn. You can get the home loan migrated to MCLR based home loan.
An SBI official, on the condition of anonymity, said that those who have already borrowed under the repo rate linked scheme can continue under the scheme.
Earlier this week, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the bank will be seeking clarifications from RBI whether it can offer long-term home loans with fixed rates in the beginning and convert the same into floating rates later.
RBI has mandated banks to shift all retail lending to floating rates that will be determined by external benchmarks like the repo rate.
SBI chairman said there is a lack of clarity on how it can go ahead with the fixed rate products, after the RBI’s new regulations on floating rates.
State-run IDBI Bank on Monday said the introduction of repo-linked retail loans would be effective from 1 October. The bank had earlier said that it would introduce repo rate-linked home and auto loans with effect from 10 September
Some analysts had said that linking loans to external benchmarks could lead to a lot of volatility in EMIs as and when the benchmark change. But the new regime will bring in a lot of transparency and enable faster transmission of RBI rate revisions to borrowers. (With Agency Inputs)"
252,2019-09-19,State Bank,"RBI asked banks to link rates on floating rate loans to borrowers to an external benchmark from 1 October The RBI recently asked banks to link their lending rates on floating rate loans to retail, personal and MSME borrowers to an external benchmark from 1 October

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India (SBI) has put on hold its existing repo-linked home loan product and will launch a new one on 1 October, said a person familiar with the development, as the country’s largest lender by assets seeks to comply with the direction of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
SBI was the first to launch a repo-linked home loan in June. On 4 September, RBI asked banks to link rates on floating rate loans extended to retail, personal and micro, small and medium enterprises borrowers to an external benchmark from 1 October.
Several banks have already started linking lending rates to an external benchmark, including public sector lenders State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Punjab National Bank, and private lender Federal Bank.
According to the person, the new product will remove inconsistencies between the existing one and what RBI has said in its circular. For instance, while to become eligible for the repo rate-linked home loan from SBI, borrowers needed a minimum annual income of  ₹6 lakh, RBI has asked banks to make it available to all.
“Moreover, the existing product had a clause where interest rates would change at the month-end of RBI changing its repo rate. This needs to be tweaked as RBI has now asked banks to ensure rates are reset once every three months,"" he said. The bank, he said, will allow all existing home loan customers as on 30 September to switch to the new product.
SBI did not respond to an email till the time of going to press.
Mint reported on 16 June that in case of repo rate-linked home loans, borrowers need to repay a minimum 3% of their principal loan amount every year in equated monthly instalments. The maximum loan tenor of the earlier product was 33 years over and above maximum moratorium permitted of two years for under-construction properties. The total loan tenor can’t exceed 35 years and the bank charged a premium of 20 basis points above applicable interest rate if loan-to-value was above 80%.
RBI has allowed banks to choose between RBI’s repo rate, government’s three-month treasury bill yield published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd (FBIL), government’s six-month treasury bill yield published by FBIL or other benchmark market rate published by FBIL.
RBI has mandated various anchor rates—benchmarks based on which lending rates are set—for bank loans since 1994, before which interest rates used to be set by the regulator."

New Delhi: In mounting trouble for Jet Airways and its founder Naresh Goyal, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to initiate an independent probe into the books of the cash-strapped airlines, which has been under the scanner for alleged diversion of funds, a person familiar with the development said.
This comes in the wake of the probe agency quizzing Goyal last week, following which the agency found gaps in an audit carried out by the State Bank of India (SBI), which – according to a report by Business Standard – did not go into the details of funds trails and the alleged diversion of funds.
An official familiar with development said the agency would “decide how to proceed as the investigation is still on and some gaps have been observed"".
Last week, the probe agency also quizzed Goyal at its Mumbai office for alleged contravention of the foreign exchange law, a month after the agency conducted searches against him in August.
In August, the ED searched several premises, including Goyal's Mumbai residence, his group companies, their directors and the offices of Jet Airways.
According to a senior ED official, Goyal had registered 19 privately held companies, five of which were registered abroad.
The ED is probing charges that these firms allegedly carried out ""doubtful"" transactions under the guise of selling, distribution and operating expenses.
In August, the Centre also informed the Delhi High Court that Goyal was not cooperating in the probe that pertained to alleged fraud of  ₹18000 crore – an allegation that the airline's founder countered.
Goyal and his wife Anita had resigned from the board of Jet Airways in March following a debt restructuring plan. He had also resigned as the chairman of the airline which is facing insolvency proceedings."

KOLKATA :
State Bank of India (SBI) is expected to launch a co-lending business model soon with 4-5 medium to large-sized NBFCs, an official of the lender said.
Once the present hurdles relating to the integration of technology with the non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) are removed, the model of co-lending will be launched and it will be completely automated without manual intervention from on-boarding of customers to loan disbursement and monitoring, the SBI official said.
Under the co-lending model, the bank will have an exposure between 70 and 80 per cent while the rest will be borne by the NBFCs but this arrangement will be ""only"" for the priority sector lending, he said.
""We are close to launch co-lending financing model with NBFCs in line with the Reserve Bank of India guidelines. We will tie-up with 4-5 medium to large-sized NBFCs and it would be finalised in 30-40 days,"" SBI Deputy Managing Director Sujit KumarVarma said.
It has been a year since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) laid out the framework for co-origination of loans by banks and NBFCs in the priority sector. Co-origination is a new system introduced by the RBI in the wake of the liquidity crisis at non-banking finance companies to enhance the credit flow to productive sectors.
The designated officials are looking at the tie-ups with NBFCs and the lender is weighing whether the NBFCs have a robust business model and technology , he said.
""Entire process of co-lending business model will be automated taking from business proposal to disbursement and tracking of the account. Now, integration of technology of both the bank and NBFCs is underway,"" Varma said.
He said the co-lending model would help the bank to meet the priority sector lending target.

243,2019-09-24,State Bank,"Under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), a senior citizen can deposit up to  ₹15 lakh and the current interest rate is 8.6%The interest on SCSS is fully taxable, which is a major drawback of this scheme

NEW DELHI :
In view of the declining interest scenario, the government should consider exempting interest earned by senior citizens under SCSS from income tax as the fiscal cost would be minimal, a SBI study said on Tuesday.
Under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS), a senior citizen can deposit up to  ₹15 lakh and the current interest rate is 8.6 per cent. The tenure of this scheme is five years with the option to extend it for three more years.
However, the interest on SCSS is fully taxable, which is a major drawback of this scheme (the interest amount for  ₹1 lakh deposit for 5 years is around  ₹51,000 which is taxable).
""It will be fair if such amount is given full tax rebate as the revenue foregone by the government could be only  ₹3,092 crore, that will have the minimal 2 bps impact on government fiscal deficit,"" said the SBI Ecowrap report.
Most of the banks, including SBI, have been reducing interest on fixed deposits in tandem with the Reserve Bank of India's decision to slash its policy rate (repo), which will have a bearing on interest income of senior citizens.
With the RBI mandating banks to link lending rates to external benchmark from October 1, the stage is now set for instantaneous transmission of change in repo rate to lending rates.
Thus, if the repo rates changes by 25 bps in either direction, lending rates will change in exact equivalent amount in either direction.
While such an external benchmarking is most welcome, some points deserves special mention, the report said.
""First, our estimate suggests that there are around 41 million senior citizens term deposits accounts in the country with total deposit of  ₹14 lakh crore, 7 per cent of India's GDP,"" said Ecowrap.
The average deposit size per account, it added, is around  ₹3.3 lakh and interest income from such deposits forms 5.5 per cent of Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) in 2018-19.
""Given the declining interest rate scenario, this might go down and will impact PFCE also,"" it said.
The second point is that the RBI should also now mandate that the liability of the banks ""also move in tandem"" with lending rates.
Possibly, the only solution is that the regulator strictly enforces that all incremental bulk deposits have to be repo linked or otherwise, it added.
As per the SBI study, rough estimates indicate that a 100 basis points decline in deposit rates (bulk and savings bank) translates into around 45-50 bps decline in lending rates."

NEW DELHI :
India's largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), has informed stock exchanges that the proposed two-day bank strike from September 26-27 has been deferred. SBI branches will, therefore, remain open on the last two days of the week.
""Furtherto our letter no. CC/S&B/SA/682 dated 16.0g.2019 on the captioned matter, we inform that the proposed strike has been deferred. This is for your information and appropriate dissemination,"" SBI said in a BSE filing.
To protest against the mega merger of state-run banks and demanding a pay hike, a cluster of four bank unions had earlier threatened to shut all bank branches for two days. Since the two-day bank strike was followed by two days of weekend, banks would have remained shut for a consecutive period of four days.
Earlier, SBI had said it had made all arrangements to ensure normal functioning in its branches and offices but it feared that work in the bank could be impacted to some extent by the strike.
The bank unions decided to postpone the strike following a meeting with finance secretary Rajiv Kumar. ""Today a delegation of four officers' organisations met Shri Rajeev Kumar, Finance Secretary and had a threadbare discussion on various issues related to our strike call on 26th & 27th September'19,"" the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) said.
""It was assured that a high power committee will be formed to look into the related to mergers. We also discussed our Wage Revision, 5 day week, issues of retirees, cross selling, etc. In view of the positive commitments, it is felt that we should defer our strike decision,"" the bank union spearheading the strike call said.
The union had also threatened an indefinite strike in November.
Two other bank unions -- All India bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) -- have, in the meantime, threatened to sit on a day-long strike on October 22."

246,2019-09-24,State Bank,"The new interest rate mechanism from SBI will be effective from OctoberSBI has made some modifications to its existing repo-linked home loan scheme

State Bank of India or SBI, the country’s largest lender, has decided to adopt Reserve Bank of India’s repo rate as the external benchmark for all floating rate loans for MSME, home and retail loans effective October 1, 2019. RBI had earlier asked banks to link all new floating rate personal or retail loans (home, auto, etc.) and floating rate loans to Micro and Small Enterprises to external benchmarks from October 01, 2019.
The benchmarks include RBI's repo rate, Government of India 3-Months Treasury Bill yield published by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL), Government of India 6-Months Treasury Bill yield published by the FBIL or any other benchmark market interest rate published by the FBIL.
The RBI said banks are free to offer such external benchmark linked loans to other types of borrowers as well.
SBI said it has voluntarily extended the external benchmark based lending to Medium Enterprises also, to boost lending to the MSME sector as a whole.
SBI had introduced repo-linked floating rate home loans from July 1, 2019. SBI said a few modifications have been made in the scheme effective 1st October 2019 to comply with the latest regulatory guidelines.
Coming back to the new RBI guidelines for new floating rate home and auto loans, the banks have to reset rates at least once in three months, depending on the change of the external benchmark.
Banks have been given the freedom to decide the spread over the external benchmark. However, credit risk premium can change only when borrower’s credit assessment undergoes a substantial change, as agreed upon in the loan contract. 
Further, other components of spread including operating cost could be changed once in three years. 
Existing loans and credit limits linked to the MCLR/Base Rate/BPLR shall continue till repayment or renewal, as the case may be.
The RBI also said that existing floating rate term loans sanctioned to borrowers who are eligible to prepay a floating rate loan without pre-payment charges will be eligible for switch to external benchmark without any charges/fees, except reasonable administrative/legal costs. And the final rate charged to this category of borrowers, post switchover to external benchmark, shall be same as the rate charged for a new loan of the same category, type, tenor and amount, at the time of origination of the loan."

Indian stock markets had consolidated on Tuesday after a two-day rally. Shares had rallied after Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman reduced corporate taxes, leading to many brokerages upgrading their Sensex targets and earnings estimates of India Inc. Among the Sensex stocks, SBI led the losers, falling and Tata Motors were down over 6%. Other major losers included Maruti Suzuki, M&M, HDFC and Tata Steel.
Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking, remains cautious on Indian markets after a combined 3,000-point Sensex rally on Friday and Monday. ""We prefer to remain cautious at higher levels. Indian benchmark indices are trading near peak valuations and sustainability at this level is essential,"" he said.
""Therefore, investors would closely monitor the movement in the coming sessions, as volatility would remain high. From medium to long-term perspective, outcome of RBI monetary policy and revival in corporate earnings will be crucial, as it is likely to dictate further market trend,"" he added.

The US House of Representatives will launch a formal impeachment inquiry over whether President Donald Trump sought help from the Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. Trump has denied the claims. It is uncertain whether the results of the inquiry will lead to an impeachment because of Trump's support in the Republican-controlled Senate.

Mumbai: Indian equity markets fell over 1% on Wednesday following a decline in banking and auto stocks, and ahead of the expiry of the September series of futures and options contract. The fall in global equity markets following the announcement of opening of a formal impeachment inquiry of US President Donald Trump also dampened sentiment.
The benchmark Sensex was down 1.29%, or 503.62 points, at 38,593.52, while the Nifty fell 1.28% to 11,440.20. Stock markets in Japan, China, Hong Kong and Korea also declined up to 1%.

""Political uproar in U.S to impeach president Trump led to selloff in global market, seems a short-term reaction.

India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."

""The NCLT has given CoC another 15 days to make the payout,"" the person said requesting anonymity.
As things stand, only the State Bank of India (SBI), which has the highest exposure towards Jet Airway's debt, has made a payout of about  ₹10 crore for interim funding, while other lenders are yet to make their contribution, the person added.
A consortium of 26 bankers, led by the SBI, had earlier approached the tribunal in June to recover dues of over  ₹8,500 crore from the grounded airline. The lenders had been trying to sell the beleaguered airline as a going concern for the past few months.
Meanwhile, the CoC had on 19 July approved the interim funding of $10 million (about  ₹71 crore according to Wednesday's exchange rate) for hiring people on contracts to verify claims made by different creditors of the airline and for maintenance of aircraft.
Jet Airways has been grounded since 18 April, due to an acute fund crunch.

Country's biggest lender SBI or State Bank of India has announced the modalities of its new repo rate-linked home loan scheme. SBI, which was the first bank in India to launch a repo rate-linked home loan scheme in July, had earlier withdrawn the earlier scheme. SBI had earlier said that it has decided to adopt Reserve Bank of India’s repo rate as the external benchmark for all floating rate loans for MSME, home and retail loans effective October 1, 2019. According to new RBI rules, banks have to link all new floating rate home, auto and other retail loans to external benchmarks from 1 st October 2019.
Key things to know about SBI's new repo-linked home loan scheme:
1) SBI will charge a spread of 265 basis points over the RBI's repo rate (currently at 5.4%) to calculate its external benchmark-based lending rate, which comes to 8.05%. SBI will charge a premium of 15 basis points for effective home loan rate, which comes 8.20%. This applies to home loans up to  ₹30 lakh and for salaried class borrowers.
2) For SBI home loans between  ₹30 lakh to  ₹75 lakh for salaried class, the premium goes up to 40 basis points which means the effective rate is 8.45%.
3) For SBI home loans above  ₹75 lakh for salaried class, the premium over external benchmark-based lending rate will be 50 basis points, meaning the effective rate will be 8.55%.
4) SBI also said that a premium of 15 basis points will be added to the card rate for non-salaried borrowers.
5) A concession of 5 basis points on home loan rates will be given to woman borrowers, SBI said.
6) If the loan to value ratio is between 80% and 90%, a premium of 10 bps will be added to the card rate for loan up to  ₹30 lakh, SBI said.
7) For borrowers who fall under RG or risk grade (4 to 6), a premium of 10 bps will be added to the card rate.
Under the new RBI guidelines, banks are free to decide the spread over the external benchmark in case of new floating rate retail loans. The RBI also said that existing floating rate term loans sanctioned to borrowers who are eligible to prepay a floating rate loan without pre-payment charges will be eligible for switch to external benchmark without any charges/fees, except reasonable administrative/legal costs.

“…as advised by public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs), the 0.75% cashback on fuel transactions will be discontinued w.e.f. (with effect from) Oct (20)19,"" a message sent by SBI Cards to users said.
All the oil marketing companies have told banks to discontinue the cashback for only credit card users from October, an official with one of the fuel retailers said. However, cashback and discount for users of other digital payment methods will continue, the official said.

Ltd -- give a cashback equivalent to 0.75% of the value of fuel purchased using credit and debit cards and e-wallets. The discount is credited to the buyer’s account within three days of the transaction.
Cashback on fuel purchases was introduced by the government to promote digital payments due to a widespread cash crunch after demonetisation in late 2016.

MUMBAI :
Financial services firm Vivriti Capital, which runs an online marketplace for mid-market corporates to raise debt, plans to raise  ₹500 crore for a debt fund that will invest in companies in its marketplace, said a top executive of the firm.
Along with the marketplace model, where large-cap investors such as State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Templeton Mutual Fund lend to mid-market corporates, Vivriti also lends from its own balance sheet as a part of these transactions to showcase its deep involvement in the business.
“There will always be different sources of capital, who want to invest in different ways, directly, on our balance sheet, and as a fund. We are raising this alternative investment fund (AIF) so that we have a structure that can absorb every type of money. The AIF becomes another participant in the marketplace,"" Vineet Sukumar, co-founder and managing director Vivriti Capital, said in an interview.
Vivriti’s own loan-book is about  ₹1,000 crore, which it expects to grow to  ₹2,500 crore by the end of this fiscal, Sukumar said. Disbursals from the marketplace are also expected to increase from about  ₹19,000 crore so far to about  ₹29,000 crore by 31 March 2020, he said.
The new debt fund will have a base size of  ₹250 crore with an equal amount as a greenshoe option, which will let the fund raise more capital in case of robust investor demand.
The investors in the fund are expected to be large insurance companies, high net-worth individuals (HNIs), and bank treasuries, Sukumar said. “While the LP (limited partners) base will mostly be domestic, we are setting up a structure to raise money from overseas, and are setting up an offshore manager,"" he added.
Vivriti expects to close the fundraise by the end of this fiscal. The firm has already received commitments worth  ₹140 crore, and plans to start investing from the fund from next month onwards, Sukumar said. He said the fund will lend to mid-size corporates and financial institutions with annual revenues of around  ₹50 crore.
It also plans to raise further equity capital, and has started a formal process to raise  ₹450 crore from private equity funds, Sukumar said.

232,2019-09-26,State Bank,"Those looking to invest should take currency fluctuations into accountA depreciation in the rupee pushes up returns from international funds and vice versa

After nearly 5 years of stagnation and decline, the overseas assets of mutual funds rose by 31% to  ₹4,499 crore in FY 19 according to an RBI Survey released on 17th September. Much of this increase was a result of some foreign markets and currencies doing better than India, but these funds are beginning to see some investor interest. If we strip out the effect of rupee depreciation and look at US dollar assets, these rose from USD 528 million to USD 650 million in FY 19, a roughly 23% increase. However they still have some way to go before they attain the previous peak of USD 721 million reached in March 2014. Their total level is also a tiny fraction of the  ₹23.7 lakh crore size of the Indian mutual fund industry indicating the huge scope for geographic diversification that lies ahead.
Indian mutual funds are collectively subject to a USD 5 billion limit by the RBI for overseas investments. On a per AMC level, this limit stands at USD 300 million. The present collective level of USD 650 million is well short of the USD 5 billion limit. Indian mutual funds invest abroad through fund of funds (FoFs) and through equity mutual funds which invest a certain portion of their holdings in foreign stocks. The latter variety of funds (such as PPFAS Long Term Equity Fund) typically place 65% gross assets in Indian stocks so that they are treated as domestic equity funds for tax purposes. However they put a significant chunk of the balance 35% in foreign stocks. Given the highly varied nature of international mutual funds, their collective performance is not adequately represented by the average. However the US focused funds among them have performed extremely well. As of 17th September, the best performing mutual fund scheme in India was the Motilal Oswal NASDAQ ETF, an exchange traded fund which tracks the NASDAQ Index in the US which delivered a CAGR of 17.5% over the past 5 years.
This performance is beginning to attract the interest of Asset Management Companies (AMCs). On 13th September, SBI Mutual Fund filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) for SBI International Access US Equity Fund. Domestic brokerages are also waking up to the opportunity. On 25th September, HDFC Securities announced a partnership with a US brokerage DriveWealth LLC for giving customers a route to invest in US stocks. Investors opting for this route will have to open a broking account with HDFC Securities’ overseas partner and remit money via the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS) of the RBI to the broking account. Direct stock investment, unlike investment through mutual funds, is capped at USD 250,000 per person per year by the RBI under the LRS.
Those looking to invest should take currency fluctuations into account. A depreciation in the rupee pushes up returns from international funds and vice versa.
“Investors should be prepared to deal with currency risk. Historically the Indian rupee has depreciated due to higher inflation in India than other countries. However with inflation in India coming down the average annual depreciation should fall from 5-6% to about 4%,"" said Amol
Joshi, founder Plan Rupee Investment Services. “Macroeconomic events do cause sharp moves to much bigger magnitudes but these eventually mean revert. The SIP route will protect you from currency fluctuations to some extent,"" he said."

The interest offered on these saving schemes are reviewed quarterly by the government. The government is expected to announce the interest rate on savings scheme offered by the post office in a couple of days.

For one-year time deposit, Post Office offers an interest rate of 6.9%. For time deposit for a tenure of 2 and 3 years, it offers an interest rate of 6.9%. For five-year time deposit account, Post Office offers an interest rate of 7.7%.

MUMBAI :
Real estate-focused lender Altico Capital India Ltd, which defaulted on interest payments, is in talks with private equity funds, including Apollo Global Management and Cerberus Capital, for a stake sale, according to two people aware of the development.
The non-bank lender has approached several funds to invest in the company, said one of the two people cited above. “While a portion of the investment will be used to pay back lenders, the rest of the fund is likely to be deployed for project completion,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.
Altico’s troubles started when it missed an interest payment to Dubai-based Mashreq Bank on 12 September. On 20 September, Mint reported that Altico has told its lenders that as part of a resolution plan, it is in talks to sell some assets and infuse fresh funds from new shareholders. For this, Altico said it is working alongside turnaround advisory firm Alvarez and Marsal and legal advisory firm Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas & Co. It also sought a moratorium on further repayments from its lenders.
Apollo Global and Cerberus are among the few private equity firms which Altico is in a serious conversation with, the second person said, adding the investors have proposed a 30-40% haircut on the debt owed to the lenders, as part of the deal to infuse fresh capital into the lender.
Mint could not ascertain the quantum of the stake or capital that Altico is looking to raise from these investors. At present, Altico’s total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.55 crore, from 27 lenders including Yes Bank, State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, among others.
Email queries sent to a spokesperson of Cerberus Capital remained unanswered till the time of going to press. Nipun Sahni, head of Apollo Global’s real estate arm in India, did not respond to calls and text messages seeking comment on the development. Altico Capital’s chief operating officer (COO) Sanjeev Agrawal too did not respond to calls and email queries.
Altico is one of the many shadow banks affected by the souring of market sentiment, following defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS).
“A significant strain in short-term financing markets precipitated by the September 2018 default by IL&FS created a knock-on impact on other NBFCs and the real estate sector in general,"" Altico Capital said in a statement earlier this month.
Mint reported on 23 September that Altico’s three shareholders—private equity firms Varde Partners, Clearwater Capital Partners and Abu Dhabi Investment Council—had initiated negotiations with its lenders for a debt restructuring while also planning to either offload their stakes or sell a large portion of the portfolio.
On 22 September, the lender asked its chief operating officer Agrawal to take charge of the company following the sudden resignation of its CEO Sanjay Grewal."

Mumbai: Bajaj Finance Ltd on Tuesday surpassed state-run lender State Bank of India (SBI) in terms of market capitalisation for the first time, with shares of the former having surged over 50% so far this year. SBI has fallen 13% so far this year.
Bajaj Finance, which was trading at  ₹3,992.20 on the BSE, down 1.4% from previous close, has a market cap of  ₹2.32 trillion. SBI, which fell 6% to  ₹254.55 a share, has a market cap of  ₹2.28 trillion.
""With the upcoming festive season and several planned online and offline mega sales events ahead, we reiterate our theme around Bajaj Finance being in the best position to play the India consumption story,"" said Emkay Research in a 25 September note.
The brokerage firm has upgraded its earnings per share for fiscal year 2020-21 by 9-10%, factoring in the corporate tax cut. Emkay Research remained ‘overweight’ on the stock with a target price of  ₹4,550 a share.
Bajaj Finance has a total loan book of  ₹1.25 trillion, whereas SBI’s loan book stood at  ₹22.40 trillion.
Gross non-performing asset as percentage of advances of Bajaj Finance stood at 0.6% as of fiscal 2019 against 0.4% a year ago.
On 24 September, Morgan Stanley had downgraded the State Bank of India to ‘equal weight’ from ‘overweight’ amid asset quality and net interest uncertainty. It maintained the target price of the lender’s shares at  ₹330. According to Bloomberg data, SBI has 45 buys, four holds and one sell.
""We raise our F21 and F22 EPS estimates ~5% each, as the tax rate cut outweighs lower margins. We downgrade to EW; upside appears limited given uncertainty on asset quality (for SBI and the system) and NIMs. We prefer large private banks where we see better EPS progression and re-rating,"" Morgan Stanley report said.
Banking stocks fell sharply over the past few sessions following concerns over financial irregularities and surging bad loans. Fall in credit growth, recent default by Altico Capital, and issues with PMC Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and DHFL dented investor sentiment."
221,2019-10-02,State Bank,"When investing towards a goal with a fixed time frame and a corpus expectation, the first thing to ensure would be that you are investing sufficient amount of money periodically to enable you to get to your goal

I am currently investing  ₹1,500 each in SBI Magnum Midcap fund, SBI Magnum Multicap fund, Axis Bluechip fund and Axis Midcap fund;  ₹500 in DSP BR Small Cap fund;  ₹1,000 in DSP Midcap fund; and  ₹2,500 in Axis Long Term Equity fund. I want to build a corpus worth  ₹2 crore in the next 15 years. Am I on the right track?
—Pradeep
When investing towards a goal with a fixed time frame and a corpus expectation, the first thing to ensure would be that you are investing sufficient amount of money periodically to enable you to get to your goal. In your case, if your target is  ₹2 crore in 15 years, you would need to save and invest  ₹42,000 a month during this period, assuming a reasonable (but not low) 12% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) from your portfolio. So, the first thing you need to do to ensure that you are on the right track is to either lower your corpus requirement, or increase your SIP amount, or both. You are presently investing  ₹10,000 a month. If you continue on this course, you will likely end up with a corpus of  ₹50 lakh in 15 years. You could, if possible, increase your investments to  ₹20,000 and expect to generate a corpus of about  ₹1 crore during this period.
Regarding your portfolio, it is an aggressive all-equity portfolio that is split almost half and half between funds that invest in the broad market (multi-cap, tax-saving funds etc.) and those that invest in small- and mid-cap segments. It would be better to streamline the portfolio into four or five funds with careful category allocations. One fund from the large-cap category, one from the multi-cap category (and possibly another from the similarly segmented, but differentially themed value investing category), and two mid- and small-cap funds would do for your portfolio. You can choose the right set of funds from the Mint 50 list of funds across these categories to build your portfolio. Such a portfolio would still be aggressive, but would be better structured with funds that are well-curated from the universe of options.

218,2019-10-03,State Bank,"In FY19, Bajaj Finance generated a net profit of  ₹3,995 crore, far higher than SBI’s  ₹862 croreInvestors were reminded this week that further stress on SBI’s book is imminent

Mumbai: Why do investors prize Bajaj Finance more than the country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) when the former is just a fraction of the size of the latter?
This week, the nimble consumer lender’s market capitalisation surpassed that of the banking giant. Note that SBI has a balance sheet size of  ₹22.4 trillion, about 14 times the size of Bajaj Finance’s book.
But what use is size, if it doesn’t result in greater profits? Investors love profits and a company that dishes profits every year with a promise of more will enjoy investor love.
In FY19, Bajaj Finance generated a net profit of  ₹3,995 crore, far higher than SBI’s  ₹862 crore. SBI suffered in that year simply because its bad loans ate up much of the profits. In the first quarter of FY20, the company reported a net profit of  ₹1,195 crore, while SBI’s was  ₹2,312 crore.
Besides, the fact remains that growth prospects at Bajaj Finance look better. The latter has less of a problem recovering loans. In the coming quarters, SBI will have to set aside more profits towards bad loans, something which Bajaj Finance needn’t do.
SBI’s book is dominated by corporate loans, which also means that in times of stress, the bank will face exponential increase in delinquencies compared with others simply because of the size of its exposures.
Investors were reminded this week that further stress on SBI’s book is imminent considering it has exposure to some troubled non-bank finance companies.
Bajaj Finance, on the other hand, is no troubled NBFC. It has a business model that rests on making individuals take equate monthly instalments to fund their desires and lifestyle purchases. Considering that India’s households are net savers with low leverage, the company stands to benefit from the sheer potential of growth in retail loans.
No wonder Bajaj Finance adds millions of new consumers to its business every year while SBI’s growth cannot match that of the consumer lender.
Analysts at Jeffries India Pvt Ltd said that Bajaj Finance could report 30% loan growth on a compounded annual growth basis for FY19-21 period. “Given its high pre-tax return on assets, we expect Bajaj Finance could see a 280-300 basis points return on equity boost (if it retains the gains), which supports a higher sustainable growth rate (without external capital) in the longer term,"" the firm said in a note.
SBI, on the other hand, faces higher provisioning and lower loan growth. But there is no denying that at a multiple of 7 times its estimated book value for FY21, Bajaj Finance valuations are stretched.
In contrast, SBI trades at a discount to its FY21 estimated book value. SBI may be a tired elephant but it is in no way giving up the race. With the bank consciously de-risking its balance sheet, valuations could see a relook."

A recurring deposit (RD) account is a good way of making periodic investments. RD accounts fetch you more interest than savings bank accounts. RD is a type of term deposit offered by banks. RD schemes allow customers to build up their savings through regular monthly deposits of fixed sum over a fixed period of time. An RD account allows you to deposit a pre-specified amount at pre-decided intervals. The installment amount once fixed, cannot be altered. An RD account can be opened with a bank or post office. Both State Bank of India (SBI) and Post Office offer RD options to their customers.
Here is a comparison of RD accounts offered by SBI and post office:
1) State Bank of India or SBI has lowered the interest rate on recurring deposits (RDs) effective from 10th September 2019. SBI RD interest rates vary between 5.80%-6.25% for general public and an additional interest rate hike of 50 basis points for senior citizens. Post Office RDs offer a quite high interest rate of 7.2% per annum, compounding quarterly. These rates are effective from 1st October.
2) SBI recurring deposits have maturity ranging from 1 year to 10 years, but Post Office offer RDs for a tenure of 5 years only.
3) An SBI RD account can be opened by cheque/cash, but an RD account in a Post Office can be opened by cash only.
4) You can open an SBI RD account online through net banking facility, but for opening a post office RD account you have to visit the Post Office branch.
5) In SBI RD account, customers are required to make monthly deposits of minimum of  ₹100 and in multiples of  ₹10. There is no maximum limit on the deposits. But the minimum amount required for opening a Post Office RD is  ₹10 per month, or any amount in multiples of  ₹5. However, there is no maximum limit on investment.
6) The government decides the 5-year RD rate for Post Office. However, for SBI, the interest rates vary from tenure to tenure and these days the banks are revising them on a regular basis after the RBI rate cut.
7) SBI RD account can be started with a minimum monthly deposit of  ₹100. However, there is no maximum limit. But the minimum amount required for opening a post office RD is Rs10 per month, or any amount in multiples of  ₹5. However, there is no maximum limit on investment."

Mumbai: A report by state run State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday said that the deposit insurance coverage in India is one of the lowest in the world.
A deposit insurance coverage ensures that the depositor gets a certain amount, before the bank pays other parties at the time of liquidation.
In India, deposits are insured up to  ₹1 lakh, while the comparable number for BRICS countries like Brazil and Russia stand at  ₹42 lakh and  ₹12 lakh, respectively.
""Data on Cross Country Deposit insurance Coverage limit shows that deposit insurance coverage in India is one of the lowest at  ₹1 lakh / $1508 / 0.9 times India's per capital income, "" an SBI Ecowrap report said.
According to the report, another diverging trend that appeared pertained to the number of accounts - over 60% of the total accounts are less than  ₹1 lakh, while around 70% are less than  ₹2 lakh, and 98.2% are less than  ₹15 lakh.
""So clearly, it seems on paper that the number of small depositors are adequately covered in terms of insurance cover, but in terms of quantum of deposits, we observe that percentage of deposits less than  ₹1 lakh is only 7.8% of the deposit base,"" the report said.
Besides, 20.4% of the deposits are contributed by customers having deposits of more than  ₹15 lakh but less than  ₹1 crore, with average deposits of  ₹35 lakh.
Effectively, customers with balances between  ₹15 lakh and  ₹1 crore get protection only to the extent of 2.8% of their deposits, though the premium is paid on the entire value of deposits held by them, the report added."

The State Bank of India (SBI) has reduced the interest rate on its savings account for balances below  ₹1 lakh to a historic low of just 3.25%. As a banking customer, you can earn a higher interest rate by switching to another bank. Unlike fixed deposits, there is no lock-in for savings accounts.
Also, remember that savings account interest up to  ₹10,000 is tax free under Section 80 TTA of the Income Tax Act, 1961. For senior citizens, this tax-free allowance goes to  ₹50,000 under Section 80 TTB. In other words, you can safely earn higher interest by shifting to another bank without necessarily paying higher tax.
Which bank to shift to
You have several options including public sector banks and private sector banks. In addition, the RBI has created newer categories of banks such as payments banks and small finance banks. “I would suggest a shift towards banks giving a higher interest rate. This will also increase the returns for clients who are doing Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in mutual funds,"" said Vineet Iyer, a Pune-based financial planner. An SIP transfers a fixed amount into a mutual fund every month from a bank account. However the money earns the savings account interest between SIP dates.
“However I would avoid co-operative banks and small finance banks,"" he said. The recent crisis in Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank (PMC Bank) which had a close to 73% exposure to a single borrower has brought home the risk in certain categories of banks. Your money in banks is only guaranteed up to a sum of  ₹1 lakh under the Deposit Insurance and Guarantee Corporation of India. That said, among mid to large private sector banks, IDFC First Bank offers a 6% rate on savings accounts with balance less than  ₹1 lakh. RBL Bank offers a 5% rate of interest.
Things to watch out for
Apart from the risk of default highlighted above, savers should also consider if they are losing out on ancillary benefits if they are shifting out their savings account, such as reward points on debit cards, a low minimum balance requirement or free ATM withdrawals. For many individuals, the strength of the branch network also matters. A branch close to one’s house greatly eases banking convenience. Finally, they should note the fact that there is no lock-in of a savings bank rate and the new bank may lower its savings account rate at any time. “However these banks will have to maintain some gap over SBI to attract savers. Also cuts in savings account interest tend to be gradual,"" said Iyer."
204,2019-10-10,State Bank,"Bank cites adequate liquidity situation, move comes days after RBI rate cutThe one-year marginal cost of funds based lending rate, or MCLR, stands reduced to 8.05%

MUMBAI :
Less than a week after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered policy rates, the State Bank of India (SBI) on Wednesday cut lending and deposit rates citing adequate liquidity situation.
The country’s largest bank reduced the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) across tenures. The one-year MCLR, therefore, stands reduced to 8.05%. The new rate may not be applicable to existing home loan borrowers immediately unless these loans are set for a one-year reset clause.
SBI also cut interest rates on its saving accounts for balance below  ₹1 lakh to a historic low of 3.25%. The new interest rates on savings deposits will be effective from 1 November. The bank also reduced interest rates on retail term deposits and bulk term deposits by 10bps and 30bps, respectively, for 1 year to less than 2 years’ tenor. The new fixed deposit rates will be effective from 10 October 2019.
Two years ago, SBI was the first bank to cut savings deposit rate by 50bps to 3.5%. Soon others followed suit. Most banks currently offer 3.5% interest on savings deposits up to  ₹50 lakh. Small and mid-sized private sector banks such as IDFC First Bank offer a 6% rate on savings accounts with balance less than  ₹1 lakh. RBL Bank offers a 5% rate.
In May this year, SBI had introduced repo linked savings account for balance above  ₹1 lakh, while interest for balance up to  ₹1 lakh was retained at 3.5%. At the current repo rate of 5.15%, this would mean a meagre 2.4% on such deposit rates. However, to avoid pain to depositors, SBI had capped the minimum rate on savings deposits at 3%.
“SBI’s move to bring down the savings deposit rates is aimed at bringing down overall cost of funds. It will help banks to partially protect their net interest margins (NIMs). Other large banks with higher casa (current and savings account ratio) are also likely to follow suit with a reduction in savings account deposit rates,"" said Asutosh Mishra, head of research, Ashika Institutional.
SBI aims to safeguard its margins from the impact of introduction of external benchmark linked retail loans, through a reduction in the savings interest rate. Under the repo linked loans, the loan rate is adjusted as and when RBI revises its benchmark rate. In its recent policy announcement, the central bank hinted at the possibility of further rate cuts after stating that it will maintain accommodative stance till growth revives. This would mean that lending rates will get repriced much faster than deposits, putting pressure on bank margins.
On 1 October, SBI had introduced repo rate linked home loan scheme for new customers. Under this scheme, SBI charges a spread of 265bps over RBI’s repo rate (currently at 5.15%) to calculate its external benchmark-based lending rate. SBI also charges a premium for effective home loan rate to maintain its margins."

198,2019-10-13,State Bank,"Weakness in sentiment, stress in agriculture segment have continued to affect rural demand, say analystsHUL may witness tepid growth in sales volume in Q2 amid subdued demand in the rural markets

Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL), India’s largest listed consumer packaged goods company by sales, may witness tepid growth in sales volume in the fiscal second quarter amid continued subdued demand in the rural markets.
Volume growth at HUL, which makes Surf Excel detergents and Ponds personal care items among others, has slowed in the past seven quarters. Sales volume grew 5% in the June quarter even as net profit rose 15% to  ₹1,755 crore.
The company is scheduled to announce its September quarter earnings on Monday.
“As rural growth falls behind urban, volume (growth of HUL) is likely to decelerate to around 4%,"" SBICap Securities Ltd said in a report.
“Weakness in sentiment and stress in agriculture segment have continued to affect rural offtake,"" it said.
However, it also pointed out that even though demand remains weak, it is not at “an alarming rate.""
According to the report, HUL’s premium portfolio has also seen deceleration but fared relatively better and continues to maintain or grow its share.
Consumer firms in India have been reeling under weak market sentiment, aggravated by a slump in demand in rural areas, a liquidity crunch and irregular monsoons in vast swathes of the country.
“We expect HUL’s revenue to grow 7% on a year-on-year to  ₹9,880 crore, with underlying domestic volume growth of 6% in the second quarter of financial year 2019-2020,"" said Krishnan Sambamoorthy, vice-president (institutional research and consumer sector), Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd in a report.
The report attributed the overall slowdown to the ongoing liquidity concerns, succession of drought and floods during the monsoon season in large parts of the country, and muted initial response to the festive season.
According to analysts, recent incentives by the Union government including capital infusion in state-run banks to tide over the current liquidity issue as well as lowering of corporate tax rates will begin to show a positive impact in the coming quarters.
“We are not assuming any benefits of the corporate tax reduction in 2QFY20 as many companies would have paid advance tax,"" Sambamoorthy said. Edelweiss Research estimates HUL’s volume growth to slip to 3% in the September quarter. “Second quarter of financial year 2019-2020 is likely to mark the slowest volume growth for consumer goods companies since the first quarter of 2017-2018 which was impacted by GST (goods and consumer tax)-related destocking,"" Edelweiss said in a report.
Mint reported on 9 October that FMCG firms are expected to record another tepid quarter of volume growth as they continue to face headwinds both in rural and urban markets.
On an average, analysts expect packaged consumer goods firms to register revenue growth between 6.4% and 9.3% while recording volume growth between 3% and 6%, according to estimates by several brokerage firms, the report said."
199,2019-10-13,State Bank,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

MUMBAI :
The newly-appointed resolution professional (RP) for the Videocon group has sought expressions of interest (EoI) for 13 group companies undergoing resolution using the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), according to a document seeking bids.
This comes after the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 8 August approved consolidation of the separate resolution processes and approved the change of RP on 25 September.

Among the twenty lenders to these companies are Allahabad Bank, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Bank of Maharashtra, Bank of Baroda, United Bank of India and Canara Bank.
Prior to the consolidation, claims of financial creditors of Videocon Industries stood at  ₹59,451.87 crore, as on 12 November, 2018 and has not been updated since.

According to Videocon Industries’ FY18 annual report, the referral of the company to NCLT under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016, had a severe impact on the perceptions of the dealers/customers on account of un-certainty of the after sales services, forcing the company to offer additional discounts and incentives resulting in losses."

193,2019-10-15,State Bank,"Rajnish Kumar said the agencies should follow this rule especially in case of companies undergoing bankruptcy process, as new suitors are 'not fools' to risk their moneyHe said there will not be any more consolidations once the number of state-run lenders gets down to 12

Mumbai: State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar on Tuesday said the Enforcement Directorate and other central law enforcement agencies should restrict to attaching personal assets while investigating a promoter and keep off the company which is under the insolvency process.
Speaking a day after NCLAT asked the ED to release the attached properties of Bhushan Power & Steel which is being taken over by JSW Steel, Kumar asserted the lenders' first right of taking charge of an asset of its bank-financed and said no one should dispute the same.
""Any action which ED or any other central authority has to take, they can take with the existing promoters and attach their personal assets leaving their companies away,"" he said, speaking at a Bloomberg event here.
Kumar said the agencies should follow this rule especially in case of companies which are undergoing bankruptcy process, as new suitors are ""not fools"" to risk their money.
""The person acquiring a company cannot be subjected to any harassment by any agencies and I am sure that will be guaranteed now,"" Kumar said, adding as per the spirit of the bankruptcy code, an acquirer needs a ""clean asset"".
It can be noted that over the weekend ED had attached assets worth  ₹4,025 crore while probing money laundering linked to an alleged bank loan fraud against the BPSL promoters. This was challenged by JSW Steel at the NCLAT, which on Monday had slammed the ED, saying the bankruptcy code would fail if the agency functioned like this and ordered the property be released. JSW Steel had won the bid to buy company for  ₹19,700 crore.
Kumar said the Supreme Court judgment on Essar Steel should address much of the worries which are leading to legal tangles in the nascent bankruptcy laws.
He said there will not be any more consolidations once the number of state-run lenders gets down to 12, and private sector lenders should also acquire smaller rivals.
Meanwhile, Kumar also said since public private partnership model has not succeeded, a new model needs to emerge and the government cannot continue to take the financial burden on projects.
If required, we bankers should be willing to take pains in the short-term as a new model emerges, he added.
""I am not saying all was well or is well with the behaviour of promoters. There are issues and they are coming out. Take a large power plant for instance. We need a promoter with means to put it and run it. How many promoters are left with the capability to bring in equity and invest today?""
He said large companies and those big mid-size ones have utilised only 31 percent of their working capital limits, while smaller companies have utilised 70 percent.
There has been a 15 percent increase in term loans for the bank on a year-on-year basis, as there is lot of appetite for credit, he said.
On the PMC Bank scam, Kumar said while cooperatives are needed and have offered good services to customers over time, governance issues dog them.
He said SBI has built a book of  ₹10,000 crore in unsecured personal loans through its digital platform in the last five months, and denied it being the next bubble, saying delinquency rates in those are as low as 0.01 percentage points.

192,2019-10-16,State Bank,"The winning point was that margin-friendly protection biz continued to grow at a fast paceThe share of protection and annuity products in the total portfolio is now 18% for SBI Life

MUMBAI :
Investors seldom like it when the business they invest in fails to show profit growth.
So what explains the fact that SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s stock gained nearly 5% on Wednesday despite the insurer reporting a 48% year-on-year drop in net profit for the September quarter?
There are a handful of reasons. First off, if an insurance firm is not making profits, it means it is getting more business. Insurers have to bear the cost of acquiring customers upfront, while the pay-offs or profits come later in a staggered manner. In other words, if SBI Life writes an insurance policy today, it gets profits at regular intervals in the future. Investors like it when prospects of future profits rise rather than present profits.
Therefore, investors found it more important that SBI Life reported an increase of 34% in its new business premium, much of which was driven by a broad-based growth in most product categories. The winning point, of course, was that margin-friendly protection business continued to grow at a fast pace.
In other words, the insurer’s products continued to fly off the shelves, with term plans getting most of the demand. Protection products are similar to no-frills bank accounts and generate high margins for insurers. The share of protection and annuity products in the total portfolio is now 18% for SBI Life. Growth in non-participatory savings products zoomed.
What this means is that SBI Life will get more bang for every buck in the coming quarters. For the September quarter too, the life insurer continued to do well on profitability metrics. The value of new business margin was 20.2%, slightly higher than analysts’ expectations. It is worth noting that the life insurer has access to a large branch network of its parent, State Bank of India (SBI).
Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd consider this a unique advantage. “SBI Life’s business done through SBI bank was 25 basis points of SBI’s deposit base, vs IPRU’s (ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd) new business with ICICI Bank at 80 bps,"" it said in a note. This means that for SBI Life, there is still scope to get more business out of its parent.
But what is behind the net profit fall at the company?
Insurance firms have to put premium they get somewhere to earn money and they invest their so-called surplus into bonds. SBI Life suffered a blow to its investments from its exposure to beleaguered Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL). Analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said that the insurer set aside  ₹70 crore towards erosion in value of its investments, of which  ₹67 crore was towards DHFL exposure.
That said, analysts believe that valuations at three times estimated embedded value for FY21 are still modest compare with rival HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd."

190,2019-10-16,State Bank,"The comments come at a time when banks' lending practices have been repeatedly put to question in many alleged scamsBhattacharya also urged bankers to undertake certifications and diplomas as their careers progress

Arundhati Bhattacharya, the former chairman of State Bank of India, on Wednesday said there is a need to create a special cadre for compliance and risk management at every banks, given the issues lenders are facing and rued that ""unfortunately"" HR is the most neglected side of banking.
The comments come at a time when banks' lending practices have been repeatedly put to question in many alleged scams, an increased attention from the regulator and investigating agencies and very high quantum of dud loans.
""The time has come for us to create a special cadre for risk and compliance,"" Bhattacharya, who headed the nation's largest bank between 2013 and 2017, said at an event organised by sectoral lobby IBA.
She said dedicated training is now being imparted to create such officers and hence, finding the right candidates will not be difficult.
The veteran banker, under whose watch SBI merged all its five subsidiaries and also Bharatiya Mahila Bank in April 2017, also urged banks not to directly place a general banking person to these roles, and if they do they must be given sufficient time to settle down and understand the new job requirements that is a very critical function.
Recollecting her times at SBI, Bhattacharya said she had created a specialised cadre of chartered accountants to ensure that each chief financial officer at the circle level was a qualified CA and also increased the strength of law officers at the bank.
Similarly, there is a need to have compliance and risk officers as abilities and understanding needed for the function is very specialised, she said.
A senior industry official said typically, the specialist officers are hired laterally at industry salaries from outside.
It can be noted that on August 30, the government had decided to allow state-run lenders' boards to appoint chief risk officers and pay them as per market salaries.
On the mega bank mergers announced recently, she said it is essential to have four banks of equal size and strength to compete better in the market, and backed the idea.
Bhattacharya said HR integration is the ""biggest pain-point"" of any such move and that there is a need for ""equivalence"" while looking at integration exercises.
She also rued the lack of proper documentation of an employee's performance and career achievements, as this may prove to be a handicap for any future leader to select or deploy people in times of a merger.
An excessive reliance is placed on ""corridor talk"" to assess an employee in banking, which is of no use in the case of a merger because the superior may not exist in that position itself when two institutions amalgamate, she said.
There is a need to change the HR practices by laying greater thrust on honest conversations between the superiors and subordinates based on constructive feedback to up the work delivery, she said.
Bhattacharya said she had headed SBI's HR department for two years, but said unfortunately this is the most neglected side in banking and there is very few reform on this front as well.
Recollecting her times at SBI, she said an employee used to spend only ""one-and-a-half minute"" annually on HR matters, and that too was limited to signing the annual performance reviews, where typically every manager used to give 100 percent scores to the subordinates.

MUMBAI :
Insurance Australia Group Ltd (IAG) on Thursday said it has agreed to sell its entire 26% stake in SBI General Insurance (SBIG) to Warburg Pincus and Premji Invest for $432.38 million.
While Premji Invest has agreed to acquire 16% in the general insurer, Warburg Pincus plans to buy the remaining 10%. The transaction, subject to regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed by 30 June 2020.
“With our sharpened focus on our core territories of Australia and New Zealand, now is the right time for IAG to exit its investment in SBIG,"" said Peter Harmer, managing director and chief executive officer of IAG. “IAG has enjoyed a strong and successful relationship with State Bank of India since establishing the SBIG joint venture in 2009.""
The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), will continue to own 70% in its general insurance arm. The remaining 16.01% will be held by Napean Opportunities Llp (an affiliate of Premji Invest) and 9.99% by WP Honey Wheat Investment Ltd, an investment vehicle of Warburg Pincus. Besides, PI Opportunities Fund-1 will hold 2.35% and Axis New Opportunities AIF-I will hold 1.65% stake in the company.
“SBIG has a high-quality management team having an institutional framework with systems and processes in place. This is demonstrated through consistent high growth and positive underwriting results. We extend our heartfelt appreciation to IAG, the outgoing partner, who has progressively collaborated with us in building SBIG to the level where it stands today,"" said Dinesh Kumar Khara, managing director of global banking and subsidiaries at SBI.
SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said the bank had dropped a plan to take its general insurance unit public, citing no immediate need for additional capital. India’s largest bank was earlier looking to list SBI General Insurance in fiscal 2021.
In November 2018, SBI sold 4% stake in SBI General Insurance for  ₹482 crore (around $66 million) to two alternative investment funds (AIFs)—Axis New Opportunities AIF-I and PI Opportunities Fund-I, an AIF of Premji Invest. The transaction valued SBIG at over  ₹ 12,000 crore.
SBI General Insurance sells motor, health, personal accident, travel and home insurance to retail customers and aviation, fire, marine, liability and cyber defence insurance policies in the commercial space. With presence in more than 110 cities across India, the insurer had a market share of 3.24% as of September, among general and stand-alone health insurers.
The insurance sector has seen heightened deal activity .
In September, Mint reported that Life Insurance Corporation of India-owned IDBI Bank planned to sell its 48% stake in IDBI Federal Life Insurance Co.
In February, homegrown private equity firm True North bought a 51% stake in Max Bupa Health Insurance Co. Ltd in an all-cash deal that valued the health insurer at  ₹1,001 crore."
188,2019-10-18,State Bank,"The facility has been launched on VISA platform and will function on any smartphone with Android OS KitKat version 4.4 and aboveTo use SBI Card Pay, cardholders will have to do a one-time registration of their card on the latest version of SBI Card mobile app

NEW DELHI :
Are you an SBI card holder? There is some good news you. SBI Card has launched 'SBI Card Pay', a feature which allows contactless payment using mobile phones at point of sale (PoS) terminals. Using SBI Card Pay, customers can make contactless payments at Near Field Communication (NFC) enabled point of sale terminals with just one tap of their mobiles, without using the physical credit card or entering any PIN. Basically, it is a payment feature based on Host Card Emulation (HCE) technology for faster, convenient and more secure card payments using mobile phones.
Here is all you need to know about 'SBI Card Pay'
1) To use SBI Card Pay, cardholders will have to do a one-time registration of their card on the latest version of SBI card mobile app.
2) Once the card is registered, users can complete payments simply by unlocking their phone screen and bringing the mobile device near the PoS terminal.
3) The facility has been launched on VISA platform and will function on any Android smartphone with Android OS KitKat version 4.4 and above.
4) How to use contactless SBI credit card to make payments
SBI Card Pay is a highly secure platform as it uses tokenisation which converts customer’s sensitive card information (Card Number, Expiry Date, CVV etc.) into a device specific digital token. 
Since the card information transmitted wirelessly by NFC is protected through tokenisation, the customer’s physical card information is never exposed to the merchant, making the transaction completely secure. Additionally, to make payments customers must set a device lock on their phones. 
Payments will go through only when customers unlock their phone screens using fingerprint/screen lock or MPIN. Even in case of loss of mobile phone, card information stored in form of digital tokens cannot be accessed by any third party. 
Customers simply have to inform the SBI Card customer service to block the digital token and can continue using their physical plastic cards.
5) A contactless transaction greatly reduces the risk of card loss and fraud through counterfeit/skimming.
6) The payments through contactless mode is allowed for a maximum amount of Rs10,000 in a day, with maximum capping of every transaction at  ₹2,000.
7) For any transaction of amount more than  ₹2,000, you would have to dip or swipe your credit card and enter the 4-digit PIN to authenticate the transaction.
8) The contactless SBI credit card can be used in Big Bazaar, Central, Costa coffee, Mc Donalds, Reliance Digital, Reliance Footprints, Reliance Fresh, Inox, Pizza Hut, Sahakari Bhandar, Reliance Smart, Starbucks.
9) Near Field Communication or NFC is a method of wirelessly transmitting data using radio waves. Tap to Pay uses NFC to wirelessly transmit payment data to payment terminals with NFC readers that have been activated for use. The payment information is transmitted in an encrypted format making the transaction completely secure.
10) Few differences between SBI Card Pay and SBI Card’s contactless credit card:
a. SBI Card Pay is enabled on SBI Card’s mobile app enabling contactless payments through a tap at NFC-enabled PoS. On the other hand, SBI Card’s contactless credit cards allow contactless transactions through ‘physical NFC-enabled card’ by tapping at NFC-enabled PoS
b. SBI Card Pay feature is launched only on VISA platform and will function on any Android smartphone with Android OS KitKat version 4.4 and above. Whereas, all the new cards issued by SBI Card are contactless cards, both for Visa and Mastercard platforms"

Indian markets edged higher today in early trade, lifted by gains in banking stocks and Reliance Industries. The Sensex was up around 100 points while the Nifty edged above 11,600.
Among financials, Yes Bank surged 6% while both SBI, HDFC Bank and Bajaj Finance logged gains over 1% each.
Market heavyweight RIL was up 0.7% ahead of its Q2 earnings announcement. The sequential recovery in refining margins should help RIL’s earnings.
Select IT stocks Infosys and HCL Tech witnessed some selling pressure, both down about 0.50%.

Below 11550, Nifty would find support at 11500 and at 11430,"" said Shrikant Chouhan, senior vice-president for equity technical research at Kotak Securities.
""Possibilities of a Brexit deal buoyed the Nifty. The deal, however, needs a stamp of the British Parliament, which is a contingent event. The chatter out of Washington and Beijing has been positive, so the odds of a phase one pact being signed next month at the G7 summit is high,"" says HDFC Securities.

LGT Lightstone looks to fund AMP’s India unit
Attracted by India’s green energy trajectory, LGT Lightstone Aspada plans to invest up to $50 million in Canadian firm AMP Solar Group’s India unit, Mint reported citing four people aware of the development. The India-focused impact investment platform will acquire a significant minority stake in AMP Energy.

CSB Bank may launch share sale next month
Kerala-based private sector lender CSB Bank, formerly The Catholic Syrian Bank, is planning to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in November, Mint reported citing two people aware of the development. Last year, Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax India Holdings Corp. had acquired a 51% stake in CSB Bank for around $168 million. In a first-of-its-kind approval to help turn around a lender, the Reserve Bank of India had allowed a foreign investment firm to invest in a homegrown bank. As the bank is planning to launch the IPO in November, work on the draft red herring prospectus is going on. The specific timelines for the November launch will be decided after factoring in the response received during the roadshows. CSB is trying to mop up  ₹500 crore through the initial share sale, he added. The bank received market regulator Sebi’s approval for its IPO on Monday. The bank, according to its draft prospectus, is looking to raise  ₹30 crore via fresh issue of shares to increase its tier-1 capital base and to meet future capital requirements, while its existing shareholders will sell 1.97 crore share through the offer-for-sale route. ICICI Lombard General Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Federal Bank and Bridge India Fund are expected to sell their stakes, partially or fully, during the IPO.
Amid a funding squeeze, NHAI seeks bids for fourth bundle of road assets
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for its fourth bundle of road assets to be auctioned under the toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, as it looks to meet divestment targets and raise funds for new projects, Mint reported citing a public notification released late on Wednesday night. This despite the fact that the third round, which has a base price of  ₹4,995 crore, is yet to close. In fact, the NHAI has deferred the deadline to submit bids twice—from mid-September to 31 October—following investors’ requests for more time. NHAI, which is the nodal agency of the ministry of road transport and highways, has set an initial estimated concession value of  ₹4,170 crore for the bundle. Bidding is expected to close by January 2020. Under the TOT model, long-term concessions for collecting toll revenues are auctioned to the highest bidder. The fourth bundle has seven stretches totaling around 401 km spread across five states. In terms of revenue (toll collection) concentration, a single stretch (Pimpalgaon-Nashik-Gonde also referred as PNG) accounts for around 35% of total collections, while the top two of the seven stretches account for around 55%.
JSW, Adani, Others Express Interest in Avantha Power Arm
Avantha Group’s Jhabua Power, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, has received expressions of interest from JSW, Adani Power, National Thermal Power Corporation and Tata Power-backed Resurgent Power, The Economic Times reported citing people directly briefed on the matter. A few Singapore-based distressed asset investors and some local asset reconstruction companies are also said to have submitted EoIs, they said, adding that Vedanta group’s Sterlite Power may also participate in the bidding process. The deadline for submission of formal bids for the company is November 15. Jhabua Power was admitted for insolvency proceedings at the NCLT in March. The company operates a 600-MW thermal power plant in Madhya Pradesh which has power purchase agreements with the state electricity boards of Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. Another 600 MW of capacity is under construction. A group of lenders, led by Axis Bank, has outstanding dues of  ₹3,000 crore from the company after it defaulted on loans taken to finance its capacity expansion plan conceptualised during a period of financial distress at its parent company, Gautam Thapar-owned Avantha Group. Adani Power and Resurgent Power had also participated in a previously held auction process for the company which was shelved last year because lenders failed to reach an agreement on the sale terms. Adani Power had acquired Avantha Power and Infrastructure subsidiary Korba West Power Company five years ago.
Leelaventure business acquired by Brookfield, company informs BSE
Canadian investor Brookfield has acquired Hotel Leelaventure, as indicated in two postal ballot notices on March 18 and August 10, and that it received the sale proceeds which it paid to banks and financial institutions that had lent it money, The Economic Times reported. The hotels operator announced closure of the deal in a filing with stock exchanges, but did not disclose further details. The company had in March announced plans to sell its hotels in Delhi, Bengaluru, Udaipur and Chennai to Brookfield Asset Management for  ₹3,950 crore. Last month, the Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) allowed Leela's sale of assets to Brookfield, rejecting minority shareholder ITC’s application challenging the deal. The tribunal had also vacated its interim order that had barred Leela from declaring the results of the postal ballot. Around 89% of Leela's shareholders had voted in favour of the deal, as per the results the company released after SAT lifted the stay. Leelaventure could go ahead with the transaction as there is no stay or injunction currently. After the SAT order was pronounced, ITC had made a plea that it needed time to appeal in the Supreme Court. The respondents including JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Company, Leelaventure and its promoters had also decided to approach the top court by way of a caveat petition that would give them a chance to put forth their arguments if ITC approached the apex court."
185,2019-10-18,State Bank,"Two bank unions have called for an all-India bank strike on October 22 against bank mergersOnly few SBI bank employees are part of the two unions which have called for the bank strike

NEW DELHI :
As two bank unions threaten to sit on a day-long bank strike against the merger of public sector banks, the State Bank of India (SBI) expects the impact to be minimal while the Bank of Baroda has warned customers that its operations could be paralysed.
With over 22,000 branches, SBI is India's largest bank while Bank of Baroda has around 9,500 branches and is now the third largest bank after its merger with Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank.
""The membership of our bank employees in unions participating in strike is very few, so the impact of strike on bank's operation will be minimal,"" SBI said in a notice to stock exchanges. It said that the loss as a result of the proposed bank strike cannot be quantified now.
Bank of Baroda, on the other hand, said it is taking necessary steps for smooth functioning of its branches and other offices on the day of strike. ""In the event the strike materializes, the functioning of the branches / offices may be affected / paralyzed,"" BoB warned.
The All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) have served a notice to the Indian Banks' Association informing them of the bank strike from 6 am on October 22 to 6 am on October 23.
Besides merger of 10 PSU banks into four larger entities, the bank unions are also protesting against banking sector reforms and increasing NPAs. The unions have also demanded that stringent action should be taken against loan defaulters and job security of bank employees should be ensured.
Last month also, another set of four bank employees' unions had called for a two-day strike but was withdrawn later on. They were also protesting on similar issues.
In the meantime, the protesters have found support from the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) on next week's bank strike."
184,2019-10-18,State Bank,"Creditors aren’t politely waiting in line to claim their collateral as the law of the jungle threatens finance

Snatch-and-grab is the new hallmark of Indian finance. As a banker friend in Mumbai put it to me only half-jokingly, a unit of 'grabbed' cash collateral in hand is worth more than two units of hypothetical receivables. 
Yet this is no laughing matter. Not only is opportunistic behavior going to worsen India’s $200 billion-plus bad loan crisis, but now that everyone from the government’s sleuths to the courts are joining the melee, the ensuing chaos will limit the recovery for lenders and threaten depositors. 
Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India, sat down for a chat with me at the Bloomberg Equality Summit in Mumbai this week. He had highlighted the problem last month by blaming what he called the selfishness of one bank for a default by Altico Capital India Ltd., a nonbank lender to property builders. When asked why his HDFC Bank Ltd. had choked Altico by helping itself to the money the shadow financier had raised elsewhere and parked with him, Aditya Puri, the managing director of India’s most valuable lender, replied: “What is out-of- turn? It is my security and I will exercise it.""
Now the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, will decide whether Kumar’s unhappiness is a case of sour grapes or if Puri did indeed cross a line. For State Bank of India, Altico is just one of the several instances where the taxpayer-funded bank has been at the receiving end.
SBI didn’t drag tycoon Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. to an in-court bankruptcy process, hoping instead that Ambani would be able to sell assets to his brother Mukesh, India’s richest man, out of court. Ericsson AB, an operational creditor, pursued the opposite strategy and got itself a very decent court-enforced settlement by invoking the younger Ambani’s personal guarantee. 
More recently, SBI’s Kumar received a fresh blow when India’s enforcement directorate, tasked to fight economic crime, attached the assets of insolvent Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. on suspicion of money laundering by its previous management. Both the new owner, who won control of Bhushan during bankruptcy, and Kumar, who’s waiting for his check, are impatient. Yet, thanks to the enforcement directorate, the $2.8 billion sale has now been put on hold by an adjudicating authority.
ArcelorMittal, too, has also been waiting endlessly to conclude a near-$6 billion purchase of Essar Steel India Ltd., the most keenly watched Indian bankruptcy. There, Kumar and other creditors are facing a legalized version of snatch-and-grab: An appellate authority has held that rights of financial creditors like SBI are no superior to those of unsecured operational creditors.
Finance 101 is being turned upside down in India. Take securitization. It got a bad rep during the 2008 subprime crisis, but the reality is that for India’s cash-starved shadow banks to survive, they must package more of their small-ticket loans into securities and sell them on to people like Kumar, who have a more stable source of funding: deposits. 
How hard is this? A court order is blocking the troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corp., which is seeking a restructuring of its $12 billion liabilities to Kumar and other creditors, from putting cash collected from homeowners into accounts from which holders of its mortgage-backed securities are paid. Six of these bonds were downgraded this week by Moody’s Corp. affiliate ICRA — three of them defaulted. These notes were supposed to perform for investors even if Dewan went bankrupt. Securitization will not lead to a safer financial system in India if this basic tenet is flouted. 
Small savers may not understand the nuances of high finance, but they’re the ones who feel the pain when a cooperative bank goes up in flames and the regulator puts limits on cash withdrawals. That’s what happened recently after a $1 billion fraud at Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank. The Reserve Bank is playing with fire. Imagine the consequences if, say, housing societies decide to move money out of smaller institutions and into too-big-to-fail SBI or HDFC Bank. Bailing out even small parts of a large deposit-taking industry will become a headache for Indian taxpayers. 
A capital-constrained economy like India can’t afford a jungle raj in finance. Only a set of clear rules can end the cash grab by powerful intermediaries and state authorities. Once powerless depositors join in the free-for-all, it will be too late.

Subhash Chandra scrambles to retain Zee reins amid VTB’s stake sale talks
VTB Capital Plc, a unit of Russia’s state-controlled lender VTB Group, is in talks with two potential investors to sell a 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, Mint reported on 16 October citing two people directly aware of the development. Both the investors are large business groups with presence in media and broadcasting. One of the interested buyers is an Indian conglomerate, while the other is an international corporation. Earlier on Tuesday, VTB Capital said it has secured rights to sell Essel Media Ventures Ltd’s 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment to recover loan dues. If the deal goes through, it may threaten promoter Subhash Chandra’s control over the company he founded and could expose Zee to hostile takeover bids. Chandra is also in negotiations with VTB to buy back the shares. The promoter group led by Subhash Chandra has offered to prepay a portion of VTB’s outstanding loan of around  ₹2,000 crore from the proceeds of the remaining stake sale to Invesco Oppenheimer, which already owns a substantial stake in the company.
Adani Gas gets Total on board in  ₹5,700-crore deal for a 37.4% stake
Total SA has agreed to acquire a 37.4% stake in city gas distributor Adani Gas Ltd for around  ₹5,700 crore, in the French energy major’s biggest bet on India’s clean energy push, Mint reported on 15 October. The proposed acquisition also marks the largest foreign direct investment in India’s city gas distribution industry, with the deal giving Total joint control of Adani Gas, along with the Adani group. Total, the world’s second-largest liquefied natural gas company, will buy the stake in Adani Gas through a combination of tender offer to public shareholders and from the Adani family. The French company plans to acquire as much as 25.2% from the public and the rest from the Adani family. Eventually, the Adani family and Total shareholders will hold 37.4% stake each and public shareholders will hold the remaining 25.2%. The expanded partnership will develop re-gasification terminals, including Dhamra LNG on the east coast, sell liquefied natural gas (LNG) and through Adani Gas distribute gas to 7.5% of India’s population. The latest announcement comes a year after the two firms agreed to set up an equal joint venture to import and retail natural gas. As part of that, Adani and Total will build a fuel retail network of 1,500 stations along highways and intercity connections over 10 years.
IRCTC makes stellar stock market debut
Shares of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corp.

The initial public offering (IPO) of state-run IRCTC, the sole provider of catering services and online bookings for Indian Railways, was subscribed 112 times at a price band of  ₹315-320. The  ₹645-crore issue was open for subscription between 30 September and 4 October. The stock opened 101.25% higher above the issue price of  ₹320 at  ₹644. It jumped 132% to touch a high of  ₹743.80 and a low of  ₹625 during the day, before closing at  ₹728.60, an increase of 127.68%. This is the biggest listing gain for any stock since Astron Paper & Board Mill Ltd made its debut with gains of 139.40% on 29 December 2017. Earlier in the same year, Salasar Techno Engineering Ltd had jumped 151.94% on the day of listing, and Avenue Supermarts Ltd surged 114.30% on listing. In 2019, a dozen stocks debuted on the stock exchanges. Of them, only four fell on their listing day.

Bhushan Power sale to JSW Steel halted in test for bankruptcy law
A bankruptcy appeals court halted the transfer of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd (BPSL) to JSW Steel Ltd and stayed the Enforcement Directorate’s (ED) move to attach assets of the insolvent steel maker, scuttling hopes of a swift resolution of the distressed asset, Mint reported on 15 October. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) stayed the transfer of the payment by JSW Steel to the creditors of BPSL till investigation into allegations of fraud and money laundering by the former owners of the steel mill is decided. NCLAT will issue final orders on 25 October. The tribunal’s ruling could have far-reaching implications, especially for BPSL’s lenders, as the resolution process has lingered on for more than two years. In court, Sanjay Shorey, director (legal prosecution)at the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), argued that ED has no jurisdiction to attach the property of BPSL, which is undergoing corporate insolvency resolution process. MCA argued that the rights of secured financial creditors (banks) are to be protected through the resolution process. A person privy to discussions within JSW Steel indicated that if the ED attachment on BPSL’s assets holds firm, then the value of JSW Steel’s bid will also fall proportionately, forcing a much larger haircut on bankers in their  ₹47,000 crore exposure to the bad loan.
Paytm to raise $2 billion at a valuation of $15 billion
Financial services firm Paytm is set to raise $2 billion from a group of existing investors at a valuation of $15 billion, Mint reported on 15 October citing a person close to the development. The identity of the investors could not be ascertained independently, but financial news service Bloomberg reported on Monday that the existing investors include Ant Financial and Japan’s SoftBank Group. The valuation of $15 billion is the same as when some of Paytm’s employees had sold their shares to investors earlier this year. In August, Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma said the company’s employees sold employee stock ownership plans worth $150 million at a valuation of $15 billion. Paytm was valued at $12 billion last year when Warren Buffett-controlled Berkshire Hathaway Inc. invested an undisclosed sum in the company. Although One97 Communications Ltd, the owner of Paytm, had not disclosed details of the deal, regulatory documents sourced from Paper.vc showed Berkshire had invested $300 million. The $2 billion that Paytm is set to raise is likely to help it fend off rivals across various segments of its business. The financial services firm is facing stiff competition from Google Pay, Amazon Pay, BHIM, and others in its payments operations. It is behind Flipkart and Amazon in its e-commerce business housed under Paytm Mall.
China’s Autohome looks to back CarDekho at $700 mn valuation
Online car marketplace CarDekho is in talks to raise $100 million in a Series D round, led by Chinese strategic investor Autohome Inc., valuing it at $700 million, Mint reported on 4 October citing two people close to the deal. Existing investor Sequoia Capital is also expected to invest from its $8 billion global growth fund. This round is mainly being put together for the strategic investor to come in, with Autohome putting in $70 million. Tybourne Capital, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, is also a common investor in both Autohome and CarDekho. Autohome claims to be the leading online destination for automobile consumers in China. CarDekho is not the only online car retailer that is drawing investor interest. Mint reported on 2 October that online used car retailer Spinny is in talks to raise $35 million in a funding round led by Fundamentum, a fund set up by Nandan Nilekani and former Helion Ventures partner Sanjeev Aggarwal, along with existing investors—Accel Partners, SAIF Partners and Blume Ventures. Also, Cars24, which sells used cars to dealers, is currently raising its Series D round.

Attracted by India’s green energy trajectory, LGT Lightstone Aspada plans to invest up to $50 million in Canadian firm AMP Solar Group’s India unit, Mint reported on 18 October citing four people aware of the development. The India-focused impact investment platform will acquire a significant minority stake in AMP Energy. The investment, to be announced shortly, will help form the beachhead for Lichtenstein investor LGT, a bank and fund manager with around $220 billion of assets, to foray into the Indian subcontinent’s energy market. LGT Lightstone Aspada, the world’s largest family-owned private banking and asset management group, has already invested around $180 million in India, including a $12 million investment in Lithium Urban Technologies Pvt. Ltd—India’s first electric cab service. Going forward, it wants to focus on India’s energy-efficiency market, which is estimated at  ₹1.5 trillion, in areas such as financing. Formed in partnership with Aspada and LGT in August 2019, LGT Lightstone Aspada is an investment platform of LGT Lightstone. LGT Lightstone is part of LGT Group, owned by the Princely family of Liechtenstein.
CSB Bank may launch share sale next month
Kerala-based private sector lender CSB Bank, formerly The Catholic Syrian Bank, is planning to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in November, Mint reported on 18 October citing two people aware of the development. Last year, Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax India Holdings Corp. had acquired a 51% stake in CSB Bank for around $168 million. In a first-of-its-kind approval to help turn around a lender, the Reserve Bank of India had allowed a foreign investment firm to invest in a homegrown bank. As the bank is planning to launch the IPO in November, work on the draft red herring prospectus is going on. The specific timelines for the November launch will be decided after factoring in the response received during the roadshows. CSB is trying to mop up  ₹500 crore through the initial share sale, he added. The bank received market regulator Sebi’s approval for its IPO on Monday. The bank, according to its draft prospectus, is looking to raise  ₹30 crore via fresh issue of shares to increase its tier-1 capital base and to meet future capital requirements, while its existing shareholders will sell 1.97 crore share through the offer-for-sale route. ICICI Lombard General Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Federal Bank and Bridge India Fund are expected to sell their stakes, partially or fully, during the IPO.
Amid a funding squeeze, NHAI seeks bids for fourth bundle of road assets
The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has invited bids for its fourth bundle of road assets to be auctioned under the toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, as it looks to meet divestment targets and raise funds for new projects, Mint reported on 18 October citing a public notification released late on Wednesday night. This despite the fact that the third round, which has a base price of  ₹4,995 crore, is yet to close. In fact, the NHAI has deferred the deadline to submit bids twice—from mid-September to 31 October—following investors’ requests for more time. NHAI, which is the nodal agency of the ministry of road transport and highways, has set an initial estimated concession value of  ₹4,170 crore for the bundle. Bidding is expected to close by January 2020. Under the TOT model, long-term concessions for collecting toll revenues are auctioned to the highest bidder. The fourth bundle has seven stretches totaling around 401 km spread across five states. In terms of revenue (toll collection) concentration, a single stretch (Pimpalgaon-Nashik-Gonde also referred as PNG) accounts for around 35% of total collections, while the top two of the seven stretches account for around 55%."
183,2019-10-19,State Bank,"A capital constrained economy like India can’t afford a jungle raj in finance

Snatch-and-grab is the new hallmark of Indian finance. As a banker friend in Mumbai put it to me only half-jokingly, a unit of “grabbed"" cash collateral in hand is worth more than two units of hypothetical receivables.
Yet this is no laughing matter. Not only is opportunistic behaviour going to worsen India’s $200 billion-plus bad loan crisis, but now that everyone from the government’s sleuths to the courts are joining the melee, the ensuing chaos will limit the recovery for lenders and threaten depositors.
Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India (SBI), sat down for a chat with me at the Bloomberg Equality Summit in Mumbai this week. He had highlighted the problem last month by blaming what he called the selfishness of one bank for a default by Altico Capital India Ltd, a non-bank lender to property builders. When asked why his HDFC Bank Ltd had choked Altico by helping itself to the money the shadow financier had raised elsewhere and parked with him, Aditya Puri, the managing director of India’s most valuable lender, replied: “What is out-of-turn? It is my security and I will exercise it.""
Now the regulator, the Reserve Bank of India, will decide whether Kumar’s unhappiness is a case of sour grapes or if Puri did indeed cross a line. For SBI, Altico is just one of the several instances where the taxpayer-funded bank has been at the receiving end.
SBI didn’t drag tycoon Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd to an in-court bankruptcy process, hoping instead that Ambani would be able to sell assets to his brother Mukesh, India’s richest man, out of court. Ericsson AB, an operational creditor, pursued the opposite strategy and got itself a very decent court-enforced settlement by invoking the younger Ambani’s personal guarantee.
More recently, SBI’s Kumar received a fresh blow when India’s enforcement directorate, tasked to fight economic crime, attached the assets of insolvent Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd on suspicion of money laundering by its previous management. Both the new owner, who won control of Bhushan during bankruptcy, and Kumar, who’s waiting for his check, are impatient. Yet, thanks to the enforcement directorate, the $2.8 billion sale has now been put on hold by an adjudicating authority.
ArcelorMittal, too, has also been waiting endlessly to conclude a near-$6 billion purchase of Essar Steel India Ltd, the most keenly watched Indian bankruptcy. There, Kumar and other creditors are facing a legalized version of snatch-and-grab: An appellate authority has held that rights of financial creditors like SBI are no superior to those of unsecured operational creditors.
Finance 101 is being turned upside down in India. Take securitization. It got a bad rep during the 2008 subprime crisis, but the reality is that for India’s cash-starved shadow banks to survive, they must package more of their small-ticket loans into securities and sell them on to people like Kumar, who have a more stable source of funding: deposits.
How hard is this? A court order is blocking the troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corp., which is seeking a restructuring of its $12 billion liabilities to Kumar and other creditors, from putting cash collected from homeowners into accounts from which holders of its mortgage-backed securities are paid. Six of these bonds were downgraded this week by Moody’s Corp. affiliate Icra — three of them defaulted. These notes were supposed to perform for investors even if Dewan went bankrupt. Securitization will not lead to a safer financial system in India if this basic tenet is flouted.
Small savers may not understand the nuances of high finance, but they’re the ones who feel the pain when a cooperative bank goes up in flames and the regulator puts limits on cash withdrawals. That’s what happened recently after a $1 billion fraud at Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank.
The Reserve Bank is playing with fire. Imagine the consequences if, say, housing societies decide to move money out of smaller institutions and into too-big-to-fail SBI or HDFC Bank. Bailing out even small parts of a large deposit-taking industry will become a headache for Indian taxpayers.
A capital-constrained economy like India can’t afford a jungle raj in finance. Only a set of clear rules can end the cash grab by powerful intermediaries and state authorities. Once powerless depositors join in the free-for-all, it will be too late.bloomberg"

New Delhi: Banking services could be affected next week as two bank unions have warned they will go on a 24-hour long strike on 22 October to protest against the recent bank mergers, falling deposit rates and a call for job security.
The two unions - the All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) and the Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI) - have informed the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) through a notice that they will go on strike from 6 am on 22 October to 6 am on 23 October.
State Bank of India (SBI) has already said the impact would be minimum as most of its employees are not members of the participating unions.
""The membership of our bank employees in unions participating in the strike is very few, so the impact of strike on our operation will be minimal,"" SBI said in the notice. It further said the loss from the proposed strike cannot be quantified as of now.
Other banks such as Bank of Maharashtra and Syndicate Bank have, however, expressed concern over providing customer services.
""The bank is taking necessary steps tor smooth functioning of branches on the proposed strike day. However in the event the strike materialises, the functioning of the branches/offices may be impacted,"" Syndicate Bank said in a notice to stock exchanges.
Bank of Baroda, in a filing with the exchanges, said: ""The Bank is taking necessary steps for smooth functioning of bank's branches on the day of strike, in the event the strike materialises, the functioning of the branches may be affected/paralysed.""
AIBEA and BEFI said they are opposing outsourcing of regular and perennial nature of banking jobs, and privatisation of banking industry while demanding adequate recruitment of clerical and sub-staff and stringent steps for recovery of mounting bad loans.
Last month, the officers' unions had called a two-day all India bank strike on 26 and 17 September that was later withdrawn on government intervention."

NEW DELHI :
The State Bank of India's (SBI) earnings are set to revive amid uncertain macros on the back of steady operating performance at pre-provisioning operating level, recoveries from large National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) resolutions and normalisation in credit cost, according to a broking firm.
The SBI posted  ₹2,312 crore profit in the first quarter of FY20 as provisionings declined 11% year-on-year.
According to Motilal Oswal, the risk-reward for the SBI has turned favourable after suppressed earnings for the past several years due to issues pertaining to asset quality merger and an adverse rate environment.
""Even now, the macro environment remains challenging with high rating downgrades in the system resulting in new names being added to the stressed pool. But given the SBI's size, the new stress is manageable (2% of total loans,"" said Motilal Oswal.
""The SBI is poised for an earnings recovery led by steady operating performance at the pre-provisioning operating level (14% CAGR over FY19-FY21E), recoveries from large NCLT resolutions and normalisation in credit cost to 1.9-1.3% over FY20E/FY21E against average of 3% over FY16-19,"" it said.
The brokerage said the bank was set for earnings recovery after a long lull. After reporting sub-optimal performance in the last few years due to high opex, interest reversals and provisioning pressures, the SBI is now poised for an earnings recovery, it said.
The reduction in the corporate tax rate from 30% to 22% should also support earnings, it added.
However, FY20E will be impacted due to one-time deferred tax asset (DTA) reversal while full benefits will come in FY21 onwards. ""Overall, we estimate profits to grow to  ₹19,700 crore/ ₹28,800 crore in FY20/21 (against average PAT of  ₹7,000 crore for the past 10 years), thus driving RoA/RoE to 0.7%/12.7%,"" it said."

NEW DELHI :
India's largest bank, the State Bank of India (SBI), which has over 22,000 branches spread all over the country, is among the least likely to be affected by today's bank strike.
Thousands of bank employees, under the umbrella of All India Bank Employees' Association (AIBEA) and the Bank Employees Federation of India (BEFI), are sitting on a 24-hour strike today to protest against a host of issues including merger of PSU banks.
Last week itself, SBI had told stock exchanges that since the membership of bank employees in the two protesting unions is very few, so the impact of strike on the bank's operation will be minimal.
A SBI union leader said they are not participating in the strike and services will be normal. Bank Employees Federation of India leader Joydeb Dasgupta also indicated that SBI staff might not be a part of the strike as they have offered only ""moral support"".
However, SBI branches where its employees are affiliated to either AIBEA or BEFI might sit outside their offices to participate in the strike. This might affect operations in some SBI branches.
The All India Bank Officers' Association (AIBOA) has also asked its members to not take part in clerical jobs today and support the strike call. SBI officers, who are members of the association, may take part in the strike.

Regional Rural Banks and cooperatives banks will also not participate in the strike as mergers do not affect them, PTI reported. A lot of private sector banks are also not likely to be affected as the impact will be felt mostly in PSU banks.
Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Syndicate Bank have indicated that their operations could be hit by bank strike.

Mumbai: The Indian markets could see inflows of as much as $1.5 billion in an upcoming MSCI India index re-jig that is due on 8 November.
In the semi-annual review of the MSCI India index, brokerage firm Morgan Stanley reckons that ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and Siemens are likely to be included. This could see inflows to the tune of about $614 million.
The MSCI Index could also increase the weightings of ICICI Bank Ltd in the November shuffle to about 5.7%, which alone would draw in about $907 million in inflows.
MSCI semi-annual index review on 8 November and the upcoming changes in weightings will be effective from 27 November. In its stock inclusion methodology, MSCI frameworks counts full market cap and free float market cap as an important criteria to include stocks in the MSCI index.
MSCI believes that the ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life and Siemens India meet the criteria for inclusion into the MSCI India index. Their combined new weightings could be about 1.8% if they are included in the index. Morgan Stanley believes that the likelihood of inclusion in the index is high for ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life, while Siemens has a low probability of inclusion.
Additionally, the latest shareholding pattern gives room to make the adjustments to the weightings of ICICI Bank in the MSCI index. The bank’s foreign shareholding come down in the recent quarter to about 54%, which gives room to increase the free float to 0.74 in the index. “We expect the weight of ICICI Bank to rise due to upward movement of the adjustment factor as foreign room on the stock goes above 25%,"" said Morgan Stanley in a note to clients.
Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, however, could make an exit from the list. The potential outflows if these companies are excluded could be to the tune of $104 million.
Overall, this would increase the weight of Indian stocks in the MSCI EM index if all these stocks are included. “If all the above changes were implemented, India's weight in MSCI EM could rise by 37bps from the current level of 8.89%. Over the medium term, the proposed Finance Minister's announcement to increase the minimum statutory limit for FPI investment in a company be increased from 24% to the foreign investment limit of the sectors, has the potential to increase India's weight in MSCI EM by 81bps,"" said the Morgan Stanley report noted."

The Indian economy is in a transition phase largely owing to important reforms undertaken in the last few years, a top Indian banker has said exuding confidence that the country's growth rate will be back on track.
""Growth can come back. Because of a lot of (reforms), economy is in transition. We had GST (goods and services tax). We had IBC (insolvency and bankruptcy code). All these reforms have been implemented in last three years. And as a result, we are in a transition period. A lot of cleanup has happened in the corporate sector,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar told PTI in an interview.
Kumar, 61, was in Washington last week as part of the Indian delegation led by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to attend the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
""When there is transition, I think, some disruption always happens,"" he said.
Kumar further said in terms of development, India is still not in the ""developed"" category. Besides, the per capita income is still low. There is huge scope for growth in India, and demographics is also not against India.
Unlike many other developed countries where they are facing challenges on account of demographics, India does not have that kind of challenge at least for the time being, he said.
""And that is where the growth can come back,"" the top Indian banker said.
“So, in my view we are seeing the bottom as far as economic growth is concerned. Now it will go up... because sector by sector, if we look at agriculture I'm finding this year position is better even in terms of credit, manufacturing is slow and private sector investment in infrastructure is slow,"" he said.
Observing that the Modi government over the past few years has brought banking to the doorsteps of every household, Kumar said the activation of these accounts have reached almost 90 per cent. Besides, balances of these accounts are now reaching a level where servicing these accounts is “not a loss-making proposition"" for the banks, he noted.
""Average balance in these accounts is touching  ₹1,900, about  ₹230 billion in June was the balance in the savings bank account,"" he said, adding that there is benefit to the economy when one is able to bring such a large population under the banking channels.
Noting that the biggest challenge in the banking sector was about the functioning of the public sector banks, Kumar said recapitalisation has happened in a big way but sectoral issues need to be addressed like the power, road and telecom sectors.
""These sectoral issues impact the working of the banks, particularly on the asset quality front,"" he said.
He further said that in this government there is no political interference in the banking sector. ""State Bank of India has been more immune to any pressures because the systems are such that it is very difficult for any Chairman, any MD to influence any decision-making process,"" he said.
When asked about cryptocurrency, which has been banned in India, the SBI chairman said the way the world is moving towards digitisation, at some stage, a regulated cryptocurrency would be a better bet than an unregulated one.
“Let's see. Because there's a dark side of the internet also. There can be misuse of the digital currencies. That is why regulation is must,"" he said adding that efforts are on how to bring technologies like blockchain into functioning of the banks."

Here is a list of top stocks that are buzzing in early trade on Friday.
Indigo: Shares of Interglobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline Indigo, slumped more than 9% in early deals after the company reported its first quarterly loss during the current fiscal due to higher maintenance and overhaul costs that outweighed an increase in passenger traffic. It posted a loss of  ₹1,062 crore in the September quarter as against a loss of  ₹652 crore a year ago.
SBI: The stock of the country’s largest public-sector lender recovered from Thursday’s loss and rose more than 2% ahead of its September quarter earnings to be released later today. Shares had fallen after the SC upheld the department of communications’ (DoT) definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), dealing a severe blow to telecom companies. The bank has huge exposure to the sector and more financial stress for telecom companies would increase the risk of fresh bad loans for the lender.
Bharti Infratel: Shares fell for the second consecutive session as its merger with Indus Tower has been delayed by two more months to 24 December. Chairman Akhil Gupta had said lack of a key government approval has held up the process, making it impossible to complete the merger by 24 October. The companies had earlier aimed to complete the process by August. The stock plunged nearly 9%.
Vodafone Idea: After crashing 23% on Thursday, the stock pared some losses and traded down 6% in early deals. There are concerns over the telecom operator shutting down as investors anticipated that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the DoT’s definition of AGR. Vodafone Idea Ltd alone has to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore as the SC ruled in favour of the government.
Tata Motors: Shares traded down more than 2% ahead of the September earnings to be released later today. Investors are treading cautiously as the numbers will be announced at a time when the auto sector has been grappling with severe demand slowdown. The company’s sales had nearly halved to 36,376 units in September from 69,991 a year ago.
Castrol India: Shares of the automotive and industrial lubricant maker extended gains from Thursday, rising nearly 3% in early deals as it reported a 25% growth in its net profit at  ₹188.4 crore in the quarter-ended September. The company had posted a net profit of  ₹150.4 crore in the same period last fiscal. It also announced the appointment of Sandeep Sangwan as the managing director from 1 January, 2020."

Post provisions, net NPA ratio was at 2.79% against 3.07% in the April-June quarter and 4.84% in the year-ago quarter.
“We expect gross slippages in a not so good scenario to not exceed 2%. We believe that the current run rate of  ₹8000 crore slippages per quarter in a  ₹23 lakh crore loan book is normal,"" said Rajnish Kumar, managing director, SBI.
Provisions during the quarter increased 8.7% year on year to  ₹13138.93 crore. In the April-June quarter, the bank had set aside  ₹9812.94 crore in provisions. The management said that the bank has utilized the returns from the 4.5% stake sale in SBI Life insurance Company Ltd for boosting the provision coverage ratio which currently stands at 81.23%.
“The stake sale returns has been used to make specific provision of  ₹2600 crore for the exposure to a housing finance company and stressed power accounts,"" said Kumar.
Operationally too the bank’s performance improved with net interest income, or the difference between interest earned on loans and paid on deposits, rising 17.7% year-on-year to  ₹24600.32 crore. Other income, which includes core fee income, also rose 9.26% to  ₹8538.39 crore in the reporting quarter.

Fixed deposits (FDs) are popular investment options for people. FDs can be broadly categorised into two types – with premature withdrawal and without premature withdrawal. FDs with premature withdrawal facility allow the depositor to close the term deposit even before the maturity period. However, a certain amount may be required to be paid by the depositor as a penalty to the bank. Banks such as State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank have their own specific terms and conditions for those who are willing to withdraw their money from the fixed deposits before the completion of the maturity period.
SBI charges a penalty of 0.50% for premature withdrawal of an FD upto 5 lakh according to SBI's website (Sbi.co.in). The bank charges 1% for premature withdrawal of an FD above 5 lakh but less than 1 crore.

168,2019-10-25,State Bank,"It is for the second year in a row that SBI is giving Diwali festival gifts to employeesSBI management has decided not to give cash but sweets, dry fruits or chocolates

CHENNAI :
Public sector banks (PSBs) here like the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) are planning to give festival gifts to their employees.
The two banks have announced a Diwali gift of sweets/dry fruits/chocolates for their staff worth  ₹1,000.
The competent authority in these two banks have issued instructions to distribute the Diwali gifts well ahead of the festival and that cash should not be given as gift in lieu of sweets/dry fruits/chocolates.
The SBI has instructed that the expenditure will be debited to the accounts of the respective offices and then appropriated from the Staff Welfare Fund for the year 2019-20, if and when allocated.
The OBC's General Manager for Human Resources Development Swarup Kumar Saha in a communication to all the branches and other offices cited the improved financial performance of the bank during the second quarter of 2019-20.
The OBC had posted a net profit of  ₹126 crore logging a growth of 23.53 per cent year-on-year. The operating profit has also increased by 20.99 per cent to  ₹1,176 crore.
The letter also said that the capital adequacy ratio and the asset quality of the banks have also improved and all these happened due to committed efforts of the staff members.
The expenses incurred on Diwali gifts will be debited to the Charges General (Staff Welfare), the OBC letter said.
While this is for the first time that Diwali gifts are given to the OBC staff, an officer association leader in SBI told IANS that it is for the second year in a row that the bank is planning to give festive gifts to their staff members.
When queried whether there is an option for non-Hindu employees to avail of the gift at a later date, for instance a Christian employee availing it during Christmas, the SBI union official refused to answer the question.
For the SBI with an employee base of about 257,000, the outgo towards Diwali gifts would be about  ₹25.7 crore.
A union official questioned the logic of giving gifts only during Diwali, that too by government banks where there are employees belonging to various faiths.
In this connection, DMK spokesperson and Member of Parliament T.K.S. Elangovan told IANS: ""These banks are owned by the government of India where people of different religions work. The employees should be given the option of choosing the festival for which he would accept the gift.""

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Friday:
Bharti Airtel: The stock closed more than 3% higher on Thursday, having slumped 6% after the Supreme Court upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT). This came as a major blow for telecom companies as they will now have to pay  ₹92,000 crore in past dues at a time of rising debt and shrinking revenues.
Vodafone Idea: The stock crashed 23% on Thursday due to concerns over the telecom operator shutting down as investors anticipated that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the DoT’s definition of AGR. Vodafone Idea Ltd alone has to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore as the SC ruled in favour of the government.
Indigo: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline IndiGo, reported its first quarterly loss during the current fiscal as higher maintenance and overhaul costs outweighed an increase in passenger traffic. It posted a loss of  ₹1,062 crore in the September quarter as against a loss of  ₹652 crore a year ago.
SBI: The largest public-sector bank will announce its September quarter earnings later today. Shares were under pressure on Thursday after the SC rejected telecom operators’ definition of AGR. The bank has huge exposure to the sector and more financial stress for telecom companies would increase the risk of fresh bad loans for the lender.
ITC: FMCG major ITC Ltd on Thursday posted a 36.2% year-on-year rise in its standalone profit to  ₹4,023.1 crore for the quarter ended September. The company had posted a profit of  ₹2,954.7 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit number, which was also boosted by a one-time tax credit of  ₹166.2 crore, was largely in line with the Street’s estimate.
Tata Steel BSL: The steelmaker released its earnings for July-September on Thursday. It reported a standalone net loss of  ₹255.9 crore for the quarter compared with a net profit of 60.7 crore in the year-ago period. The stock has been under pressure as its parent Tata Steel stares at uncertainty around a no-deal Brexit. Tata Steel has a significant presence in the UK and Europe.
Biocon: The pharmaceutical company has set a target of $1 billion for annual sales of its biologics business by 2021-22 (Apr-Mar). To achieve the aim, the company, among other strategies, plans to supply recombinant human insulin to diabetes patients in countries at low and middle income levels at less than 10 cents per day, roughly one-third the cost of current prices in these countries.
Tata Motors: The company will announce its earnings for the September quarter today. The stock may be in focus as the numbers will be announced at a time when the auto sector has been grappling with severe demand slowdown. The company’s sales had nearly halved to 36,376 units in September from 69,991 a year ago.
PNB Housing: The company announced its earnings for the September quarter on Thursday after market hours. PNB Housing Finance Ltd reported a 45% rise in net profit to  ₹366.8 crore in the second quarter-ended September of this fiscal. It had posted a net profit of  ₹253 crore in the same period last year.

165,2019-10-26,State Bank,"SBI is yet to move to a lower tax regime after the corporate tax cutSBI still has to face a large line of insolvency cases that are mired in courts

The September quarter earnings of the country’s largest lender, State Bank of India, brought much-needed cheer to an otherwise gloomy banking sector. Net profit at  ₹3,012 crore was up by nearly three times from the year-ago period. The 7.3% gain in the stock on Thursday was justified with profit comfortably beating estimates.
When the bank’s chairman Rajnish Kumar sought divine intervention in the June quarter—“every morning I am looking at the sky and praying to God"" is how he put it—SBI’s balance sheet had been hit by a surge in fresh slippages. Three months later, these slippages have halved and the pile of dud loans is down to 7.19% of its loan book.
Clearly, this sharp reduction in stressed loans has given confidence to Kumar to commit to the worst-case scenario of a 2% slippage ratio for FY20. Kumar was hopeful that the ratio will be lower.
“We expect gross slippages in a not-so- good scenario to not exceed 2%. We believe that the current run rate of  ₹8,000 crore slippages per quarter in a  ₹23 lakh crore loan book is normal,"" said Kumar.
The other boost was an over-17% growth in core income, propelled by an 18% growth in retail loans.
Even if Indian companies are not borrowing, consumers, it seems, are still willing to fund their purchases through loans.
Indeed, SBI’s strong retail loan growth belies the broad narrative of a consumption demand slowdown in the economy.
But no banker leaves everything to God and, as they say, the devil is in the details. Here are three:
First, SBI is yet to move to a lower tax regime after the corporate tax cut. What this means is that the bank is yet to account for deferred tax assets which will weigh on profits of the future quarters. Further, the lender had to use all the gains it got from the stake sale of SBI life Insurance towards provisions.
Part of it went towards the beleaguered Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd, to which the bank has an exposure of  ₹7,000 crore. More than 60% went toward a power borrower due to a failed resolution.
Second, SBI’s loan write-offs are still high. For the September quarter, the bank wrote off  ₹12,053 crore worth of bad loans, a bit lower than  ₹16,000 in the previous quarter. Write-offs helped SBI to reach a provision coverage ratio of 81%. Had it not written off loans, its provision coverage ratio would be an unimpressive 62%. Write-offs still drive the reduction in SBI’s bad loan pile.
Third, SBI still has to face a large line of insolvency cases in courts. The high level of provisioning done by the lender should give some comfort to investors. The lender said three accounts were in the final stages of resolution, with an expected recovery of 62%. The impending stress from the telecom sector, after the Supreme Court ordered telcos to pay up licence fees will also have an impact on SBI’s asset quality. Kumar’s comment on the likely impact was non-committal.
In short, SBI’s September performance brings cheer to investors, but is not enough to dispel the gloom on the economy.
With some prayers answered, Kumar has to get down to the business of getting the cheques overdue from troubled marquee borrowers. Most of all, SBI will have to find a resolution for DHFL to save its  ₹7,000 crore."

ICICI Bank: The private lender reported its September quarter earnings on Saturday. Analysts expect the stock to touch a lifetime high today due to strong performance during the quarter.

Tata Motors: The auto major announced its September quarter results after market hours on Friday. It has reported a consolidated net loss of  ₹217 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal due to increased tax expenses and accumulated losses from joint ventures, primarily the Cherry Jaguar Land Rover Automotive Company Ltd, its JV unit in China.

Marico: The Mumbai-based fast moving consumer goods maker on Friday posted a 17% jump in the second-quarter net profit to  ₹253 crore on the back of benign input costs even as domestic demand continued to remain weak during the quarter.

MUMBAI :
At least seven of the 10 public sector banks slated for merger have invited independent experts to determine their share swap ratios, according to documents reviewed by Mint.
These include Allahabad Bank, United Bank of India, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Punjab National Bank, Union Bank of India, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.
The valuers of each bank will work with others merging with it to arrive at a ratio. The share swap ratio is the ratio at which an acquirer offers its own shares in exchange for the target company’s shares during a merger or acquisition.
In the case of Allahabad Bank, the valuer appointed by it will recommend a ratio and work with independent valuers appointed by Indian Bank to gain comfort on the valuation made by their valuer and sign a joint swap ratio report.
“The valuer must adopt all market prevalent practices/principles for arriving at the valuation (including principles specified by the Reserve Bank of India and the ministry of finance), and must submit a joint report along with the valuer of Indian Bank, indicating the swap ratio for the proposed amalgamation. Consequently, the valuer would be required to issue swap ratio reports,"" showed Allahabad Bank’s request for proposal from valuers put up on its website.
According to the merger plan announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in August, Punjab National Bank will merge with Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India with business totalling  ₹17.95 trillion to make it India’s second-largest bank.

I just got my first job and have been recommended schemes by my senior at work. I have no knowledge about mutual funds and have started investing from August 2019. This is my portfolio: lump sum every three months in SBI Small Cap fund ( ₹1,000), Axis Blue Chip fund ( ₹5,000), Axis Short Term fund ( ₹10,000) and Aditya Birla Sun Life Liquid fund ( ₹20,000). I have ongoing SIPs in Mirae Asset Hybrid Equity fund ( ₹1,250), Mirae Asset Tax Saver fund ( ₹4,000), Mirae Asset Blue Chip fund ( ₹5,000) and Axis Long Term Equity fund ( ₹5,000).

—Vidushi Khatri
You have two different investment plans going on—one at a quarterly frequency, and another at a monthly frequency. To make matters simple, let’s see how much, on average, you are investing every month. Given the figures that you have provided, I can see that you are investing  ₹27,250 a month on an average. Of this, a little more than a third is going to debt funds and the rest are going to equity funds. You have relatively small short- and medium-term goals. You can easily achieve these goals with the quantum of investing you are doing presently. And what’s more, you will likely significantly overshoot your retirement target as well. You will likely have upwards of  ₹3 crore by the time you retire if you keep with this current rate of investment. However, that is just fine given that inflation will ensure that the value of  ₹1 crore is definitely not what it is today when you look at it 25 years later.
Regarding your portfolio, as I said, it’s a balanced portfolio with two-thirds (about 60%) going to equity and the rest to debt funds. There is a concentration of investments in two fund houses—Axis and Mirae—that you may want to keep an eye on. These are good fund houses and the funds you have chosen are decent, but it is always better to diversify across major fund houses such as ICICI Prudential and Franklin Templeton as well. But, that’s a minor point. The main thing is that you have a good portfolio and, importantly, a good amount being invested and these should see you through to your goals just fine.

MUMBAI :
American private equity (PE) firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co., or KKR, on Wednesday sold shares worth  ₹533.7 crore (around $75 million) that it held in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd through a block deal on the market, data from stock exchanges showed.

On Wednesday, SBI Life shares closed at  ₹999.75, down 1.4% on BSE, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 40,051.87 points, up 0.55%.
This is the third time this year that KKR has sold shares of SBI Life.
Mint had reported on 25 July that Value Line Pte. Ltd, an affiliate of KKR that held the shares, had sold 6.5 million shares at  ₹775 apiece, to raise  ₹503.7 crore.
On 30 August, the private equity firm sold another tranche of 5.3 million shares at  ₹810.07 apiece, which fetched it  ₹429.3 crore.

156,2019-10-30,State Bank,"SBI chief urges analysts to also consider growth potential of subsidiaries while looking at its valuationSBI expects credit growth to pick up to more than 12% and slippage ratio to fall to 1.3-1.5% by FY21

State Bank of India (SBI) chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday pitched for a higher valuation of the bank’s enterprise value, asking analysts to take into account the growth prospects of its subsidiaries, as well as forecasts of a better-than-expected performance in 2020-21.
Kumar said the bank’s performance is set to improve from FY21, following an improvement in asset quality and better growth. Speaking to analysts at the SBI analysts day function, he said the bank expects credit growth to pick up to more than 12% and slippage ratio—the ratio of fresh bad loans added—to fall to 1.3-1.5% by the next fiscal year. This is an improvement on the bank’s current year guidance on loan book growth of 10% and slippage ratio of around 2%.
Kumar urged analysts to consider the potential growth of subsidiaries, while looking at the bank’s valuation. SBI has subsidiaries in life insurance, asset management, credit cards and general insurance segments. The bank is also set to launch the initial public offering (IPO) of SBI Credit Cards before the end of this fiscal year. While almost all the subsidiaries have reported strong financials, the management said these subsidiaries hold huge potential to cross-sell their products to the bank’s 437.8 million customers. While only 0.6% of the bank’s customers hold the majority of products of SBI subsidiaries, 5% have insurance from SBI General Insurance.
Taking analysts through a presentation, SBI’s top management also said the bank was looking at a net interest margin of 3.2% in FY21, and 3.15% by the end of the current fiscal. They added that they were confident of improvements in return on assets (ROA), which is indicative of how profitable the company was relative to its assets, from 0.4-0.5% in FY20 to 0.9-1% by FY21. They also expect credit cost, which is the amount set aside for bad loans, to improve to less than 1% by FY21, compared to 2.66% at the end of FY19.
While the bank expects slippages to improve, it guided for a rise in bad loans in the third quarter of 2019-20, owing to its exposure to Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd.
“The management sounded confident on the growth, credit cost and margin guidance which we believe are achievable as well. While, recovery from some accounts which are expected to get resolved in the near-term will be positive, we believe telecom sector exposure’s performance will be an important monitorable. We find SBI better placed compared to (public sector bank) peers with several levers available to help allow the management keep the credit costs under control during FY20e (estimates for FY20),"" said Lalitabh Shrivastava, banking analyst, Sharekhan.
During the presentation, the bank’s management said that it will be focusing on opening more current accounts following the Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Ltd crisis, which led to a flight of deposits out of cooperative banks.
Last Friday, SBI reported trebling of net profit to  ₹3,011.73 crore in the second quarter, compared to  ₹944.87 crore a year-ago. Asset quality improved with fresh additions to bad loans nearly halving to  ₹8,805 crore at the end of the September quarter, compared to the preceding quarter. Gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, stood at 7.2% in Q2, compared with 7.5% in the June quarter, and 9.95% a year-ago. Post-provisions, net NPA ratio was at 2.79%, against 3.07% in the April-June quarter, and 4.84% in the year-ago period"

Hopes of fresh tax reforms and lower interest rates in the US kept up the market tempo for the fourth straight day on Wednesday, with the benchmark Sensex closing above the 40,000 mark for the first time since 4 June.
The 30-share BSE Sensex rose 220.03 points, or 0.55%, to 40,051.87, just 215.75 points shy of its record 40,267.62 on 3 June. The 50-share Nifty gained 0.49% to 11,844.10.
A mixed bag of quarterly earnings performance and hopes of lower taxes raised hopes among investors. Global markets were mostly cautious ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting ending later on Wednesday.
Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking, said, “Indian indices continued their upward trend on the hopes of more tax sops for the equity markets from the government."" He said that in the near term, the market will be driven by corporate earnings and, thus, stock-specific volatility may remain high. “Further, any favourable announcement from the government could help sustain the momentum. On the global front, expectations of an interest rate cut by the US Fed are high and the Fed’s guidance will be keenly watched by investors. In addition, other factors such as oil prices and currency movement may have a bearing on the markets.""
The Fed is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter point on Wednesday for the third consecutive time to provide insurance against global risks, while signalling that the committee has probably done enough for now. Investors are pricing in a 90% likelihood of a cut, though economists surveyed by Bloomberg put the odds at 75%. While policymakers see risks from trade uncertainty and weakness abroad, some view the Fed’s cuts in July and September as sufficient to offset those headwinds, absent more shocks.
Higher interest rates in the US typically lead to foreign money flowing out of emerging markets, considered to be riskier assets, while in the case of lower interest rates in the US, there are inflows to emerging markets.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have bought Indian shares worth $710.72 million in October after aggressively selling them following tax proposals in the Union budget that were later rolled back. The budget had raised the surcharge on the ultra-rich that was also applicable to some FIIs. Year to date, FII investments net of selling in Indian markets are worth $8.87 billion.
Rahul Gupta, head of currency at Emkay Global Financial Services, said: “We expect the Fed to cut rates to 1.5-1.75% for the third consecutive time as the unsettled US-China trade war has started taking a toll on the US economic data. The rupee will continue to trade between 70.70-71.30 until we get more clarity on a US-China trade deal.""
Domestic institutional investors have been net buyers of shares worth  ₹51,590.33 crore so far this year, including  ₹5,380.49 crore bought in October.
The rupee on Wednesday ended at 70.90, down 0.07% from the previous close.

Mumbai: Shares of grounded carrier Jet Airways India Ltd have surged inexplicably more than 50% in the last eight sessions even as the airline has not been operating for more than six months.
The stock hit the 5% upper circuit for eight consecutive trading sessions, gaining 50.5% during the period. At 11.24 am, the stock traded at  ₹22.60 on the BSE, up 5% from its previous close. So far this year the scrip has declined a massive 92%.

Fiat Chrysler, Peugeot owner PSA in talks to combine
Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot owner PSA are in talks to combine in a deal that could create a $50 billion (£38.88 billion) automaker, Mint reported citing a Wall Street Journal report. The deal could be in the form of an all-stock deal. Investors have speculated for several years that Fiat Chrysler was hunting for a merger partner, encouraged by the rhetoric of the company's late chief executive, Sergio Marchionne. In 2015, Marchionne outlined the case for consolidation of the auto industry, and tried unsuccessfully to interest General Motors Co in a deal. Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler had discussed a combination earlier this year, before Fiat Chrysler proposed a $35 billion merger with French automaker Renault SA. Fiat Chrysler Chairman John Elkann broke off talks with Renault in June after French government officials intervened, and pushed for Renault to first resolve tensions with its Japanese alliance partner, Nissan Motor Co. Following the collapse of the Renault merger plan, Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley left the door open for talks with would-be partners, but said the Italian-American automaker could go it alone despite mounting costs to develop electric vehicles and comply with tougher emissions rules in Europe, the United States and China. Peugeot CEO Carlos Tavares dismissed the idea of a combination with Fiat Chrysler during a discussion with reporters at the Frankfurt auto show last month."

NEW DELHI :
India's largest lender, the State Bank of India (SBI), has warned its account holders against fraudulent income tax refund messages which may end up compromising the safety of their bank deposits.

The bank also put out out a short animated video asking customers who have received any suspicious email, SMS or any other communication asking credentials for processing income tax refund to be careful before clicking on such links. It said that you will be redirected to another website where the fraudsters will ask you for your ID, password and or other details to steal your information and access your money.
This is nothing but a case of phishing where an attempt is made to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one.
SBI said its customers should not click on suspicious links nor share any personal information with anyone. All suspicious messages should be reported.
Recently, the income tax department had also issued a similar warning to taxpayers or assesses that they should be wary about fraudulent SMSes asking them to click on certain links to get tax refund.
As and when the income tax department issues a refund, it gets credited to the taxpayer's bank account. You can also log in to the income tax e-filing portal to check the status of your refund."

147,2019-11-01,State Bank,"Before going to your nearest bank branch in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra, check the new time tableWith effect from today, the timings of all public sector banks in the state have changed

NEW DELHI :
To improve convenience and ease of banking for customers, the timings of all public sector banks have been changed in Mumbai and the rest of Maharashtra from today. The new rules define banking hours based on whether the branch is located in a residential or commercial area. The timings in one particular area will be uniform all over the state.
For example, whether you are visiting a PSU bank branch in Mumbai's residential area or in Pune's residential area, the operating hours of all such banks will be the same.
So far, bank timings varied from one bank to another and from one branch to another. Most banks followed a 10 am to 5 pm work hour schedule and were open for the public till 3:30 pm.
New bank timings:
In residential areas, the new banking hours are from 9 am to 4 pm while for customers the banking hours are from 9 am to 3 pm.
In commercial areas, banking hours are from 11 am to 6 pm but for customers the banks will close an hour early at 5 pm.
In all other areas, banks will now function from 10 am to 5 pm. For customers, these banks will shut doors at 4 pm.
These timings are applicable to all public sector banks like the State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Corporation Bank, etc.
Why the change in bank timings:
The bank timing change process is part of reforms in PSBs under finance ministry's Enhanced Access and Service Excellence Programme (EASE) 2.0.
The Indian Banks' Association (IBA) had approved three time slots for customer banking hours for PSBs all over India. The timings were - 9 am to 3 pm, 10 am to 4 pm and 11 am to 5 pm.
In each state, the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBCs) were asked to come with recommendations of uniform time slots after consultation with the leadership of different banks. While some states implemented it earlier, Maharashtra SLBC had recommended the implementation of uniform banking hours with effect from November 1."
146,2019-11-02,State Bank,"According to lenders, DHFL had stopped new origination and opted for securitization at the height of the liquidity crisisWhile banks and NBFCs have signed the proposed resolution, some mutual funds have reservations signing it

MUMBAI :
Lenders of Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) are in the process of filing an application in the Bombay high court (HC) to protect the housing finance company’s borrowers from being classified as defaulters just because DHFL has been declared a defaulter, two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
According to the people cited above, DHFL has been receiving repayments on schedule from its retail borrowers, but has not been able to use the proceeds towards paying the dues to its lenders.
As a result, DHFL’s retail borrowers were at risk of being declared defaulters in spite of making repayments.
The issue is about securitization of home loans, which involves pooling together of individual loans and selling the right to receive future payments from borrowers to a third party, which could include banks and investors.
The housing finance company (HFC) in return receives a consideration much before the actual maturity of the original loan. Then, the HFC continues to collect interest and monthly payment on these loans on behalf of the acquirer of the loans, and remit the amount after retaining its portion.
The Bombay high court has restrained DHFL from making any payment to its secured and unsecured creditors. Earlier, mutual funds, including Edelweiss Asset Management Co. and Reliance AMC, had filed separate pleas before the court seeking to recover their dues after the HFC defaulted on the non-convertible debentures (NCDs), which they had subscribed to.
Subsequently, on 15 October, rating agency Icra downgraded six securitized loan pools of DHFL. Icra said the ongoing legal proceedings against DHFL might impact its ability to transfer the pool collections into the respective collection and payout (C&P) accounts of the rated transactions in a timely manner.
“While the company continues to collect the monthly instalments from borrowers, it is not able to pay the banks, which would essentially result in the borrower being classified as a defaulter,"" said Rajkiran Rai G., managing director and chief executive officer, Union Bank of India.
“We have already had discussions with other lenders and we will be filing the intervention soon. We feel that asset management companies have acted impulsively in their own selfish interest, which has jeopardized the resolution process,"" he added.
According to lenders, DHFL had opted for securitization at the height of the liquidity crisis which had hit the non-banking financial companies last year. DHFL’s annual report shows that in the six months leading to 31 March, the company had securitized assets valued at over  ₹15,630 crore and repaid liabilities of over  ₹22,700 crore.
As on 6 July, the company’s total debt stood at  ₹83,873 crore, of which  ₹38,342 crore was owed to banks, and  ₹45,061 crore to domestic bondholders."

NEW DELHI :
To continue receiving retirement pension, government pensioners will have to submit a Life Certificate or Jeevan Pramaan Patra by November 30. The window to submit the certificate opened from Friday for those aged below 80.
The offline or the traditional process of getting a life certificate for pension involves a personal visit before pension disbursing agencies like banks, post offices, etc or have the certificate issued by authority where they have served earlier and have it delivered to the disbursing agency.
The traditional process is not only complicated but also but also a time consuming one.
pic.twitter.com/nhtDzolCJd
The easier process for pensioners is getting a digital life certificate (DLC) that can be generated online with the help of Aadhaar. There is no requirement to be present personally before the pension disbursing officer nor visit any bank or post office to submit the certificate.
How to submit life certificate for pensioners online:
The government had launched the Aadhaar-based Digital Life Certificate in 2014 which uses the pensioner's Aadhaar number and biometric data (either iris or fingerprint).
If you are doing it from your home then you need to have an STQC certified biometric device is required for capturing data. If not, then you can go to any Citizen Service Centre (CSC) or the office of pension disbursing agencies.
You need to download the 'JeevanPramaan Application' on your PC/mobile phone. The app is also available at the Jeevan Pramaan portal.
The pensioner has to provide Aadhaar number, name, mobile number and self declared pension related information like PPO number, pension account number, bank details, name of pension sanctioning authority, pension disbursing authority, etc. Once the Aadhaar authentication is complete, you can download a PDF copy of the certificate from the Jeevan Pramaan website by providing the Jeevan Pramaan ID.
The digital life certificate is made available to the pension disbursing agency.
Since 2014, 2.6 crore pensioners have used the platform to submit digital life certificates.
The last date for submission of life certificate:
For those aged below 80, life certificate can be submitted in between November 1 and 30. And for senior pensions, aged 80 and above, the department of pension and pensioners' welfare has allowed them to submit life certificates from October 1 instead of November 1. The deadline remains the same - November 30. If you miss the deadline, pension disbursal is stopped from next month onwards but will be resumed as and when you submit the certificate."

142,2019-11-03,State Bank,"SBI chairman is confident of delivering a return on assets of 1% by FY21 by bringing down credit costs and focusing on borrowers who will behaveUncertainty on asset quality and recoveries is deterring investors from taking a big bite of SBI

Mumbai: The country’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), believes it deserves a higher valuation from investors than what is ascribed to it at present.
It has a tough fight ahead to get this love from investors, though.
Chairman Rajnish Kumar has rolled out his plan for the next two years, through which SBI will hack through its pile of bad loans and bring in virtuous business growth. Kumar is confident of delivering a return on assets of 1% by FY21 by bringing down credit costs and focusing on borrowers who will behave.
He reminded investors of the vast network of branches the bank has and its balance sheet heft that will act as a springboard for further growth. The impressive 10% jump in the stock following this presentation is proof enough that Kumar has got the attention of investors.
But investors aren’t willing to take a big bite of SBI yet and not all analysts, who have a buy rating, are jacking up their target prices. Here is the single overwhelming reason for it: uncertainty on asset quality and recoveries.
Analysts at Morgan Stanley sum it up thus in their note: “In our view, NPL (non-performing loan) formation will remain high unless the economy rebounds sharply. Coupled with the continued struggle for banks to recover old bad loans, this implies that credit costs stay high. The other risk with SBI, being the largest state-owned bank, is that it is asked to help stressed borrowers.""
Kumar’s targets depend heavily on how quickly insolvency cases get resolved and how fast new stress can be stemmed.
For SBI, 272 such cases are grinding in courts at present, and the most high-profile of them, Essar Steel, has been dragging on for quite sometime. Kumar has been running after his cheque from Essar Steel, only to see it fly from one date to another. The delays are not giving investors much hope.
Another factor key for SBI to meet its targets is how quickly its peers agree on resolution plans through inter-creditor agreements. Already, one case involving a power company has failed in the past.
To its credit, SBI has taken a conservative approach in setting targets. For instance, Kumar has warned that credit costs could go up to 2% if stress escalates and if SBI’s exposure to troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd decays even further.
Of course, no bank draws up targets without increasing the probability of meeting them. In that, SBI is clearly doing its bit. Its provision coverage ratio is 81%, the highest among banks. Considering its size, insurance is critical. That said, the coverage ratio draws strength from loans worth  ₹1.04 trillion that have been written off.
Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd noted that the bank is battling 650 overdue accounts through its stressed asset resolution department accounting for nearly  ₹2 trillion.
But it would be unfair to ignore the big benefits of size. A 12% loan growth target on an asset size of  ₹30 trillion is no chump change. Indeed, faster loan growth will not only bring income, but also tamp down on toxic loan ratios.
Then there are the more valuable subsidiaries that ride on SBI’s vast network. “SBI has a huge opportunity to leverage its huge existing customer base of 438 million customers to cross-sell its retail assets products (especially in life and card where only 3.6 million and 3.3 million, respectively, are SBI customers),"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.
SBI group’s life insurance arm has shown strong profitability over the past quarters with a promise of more. “Furthermore, expected IPOs (initial public offerings) in a couple of subsidiaries could unlock value like in the case of the life insurance business; hence, we remain bullish on the increasing subsidiary value contribution in our SOP (sum of parts),"" wrote analysts at Nomura Securities.
SBI’s pitch for more premium is well founded. As proof of the pudding is in the eating, investors would wait for recoveries to materialize before bingeing on SBI shares."

Mumbai: Stressed mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) has turned down a depositor seeking premature withdrawal saying it has been advised against doing so by its lenders.
According to the copy of the response, dated 14 October, received by Ishan Chakrabarty, whose mother, a 75-year-old cancer patient, is the depositor, DHFL said it has also informed the National Housing Bank (NHB) about this. Kumkum Chakraborty, the cancer patient, submitted two applications, one in July and the other in September, seeking premature withdrawal of her  ₹14 lakh deposit.
“Consequently, we are not processing requests for premature closure of deposits as advised by the consortium of lenders, until further notice. We have also provided an intimation to the National Housing Bank, in this regard,"" said the letter, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint.
State Bank of India has an exposure of about  ₹10,000 crore to DHFL, the bank’s chairman Rajnish Kumar had told shareholders at its annual meeting in June. Other lenders to DHFL include Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Andhra Bank, Canara Bank, Punjab National Bank, and Corporation Bank.
As on 6 July, the company had public deposits of  ₹6,188 crore, which fell from  ₹10,166.72 crore at the end of March 2018. On 21 May, DHFL stopped accepting public deposits and renewing existing deposits. It also stopped premature withdrawals of existing deposits to “help reorganize its liability management"".
Meanwhile, the company told stock exchanges on 3 November that the Bombay High Court in the case of Reliance Nippon Life Insurance v/s DHFL passed an order on 30 September, 2019 and 10 October, 2019, restraining it from paying any of its secured or unsecured creditors, including fixed deposit holders.
“The company was making all payments for maturity and interest on all fixed deposits held with the company, on their respective due dates, and there has been no delay in making any payment to any fixed deposit holders until the orders,"" it added.
Led by Union Bank of India, lenders are examining a draft resolution plan for DHFL. The plan envisages conversion of a part of its debt into equity for lenders, giving them a 51% stake in the company. As on 6 July, the company’s total debt stood at  ₹83,873 crore, of which  ₹38,342 crore was owed to banks."

NEW DELHI :
Amid its ongoing probes into several high-profile cases of bank frauds, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday launched a massive crackdown at 169 places across India with alleged links to cases of financial crimes worth a total of  ₹7,200 crore.
The agency’s crackdown comes against the backdrop of its current probes against several financial and white-collar crimes, including the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and the ICICI Bank probe. Those questioned include top industry bankers.
With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recording more than 6,800 cases of bank fraud amounting to  ₹71,500 crore in 2018-19 alone, the probe agency on Tuesday said that the searches were based on complaints by the State Bank of India (SBI), PNB, Andhra Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Indian Overseas Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Dena Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Central Bank of India, Union Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, and Bank of India.
The 169 premises were spread across Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.
A CBI official said the probe agency has registered around 42 cases related to bank frauds involving more than  ₹7,200 crore. “Investigations and searches are ongoing,"" the official said.
The agency began its anti-corruption drive earlier this year to probe cases of financial crimes in association with the vigilance officers of concerned government departments, ministries and organisations, with the action being in consonance with “the CBI mandate of anti-corruption work"", a person familiar with the development said.
The move comes nearly two years after the  ₹14,356 crore scam involving PNB became the focus of both the CBI and the enforcement directorate (ED), with a global dragnet in place to try and arrest diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The CBI and ED are currently pushing for their extradition from the UK and Antigua respectively.
Quick on the heels of the PNB scam which broke in February 2018, the agency registered a  ₹1,394.43 crore bank fraud case against Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure Ltd on a complaint by state-run Union Bank of India. That came just days after it registered a case against Chennai-based Kanishk Gold and its promoters for allegedly duping SBI and 13 other banks of  ₹824.15 crore.
In the budget session of Parliament this year, the Lok Sabha was informed that RBI in 2018-19 registered 921 cases of financial fraud involving ATM, debit and credit cards, and internet banking, each involving amounts of  ₹1 lakh and above."

Incomplete housing projects worth less than  ₹2 crore per unit in Mumbai,  ₹1.5 crore in other metros, including the national capital region (NCR), and  ₹1 crore in other parts of the country will benefit from the move, Sitharaman said. The funds will be used to complete stalled projects.
“The projects need to be registered in RERA (Real Estate Regulation and Development Act) and their net worth should be positive. Even if the project has been declared an NPA or dragged to NCLT but not asked for liquidation will also benefit,"" she added.
Property developers have been struggling with dwindling sales, piling inventory and falling prices, even as funding for projects has dried up, with banks reluctant to lend to real estate projects fearing defaults. The prospects of the industry have turned worse since the ban on high-value currency notes in November 2016 and the implementation of the goods and services tax in July the following year.
When Sitharaman last announced a package for the housing sector in September, the government barred projects that have been declared as defaulters or are facing bankruptcy proceedings from availing the benefits of the scheme. Defining mid-income housing by indicating the eligibility of projects based on price points across property markets will benefit premium projects.
This expands the scope of including more projects under the new corpus. The government has taken a big step by allowing projects undergoing insolvency proceedings to benefit from the distressed fund scheme, said Anuj Puri, chairman of Anarock Property Consultants Ltd.
“The government has realized that something needs to be done for the realty sector. This step will definitely improve the sentiment of the real estate market because this is the first time that such a measure has been taken for stalled projects,"" said Puri.
Sitharaman said 1,600 housing projects and 458,000 housing units are stalled due to lack of funds. Of the stalled units, around 200,000 are in NCR, around 100,000 in Mumbai and the rest in smaller cities, according to estimates by analysts.
Real estate projects worth  ₹1.8 trillion are stalled across India, according to Anarock Property Consultants.
The focus on real estate is part of the government’s broader plan to kick-start economic growth, which slowed to a six-year low of 5% in the quarter ended 30 June.
Economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty said the net worth of projects will be considered positive if their cash flow is higher than their project cost. “Most of the projects are viable projects, but their problem is of liquidity. The government had to intervene because there was some amount of market failure and liquidity crunch that had happened,"" he added.
SBICAP Ventures Ltd will run the AIF and ensure the funds are utilized only for completion of the intended projects.
AIF is a privately pooled investment vehicle that collects funds from sophisticated investors, whether Indian or foreign, for investing them in accordance with a defined policy. The real estate AIF cleared by the cabinet is a category II AIF and will not undertake borrowing activities other than to meet day-to-day operational requirements.
“The extension of this benefit to mid-income projects beyond the affordable housing segment is a critical step forward,"" said Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director of Knight Frank India.

Besides funds from government, Life Insurance Company (LIC) and State Bank of India (SBI) will also contribute money towards the AIF, put together fund is expected to reach Rs25,000 crore. Government is also in talks with sovereign bonds and pension funds to put in money in AIF further.

Only those projects will be considered for funding, where unit price is less than Rs2 crore in case of Mumbai, units price are less than Rs1.5 crore in case of cities like Delhi, Kolkata, Pune, Hyderabad and units price are less than Rs1 crore for all other cities.
Besides, that project has to be registered under Real estate (regulation and development) Act, and it should be net-worth positive, to get funding from the AIF.
Even those projects which had been declared non-performing assets (NPAs) or cases has been filed against the projects in National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) will get funded, provided NCLT has not yet ordered for liquidation of the project.

136,2019-11-06,State Bank,"Kumar also said that many of the problems of the real estate sector have to be solved by the industry itselfThe housing finance company has faced multiple rating downgrades in recent months

MUMBAI :
State Bank of India chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday said that housing finance companies should behave like housing finance companies and should focus only on lending to individual retail borrowers. Speaking at the Indian Mortgage Leadership Conclave organised by India Mortgage Guarantee Corporation, Kumar also said that there is a need to cap the amount of retail and developer loans in the ratio of 75%:25% of total loans.
“If you are a housing finance company be a housing finance. Else be a developer finance company. Everybody drew comfort when the money was lent to HFCs. But that turned otherwise and that’s where the whole problem arose,"" he said. “Earlier HFC was giving 75% of their total loans to retail loans. But rules changed and it reduced to 50% of the total loans.
Kumar also said that many of the problems of the real estate sector have to be solved by the industry itself. “Who told developers to take out money for this project and invest in buying land or for your luxuries? This isn’t government’s problems. This is created by developer community. How can you expect the government to set it right. We will have to set it right,"" he added.
Kumar’s comments come in the wake of the crisis at Dewan Housing Finance Corp Ltd (DHFL) where forensic audit has revealed siphoning of funds from the company to a host of promoter-led entities. Separately, Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) is also likely to recommend a probe by Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) into allegations of fund diversion.
DHFL, the fourth-largest Indian housing finance company based on loans outstanding as of March 2019, has been facing a liquidity crisis since September 2018. As on 6 July, the company’s total debt stood at  ₹83,873 crore, of which  ₹38,342 crore was owed to banks, and  ₹45,061 crore to domestic bondholders. The housing finance company has faced multiple rating downgrades in recent months.
At the end of September 2018, DHFL was a standard account on the books of many lenders. However, the housing financier stopped payments to lenders since 10 October following the Bombay High Court order restraining it from paying any of its secured or unsecured creditors, including fixed deposit holders. With no repayments coming, the company is likely to be declared as a non-performing asset in the third quarter.
Speaking on the sidelines, Kumar also added that lenders will report only a part of the loan exposure to DHFL as fraud. Mint had reported on 3 November that lenders are looking to declare only a part of the loan amount that is 40% of the banks’ exposure as fraud. Lenders are currently awaiting the final forensic audit report by audit firm KPMG before declaring the account as fraud in the third quarter.
A draft forensic report by accounting firm KPMG discovered that out of funds worth around  ₹27,000 crore borrowed by DHFL from banks for on-lending to homebuyers, around  ₹10,050 crore was invested in mutual funds. The forensic report also found that about 25 group companies to which DHFL had lent a total of  ₹14,000 crore had an average profit of about  ₹1 lakh, raising suspicion that the mortgage lender might have diverted funds."

MUMBAI :
State Bank chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday said the lenders will finalise the resolution plan for the troubled mortgage lender DHFL after the November 11 hearing at the Bombay High Court.
Edelweiss AMC, Kotak Mahindra AMC, Axis Asset Management and Reliance AMC had moved the Bombay High Court seeking a direction to DHFL to disclose all its assets and liabilities and also to temporarily prevent it from making payments/disbursements to secured and unsecured creditors.
""We have to wait what happens on November 11. Then a call will be taken,"" Kumar told reporters on the sidelines of the India mortgage conclave.
Under the draft resolution plan, the lenders would pick up 51% stake in the third largest mortgage lender by converting a part of their debt into equity.
The beleaguered home financier owes  ₹83,873 crore as of July 6 to banks, the National Housing Board, mutual funds and bondholders. Its secured debt is  ₹74,054 crore while the unsecured debt stood at  ₹9,818 crore.
Kumar said for SBI, the DHFL account is stressed but not an NPA in the September quarter.
On the High Court restraining DHFL from making any further payments to unsecured creditors, he said it would have a ""very negative impact on the securitisation market as this is against the contracts.""
On resuming lending to the fund-starved NBFC sector, Kumar said SBI is not averse to lending to those NBFCs that have good rating and have lent prudently to its customers.
According to him, a housing finance company should focus on housing finance only. ""If you are a housing finance company, be a housing finance company. If you are developer finance then be a developer finance company,"" he said.
It can be noted that the main cause for the liquidity crisis at NBFCs is due to their large exposure to long-term project finance, which is funded with short-term borrowing."

129,2019-11-08,State Bank,"The cut in lending rates will be effect from November 10, SBI saidSBI also lowered FD rates for select maturity

India's biggest bank State Bank of India or SBI today lowered lending rates, making loans cheaper. SBI cut its MCLR or marginal cost of fund based lending rate by 5 basis points across all tenors, its 7th consecutive cut in borrowing rates in FY 2019-20. After the rate cut, SBI's one-year MCLR will come down to 8% per annum, with effect from November 10, 2019.
The one-year MCLR is the benchmark against which most retail loans such as home loan and auto loan are priced. HDFC Bank had earlier this week cut marginal-cost based lending rate (MCLR) for various tenors by up to 10 basis points (bps).
MCLR is closely linked to the bank's actual deposit rates. If your home loan is linked to one-year MCLR, your interest rate will get reset only after the completion of one year.
SBI today also announced a revision in fixed deposit rates or FD rates by 15 basis points for deposits for one year to less than two years maturity.
SBI also slashed bulk deposit rates by 30-75 bps across tenors. The bank cited adequate liquidity in the system for lowering FD rates.
The Reserve Bank of India so far this year cut repo rate by a cumulative 135 basis points. Many banks have linked their retail lending rates to an external benchmark and even lowered the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR). 
SBI, for example, has a repo rate-linked home loan product under which it charges a spread of 265 basis points over the RBI's repo rate (currently at 5.4%) to calculate its external benchmark-based lending rate, which comes to 8.05%. SBI also charges a premium for calculating effective home loan rate for customers."

127,2019-11-08,State Bank,"The rating actions follow the affirmation of India's Baa2 sovereign rating, and the change in the outlook to negative from stableThe outlook was revised down for EXIM India, HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI

Mumbai: Moody's Investor Services on Friday downgraded financial institutions closely linked to the Indian government's sovereign rating from 'stable' to 'negative' after a similar rating action on India's sovereign outlook which elicited a quick response from the government.
Moody's on Friday revised the outlook of six systemically financial institutions including the State Bank of India and HDFC Bank to negative from stable. 
The rating actions follow the affirmation of India's Baa2 sovereign rating, and the change in the outlook to negative from stable a day earlier.
The outlook was revised down for EXIM India, HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI but was maintained at stable for Bank of India (BOI), Canara Bank (CAN), Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC), Syndicate Bank (Syndicate) and Union Bank of India (UBI).
Explaining the rational for the downgrade of EXIM India, HUDCO, IRFC, and SBI, Moody's said that their final ratings are at the same level as the sovereign rating because of the uplift to their ratings, based on Moody's assumption that these companies will receive government support in times of need.
""Consequently, if Moody's downgrades the sovereign rating, it will also downgrade these companies' final ratings. The close links between the four companies and the government is the key reason why Moody's has changed the outlooks for these companies to negative from stable, after doing the same for the sovereign rating,"" Moody's said in a statement.
Moody's justified its rating action on the country's largest private bank, HDFC Bank by saying that the bank has large direct exposure to government debt and also as the Baseline Credit Assessment (BCA) of a bank is capped at the sovereign rating of the country that it operates in.
Moody's said it expects that BOI, CAN, OBC, Syndicate and UBI to continue to enjoy a very high level of support from the government. Under these support assumptions, even if the sovereign rating is downgraded by one notch to Baa3, the support uplift should be sufficient to keep the final ratings unchanged at Baa3, it said.
""This situation is the key driver of Moody's affirmation of the five banks' ratings.
Moody's does not have any particular governance concern for all the issuers impacted by today's rating action,"" it added.
Separately, Moody's downgraded the long-term counterparty risk assessment and long-term local currency counterparty risk rating of HDFC Bank's Bahrain branch and ICICI Bank's Bahrain Branch to Ba2(cr) from Ba1(cr) and Ba2 from Ba1 to align these ratings with Bahrain's local currency ceilings.
Also for ICICI Bank Bahrain Branch, Moody's downgraded the long-term foreign currency senior unsecured medium-term note programme rating and subordinate medium-term note programme rating to (P)Ba3 from (P)Ba2 to align these ratings with Bahrain's foreign currency bond ceiling.
There are currently no outstanding bonds issued out of the Bahrain branch, Moody's said in a statement.

126,2019-11-08,State Bank,"The revision may impact the overseas borrowing programmes of the affected banksMoody’s on Friday revised outlook for 6 financial institutions, including SBI, HDFC Bank and Hudco

NEW DELHI :
Moody’s Investors Service’s revision of the outlook for key Indian banks and financial institutions from stable to negative on Friday could make it dearer for them to borrow on international markets in the short term, three analysts said. This could have implications for their lending rates, too.
Moody’s on Friday affirmed the ratings, but revised the outlook for six banks and financial institutions—State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, Hero FinCorp, EXIM India, Housing and Urban Development Corp. (Hudco) and Indian Railway Finance Corp. (IRFC)—following a similar revision in outlook for India’s Baa2 sovereign rating in light of increasing risks that economic growth will remain lower than in the past.
The outlook revision could impact overseas borrowing programmes of the affected banks, said an analyst with a rating agency in India, adding that the actual quantum of impact may be hard to predict.
“Any rating action will have an impact based on the direction, positive or negative. These are international ratings. Logically, the revision in outlook would have an impact but this depends on whether these institutions are looking at borrowing abroad at this point in time,"" said the analyst, requesting anonymity.
Moody’s said it will downgrade the ratings of SBI, HDFC Bank, EXIM India, Hudco and IRFC if it downgrades India’s sovereign rating. “The close links between the companies and the government of India is the key reason why Moody’s has changed the outlooks for these companies to negative from stable, after doing the same for the sovereign rating,"" said the rating agency statement.
It added that if India’s Baa2 sovereign rating were to be downgraded, HDFC Bank’s rating will also be downgraded in view of the strong linkages between the bank’s business and the sovereign credit profile.“Many financial institutions do raise capital from overseas markets and the outlook revision will obviously have a bearing on cost of borrowing per se in the short term. The government has been taking steps to improve the macroeconomic conditions and once those steps start showing results, the rating outlook will also return to stable,"" said a partner at a consultancy service, who also requested anonymity.
A third analyst, who also asked not to be named, said the outlook revision can have a bearing on borrowing costs, but not as sharply as a ratings downgrade.
Friday’s sovereign rating outlook revision, which financial institutions are also linked with, reflects lower policy effectiveness in addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses, than Moody’s had previously estimated, the rating agency said.
Moody’s has also revised down the outlook of state-run energy companies such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd, which could have an adverse effect on their overseas borrowing costs.
External commercial borrowing (ECB) has been a popular source of capital for Indian businesses. Care Ratings had said on Thursday that there has been a resurgence in ECBs in the past one year, following a decline in the preceding three years, in light of underlying conditions in the domestic economy and financial markets, coupled with the liberalisation of ECB rules.
India has eased ECB rules only when a pressing need is noticed by the government and the Reserve Bank of India, so that cheaper foreign funds do not flood the local economy and create asset bubbles."
130,2019-11-08,State Bank,"With an estimated $25 bn worth of property projects facing insolvency proceedings in bankruptcy courts, there is little clarity on how many cases the proposed fund will be able to resolveWhile the govt will invest  ₹10,000 crore in the fund, the remaining  ₹15,000 crore will come from SBI, LIC and private sector lenders

NEW DELHI,
		             REAL ESTATE :
The government’s  ₹25,000 crore rescue fund for reviving the real estate industry may not be enough to address the full extent of the problem, even as private investors appear unwilling to take on outsized risks in the distressed sector without suitable returns.
With an estimated $25 billion worth of property projects facing insolvency proceedings in bankruptcy courts, there is little clarity on how many cases the proposed fund will be able to resolve.
“There is no legal provision of last-mile funding of projects under bankruptcy laws. The proposed alternative investment fund (AIF) would need to acquire the entire company or special purpose vehicle and not just projects under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code),"" a fund manager at an AIF, which specializes in distressed funding, said on condition of anonymity.
Several financial industry executives who spoke to Mint said the success of the government’s move to revive stalled housing projects will depend on how the rescue package is designed. On Wednesday, the Union cabinet approved a plan to set up the AIF to provide relief to distressed homebuyers and property developers. While the government will invest  ₹10,000 crore in the fund, the remaining  ₹15,000 crore will come from institutions such as State Bank of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India and private sector lenders.
The government plans to address projects that are net worth positive, which means the amount of money given for construction will be easily recoverable from the cash flows of the project, said Prashant Thakur, director and head of research at Anarock Property Consultants Pvt. Ltd.
“If the project is not cash positive, chances are that one may not be able to recover the money because the developer might have overborrowed. Given this criteria, it will be a small fraction of the entire NCLT projects that may benefit from this fund,"" Thakur said.
The proposed AIF is aimed at bridging the funding gap in the real estate industry, with banks unwilling to lend to real estate projects fearing defaults as property developers have been struggling with dwindling sales, piling inventory and falling prices.
“Given the record pile-up of unsold inventory in the residential sector, not many are willing to underwrite the construction risk,"" said a second fund manager of a foreign real estate-focused AIF. “While the saleability of a project goes up manifold once it is completed, poor demand conditions in the market may offset any potential upside that a private investor may be looking to make from these projects.""
“Also, it is fair to assume that the AIF will be inundated with funding requests from day one and how it evaluates and decides on potential recipients will be critical,"" said the fund manager.
Another hurdle for the plan is that the AIF would need to acquire the entire insolvent unit under bankruptcy resolution, said Ramakant Rai, partner at law firm Trilegal. “If it is just a financier, then it does not solve the matter much as currently the market needs liquidity as well as good developers to tackle the real estate mess."" Rai added that the majority of cases undergoing bankruptcy proceedings will not be net worth positive, reducing the number of projects that can be revived."

It was followed by Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), whose m-cap valuation plunged  ₹20,230.2 crore to  ₹4,51,633.92 crore.
Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) lost  ₹7,383.37 crore crore in m-cap to stand at  ₹9,16,230.34 crore, while ITC's valuation dropped  ₹1,013.61 crore to  ₹3,20,032.38 crore.

Global setbacks put SoftBank’s investment plans in India at risk
SoftBank Group’s large-ticket investments in India face an uncertain future as the Japanese conglomerate struggles with setbacks in its marquee investments of WeWork and Uber, raising questions on the completion of its second Vision Fund of $100 billion, Mint reported citing four people directly aware of ongoing discussions between SoftBank and Indian startups. Softbank has been mulling two deals for more than six months—a $200 million investment in regional language news aggregator Dailyhunt, and a $300 million funding in eyewear retailer Lenskart. In both cases, SoftBank has submitted the final term sheets but has not been able to make the investments that are slated to come from the second Vision fund, the people said. The capital for both Lenskart and Dailyhunt has to come from the second Vision Fund, because Fund 1 is fully deployed, with money left only for debt repayments and some follow on deals. The delay in the investment despite a go-ahead by the investment teams in India and global headquarters has left the companies in question in a lurch. SoftBank confirmed the same in its quarterly earnings release last week, when it said that Vision Fund 1’s investment period ended on 12 September 2019. For the quarter ended 30 September, SoftBank reported a loss of $6.4 billion, while the Vision Fund reported an operating loss of $9 billion.
Shareholders ask Fortis to act on IHH open offer
Minority shareholders of Fortis Healthcare Ltd are demanding that the company and its parent IHH Healthcare Bhd make efforts to vacate a Supreme Court stay on an open offer for buying additional shares of the Indian hospital operator, Mint reported citing three people familiar with the development. There are some minority investors who have asked the company about its action plan on the  ₹3,400 crore offer, especially considering that Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi retires on 17 November. In December last year, a three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Gogoi had ordered a status quo on the sale of Fortis Healthcare to IHH Healthcare while hearing a petition by Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo. Another bench, which was also headed by Chief Justice Gogoi, reserved an order on the stay in April. Some shareholders of Fortis Healthcare also approached Sebi in May and asked the regulator to issue directions to Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare to pay interest, of about 8-10%, to shareholders for the delay in the open offer to buy an additional 26% stake in Fortis Healthcare. IHH has deposited the funds for the open offer in a non-interest bearing escrow account, and are being maintained without demur for the entire period of operation of the stay order.
Saudi Aramco IPO starts November 17, offer size still pending
Saudi Aramco will allow investors to start bidding for shares in the world’s most-profitable company from Nov. 17, Bloomberg reported. It left potential buyers in the dark about the size of the stake it plans to sell and the pricing range. The Saudi stock exchange rules prohibit the oil giant from listing additional shares for six months after the start of trading, according to its more than 650-page prospectus. Also, the Saudi government, the company’s sole owner, won’t offer any additional shares during the 12-month period after listing, but retains the right to sell to foreign governments or investors affiliated with foreign governments. While the prospectus includes Aramco’s profits for the first nine months and details of the company’s operations, it doesn’t include any indication of what valuation the government hopes to achieve. Price guidance for the share sale is expected next week, but people familiar with the deal have told Bloomberg that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman would be satisfied with a valuation of between $1.6 trillion and $1.8 trillion.
Hero could buy 10-15% stake in Max Financial
Sunil Kant Munjal’s Hero Corp is set to buy a significant minority stake from Analjit Singh in Max Financial Services Ltd, The Economic Times reported citing two people familiar with the development. The listed Max Financial houses Max Life Insurance, the largest nonbank private life insurer in the country. Singh, who has pledged more than 90% of the promoter stake in Max Financial, is raising funds to deleverage the balance sheet. The promoter leverage has been a drag on the listed parent’s stock. Hero Corp may pick up a stake of 10-15% or more. Under the proposed deal that’s likely to be announced shortly, it may declare itself a co-promoter along with Singh and make an open offer. Munjal is expected to join the board of Max Financial, which has a market capitalisation of  ₹12,963 crore. Singh could retain a 10% stake. Earlier this year, Max Financial was reportedly in discussions with Axis Bank for a possible merger. However, no agreement could be reached on valuation.
Edelweiss set to close last-mile realty financing fund with South Korea’s Meritz
The Edelweiss group is planning to raise up to $1 billion in dedicated real estate funds, and deploy the proceeds in completion financing for housing projects stuck due to liquidity or solvency constraints, The Economic Times reported. This move comes a week after finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced establishing an alternative investment fund (AIF) to give last-mile financing to lower and middle income housing projects. Edelweiss has partnered South Korea’s Meritz Financial group to launch the first fund of $425 million. The first tranche of this fund will likely close this week at $270 million, with Meritz making the majority investment commitment. Another tranche of $155 million would also be launched soon following the first series deployment. The fund will buy out existing loans of these projects. This will also reduce Edelweiss group’s own real-estate loan book. Last-mile financing helps unlock projects stuck due to a cash crunch. The fund will be managed by Edelweiss’ Alternative Assets platform, which manages $3.6 billion in assets.
Aviva Life faces IBC trial over ‘not paying landlord’
Aviva Life Insurance has become the first financial company to be admitted into Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) upheld a landlord’s claim accusing the insurer of failing to meet its payment obligations and ordered the commencement of the company’s insolvency process, The Economic Times reported citing court documents it has seen. The life insurer, which is a 51:49 JV between the Burman family that controls consumer goods maker Dabur and Britain’s Aviva Plc, has denied owing money to the landlord, Kolkata-based Apeejay Group, whose premises in Mumbai the company has been occupying for over a decade. The insurer also claimed in court filings that IBC laws do not allow for insolvency of financial services providers. The seeds of the commercial dispute between Aviva and Apeejay group were sown two years ago when the former stopped making payments towards licence fees for Apeejay House, a property that belongs to Apeejay Trust, as per the court filings. Though the NCLT noted that IBC exempts financial services providers from insolvency proceedings, it rejected Aviva’s attempt to seek an exemption on these grounds.
Kalanick readies recipe for India cloud kitchen Foray
Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick has discreetly begun building an India team to drive his new venture, City Storage Systems, which runs delivery-only kitchens called CloudKitchens, The Economic Times reported citing five people aware of his plans. The company, which continues to operate on a stealth mode, has started engagements with restaurant chains and real estate developers in Mumbai, as well as begun early discussions with marketplaces including Swiggy, UberEats and Zomato. Cloud kitchens are restaurants without a dine-in facility or walk-in customers. Former TexMex Cuisine India CEO Ashish Saxena is the general manager for Mumbai and has been overseeing operations reporting directly to Kalanick. The company is in the process of setting up teams in other cities as well. It will also hire a country head once the business launches and scales. Mumbai is the first city scheduled to be launched, followed by Bengaluru, Delhi and Hyderabad. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported that CloudKitchens had received a $400 million investment from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, valuing the startup at around $5 billion. The other market in the pipeline is the Middle East.
CG Power plans to raise  ₹800 crore via equity issue to tackle liquidity crisis
CG Power & Solutions, which has ousted its promoters following allegations of financial irregularities, has sought regulatory waiver on a market-access clause to raise much-needed funds, The Economic Times reported citing two industry executives aware of the plans. CG Power’s erstwhile directors and promoters, who hold an insignificant stake in the board-driven company, are barred from accessing the capital markets. CG Power’s investment banker, the Kotak group, is handling the fund-raising proposal. The company aims to raise around  ₹800 crore through an issue of equity or quasi-equity instruments to institutional investors — existing and new — over the next few months. The company told the exchanges last week that it is in need of both long-term capital and working capital and is in the process of identifying potential sources of capital and also seeking external advice on mode and sources of fund raising. The company has also initiated the process to remove the Thapar-led Avantha Holdings, which only holds around 8,500 shares, as the company’s promoter in the wake of its role in alleged financial irregularities that may have cost the company  ₹3,000 crore. The company, which badly needs funds since bankers were reluctant to give fresh loans, has sought an exemption on tapping the markets from the Sebi, which barred former chairman and promoter Gautam Thapar and other ex-directors from accessing D-Street after the irregularities first surfaced.
SBI plans to sell 14% stake in card unit’s IPO to raise  ₹ 8,000 crore
State Bank of India (SBI) plans to raise about  ₹8,000 crore by selling a minority stake in the initial share sale of SBI Cards, a company that has also turned out to be a multi-bagger for the lender’s private equity partner in the business – Carlyle, The Economic Times reported citing a source close to the development. State Bank of India has initiated the process to sell 14% stake in SBI Cards and is looking to raise  ₹8,000 crore through the public issue, valuing the company at  ₹57,000 crore. Both SBI and Carlyle will sell stakes in the IPO. SBI Cards is a joint venture where SBI owns 74%. Buyout firm Carlyle, which owns the remaining 26%, will likely sell a part of its holding in the upcoming IPO. Back in 2017, when Carlyle joined the business as a financial investor, the valuation was  ₹8,000 crore. Carlyle had come into the joint venture when GE Capital exited after two decades. Nomura, Axis Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Kotak Mahindra Capital and SBI Caps are bankers to the issue. It is the second largest credit card company in India with a card base of 9.5 million after HDFC Bank, with over 13 million. In total spend, the market share is 17.7% while by way of card base, it is 18%."
121,2019-11-11,State Bank,"An SBI report said the demand slowdown in the economy is still significant and would take longer time to recoverNomura has projected September quarter GDP growth to decelerate to 4.2%

New Delhi: With industrial output in the September quarter contracting 0.4% from a 3% expansion in the preceding three months, economic growth is likely to slow to less than 5% in the quarter ended September, data for which is to be released on 29 November.
The weaker-than-expected economic data emerging from India points to a deepening slowdown in Asia’s third-largest economy, where private consumption, investments and exports have all taken a hit. Economic growth rate had cooled to a six-year-low of 5% in the June quarter.
“GVA (Gross Value Added) and IIP measure two different data points and industrial GVA growth has generally been in excess of IIP growth. However, in Q2 of FY20, industrial GVA growth is likely to be lower than 2.7% achieved in Q1 of FY20,"" said Devendra Kumar Pant, chief economist at India Ratings.
Nomura has projected September quarter GDP growth to decelerate to 4.2% from 5% in the June quarter of FY20. The brokerage last week cut its overall GDP growth forecast for FY20 to 4.9% from 5.7% estimated earlier, the lowest so far among forecasting agencies.
SBI in its Ecowrap report released last week said it is less hopeful of a growth pick-up in Q2 FY20. “Out of 26 indicators, only 5 indicators were showing acceleration in September. This indicates the demand slowdown in the economy is still significant and would take longer time to recover. If we map the leading indicators showing acceleration, there is a distinct possibility that growth in GDP in Q2 will be lower than 5%,"" the report said.
The Narendra Modi administration has taken a series of steps to reverse the slowdown, including a cut in the corporate tax rate in September. The Cabinet cleared a proposal last week to set up a  ₹25,000 crore debt fund to finish incomplete housing projects, a move that is expected to boost cement and steel sectors in the coming months.
Sachchidanand Shukla, chief economist at Mahindra Group, said the government has tried to address sectoral pain points through specific measures. Most of these measures are addressing supply-side concerns and not those on the demand side, barring RBI’s rate cuts, he added. “We will see from Q3 onwards a slight recovery and may end Q4 probably with a growth rate of close to 7%. The factors that will support this recovery are a favourable base, some favourable lagged effect of RBI’s policy rate cuts meant to infuse liquidity and government spending. This recovery will be clearly visible from Q4. Please bear in mind, large part of it will be statistical,"" he added.
The country needs to create employment and livelihood so that income levels go up which will help resolve the weakness in the economy rather than resorting to patchwork aimed at boosting investor sentiment, said Arun Maira, former member of Planning Commission of India. “We need a broader policy for improving incomes and livelihood. Short term measures will not help recover the economy in a sustainable way. We need an industrial policy that focuses on the bottom of the economy, that is, small enterprises in various sectors, which will create more employment and income for people. From this, we can derive the solutions for other facets of the economy,"" Maira added."

MUMBAI :
Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) has received an unsolicited offer from a potential investor to acquire a 59.18% stake in its process management and back office services arm CPG BPM Services Pvt. Ltd.
Following the offer, the bankrupt infrastructure developer on Monday announced that it is seeking expressions of interest (EoIs) for the stake—an effort to attract more bidders and receive a robust valuation.
“CPG has been approached by an interested party who has submitted a binding offer for the acquisition of 59.18% of the issued, subscribed and paid up equity shares of CPG,"" IL&FS said in a notification on its website. The remaining stake is held by M.R. Srinivasan and Latha Srirnivasan, founding promoters with experience in the BPO business.
Founded in 2010, CPG’s expertise lies in providing KYC (know your customer) and anti-money laundering services, and it has digitized 36 million documents so far. It also provides cash management services, customer on-boarding, and other services for broking and telecom firms and processes insurance claim data entry, import payments and credit cards data.
The Bengaluru-based firm has about 450 employees and counts SBI Card, Bank of America, Zerodha, JP Morgan and LIC Housing Finance as its clients.
Interested bidders can submit their offers by 22 November. The company has set a net worth eligibility criteria of  ₹1 crore for strategic investors, while for financial investors, the eligibility criteria is assets under management of  ₹4 crore as of 31 March.
CPG is another asset that the new board of IL&FS, chaired by billionaire banker Uday Kotak, is looking to divest as part of a resolution process. The new board was appointed by the corporate affairs ministry on 4 October 2018 to resolve the IL&FS crisis after the financial behemoth defaulted on debt repayments.
IL&FS group owes nearly  ₹94,216 to its creditors, of which  ₹57,000 crore is owed to banks alone, mainly public sector lenders.
Mint reported on 1 October, that the Uday Kotak-led board expects to recover and resolve more than half of the outstanding debt of  ₹94,216 crore that IL&FS owes its lenders. Given the several challenges to saving IL&FS from the brink of bankruptcy, he hopes to complete the bulk of the resolution process in six months through March 2020, Kotak said."

119,2019-11-12,State Bank,"The SBI report says the Q2 GDP growth may further lower down on low automobile sales, flattening of core sector growth and low investment in construction, infrastructureThe report says it expects growth rate to pick up pace in FY21 to 6.2%

The second quarter GDP growth may further lower down to 4.2% on low automobile sales, deceleration in air traffic movements, flattening of core sector growth and declining investment in construction and infrastructure, and the growth forecast for FY20 has now come down to 5% from 6.1% earlier, an SBI report said.
State Bank of India (SBI) joins all other global agencies — the ADB, World Bank, OECD, RBI and the IMF — in downgrading India's FY20 growth rates.
""Based on our composite leading indicator that suggests the GDP growth to slow down further from 5.0% in Q1 of FY20 to 4.2% on account of low automobile sales, deceleration in air traffic movements, flattening of core sector growth and declining investment in construction and infrastructure"", the bank said in a report.
India's GDP was already at the 6-year lowest of 5% in Q1. ""Our 33 high frequency leading indicators reveal an acceleration rate which was 65% in Q1 FY19 declined sharply to 27% in Q2 FY20. Besides that, Skymet also reported that the country as a whole received 110% of the long period average (LPA) of 89 cm of rainfall during the four-month-long southwest monsoon period, making it to the above normal category, SBI said.
""Among meteorological divisions, Central India and Southern Peninsula received the maximum rainfall of 129% and 116% of their LPA, respectively. Excess Monsoon rains and the floods caused by them had affected the Kharif crops in many states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Punjab.
""While 40 to 50% soyabean crop has been hit in Madhya Pradesh, which is the biggest producer of the oilseed, 30 to 40% of the groundnut and up to 30% of cotton crops have been affected in Gujarat.
""As these states are major agrarian states, so this could have a negative impact on the agricultural growth. Considering all these domestic parameters along with the global downturn, we now foresee a GDP growth at 5 per cent in the current fiscal,"" the report said.
""We expect Q2GDP growth at 4.2%. Our acceleration rate for 33 leading indicators at 85% in October 2018 is down to just 17% in September 2019, with such decline gaining traction from March 2019.
Even IIP growth number for September 2019 was 4.3%, which is quite alarming. We are revising our GDP forecast for FY20 to 5% from 6.1% earlier,"" the SBI Ecowarp said.
""We expect growth rate to pick up pace in FY21 to 6.2%. We also expect revisions to the GDP data as in the past, but that is likely in February 2020 as is the custom. In FY17, Q1 GDP figure was revised upwards from 7.1% in every revision and finally settled at 9.2%"", the bank said.
""We, however, believe this growth rate in FY20 should be looked through the prism of synchronised global slowdown (countries have witnessed 22-716 basis point decline between June 2018 and June 2019, and India cannot be isolated!).
""India is also significantly lower in Economic Uncertainty Index when compared globally. We also believe that Moody's change in outlook from stable to negative will not have any significant impact as rating actions are always a laggard indicator and the markets this time have categorically given a thumbs down to such indicators,"" it said."

Indian markets fell sharply today amid weak global cues and disappointing domestic factory output data. The Sensex declined 229 points to 40,116 while the broader Nifty settled 0.60% lower at 11,840. Some profit-taking was seen in banking stocks after their recent outperformance. The Nifty Bank index fell 1.8%. Yes Bank fell 6% while SBI, Axis Bank and Bank of Baroda declined 3%.
Shares of Infosys fell 2% today. Infosys has received another whistleblower complaint against chief executive Salil Parekh of misdemeanours, days after a similar letter prompted the company’s board to institute an independent probe.
Gains in heavyweights TCS, up 4%, and RIL, up 3%, helped cap losses.
Nifty is likely to see further profit-booking in the near term after the breach of 11,850, says Amit Shah, technical analyst with Indiabulls Ventures. ""Nifty is likely to test the next support zone of 11,700. Broader uptrend however remains intact and markets currently are seeing a phase of consolidation.""
Sahaj Agarwal, head of derivatives at Kotak Securities, expects Nifty to trade in the range of 11700-12100. ""Short-term selling pressure is expected to push the index towards 11700-11750. Broader health of the market is also negatively biased for the near term. This correction provides with an excellent buying opportunity from the medium term perspective,"" he said. 
India's industrial output fell at the fastest pace in over six years in September, adding to a series of weak indicators, data released after Monday's market hours showed. Indian markets were closed on Tuesday for a holiday.
“Dismal IIP performance for the second consecutive month points to a deep slump in economic activity. The weakness was broad-based across a mix of consumption and investment indicators. Owing to weak momentum and lack of any impetus, we revise down our FY2020 GDP growth estimate by 80 bps to 5%,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.
“Even though inflation is likely to breach the MPC’s target of 4%, we expect the MPC to cut the repo rate by another 50 bps through the rest of FY2020,"" the brokerage added.
Asian markets sank today after US President Donald Trump failed to give investors enough reassurance over the progress of China trade talks. In a much-anticipated speech on Tuesday, the president went into election mode, hailing a strong economy and saying a trade deal was close but also warning that he could ramp up tariffs if he did not get his way.

In an environment when bank fixed deposit (FD) interest rate is falling, Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) is an excellent scheme for senior citizens. This 5-year, small savings scheme offers currently offers an interest rate of 8.6% per  annum. Under this scheme, senior citizens can deposit a maximum of  ₹15 lakh and earn quarterly interest. But the interest earned is taxable. ""The government can provide tax exemption to Senior Citizens Savings Scheme (SCSS) to support the senior citizens and this move will have a minimal impact on fiscal deficit of 2 basis points,"" SBI research team said in a report.
""Government has an excellent scheme for senior citizens.However, the interest on SCSS is fully taxable which is a major drawback of this scheme,"" it added in the report.
According the SBI report, March 2018 outstanding under Senior Citizen Savings Scheme was  ₹38,662 crore. ""It will be fair if such amount is given full tax rebate as the revenue foregone by the government could be only  ₹3092 crore, that will have the minimal 2 bps impact on Government fiscal deficit,"" the report said.
""The impact of declining interest rate regime since 2015 is also being felt by the depositors / pensioners. It is in fact imperative in a country with less than 5% of the population having access to social security, that the bank depositors are at least compensated with a sufficient positive real rate of return and are treated at par with the borrowers too. Further considering that there are more than 4 crore pensioners who have average term deposits of  ₹3.34 lakh per account, the net impact on Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) due to low interest income could be a decline of 30 basis points,"" the report said.
TDS is deducted at source on interest from Senior Citizen Savings Scheme if the interest amount is more than  ₹10,000 per annum. Investment under this scheme however qualifies for the benefit of Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Under Section 80TTB, senior citizens can claim deduction up to  ₹50,000 on interest earned from deposits."

This means that lenders to Essar Steel will soon get their cheques and it is no chump change. For SBI, this means  ₹13,220 crore worth of money. In total, the promoters owe banks a whopping  ₹49,473 crores.
Since the case took 830 days or close to nine quarters, SBI’s Kumar had run out of patience and provided 100% of the exposure. Now, he can write these back and boost profits. Considering 90% recovery, this write back is a cool  ₹12,000 crore.
Analysts have already noted the gains. Those at JP Morgan said that SBI and ICICI Bank are the biggest winners in terms of recovery.
“While the SC does ask the COC to consider operational creditors as well, we believe recovery for banks in the Essar Steel case will be closer to 90% (as suggested by the COC) vs 60% (as suggested by the NCLAT) – within our coverage universe, the key beneficiaries should be SBI followed by ICICI Bank,"" said analysts at Nomura in a note.
SBI’s shares have risen over 6% since Friday. But investors should note that stress has been piling up for banks from other large conglomerates.
The pain from Dewan Housing Finance Ltd and Essel Group is big and the telecom sector has emerged as a new point of stress. Nomura estimates SBI’s stress to be close to  ₹29,000 crore through DHFL, Indiabulls Group and Vodafone-Idea.
Banks are not off the hook yet, as far as stress is concerned and investors would be right in being cautious. For now, SBI and others can enjoy a bit a of a sunshine in a long winter."
108,2019-11-18,State Bank,"Kumar spoke to business news channel CNBC TV18 after the Supreme Court on Friday gave its verdict in favour of committee of creditors decisionWith its judgment, the apex court also ended an over two-year long legal battle to acquire Essar Steel.

State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Monday said recoveries from resolution of the Essar Steel insolvency case will add to the lender’s profit in this quarter ending December.
Kumar spoke to business news channel CNBC TV18 after the Supreme Court on Friday gave its verdict in favour of committee of creditors’ (CoC) decision, paving the way for ArcelorMittal’s entry into India. With its judgment, the apex court also ended an over two-year long legal battle to acquire Essar Steel.
“We have provided 100% (for Essar Steel). Whatever recovery comes from Essar Steel, it will go to the bank’s P&L (profit and loss) account,"" Kumar said, adding that all recoveries where the bank has made 100% provisions will straight away go into the lender’s profit and loss books.
Essar Steel owed its financial creditors  ₹49,473 crore, of which State Bank alone had an exposure of  ₹13,226 crore to the steel company. Total outstanding, including claims of financial as well as operational creditors, stood at  ₹54,565 in India’s one of the biggest insolvency cases.
The Supreme Court on Friday said the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) should not interfere with the decisions of the CoC in the Essar Steel insolvency case. In doing so, the apex court gave more weight to the financial creditors and overruled NCLAT’s July 5 judgment that operational creditors should be treated on a par with financial creditors for distribution of funds.
The CoC had filed petitions against NCLAT’s judgment, challenging that they should recover more than operational creditors in the bankruptcy resolution process.
The Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal had in March 2019 approved global steel-giant ArcelorMittal’s bid for Essar Steel. ArcelorMittal had offered an upfront cash payment of about  ₹42,000 crore to the financial creditors and capital infusion of  ₹8,000 in the next few years.
ArcelorMittal’s offer did not cover operational creditors to Essar Steel, which is promoted by the Ruias. The case was admitted to NCLT in August 2017 for insolvency proceedings after it was identified by the Reserve Bank of India in the first list of 12 big loan defaulters.
At 11:27 am, shares of the bank were up 1.2% at  ₹326 on the BSE. Following the news on Friday, shares of the bank had rallied and ended 5.19% higher."
107,2019-11-19,State Bank,"Supreme Court’s ruling in Essar Steel insolvency case establishes primacy of secured creditorsAnalysts estimate banks to get 90% recovery; SBI may see provision write-back of over  ₹12,000 crore

The closure of the Essar Steel insolvency case, one of the first set of 12 large defaulting accounts referred under a nascent code, is a victory for banks.
But beyond this steelmaker promoted by the Ruia family, lies a minefield of stressed loans that threatens to upset the earnings of banks. Essel Group, Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) and Vodafone Idea Ltd are but a handful of those accounts.
Banks have been hacking through their bad loan pile for three years now, but it still is at a formidable  ₹9.15 trillion as of September. The above names are still to be tagged bad, which would be added to this pile once they are termed as non-performing.
Granted, Essar Steel’s closure has established the primacy of lenders in the resolution process. Also, the recovery for banks would be close to 90%, analysts estimate, instead of the 60% expected earlier. Surely, banks will see huge write-backs in provisions and a boost to profit in the third quarter.
“While the SC does ask the COC (committee of creditors) to consider operational creditors as well, we believe recovery for banks in the Essar Steel case will be closer to 90% (as suggested by COC) versus 60% (as suggested by the NCLAT)—within our coverage universe, the key beneficiaries should be SBI followed by ICICI Bank,"" said analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note. NCLAT is National Company Law Appellate Tribunal.
But this win should not make banks and investors complacent. There are still large accounts to be resolved and the insolvency courts have shown no signs of a speedy process. Essar Steel took 830 days to exit the courts. There are many still doing the rounds of insolvency courts beyond the stipulated time frame of 270 days for resolution.
According to data from the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, the average time for cases to be resolved was 374 days, against the mandated 270-day limit under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. As of September, 535 cases languished in the courts for more than 270 days.
If we look at the largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), it has 540 accounts totalling more than  ₹1 trillion held up in the courts. SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar has been reminding investors of the large recovery Essar Steel will bring. The public sector bank will get a boost of  ₹12,000 crore in the December quarter as it had provided 100% for the account.
But SBI’s stressed exposure includes  ₹29,000 crore through DHFL, Indiabulls Group and Vodafone Idea, according to Nomura.
The pain from DHFL and Essel Group is big and the telecom sector has emerged as a new point of stress.
As past stressed loans get resolved, new trouble is brewing. Therefore, banks are not off the hook yet as far as stress is concerned and investors would do well in exercising some caution. For now, lenders can enjoy a bit a of a sunshine in a long winter."

NEW DELHI :
India's state-run banks reported fraud worth 958 billion rupees ($13.3 billion) from April to end-September of this year, the country's finance minister said on Tuesday, as the government struggles to help banks recoup losses.
State banks reported 5,743 cases of fraud in the period, most of which had taken place over the last several years, although 1,000 cases worth  ₹2,500 crore had just taken place, Nirmala Sitharaman told the upper house of parliament.
""Government has taken comprehensive measures to curb the incidence of fraud in banks,"" the minister said.
Measures included the freezing of 338,000 bank accounts of inoperative companies in the last two financial years and the enactment of a law with a provision to confiscate the property of those found to have committed fraud and who have fled the country.
State Bank of India reported fraud of  ₹25,400 crore followed by Punjab National Bank of  ₹10,800 crore and Bank of Baroda of  ₹8,300 crore, she said.
Bankers have blamed lax regulations and said some bank officials were working in league with fraudsters.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced a tough bankruptcy and insolvency law in 2016, and fugitive economic offenders law aiming to help banks recover losses from fraud amounting to near $140 billion.
Punjab National Bank, India's second-biggest state-run bank, reported more than $2 billion losses through fraud last year alleging that a few rogue employees had issued fake bank guarantees over several years to help jewellery groups raise funds in foreign credit."

NEW DELHI :
India’s economic growth probably hit a new low last quarter, with early forecasts showing expansion below 5%.
Economists at State Bank of India, Nomura Holdings Inc. and Capital Economics Ltd. lowered their growth forecasts for the quarter ended September to between 4.2% to 4.7%. The government is scheduled to publish the data on Nov. 29.
Growth of 4.2% would be the lowest since authorities adopted a new base year for gross domestic product data in 2012. The economy expanded 5% in the three months through June.
“We now believe GDP growth did not bottom in"" the April-June period, said Sonal Varma, chief economist for India and Asia at Nomura in Singapore, who is predicting 4.2% growth for last quarter. “High-frequency indicators have plunged and domestic credit conditions remain tight amid weak global demand.""
The Reserve Bank of India has cut interest rates five times this year to boost growth, with the monetary easing complemented by fiscal measures, including $20 billion of tax cuts for companies.
“We now expect larger rate cuts from RBI in December,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic adviser at State Bank in Mumbai, whose growth estimate matches that of Nomura’s Varma. “However, such rate cut is unlikely to lead to any immediate material revival.""
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last week said it was too early to say if the slowdown had bottomed out. Companies are planning new investments which might take time to materialize, she said.
“We doubt that these tailwinds will have been enough to offset the weakness elsewhere,"" said Shilan Shah, senior India economist at Capital Economics in Singapore, who is forecasting a 4.7% expansion. “It is clear that the recovery in growth we have been forecasting has so far proved elusive."""

Government to sell BPCL in mega push for privatization
The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) cleared one of the government’s largest asset-sale exercises involving five companies, including the privatization of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Shipping Corp. of India (SCI), Mint reported. Other companies in which the government will sell stakes include Container Corp, of India Ltd (Concor), THDC India Ltd (THDC) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco). As part of a consolidation exercise of the state run hydropower firms, the GoI will sell its 74.23% and 100% stake in THDC and Neepco respectively along with management control to state run India’s largest power generation company-NTPC Ltd. In 2014, a concept paper on the possibility of a merger of all state-owned hydroelectric companies recommended a phased approach, starting with North Eastern Electric Power Corp Ltd (Neepco) to be combined with NHPC Ltd, followed by THDC India Ltd and SJVN Ltd. Also, the government will sell its 63.75% and 30.8% stake share in Shipping Corporation of India and Container Corporation of India respectively along with management control to a strategic buyer. In the case of BPCL, the government will sell its 53.29% stake to a strategic buyer, ceding management control, according to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The proposed sale will, however, exclude the strategic Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) in Assam, which will be later sold to another state-run firm, given India’s need to secure fuel supplies for security forces in the north-east.

Cube Highways wins third TOT bundle with  ₹5,011 crore bid
Road developer Cube Highways and Infrastructure Pte Ltd has emerged as the highest bidder in round three of road auctions under the toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, although its price offer was marginally more than the reserve price set by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Mint reported citing two people close to the development. Cube Highways, which is backed by global infrastructure fund I Squared Capital and the International Finance Corp. (IFC), offered  ₹5,011 crore to the government for a 30-year concession period. This is against the initial estimated concession value (IECV), or reserve price, of  ₹4,995.48 crore set by the NHAI for the road bundle. The state-run highway developer had put up nine stretches of roads, totaling 566.27km across Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, in the third round. It had deferred the deadline for bids twice—from mid-September to 31 October—as potential investors sought more time. National Infrastructure and Investment Fund and IRB Infrastructure Developers also bid for the assets, quoting  ₹4,230 crore and  ₹3,510 crore, respectively. Even before the bidding for the third round was completed, the NHAI started the process to invite expressions of interest for the fourth round of TOT auctions, as it seeks to meet divestment targets and raise funds for new projects. The NHAI, which is the nodal agency of the ministry of road transport and highways, has set an initial estimated concession value of  ₹4,170 crore for the fourth bundle. Bidding is expected to close by 14 January.

Varde Partners may invest  ₹ 1,000 crore in Altico Capital
In a day of mixed developments at stressed home financier Altico Capital, one of its three owners— Varde Partners, would lead the equity infusion of up to  ₹1,000 crore, while the company said its chief executive officer is quitting and would cease to be in that role as early as next week, The Economic Times reported. The company is likely to submit a resolution plan at the lenders’ steering committee meeting to be held next week. According to the plan, US-based Varde will repay the lenders in full and seek additional credit lines from them. The financier is also in advanced talks with SBI Capital. Further, the firm may seek another  ₹1,000 crore of new loans from lenders as it will collectively help finish all those stalled builders’ projects. To be sure, one of the existing investors in Altico bonds reportedly sold the debt recently at yields beyond 71%. Separately, Altico told BSE that CEO Sanjeev Agrawal has “tendered his resignation"" and that November 26 will be his last working day as chief executive. Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Clearwater Capital and Varde are the three sponsors of the property-focused financier. The US-based private equity firm owns about 22%, ADIC holds about 33% and the remainder is in the hands of Singapore-based Clearwater Capital. Altico’s credit exposure is yet to turn into a non-performing asset in bank books. The company has about  ₹800 crore of repayment liabilities until December. Its total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.5 crore.
ONGC plans to raise $500 million via dollar bond sale
Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), India’s largest fuel explorer, plans to raise at least $500 million in a dollar bond sale as soon as next week to refinance part of its debt through cheaper funds, The Economic Times reported citing three people familiar with the matter. This is the state-owned company’s first sale of overseas bonds, although its subsidiary ONGC Videsh has raised dollar funds before. ONGC launched a $2 billion medium-term note programme in August, which allows the company to tap the overseas bond market when needed, subject to market conditions. The bonds are likely to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The company’s capital expenditure over the past five years totalled  ₹1,45,915 crore and it plans to invest  ₹32,921 crore in the current financial year. If demand for the bond is strong, the company may choose to retain as much as $1billion, the people said. DBS Bank from Singapore, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Standard Chartered are some of the banks involved in the issue.
SBI raises  ₹ 3,800 crore via perpetual bond sale
State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s biggest mass-lender, has raised  ₹3,800 crore by selling perpetual bonds at 8.50% yield to several institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, The Economic Times reported. The money raised will augment the bank’s Tier I capital ratio, likely easing pressure on the lender to raise cash soon through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). HDFC Mutual Fund is said to have bought a large amount of these bonds that are rated AAA/ Stable by Crisil. Nippon India Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, Edelweiss Mutual Fund and ICICI Primary Dealership were among the buyers. According to Basel III capital norms, the systemically important SBI needs to maintain a capital adequacy of 12.10%, which includes 8.60% of common equity, 1.5% of Tier I bonds like the perpetual debt raised by the bank on Wednesday and 2% of Tier II bonds. Capital adequacy at 13.59% was higher than required as of September. “With this sale, our capital adequacy improves further to 14%, which means we are more than 150 basis points above what is required by April 2020. This is a cost-effective way of raising capital compared to equity. We expect internal accruals to also add to capital; so there is no urgent need to dilute equity as of now,"" the official cited above said. Earlier this year, the bank had mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Capital Markets to raise what was touted to be the largest QIP at about  ₹18,000 crore. However, the bank’s shares have fallen from a peak of  ₹372 apiece in July to  ₹329 on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI :
Crossing toll plazas will no more be the same from December 1 as the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways will make it mandatory for all vehicles to have FASTags affixed on windscreens of all vehicles. Those passing toll plazas without the electronic tags will be charged double the toll fee as all lanes will be converted to FASTag-only lanes from next month.

97,2019-11-24,State Bank,"Compare the rates before you apply for a personal loanAllahabad bank offers the most affordable interest rates at 8.40-12.90% and also charges a processing fee of 1.06% of the loan amount

Personal loans are one of the most expensive categories of loans you can avail of. These are unsecured loans that can be easily availed of and banks are eager to offer them. In fact, you might have received a few calls offering instant personal loan because you have been a loyal customer to your bank. However, if you opt for a personal loan, expect to pay an interest rate of anywhere between 9% and 20% per annum. The reason is simple: an unsecured loan means that the lender will not ask for a collateral. This is only feasible for the lender if they have a sense of what your credit history is like and whether you have the capability to repay the loan. But that isn’t enough of a safety net. Hence the high interest rate.
Given that they are expensive, but easily available, personal loans seem like a good option to fund an emergency expense, if you don’t have a contingency fund in place, or if the fund was depleted for some reason. Of course in the absence of emergency money, falling back on taking a personal loan may seem like a feasible solution if say a family member needs to be hospitalized suddenly. But funding lifestyle expenses using debt is a strict no no.
But that doesn’t stop most from borrowing for all the wrong reasons. According to RBI data, personal loans constituted 96 % of new bank loans taken in financial year 2018, according to RBI data. And according to a report by CASHe, a digital lending company, in 2018, 23% salaried millennials took short-term personal loans to refinance individual EMIs and 14% borrowed to pay off their loans.
While it’s not advisable to take a personal loan unless you have an emergency or immediate requirement for funds that can’t be serviced otherwise, if you do want to opt for one, it’s wise to analyse which bank can offer you the lowest interest rates. Allahabad bank offers the most affordable interest rates at 8.40-12.90% and also charges a processing fee of 1.06% of the loan amount. But even among the top 15 banks we have listed, the highest interest rates goes up to 11.25-13.65% offered by Syndicate Bank, with an additional processing charge of 0.50%. Take a look at the list of personal loans available at the best rates before you make your decision.

96,2019-11-25,State Bank,"In January this year, HPCL signed a debt syndication agreement with a consortium of nine lenders led by SBI for its refinery project in BarmerLenders seek exemption from RBI to relax the large exposure framework requirements for state-run firms

Mumbai: A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulation meant to reduce concentration risk for banks is gradually choking the flow of funds to some large public sector enterprises, especially the oil marketing companies that have substantial debt requirements to meet capital expansion commitments, said two people aware of the development.
Lenders have sought an exemption from the central bank to relax the large exposure framework requirements for public sector companies, said these two people who spoke on condition of anonymity. The RBI is yet to respond to their request, they said.
“There are cases where funds have been sanctioned but the company is unable to draw it because of the regulations. As the exposure limit is based on 20% of a bank’s capital base, a possible solution seems to be for banks to raise more funds or (wait for) the upcoming mergers (of state-run banks to grow their capital base),"" said one of the people mentioned above.
A refinery project of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) in Barmer district of Rajasthan and a few upcoming second-generation (2G) ethanol or bio-refineries are currently incomplete as banks have their hands tied by the new norms.
In January this year, HPCL, a unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), signed a debt syndication agreement with a consortium of nine lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) for its refinery project in Barmer. The total cost of the project is  ₹43,129 crore. HPCL holds a 74% stake in the refinery, while the Rajasthan government owns the rest.
Two-thirds of the project is being funded through loans and the remainder through promoters’ equity. The company has already achieved financial closure by tying up for a  ₹28,753-crore loan from lenders. This project comprises a 9-million tonne a year oil refinery and a 2-million tonne per annum petrochemical unit.
“While the loans have been sanctioned by the banks, HPCL is unable to draw down the funds as lenders are near the end of their exposure limits and do not have further headroom,"" said the second person quoted above. The large exposure framework, effective 1 April 2019, seeks to reduce concentration risk in the banking industry, already saddled with bad loans. It aims to align with the standards on supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of September, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of all banks was more than  ₹9.5 trillion. What has worsened the issue is the merger of ONGC and HPCL last year, resulting in exposures in two separate entities being clubbed as one. Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and HPCL, did not reply to emails sent on Friday.
A senior executive from an oil marketing company said there is liquidity in the system but the companies are unable to tap it because of certain regulations.
All these entities are exceptions and only a few such companies are there with such large requirements and RBI’s objective is to de-risk large exposures of banks, said former RBI deputy governor R. Gandhi. “These entities are to raise capital and debt directly from the market. They have good ratings and can raise funds at competitive terms. Further, the merger of banks into international-size can also help take care of these large requirements. These merged banks will have higher net-worth and, therefore, would be able to sanction larger limits to these entities,"" he said.
Meanwhile, RBI had last October allowed OMCs to raise up to $10 billion through the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route for working capital needs. However, this does not cover loans required for capital expenditure or capex. Companies did not avail much of the ECB facility as lending rates are better domestically, said the OMC executive quoted above.
In a 16 October note, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI said recent stake sales by the government as a part of the disinvestment programme has resulted in some central public sector undertakings (CPSUs) becoming a part of connected counterparties and hence there might be little headroom for bank lending to individual CPSUs.
“In fact, even if such lending were to happen it would result in additional bank capital or higher risk weights resulting in elevated rates,"" said Ghosh. It is, however, pertinent to add that public sector companies are not alone in their struggle for funds. Outstanding bank loans to industries grew by only 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in September to  ₹27.74 trillion. On a year-to-date basis, these loans were 3.8% lower than March 2019. Credit has to flow and move and while there is  ₹2 trillion in the system, banks and the financial sector are sitting on extra credit, said R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer, Larsen and Toubro, at the company’s second-quarter earnings on 23 October. “It is important that they get diverted. NPAs are part and parcel of any credit delivery system but that cannot be allowed to paralyse the flow of money,"" he said."

I am 28 years old. I am an aggressive long-term investor (15-20 years). I have been investing  ₹2,500 each via systematic investment plans (SIPs) in SBI Blue Chip fund, L&T Emerging Businesses fund, HDFC Small Cap fund, Motilal Oswal Multi Cap 35 fund and ABSL Pure Value fund for the last one year. I finalized these funds based on my own research. All funds are direct growth plans. Please review these funds and let me know if my selection is okay.
—Rajagopalan
If you invest  ₹12,500 a month for 20 years, you can expect to have more than  ₹1.2 crore in your portfolio by the end of your tenure (assuming 12% CAGR portfolio returns over the period). You have an aggressive, all-equity portfolio with one large-cap fund, one value-oriented diversified fund, one multi-cap fund, and two small- and mid-cap funds. The fund choices are a mixed bag in terms of quality and track record. I would recommend a shuffle of funds in this manner—you can replace the L&T fund with the L&T Midcap fund from the same fund house. Instead of SBI Bluechip fund and HDFC Small Cap fund, you can go with HDFC Top 100 fund and SBI Small Cap fund respectively. The ABSL fund can be replaced with a multi-cap fund from the same fund house—the ABSL Equity fund. Once you do these changes, you will have a similarly aggressive portfolio as you do presently, but in a set of funds that have had better track records of performance and consistency.
I started investing in Reliance ELSS (equity-linked savings scheme) in 2016. It has run into loss throughout this three-year period and now has been taken over by Nippon Insurance. Should I continue investing in this mutual fund or consider shifting to another ELSS? If yes, which fund should I choose?
—Deblina Kar
It is time to switch out of this fund and move to a better fund for your tax-saving needs. This fund ranks near last in its category in terms of returns over one-, three-, and five-year terms, as of current date. In the period that you mention, while the funds in this category on average returned 11.31% (in three years, annualized), this fund returned 3.96% annualized.
You should move your investment out of this scheme as and when the lock-in period expires and invest in funds from the Mint50 list of schemes. As for your future tax-saving requirements, you can consider Invesco India Tax Plan or Aditya Birla Sun life Tax Relief 96.

SBI refuses to fund Patanjali’s Ruchi Soya buyout on its own
Pantajali Ayurved’s attempt to buy out edible oil maker Ruchi Soya under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) for  ₹4,350 crore has ran into a road block as the State Bank of India (SBI) has refused to fund the transaction on its own and demanded that other lenders who also benefit from the deal chip in, too, The Economic Times reported. As much as  ₹3,700 crore of the acquisition cost was supposed to have been funded by bank loans with Patanjali infusing  ₹600 crore from its own internal accruals, according to the resolution plan submitted by the company in August. Bankers were hoping that SBI, which had the maximum exposure of  ₹1,800 crore and hence would benefit the most by the adoption of the resolution plan, would take a disproportionate share and help the deal go through. Now there are doubts being raised on the deal. Patanjali had mostly approached public sector banks for the funding. However, bankers are wary of giving more loans. “SBI cannot force any lender to give loans for this deal. This is a purely a commercial decision and each lender will have to take a call. Gone are the days when all banks use to follow the lead lender and give loans in a consortium. Now everyone takes their own call. Patanjali had to tie up the funding while submitting the bid which they have not done. If this does not work out banks will have to think about invoking the guarantee given by the company,"" said a public sector banker. Bankers are also wary of funding the home-grown consumer goods company after rating downgrades by rating agencies Care and ICRA in October."
86,2019-11-29,State Bank,"Banks also send an SMS alert to account holder when cheques are received in clearingA bank official said that cheques amounting to  ₹25,000 and more are examined under ultraviolet lamp

NEW DELHI :
India's premier medical institute AIIMS fell prey to a banking fraud as over  ₹12 crore has been stolen from its two bank accounts with the State Bank of India by allegedly using ""cloned cheques"" over the past one month, official sources said.
The money has been siphoned off from the bank accounts the AIIMS has with the State Bank of India (SBI) from its non-home branches in other cities, the sources told PTI.
Even after the fraud came to light, attempts were made to illegally withdraw over  ₹29 crore allegedly using cloned cheques from SBI's non-home branches located in Dehradun and Mumbai in the last one week.
However, the attempts were foiled.
The hospital administration has already approached the Economic Offences Wing of Delhi Police seeking an investigation into the scam.
According to an official, fraud cheque leaves presented at SBI's branches passed UV ray tests, and in most of the cases, the original cheque leaves with same series were still in the possession of the institute, the AIIMS said in a report to the health ministry.
It said the SBI has failed to follow verification protocol while clearing cheques at non-home branches and asked the bank to deposit the stolen amount.
The sources said the fraudsters attempted to withdraw over  ₹20 crore from a non-home branch of SBI in Dehradun while  ₹9 crore was attempted to be stolen from a branch of the bank in Mumbai.
""Prima facie there is no evidence suggesting direct role or complicity of AIIMS officials as the signatures of authorised signatories also seem to be forged.
""The payments released or stopped can straight away be attributed to failure of control mechanism in SBI bank and its branches. Hence, the loss doesn't pertain to AIIMS,"" the AIIMS said in its report.
The sources said over  ₹7 crore was fraudulently withdrawn from the institute's main account with the SBI which is operated by the AIIMS Director. Another amount of  ₹5 crore was taken out from another account held by the Dean, Research of AIIMS.
After the fraud came to light, the SBI has alerted all its branches and has advised its employees against paying high value cheques issued by AIIMS, New Delhi.
""Branches not to pay high value cheques issued by AIIMS, New Delhi, A/c No. 10874584010 maintained with AIIMS New Delhi Branch (01536).
""Huge number of cloned cheques paid across the country -- AGM, Fraud Monitoring Cell,"" read a message circulating in the internal whatsapp group of the SBI's staff.
Further, the bank has sent an alert message which is popping up as soon as employees working in the transaction department open their systems.
As per instructions of the bank, if a cheque worth over  ₹2 Lakh is presented at any non-home branch, then it has to contact the customer to get a confirmation before clearing the cheque or even transferring money, said an SBI official.
Additionally, the non-home branches are required to contact the home branch to confirm the details of the account holder in case of high-value cheques.
Banks also send an SMS alert to account holder when cheques are received in clearing.
A bank official said that cheques amounting to  ₹25,000 and more are examined under ultraviolet lamp.
Also, as per the instructions of the Reserve Bank of India, if a bank fraud of beyond  ₹3 crore is reported then the bank registers a complaint with the CBI.
It is not immediately known whether the SBI has approached the CBI in the current case."

New Delhi: Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved on Friday said it has already tied up loan worth  ₹3,200 crore from a consortium of lenders led by State Bank of India to fund its acquisition of Ruchi Soya through insolvency process.
In September, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the resolution plan of Patanjali Ayurved to acquire debt-laden Ruchi Soya.
""The company has already secured required total debt from a consortium of banks led by State Bank of India,"" Patanjali Ayurved Managing Director Acharya Balkrishna said in a statement.
Patanjali also said it has got loans of  ₹1,200 crore from SBI,  ₹700 crore from Punjab National Bank,  ₹600 crore from Union Bank of India,  ₹400 crore from Syndicate Bank and  ₹300 crore from Allahabad Bank.
Ruchi Soya went into the insolvency in December 2017.
NCLT had admitted the insolvency plea filed by two lead financial creditors Standard Chartered Bank and DBS Bank. However, later, Singapore-based DBS Bank became dissenting creditor and approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal challenging the distribution of proceeds from the bid submitted by Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurveda.
Ruchi Soya told the NCLT that resolution applicant Patanjali group will infuse  ₹204.75 crore as equity and  ₹3,233.36 crore as debt.
The amounts will be infused into a special purpose vehicle (SPV), Patanjali Consortium Adhigrahan Pvt Ltd, which will be later amalgamated with Ruchi Soya.
Another  ₹900 crore will be infused by the Patanjali group through subscription of non-convertible debentures and preference shares in the SPV. It will also provide a credit guarantee of nearly  ₹12 crore.
On April 30 this year, a committee of creditors had approved Patanjali group's  ₹4,350 crore resolution plan to take over Ruchi Soya. Lenders will have to take a haircut of around 60 per cent.

SBI Mutual Fund has written down its exposure to Reliance Home Finance to zero, prompting steep cuts in several close ended hybrid schemes of SBI Mutual Fund. The fund house had earlier on 28th June 2019, written down its exposure to Reliance Home Finance by 75% and its current write down wipes out the balance 25% value of this debt. SBI Mutual Fund had an exposure of around  ₹800 crore to the company of which the remaining  ₹200 crore was written off.
In public statement, SBI Mutual Fund notes that Reliance Home Finance continued to default on its payment obligations and no resolution has been finalised under an Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) framework. The fund house called a meeting of debenture holders on 14th November and the secured NCD holders passed a resolution on 19th November calling an ‘Event of Default.’ Following this, IDBI Debenture Trustee called for an acceleration of dues giving the issuer 7 days to make payment which expired on 26th November.

81,2019-12-01,State Bank,"According to Moody’s, power demand grew 1.5% till October, compared to an average growth of 4.9% in the past five yearsImplementation of the payment security mechanism may have temporarily thwarted electricity purchases by power distributors

Mumbai: Is the pace of 4.5%, the slowest in six years, the lowest point of India’s gross domestic product growth?
While there is no easy answer to that question, the dimming lights in the power generation space portend a worsening economic outlook. After all, part of the economy is powered by how much electricity its factories, farms and households consume.
Electricity generation, tracked by many to gauge the momentum in the economy, saw its biggest fall in more than five years in October.
To be sure, the government and many on the Street see the 12.9% drop in October power generation as an aberration, attributing it to a combination of high base, an extended monsoon and a economic slowdown. Even then, there is no denying the fact that electricity generation so far this fiscal is the slowest in at least a decade. Importantly, the deceleration in power generation has intensified in recent months. Data for November is not available. But daily generation data till 25 November shows a 6% decline.
“If manufacturing slows, then the (power) usage also falls. This is reflected in weak IIP (index of industrial production) data,"" said D.K. Joshi, chief economist at Crisil Ltd.
“The economy has witnessed a significant loss of momentum—from 8.13% (GDP growth) in Q4FY18 to 4.5% in Q2FY20, clearly establishing the fact that this is a cyclical slowdown and the cycle is yet to bottom out,"" Gaurav Kapur, chief economist at IndusInd Bank, said in a 29 November report.
The demand-side story is even more worrying. According to Moody’s Investors Service, power demand grew 1.5% till October, compared to an average growth of 4.9% in the past five years. “For the past 10 years, the ratio of power demand growth to real GDP has been around 0.8. This implies that the sharp decline in power demand is symptomatic of a slowing economy,"" Moody’s said on 18 November.
About 40% of the electricity produced in India is consumed by the industrial and commercial sector. Around one-fourth is used by households and a fifth by the agriculture sector. The quantum of fall in power usage by the industrial sector is difficult to calculate because of lack of data.
Implementation of the payment security mechanism may have temporarily thwarted electricity purchases by power distributors. Even then, analysts say power demand cannot be pulled down only by the farm and household sectors.
Electricity usage dropped in all but three states in October, shows data collated by Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd. This is the largest across-the-board fall in the last decade, points out SBICAP Securities Ltd in a separate note, referring to the reduction in energy demand.
Consumption in the most industrialized states—Gujarat and Maharashtra—dropped 18% and 21%, respectively. This fiscal through October, usage in these states was down 3-5%. “This reflects the slowdown in the manufacturing activity, increased penetration of renewable energy sources and demand-side measures on energy efficiency,"" said Deepak Agrawala, president of investment banking at Elara Capital.
Other indicators such as freight traffic at Indian Railways show a slowdown in October. They are down 8% vis-à-vis a 6% fall in September. Volumes on the Indian Energy Exchange remained sluggish despite tariffs falling to a two-year low in October. “Decline in diesel consumption also points to weak economic activity,"" said Teresa John, an economist at Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities.
Analysts fear the readings for October may deteriorate. “Power generation fell an unprecedented 12% in October and remains weak so far in November too, likely suggesting manufacturing (IIP) may fare even worse than it did in September,"" Jefferies India said in a 14 November note.
The impact of a continued slowdown in electricity demand from industrial and manufacturing sector will be first felt by power distribution companies (discoms). Industry and commercial consumers pay higher tariffs helping discoms recoup part of their losses from selling power at below the cost for households and agriculture sector. A sustained fall in power offtake from the industrial sector will impact the cash flows of discoms, which in turn can curtail electricity purchases.
Thermal power generators are already feeling the heat. Utilization levels dropped below 50% in October. Thermal power plant utilization levels at India’s largest power producer, NTPC Ltd, dropped to a 13-year low in October, points out Elara Capital.
The situation is no better at private utilities. Generation volume dropped at CESC Ltd, JSW Energy Ltd, Reliance Power Ltd and Adani Power Ltd. This comes on the back of reduced power offtake that many of these companies saw in the September quarter.
The economy is low on power and the worry is things could get worse."
84,2019-12-01,State Bank,"India’s first initial public offering of SBI Cards and Payment Services is either an opportunity with boundless prospects — or a victim of arrested development. Which is it?

For every 100 people in India, there are only three credit cards. A comparable penetration figure for the US is 320.
Statistics like these suggest that India’s first initial public offering of a credit card issuer is either an opportunity with boundless prospects — or a victim of arrested development. Which is it?
The upcoming sale of shares in SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd. will give investors a chance to find out. Between them, the controlling shareholder, State Bank of India (SBI), and its 26% partner, Carlyle Group, plan to sell up to 130.5 million shares. Throw in a simultaneous offer of new shares, and it could be a  ₹9600 crore ($1.3 billion) IPO, India’s biggest in the current financial year, according to local media reports.
Business is booming at the country’s second-largest card issuer. After Carlyle arrived in 2017 to replace GE Capital in the two-decade-old venture, earnings were  ₹7.4 a share in the year through March 2018. The most recent six-monthly profit topped that figure. Younger millennials and Generation Z — those born after 2000 — are driving this growth. In India’s fiscal year ended in March 2016, barely 2% of credit card transactions were originated by people below 25 years of age. That number has jumped to 10%. Add the 26-30 age group, and the youth share of plastic is 35%, beating people over 40 by as much as eight percentage points.
Yet only about 5% of Indians’ consumption per capita takes place through credit cards. After growing 12% annually over four years, average spending per card is stalling. While a slowdown is only to be expected given a sharp decline in economic momentum, the reason has more to do with the merchant than the spender.
E-commerce, which is increasingly the most obvious use of a credit card, will account for barely 7% of India’s $1.2 trillion-a-year retail industry by 2021, according to Deloitte Consulting. Another 18% will go to malls, department stores and other forms of organized retail. But three-quarters of the market will remain with mom-and-pop stores. An average shop can hope to receive $775 in monthly business from cardholders. Card issuers would garner revenue of $11 of that, but the bank that acquired the merchant and fitted it up would receive just $1.50 a month. It’s simply not worth anyone’s while to expand the business into smaller towns dominated by small shops.
Increasingly ubiquitous smartphones are far more suitable for payment authentication in a low-middle-income country than credit cards. Google Pay and Walmart’s PhonePe are leading people-to-people mobile payments in India, using the so-called unified payments interface, a system linking India’s banks. The same system will also drive people-to-merchant payments. Credit will just be an added layer. Banks will compete for whoever can bring them a lot of customers.
India’s richest man, Mukesh Ambani, has 355 million customers for his 4G mobile network, Jio. Unsurprisingly, the oil-to-telecom tycoon wants to connect 30 million small retailers with common inventory-management, billing and tax platforms as well as low-cost payment terminals. He won’t be alone. Even in Indian e-commerce, Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart Online Services Pvt is promoting “cardless"" credit, where the financing comes from banks and nonbank lenders. During the recent local holiday sale season, three out of four Amazon.com Inc. customers who availed themselves of credit to make purchases came from Tier 2 and 3 cities, where card penetration is low; every second buyer who borrowed to buy something did so for the first time.
The parent State Bank’s opportunity in unsecured retail loans will be far larger than that of its IPO-bound cards unit. India’s largest commercial bank will make its low-cost deposits available to Ambani, Walmart and other digital commerce hopefuls who might be looking to sweeten their proposition to customers with a dollop of credit. That should still leave plenty of headroom for SBI Cards to grow. Its 18% market share means the company will remain a sought-after choice for co-branded partnerships, such as with Indian Railways and ride-hailing app Ola.
Carlyle’s partial exit would value the US buyout firm’s 26% stake at about seven times what it paid in 2017, according to Reuters. That’s a neat pile to make from plastic in such a short time, and in a country where it hasn’t really taken off. IPO investors will be content with a lot less."

MUMBAI :
Washington-based private equity (PE) firm Carlyle Group’s partial stake sale in SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, the credit card unit of the country’s largest lender, is set to become the largest-ever exit of a PE firm through an initial public offering (IPO) in India,two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
SBI Cards filed draft papers for its IPO on 27 November. The IPO, which is expected to be around Rs9,600 crore in size, according to one of the people, will see both State Bank of India, the parent entity, and Carlyle, which holds 26% in the unit, pare their stakes by 4% and 10% respectively.
SBI holds 74% stake in SBI Cards, while Carlyle owns the rest 26% through its subsidiary CA Rover Holdings.
At an expected enterprise valuation of up to  ₹65,000 crore, the second person said, Carlyle’s stake sale could be worth  ₹6,500 crore—the largest-ever made by a PE firm through a public listing in India.
The previous major IPO exits witnessed in the Indian primary markets include Tata Opportunities Fund’s  ₹1,636 crore exit from Varroc Engineering Ltd, Chrys Capital’s  ₹1,347 crore exit from Eris Lifesciences Ltd, Actis’s  ₹910 crore exit from Endurance Technologies Ltd and International Finance Corporation’s  ₹810 crore exit from Bandhan Bank Ltd.
The size of the proposed Carlyle stake sale shows that public market investors are increasingly keen to lap up shares of companies backed by PE firms.
“Having private equity backing helps companies to hit public markets at a larger scale and at a later stage of their growth cycle, as compared to what used to happen earlier when most of them would raise primary capital to fund their growth. Now, PE investors come in at the growth stage of the company, scale up the business, put processes in place and make them ready for IPO, which also in a way suits public market investors as they can put their money into more stable businesses,"" said Subhrajit Roy, executive director and head, equity capital market origination at Kotak Investment Banking.
Despite a slow year for listings due to volatile markets, IPOs of most PE-backed firms have performed better than their peers. This year, three PE-backed firms— Kedaara Capital-backed Spandana Sphoorty Financial Ltd, Quona Capital-backed IndiaMART InterMESH Ltd and another Carlyle-backed firm Metropolis Healthcare Ltd, went public amid difficult primary markets.
“In today’s environment where corporate governance and the quality of companies is of utmost importance to investors, a company which has private equity backing also adds that much more credibility to the business,"" said Satyen Shah, head of investment banking at Edelweiss Financial Services.
“We believe that this year primary markets have seen fewer issuances but almost all the IPOs that have hit the market have done very well, as evident from the strong interest they have generated from investors across categories. They have also provided very good returns to investors, which is a very positive sign,"" he added.
While this year, PE investors sold shares worth  ₹803 crore in three firms through IPOs, between 2014-2018, 47 such companies launched IPOs, offering exits worth  ₹20,133 crore to their PE investors, according to data from primary market tracker Prime Database.
Of the total PE exits made so far via IPOs, the period between 2015-2017 saw nearly 80% of the total exits worth  ₹16,816 crore.
“Today, IPO investors want more liquidity, more float, hence the IPO sizes are also higher. Therefore, companies that tap the markets now will have to be of a certain scale and size to attract higher valuations, which is why having a PE investor in the interim period makes so much sense. In my view, this trend will get more dominant going forward as investors keep pushing for more liquidity, more distributed book, larger market cap and a larger float in IPO-bound companies that go for an IPO,"" said Roy."

Arcelor, Thriveni in bidding war for pipeline integral to Essar Steel
ArcelorMittal is facing stiff competition in its bid for Odisha Slurry Pipeline Infrastructure Ltd (OSPIL), an insolvent company whose single asset could cut the cost of production at Essar Steel by a fifth, Mint reported. Thriveni Earthmovers Pvt. Ltd, one of the country’s largest iron ore mine developers and operators, has offered to pay back creditors in full —principal and interest— but over a five-year period. ArcelorMittal has made an upfront cash offer of  ₹2,200 crore for OSPIL, while Thriveni has placed a bid of  ₹3,300 crore, with  ₹8 crore of upfront cash and the rest in staggered payments, Mint reported citing two people aware of the bid details. The bids were submitted on Saturday. OSPIL has  ₹2,352 crore of principal outstanding to various classes of creditors. With accumulated interest, the outstanding liabilities are  ₹3,300 crore. OSPIL owns and operates a 253-km pipeline that connects iron ore mines in Dabuna, Odisha, to a pelletisation plant in Paradip. Essar Steel, which had commissioned the pipeline, sourced about half of its iron ore needs for its plant in Hazira, Gujarat, from Dabuna. The Paradip pellet plant converted the iron ore fines brought by the pipeline to pellets, which were then shipped to the Essar-operated port terminal in Hazira, adjacent to the steel mill. At the time of commissioning, Essar Steel said the pipeline cut its iron ore transportation cost by  ₹1,200 a tonne, as opposed to using road or rail, and significantly reduced the cost of production per tonne of steel. For ArcelorMittal, the new owner of the Essar Steel, the pipeline is critical for the plant’s production and efficiency in a price-sensitive steel market.

77,2019-12-03,State Bank,"The takeaway here is that no debt is too small and you could be facing criminal charges against you if you fail to repay the debtA case under the Negotiable Instruments Act is filed when your credit card bill payment cheque bounces

Data from the recently released SBI Cards IPO prospectus reveals that the company has filed 19,201 cases under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act and 14,174 cases under Section 25 of the Payment and Settlement Act 2007. A case under Section 138, is typically filed when a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficiency of funds (colloquially known as cheque bouncing). A case under the Payment and Settlement Act is filed when there is a failure in electronic payments due to insufficiency of account balance (think auto debit for bill payment). Interestingly the cumulative amounts for these cases was just  ₹25.52 crores and 72.6 crores respectively. This implies an average case of just  ₹13,290 and  ₹51,220 in credit card debt under the two acts respectively. For you the takeaway here is that no debt is too small and you could be facing criminal charges against you if you fail to repay the debt.
A footnote to the IPO prospectus details the collection procedure followed by SBI Cards. “SBI Cards may block the customer’s account, in the event payment is not received within stipulated payment due date, as communicated through statements and SMS,"" it says. “The account block, in such cases, may be temporary or permanent depending on delinquency stage, default potential, payment history,"" the note adds.
After roughly 6 months, your credit card account is moved to a recovery pool. “Accounts charged off post 191 days from payment due date are classified as recovery pool / post charge-off bucket,"" says the note. In such circumstances, it mentions the battery of legal tools used by the credit card company. As per the footnote the company has resorted to alternate dispute resolution channels like arbitration, conciliation, bilingual legal notice, privilege police complaint and lok adalat depending upon risk profile. It has also used quasi-legal, legal action under Sec 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act. Both the sections quoted above provide for a jail term up to two years and a fine for up to twice the amount dishonoured.
A case under the Negotiable Instruments Act is filed when your credit card bill payment cheque bounces while a case under the Payment and Settlement Act is filed when an electronic transfer (such as an autodebit) bounces due to insufficient funds. In both situations, the credit card company has to send you a notice asking for payment within 30 days of the cheque bouncing/auto debit failure. If you fail to make the payment within 15 days of this notice, a case under these sections can be filed.
You should also note that a credit card default can move you into a blacklist with credit rating agencies like CIBIL. This will make it harder to get future loans or credit cards even if you subsequently pay off your debt. According to the prospectus, there are around 3.6 crore credit cards in force in India and SBI cards which has issued 83 lakh credit cards commands a roughly 23% market share."
76,2019-12-03,State Bank,"SBI Cards IPO is set to be India's biggest this financial yearIn its draft prospectus filed with Sebi, the company expects credit card volumes to grow at a CAGR of 25%

New Delhi: SBI cards, the credit card arm of India’s largest public sector lender State Bank of India, expects credit card industry spends to grow 2.5 times in the next five years.
SBI Cards initial public offer (IPO), which aims to raise around  ₹9,600 crore and is awaiting regulatory approval, is set to be India's biggest this financial year.
With a market share of 18%, SBI Cards is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country with 9.46 million credit cards as on 30 September.
In its draft prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the company expects credit card volumes to grow at a CAGR of 25%. “The number of credit cards issued stands at 47.0 million in FY19, having grown at a CAGR of 20.0% over the last five years, and is expected to grow by 25.0% from FY19 to FY20,"" said the draft document.
While the draft prospectus forecasts a robust growth for card volumes, the annual average spends per card is expected to grow just 1% year-on-year in FY20 compared with a healthy 12% growth during FY14-19.
Here are the key growth factors that could be driving the credit card industry in the next 5 years:
The millennial factor: The proportion of credit card originations among millennials (persons below 30 years of age) has increased over the last four years to 35.0% in FY19 from 19.0% in FY15, while the share of customers below 25 years of age has increased ten-fold in the same period.
The EMI factor: The EMI financing option is one of the major forces driving credit card growth. Credit card dues accrue when customers prefer to reduce their lumpsum payments by converting it to EMI, whereby they pay the minimum amount due and roll-over or revolve their payment or take loans on their credit card. The increasing focus of banks on retail loans amidst a muted environment for corporate loans has led to higher growth in unsecured retail loans, including credit cards. According to CRISIL Research, credit card dues are anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 23.0% to reach  ₹3,313.0 billion by FY24.
The tech factor: Faster adaptability of technology by a younger generation and a change in consumer mindset has boosted credit cards penetration. The last five years have witnessed increasing acceptance of digital payments by Indian consumers and the rise of e-commerce businesses, which gave a huge impetus to credit card usage. On the supply side, banks’ focus on cross-selling to their existing customers in the form of pre-approved offers has driven growth. The increased use of cards for purposes such as travel, shopping, lifestyle purchases, entertainment, healthcare, utility bill payments, etc., have increased the spend per card.
Payments infra: Payment infrastructure includes POS terminals and payment gateways which facilitate online payments. The number of POS terminals has grown at a CAGR of 29.0% from fiscal 2015 to reach 3.7 million terminals in FY19.
The retail factor: Organized retail penetration has nearly doubled to 10.6% in FY19 from 5.6% in FY09 on the back of a supportive macro-environment, a rise in discretionary spending, higher product penetration, a rise in e-commerce and favorable regulations. According to CRISIL Research, organized retail penetration is expected to grow to approximately 15.0% in FY24."
75,2019-12-03,State Bank,"E-wallets like Paytm, Mobikwik, gained popularity post demonetisation in November 2016As more cards have been issued, there has been a growth in the acceptance infrastructure as well.

Digital payments in India are likely to witness robust growth over the next 5 years at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 52%, according to the draft red herring prospectus of SBI Card. From FY14 to FY19 digital payments transactions, in terms of volume, grew at a 49% CAGR.
According to CRISIL Research, digital payments in India, in terms of value, is expected to more than double to  ₹4,055.0 trillion in FY24 from Rs. 1,630.0 trillion in FY19, translating into a five-year CAGR of 20%. Here’s a look at the key factors that are driving India’s digital growth story:
Government initiatives:Regulatory initiatives including financial inclusion, Aadhaar, and the unveiling of the Unified Payments Interface have spurred growth digital payments. Introduced in 2016, UPI has been a crucial contributor to the Indian digital payments market. UPI facilitates instant fund transfer between two bank accounts on a mobile platform, without requiring any detail of the beneficiary’s bank account. UPI transactions, in value terms, crossed  ₹5 billion, while Aadhaar-enabled payments system (AEPS) recorded over  ₹250 million worth of transactions in FY19.
E-wallets: E-wallets like Paytm, Mobikwik, gained popularity post demonetisation in November 2016. Digital prepaid wallet operators have gained widespread traction in recent times and have been able to build a substantial consumer base. Starting with basic services like online recharge and bill payments, these firms provide convenience to its customers. With rapid development of multiple use cases for merchants and customers, e-wallet firms have targeted varying customer profiles. Mobile wallet transactions crossed  ₹18,39,020 million mark in FY19.
Point of Sale (POS) penetration: As more cards have been issued, there has been a growth in the acceptance infrastructure as well. While the POS infrastructure in India has more than doubled over the past five years to 3.7 million in fiscal 2019 from 1.1 million in fiscal 2014, it remains weak in terms of availability. According to a report by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), acceptance infrastructure, particularly POS terminals, as a percentage of the total number of debit and credit cards is low. Hence there is a need to increase the penetration of acceptance infrastructure in the country. RBI also expects to have 5.0 million active POS by the end of 2021.
Credit cards: The number of credit cards issued stood at 47.0 million in FY19, having grown at a CAGR of 20% over the last five years, and is expected to grow by 25% year-on-year in FY20, SBI Cards said in the draft IPO document. While the draft prospectus forecasts a robust growth for card volumes, the annual average spends per card is expected to grow just 1% year-on-year in FY20 compared with a healthy 12% growth during FY14-19."

73,2019-12-04,State Bank,"How can we expect people to follow the transition to a new economy, while political parties continue to accept cash donations?

Amid the raging debate on electoral bonds in India, it is important to understand why did the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduce the process of using electoral bonds for political funding.
Electoral bonds were introduced to stop cash funding of political parties because most political parties were taking large donations in the form of cash. What was even more surprising that some political parties were using the method to get almost 100% political funding in cash, which was then deposited in bank accounts in denominations of less than  ₹20,000.
At a time when the whole nation was making a transition to a cashless or a less-cash economy, how can we expect people to follow the transition to a new economy, while political parties continue to accept cash donations?
While introducing electoral bonds, the individual donations or cash donation to any political parties have been reduced from  ₹20,000 to  ₹2,000, in a way making it difficult for political parties to receive cash funding.
Electoral bonds are a transparent and a legal instrument, wherein a donor has to purchase these electoral bonds from select branches of the State Bank of India (SBI) through a KYC bank account for electoral bonds. This system has ensured that cash cannot be used to purchase electoral bonds and cash cannot be donated to political parties in higher amount. The question being raised is that electoral bonds are anonymous, but the real purpose of these electoral bonds is to ensure clean money and tax paid money comes into political parties and not some slush funds or corrupt money.
Corporates in the country have generally been averse to funding political parties in a manner that reveals their identity. This is a behavioural problem of India’s corporate, and political parties cannot really change it.
Ideally, we should have had a system where every donation is identified to a donor, but when donors are not prepared to reveal their identities, how does one get over the problem? One possibility is that if political parties want money to carry on their day-to-day activities and contest elections, moving towards state funding of political parties and elections is also a possibility. Money has to come from donors if not state funding. The question is should public money be given to political parties? Public approval will be needed for such a move. Electoral bonds are certainly a solution that helps us to overcome the challenges of preventing corrupt black money getting into the system and, second, overcoming corporate inhibitions to offer transparent donations disclosing their identity. Bulk of the electoral bonds have gone to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the past 1-2 years because most of the support is for the BJP. The party, along with its allies, has 70-75% seats in the Lok Sabha, so obviously, the party will get greater share of the funds.

68,2019-12-05,State Bank,"The SBI Cards IPO could raise as much as  ₹9,600 crore through the issueIndia’s favourable demographics — large young population — is another crucial factor that the company is banking upon

SBI Cards, the credit card arm of India’s largest public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI), last week filed its draft red herring prospectus for an initial public offering. The IPO could raise as much as  ₹9,600 crore through the issue. Ahead of its IPO, Mint looks at the key factors that India’s second largest credit card issuer is banking on to ride the equity markets.
What is SBI Cards banking upon for its IPO?
The initial public offering (IPO) of SBI Cards comes at a time when there has been a massive spurt in digital payment transactions, fuelled by massive innovation and offerings by financial institutions. Considering that India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world, its second largest credit issuer is banking upon rise in personal consumption that includes splurging on luxury goods, spending more on dining, entertainment, vacations and less on basic needs of house, food and education. Rapid urbanization is expected to improve infrastructure, create jobs, which in turn will propel savings. Besides, India’s favourable demographics — large young population — is another crucial factor that the company is banking upon.
What is behind the rise in digital payments in India?
Steps taken by the government and the banking regulator, especially in the last three years to launch innovative payment options, shift in consumer preferences have boosted online payments. The Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM) trinity, demonetization of high value currency in November 2016, rollout of Goods and Services Tax (GST) and the launch of real-time payments system Unified Payments Interface (UPI) have been key drivers of rapid growth in digital payments space. Besides, rise in internet usage, increase in smartphone penetration, affordable data, presence of large number of payment apps, a booming e-commerce sector and simple, hassle-free online payments have also contributed to the rise in digital payments, including credit cards.
Who are the biggest spenders?
Ability to quickly adopt technology and increasing indebtedness has made credit card more popular among millennials. The proportion of credit card users among millennials — below 30 years of age — has almost doubled to 35% in 2018-2019 from 19% in 2014-2015. The share of customers below 25 years witnessed a ten-times jump in that period. They are seen driving, what CRISIL Research expects to be approximately  ₹14.4 trillion in size by fiscal 2024, the boom in India’s unsecured loan, that credit cards are part of.
What will drive growth of credit card industry?
A young population armed with discretionary and higher spending power, card issuance in smaller cities, tapping new-to-credit customers and strong investments in payment infrastructure will all aid the credit card penetration. Shift in consumer behavior toward digital payment systems and formalization of the economy will also held the growth of credit cards. Interest-free-EMI and its international exposure makes it a popular choice for online transactions and advantage over UPI and e-wallets. Creation of requisite infrastructure such as availability of more point of sale (PoS) machine is a crucial driver for its growth.
How have credit cards, digital payments fuelled e-commerce services?
The rapid growth in the e-commerce industry has given opportunities to several payments companies. In the payments space, banks, financial technology companies, technology startups as well as major technology giants such as Amazon, Google and Apple compete with each other to be part of the most popular payment option. Credit card companies offer cash backs, reward points, discounts to customers based on a customer’s spending, which make it a popular and a convenient choice for users. Many players are now also increasingly partnering with others to offer co-branded credit cards to attract more customers. In 2018-19, credit cards accounted for 30%-35.0% of overall e-commerce payment value."
67,2019-12-05,State Bank,"In an unexpected move, the MPC on Thursday kept interest rates unchangedKumar’s remarks on policy decisions working with a lag echo comments made by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das earlier

NEW DELHI :
The decision by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to keep policy rates unchanged is the “most appropriate"" as such policy actions work with a lag, State Bank of India Chairman Rajnish Kumar said, terming the central bank’s move an “unanticipated policy surprise"".
In an unexpected move, the MPC on Thursday kept interest rates unchanged, as it decided to take a pause given the “evolving growth-inflation dynamics"", after five consecutive rate cuts in 2019.
The repo rate—the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI—remains unchanged at 5.15%. This is contrary to the result of a Mint survey, wherein eight of 10 bankers and economists expected a 25 basis points cut. The six members of the MPC unanimously voted to hold rates in the December policy.
Kumar’s remarks on policy decisions working with a lag echo comments made by RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das earlier today. Das said past policy actions need time to play out and yield results.
The MPC also sharply reduced its growth forecast for 2019-20 to 5% from 6.1%, with the committee noting that a delay in revival of domestic demand, further slowdown in global economic activity and geo-political tensions could pose downside risks to growth.
India’s economy grew at 4.5% in July-September, the weakest pace in more than 6 years.
“The lowering of the GDP growth for FY20 and FY21 reflects continued growth conundrums and a slow recovery,"" Kumar said.
Key decisions on interest rates apart, the Reserve Bank said it would amend guidelines for primary (urban) co-operative banks with a view to minimise concentration risk in their exposures and to strengthen the role of such lenders in promoting financial inclusion.
A draft circular proposing the changes for eliciting stakeholder comments will be issued shortly.
“On the development and regulatory front, the steps announced for the primary (urban) co-operative banks will facilitate increased public confidence in these institutions,"" Kumar said.
RBI’s move for primary (urban) co-operative banks comes in the wake of the recent scam at Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd (PMC), where two-third of the bank’s total loan book has an exposure to Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL)."
66,2019-12-05,State Bank,"The Reserve Bank of India said it proposed to introduce a pre-paid instrument with a spending limit of  ₹10,000

India’s digital payments space is booming. On Thursday, the Reserve Bank of India said it proposed to introduce a pre-paid instrument with a spending limit of  ₹10,000. Last week, SBI Cards filed papers for an IPO. Mint looks at what’s driving India’s payments ecosystem.
Why is a credit card firm floating an IPO?
The initial public offering (IPO) of SBI Cards, India’s second largest card issuer, comes amid a massive spurt in digital payment transactions, fuelled by innovative offerings by financial institutions. India’s population is dominated by millennials, who are driving the consumption that companies, such as SBI Cards, Zomato and Uber, and e-tailers bank upon for their revenues. The young may not be buying houses or cars, but they are spending a lot on clothes, movies and small purchases. The promoters of SBI Cards feel this is just the right time to encash on their investments and use the proceeds for other purposes.
What is behind the rise in digital payments?
Steps taken by the Centre and the banking regulator, especially in the last three years, to launch innovative payments options, and a shift in consumer preferences have boosted online payments. The Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile (JAM) trinity, demonetization, the GST roll-out, and the launch of the Unified Payments Interface have been key drivers behind the rapid growth in digital payments. Besides, rise in internet usage, smartphone penetration, affordable data rates, a host of payments apps, booming e-commerce, and hassle-free online payments have also contributed to the rise.
Who are the top users of digital payments?
Increasing indebtedness and the ability to quickly adopt technology has prompted millennials to use credit cards, almost doubling their share from 19% in FY15 to 35% in FY19. The boom in unsecured loans, including digital wallets, according to Crisil Research, is expected to reach  ₹14.4 trillion by FY24, primarily driven by millennials.
What will drive growth of digital payments?
A young population armed with discretionary income, cheaper smartphones and data connectivity, and new-to-credit customers with access to multilingual interfaces on their phones, besides improved online security, will help digital payments. Shift in consumer behaviour towards digital has also been influenced by formalization of the economy. With an institutional push to develop payments infrastructure and setting up of point-of-sale counters, the masses are finding it more attractive.
What’s the impact on e-commerce services?
The rapid growth in e-commerce has led to stiff competition among banks, digital wallets, fintech firms, tech startups, as well as majors, such as Amazon, Google and Apple. Credit card companies offer cashbacks, reward points and discounts to customers based on spending habits, which make it a popular and convenient choice. Many players are now increasingly tying up with consumer brands to offer credit cards to attract more customers. In FY19, credit cards accounted for 30-35% of overall e-commerce payments value."
63,2019-12-06,State Bank,"Sebi directs LIC, SBI and BoB to submit compliance report within one monthSBI on Wedensday said its board has approved diluting up to 8.25% stake in UTI AMC which goes for an IPO

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday said Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC), State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of Baroda (BoB) must reduce their stakes in UTI Asset Management Co. Ltd by December 2020.
If they continue to be in violation of the order after the deadline, Sebi will freeze the lenders’ voting rights. While the three public sector financial institutions hold 18.24% each the firm, Sebi’s cross holding norms for mutual funds says the sponsor of one AMC cannot hold more than 10% in another.
Under Section 7B of the Sebi (Mutual Funds) (Amendment) Regulation, 2018, the market regulator had mandated all mutual funds to comply with the norms by March 2019.
The three entities, who have their own MF businesses—LIC Mutual Fund, SBI Mutual Fund and Bank of Baroda Mutual Fund—are in violation of the Sebi norms with their stakes in UTI AMC.
In their submissions before the Sebi the lenders said the delay in reducing their stakes in UTI AMC was due to the lack of approvals from the government. The lenders also said the divestment of the excess stakes will happen in two phases—a 25% divestment of the stake by all institutional shareholders on pro-rata basis by way of an initial public offering (IPO) and 10.92% divestment in the second phase through a follow-on public offer.
In the first phase the three lenders will offload 8.25%, each, while T Rowe Price and Punjab National Bank will sell their 3% stakes, each. T Rowe Price is a majority shareholder with a 26% stake in UTI AMC, while PNB holds 18.24%.
T Rowe Price, however, had not agreed to the IPO plan, raising concerns in July. Subsequently, meetings of all shareholders were held to reach a consensus and the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management approved the listing plan on 12 September.
“It is noted that despite the expiry of over 20 months from the date of amendment of the Regulations, the noticees (public lenders) are yet to achieve compliance with these requirements. While the noticees have shown that they have initiated some steps to dilute their stake in UTI AMC, the substantial compliance with Regulation 7B still remains pending. Considering the facts and circumstances, I am of the view that a direction granting a reasonable time limit for compliance would be in the interest of all stakeholders,"" said G. Mahalingam, whole time member, Sebi, in his order.
The SBI board on Wednesday approved a proposal to sell an 8.25% stake in UTI AMC.
The public sector lenders will reduce their stakes through UTI’s listing. Citigroup Inc. and ICICI Securities Ltd are the advisers for the planned IPO of UTI AMC, which is expected to mop up over  ₹2,600 crore."

58,2019-12-09,State Bank,"This is the eighth consecutive cut in MCLR by SBI this yearThe new SBI rates come into effect from 10th December

India’s biggest lender State Bank of India or SBI today announced a cut in one-year MCLR rate or marginal cost of funds-based lending rate by 10 bps, effective from December 10th. With this cut, home, car and other retail loans of SBI linked to MCLR will get cheaper. After the latest cut, SBI's one-year MCLR comes down to 7.90% per annum from 8.00% per annum. This is the eighth consecutive cut in MCLR by SBI this fiscal.
SBI said it continues to remain the “cheapest loan provider in the country"" and the latest rate cut is meant to ""pass on the benefit of its reducing cost of funds to the customers.""
SBI says it commands 25% market share each in home loans and auto loans.
MCLR rates are based on the bank's own cost of funds. If your home loan is linked to SBI's MCLR rate, the latest cut may not bring down your EMIs immediately. MCLR-based loans typically have a one-year reset clause.
For new borrowers, SBI also offers a repo-rate linked home loan scheme. Under this scheme, the loan rate gets adjusted as and when Reserve Bank revises its benchmark repo rate.
Earlier this month, the RBI held its repo rate steady at 5.15% but so far this year the central bank has cut the benchmark lending rate by a cumulative 135 basis points.
SBI is the largest commercial bank in terms of assets, deposits, branches, customers and employees. SBI also claims that it is also largest mortgage lender in the country.
As on September 30, 2019, SBI had a deposit base of over  ₹30 lakh crore and advances of nearly Rs. 22.5 lakh crore."
57,2019-12-09,State Bank,"Following the move, the one-year MCLR will come down to 7.90%RBI has lowered its repo rate by 135 bps between February and December

MUMBAI :
India's largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) on Monday said it will reduce its one-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) to 7.9% from 10 December.
This cut, the bank said in a statement, is the eighth consecutive cut in MCLR in FY20.
""To pass on the benefit of its reducing cost of funds to customers, country’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) has announced the reduction in its one-year MCLR by 10 bps,"" said SBI.
While transmission of repo rate cuts into lower lending rates for customers has been a bone of contention between the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and banks, the central bank said last week it is hopeful of quicker transmission in the coming days. According to RBI data, the 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) has declined 49 basis points and the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh rupee loans sanctioned by banks declined by 44 basis points, while the WALR on outstanding rupee loans increased by 2 basis points during this period. RBI has lowered it's repo rate by 135 bps between February and December.
Meanwhile, monetary transmission has been full and reasonably swift across various money market segments and the private corporate bond market. Transmission to various money and corporate debt market segments ranged from 137 bps (overnight call money market) to 218 bps (3-month commercial papers of non-banking finance companies). Transmission to the government securities market has been partial at 113 bps (5-year government securities) and 89 bps (10-year government securities)."

Total enrolment under the government’s flagship pension scheme Atal Pension Yojana (APY) recently crossed the 2-crore mark after 9 lakh subscribers were added to it in November. PFRDA aims to expand the subscribers base under APY to 2.25 crore by March 2020.
“The primary reason for the uptick in enrolment was due to the creation of awareness among target population regarding its three major benefits--a guaranteed pension for the subscriber, same pension to the spouse after death of the subscriber and return of accumulated corpus to the nominee after death of the both subscriber and the spouse,"" according to a government press release.
Enrolment of first 1 crore subscribers took around 3 years while enrolment of next 1 crore enrolment took only one and a half years, indicating the increased pace of APY enrolment, the release said.
Under the scheme, the government covers workers in unorganised sector between the age of 18 and 40. Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) regulates the scheme that provides minimum guaranteed monthly pension of  ₹1,000 to  ₹5,000 from the age of 60.
Until November of this fiscal, more than 46 lakh APY accounts were added, a growth of around 30% compared with the same period last year. Out of the 46 lakh new APY accounts, more than 36 lakh accounts were sourced from public-sector banks, around 7 lakh accounts from regional rural banks and more than 3 lakh accounts from private sector and payment banks, the release said.
So far in the current financial year ending March 2020, India’s largest public-sector lender, State Bank of India (SBI), accounted for more than 13.5 lakh APY accounts followed by Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India. While in terms of average account per branch or AAPB, Indian Bank sourced highest APY accounts followed by SBI and Bank of India.
In the payments bank category, Airtel Payments Bank got more than 2 lakh APY accounts, while Axis Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd were the top contributors among privates sector banks in terms of number of enrolments.
“There is a long way to go as currently there are around 45 crore people in the unorganised sector. However, the target of providing pension coverage to such people can be achieved with the government’s support,"" the release said."
55,2019-12-09,State Bank,"The MCLR of the country's largest bank is now at 7.9%About 20% of the visitors to his website have loans that charge less than 9%, according to Aditya Mishra, founder and CEO, Switchme.in

The State Bank of India (SBI) has reduced its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps). One bps is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The MCLR of the country's largest bank is now at 7.9%. The revision makes some of the old home loans linked to MCLR cheaper or on a par with what SBI is offering to its new customers.
From October this year, all new retail loans are linked to an external benchmark; SBI uses repo rate as its external benchmark. Under the new external benchmark regime, SBI offers home loans up to  ₹30 lakh at an interest rate of 8.2%, loans between  ₹30 lakh and  ₹75 lakh at 8.45%, and those above  ₹75 lakh at 8.55%.
Earlier in calendar year 2019, SBI's home loans were 10-60 bps above MCLR for different loan amounts, according to data on SBI's website. The interest rates on home loans for some of those who borrowed early in 2019 would be on a par or lower than the existing rates of the bank under the new benchmark. For such borrowers, who took a loan of up to  ₹30 lakh, the interest rates would be between 8.0% and 8.12% after the reset clause kicks in; those with a loan of  ₹30 lakh-70 lakh would see interest rates resetting to 8.3-8.4%; and those with loans above  ₹75 lakh would see the reset at 8.4-8.5%.
This is in contrast to the trend in the banking industry, where new borrowers typically get better rates. ""It is possible that some existing borrowers of banks would have interest rates lower than those offered to new customers. But there is a significant proportion of borrowers who take a home loan from home finance companies. Their rates would still be higher,"" said Aditya Mishra, founder and CEO, Switchme.in, a platform that helps borrowers shift their home loans to other financial institutions.
According to Mishra, about 20% of the visitors to his website have loans that charge less than 9%. A bulk of the remaining customers pays an interest rate between 9% and 10%. If you are among those borrowers who are servicing loans above the interest rates offered by banks, it's time you think of switching the loan.
Banking industry experts said it makes sense to switch if your existing tenure if over 10 years. This is because in the initial years of the loan, a large part of the equated monthly instalment comprises the interest.
As a rule of thumb, a borrower should look at shifting the home loan if the remaining tenure is above 15 years and she's getting a loan cheaper by 25 basis points than what her existing lender is offering. For those who have a remaining tenure between 10 years and 15 years should look at switching only if the interest rate difference is above 50 basis points. If an individual has less than 10 years remaining for the loan, then the borrower needs to estimate if there will be any savings on switching."

53,2019-12-10,State Bank,"Regulator finds that the lender under-reported its NPA numbers for FY19Others including Union Bank, UCO, Lakshmi Vilas and Yes Bank have also reported a divergence in NPA numbers for FY19

Mumbai: India’s largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI), underreported bad loans and their provisioning by  ₹11,932 crore and  ₹12,036 crore, respectively, in 2018-19, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has found, the highest such figures reported by any bank so far for the last fiscal.
In a stock exchange filing on Tuesday disclosing the central bank’s risk assessment report, SBI said had it taken into account the provisions based on RBI’s findings, the bank would have reported a net loss of  ₹6,968 crore in 2018-19 instead of its reported profit of  ₹862 crore.
However, SBI said the remaining impact on the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in the third quarter of 2019-20 is  ₹3,143 crore, since some of it has already been recognized in the first two quarters of FY20. Likewise, the remaining impact on provisioning during Q3 FY20 is  ₹4,654 crore.
Earlier, SBI had reported its highest bad loan divergence of  ₹23,239 crore for 2016-17.
In 2017, the central bank directed banks to disclose the extent to which their assessment of NPAs and their provisioning diverged from that of RBI, and released guidelines for such classification. In April 2019, RBI mandated banks to disclose information about provisioning divergence, if it exceeded 10% of a bank’s pre-provisioning profit. Banks were also directed to disclose information if additional NPAs were more than 15% of reported NPAs. The divergences were disclosed in notes to accounts in annual financial statements following the RBI directive.
In October, the Securities and Exchange Board of India directed publicly-traded banks to disclose such divergences within a day of receiving the final report from the banking regulator, tightening norms for asset quality disclosures.
According to Anil Gupta, vice president and sector head of financial sector ratings at ICRA Ltd, divergences in terms of gross NPAs for banks have been declining, given that most of the stress in the sector has been recognized.
“However, the banks continue to lag in terms of provisioning for these NPAs and as per our estimates, the divergences in provisioning for public sector banks stood at  ₹18,500 crore as of March 2018,"" Gupta said. “For FY19, we continue to expect the divergences in gross NPAs to remain low, but there can be elevated level of divergences in provisions in the year ended March 2019.""
Other banks including Indian Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Union Bank of India, UCO Bank, Central Bank of India and Yes Bank have also reported divergence in their FY19 bad loan numbers.
State Bank of India reported a more than threefold jump in its net profit to  ₹3,011.73 crore in the second quarter of FY20 from  ₹944.87 crore a year ago. The bank’s asset quality improved, with fresh additions to bad loans nearly halving to  ₹8,805 crore at the end of the September quarter, compared to the preceding quarter. Gross NPAs as a percentage of total advances stood at 7.2% in Q2, compared with 7.5% in the June quarter and 9.95% a year earlier. Post provisions, net NPA ratio was at 2.79%, against 3.07% in April-June and 4.84% in the year-ago period.
The idea of reporting divergences was floated by RBI in 2015 and the final guidelines were issued in 2017. In its bimonthly monetary policy statement on 29 September 2015, the central bank said it assesses compliance by banks with extant prudential norms on income recognition, asset classification and provisioning (IRACP). It said that there have been divergences between banks and the supervisor with respect to asset classification and provisioning.
“In order to bring in greater transparency, better discipline with respect to compliance with IRACP norms as well as to involve other stakeholders, the Reserve Bank of India will mandate disclosures in the notes to accounts to the financial statements of banks where such divergences exceed a specified threshold,"" it said."

Mumbai: Indian stock markets may continue to remain sluggish. Asian stocks flatlined on Wednesday as Sino-US trade talks approached a weekend deadline with little sign of progress, while a tightening of the UK election race knocked the pound.
Investors are beginning to suspect that even if US tariffs due to take effect on Sunday are delayed, it may be 2020 before Washington and Beijing can agree a broader rapprochement. In the absence of detailed trade news, focus moves to the US Fed’s outlook for the economy along with an expectation interest rates will be held steady.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan barely budged. Japan’s Nikkei ticked lower after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said a decision on the 15 December tariffs would come soon, also knocking modest early gains off Australia’s S&P/ASX 200.
The biggest mover of the morning was the British pound, which shed 0.3% to hit $1.3128 after a closely watched YouGov poll showed the ruling Conservatives tracking toward a much slimmer majority than forecast a fortnight ago.
The pound had climbed to an eight-month high overnight, before the survey, as investors priced in a comfortable Conservative victory and expected it could end years of uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union.
On the trade front, officials from Canada, Mexico and the United States signed a fresh overhaul of the quarter-century-old North American trade pact, but there were few hints of progress on a deal between the globe’s two largest economies.
A Wall Street Journal report that said US and Chinese officials were preparing for a delay to the 15 December round of tariffs knocked bonds but did not shift stocks since it suggested no resolution to the trade conflict.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 each fell 0.1%, while the Nasdaq dropped by a little less.
Back home, Yes Bank Ltd on Tuesday said it is considering a $500 million investment offer from London-based Citax Holdings and Citax Investment Group, in what would be a vital financial lifeline for the cash-starved private lender. A final decision on the investment, which is proposed to be made through a preferential allotment, will be taken at the bank’s next board meeting. In its statement to stock exchanges, the private lender did not give a time frame for the next board meeting.

In an indication that consumer demand remains under pressure, passenger vehicle sales declined 0.8% year-on-year to 2,63,773 units in November. A 10.8% decline in dispatches of passenger cars to 1,60,306 contributed the most to the overall decline. Sales of utility vehicles though rose almost by a third from a year ago to 92,739 units as new launches and entry of players like MG Motor India and Kia Motors India spurred purchase decisions.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which moves inversely to price, last stood a little higher at 1.8399%.
The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady at the conclusion of Wednesday’s policy meeting, with investors instead focused on any change to the central bank’s view of the economy and its 2% growth forecast for next year.
Elsewhere in currencies, the dollar slipped against the euro overnight as German economic sentiment sharply rose after an unexpected rebound in October exports.

India’s market for initial public offerings is expected to gather pace in 2020 after this year’s relatively small crop saw strong gains in the stock market.
The 14 mainboard IPOs this year have risen by an average of more than 50% since listing, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The S&P BSE IPO Index, a gauge of shares in their first two years of trading, has climbed 36% in 2019, compared with a gain of 13% for the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index.

Shah said there are 21 companies that have filed documents with market regulator Securities & Exchange Board of India for planned IPOs, looking to raise a total of about 300 billion rupees ($4.2 billion). Of these, 11 have already received approval to tap the market as soon as next year, he added.
Companies planning IPOs include SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd., UTI Asset Management Co., Computer Age Management Services Pvt. and Fincare Small Finance Bank Ltd.
The outperformance of recent debutantes is notable given the sluggish performance of smaller Indian shares in general. Gauges of small- and mid-cap stocks are in the red for 2019.

Amid the nation’s ongoing crisis in non-bank lending, market participants expect a larger number of financial companies to list shares next year in order to raise funds or meet regulatory requirements.

41,2019-12-15,State Bank,"If you pay toll charges by cash, you pay a penalty and if you pay by FASTag you get a cashback of 2.5%Here's how to buy FASTag, activate and recharge it online

NEW DELHI :
If you have not bought FASTag for your vehicle yet, get ready to pay double the toll charge from today across national highways in India. With effect from December 15, the government has converted all lanes, barring one, on toll plazas to FASTag-only lane. The National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme will not only promote digital payments but also ensure seamless traffic movement on highways. Affixed to the windscreen of your vehicle, the FASTag runs on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology which allows payments of toll charges from a prepaid wallet or bank account linked to it.
Using FASTags for toll charge payment has another advantage till March 2020 as the government is offering a cashback of 2.5%.
FASTag rule explained in 5 points:
1) In case you are going without a FASTag, look for the hybrid lane in toll plazas where FASTag as well as other modes of payment will be accepted. The ministry of road transport and highways has instructed that one lane on either side of the toll plaza shall be kept as hybrid lane. You will, however, have to pay double the toll tax as a penalty. At some toll plazas you may find more than one hybrid lane as the government has allowed them to keep upto 25% lanes as hybrid ones for a month.
2) FASTags are priced at  ₹100 but the government was giving it out for free for few days last month to popularise its use. Besides, you also need to pay  ₹150 as security deposit and recharge it as per your use.
3) Designed as an Aadhaar card for vehicles, FASTags are not issued without KYC documents. You will need to submit the Registration Certificate (RC) of your vehicle, your passport-size photograph as well as your own identity proof document.
4) Besides toll plaza counters, you can buy FASTags from banks like SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, Paytm Payments Bank, etc. It is also being sold online on Amazon.
5) Once you buy the FASTag you can either use the e-wallet option and keep recharging it with online payment modes like debit card, credit card, internet banking, UPI, etc. Alternatively, you can also link it to your bank account. But before you recharge, you need to activate the tag by entering details related to you and your vehicle in MY FASTag mobile app."

Marico Ltd is one of the odd men out among consumer staple firms. At a time when shares of most peers are far ahead of their 52-week lows, the Marico stock is flirting with its lows. The demand slowdown is hurting it more than others. Marico’s domestic volume growth was a mere 1% for the September quarter. Apart from overall demand slowdown, competition from the unorganized market weighs on growth, too.
Signs that the December quarter will show a marked improvement are few and far between. To boost demand, Marico has taken price cuts. “For the 100ml Parachute packs, the company has rolled back 20% extra grammage (volume promotion implemented in October) and cut the price by 13% (in December), leading to overall 4% increase in prices in the last couple of months,"" said analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd in a report on 9 December.
To pass the benefit of reduced copra cost, Marico is now offering  ₹5 off on 100ml and 250ml Parachute products, added the broking firm. Copra is one of the company’s key raw material.
“It appears that demand did not revive as expected post the volume increase offers. As a result, a shift in strategy resulting in an optical price cut becomes a necessity to consumer wallets given the stress,"" said an analyst requesting anonymity.
Analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd wrote in a report on 12 December: “The price cuts are not negative and have been done historically in order to pass on lower copra prices, a move which has helped the company support volumes and market share in a deflationary cycle.""
As of now, investors can just hope volume growth revives. But what about the impact on profit margins? Emkay Global estimates the margin impact to be limited to about 150 basis points, which can be partially offset by minimizing promotions and advertising spends. A basis point is 0.01%. Additionally, it is helpful that copra prices are not expected to rise meaningfully.
To be sure, consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin expansion of 270 basis points helped Marico report year-on-year growth in profit in the September quarter. Note that this was achieved despite flattish revenue.
From its annual high of  ₹404 seen on 25 September, the Marico stock is down 17%, suggesting investors have factored in the pessimism on demand adequately. Currently, the stock trades at 39 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data.
For the half-year ended September, net profit rose by 19%. If demand continues to rub the wrong way, there’s no reason why current valuations should sustain."

New Delhi: State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Monday said the resolution of Essar Steel will boost profitability of the bank by about  ₹12,000 crore in the third quarter of the current financial year.
The country's largest bank, which was leading the consortium of lenders to Essar Steel, had an exposure of  ₹12,161 crore to the company. The bank has already made 100 per cent provisioning towards this.
So, recovery from the Essar Steel will be written back to its bottom line and will boost the profitability of the bank in the third quarter, he said.
The Supreme Court on November 15 set aside an NCLAT order which gave equal rights to the secured and unsecured creditors during the insolvency proceedings of debt-ridden Essar Steel, clearing the decks for its takeover by Lakshmi Mittal-led ArcelorMittal.
With the order, the apex court paved the way for ArcelorMittal's takeover of Essar Steel for  ₹42,000 crore.
The full money has come into an SBI escrow account and it is being distributed among the creditors, he said.
Kumar expressed hope that the last quarter too will be better as the money from the resolution of Alok Industries and Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd (BPSL) will flow in during January-March.
SBI has an exposure of  ₹4,000 crore to BPSL while  ₹1,700 crore to Alok Industries.
Besides, resolution of other stressed assets which are in the pipeline will have positive impact in the fourth quarter, he said.
""For MSMEs, I think the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) is not the right route. It is more for the bigger corporates. MSMEs should have a rehabilitation...we are not in favour to take them to the NCLT because it will burden the system unnecessarily,"" Kumar said.
He also said there will be money coming in from SBI Card stake dilution in the months to come.
Emphasising that the Supreme Court's verdict on Essar Steel is a landmark judgement, Kumar said it has settled every issue around the resolution under the IBC process and it is a huge positive for the economy.
The verdict came on a plea of the committee of creditors challenging the NCLAT's order of July 4 in which it had approved ArcelorMittal's bid for the acquisition of Essar Steel after it rejected a plea by the lead shareholder of the debt-laden firm challenging the eligibility of the bidder.
Essar Steel was auctioned under the new IBC to recover  ₹54,547 crore of dues of financial lenders and operational creditors.
On the loan growth, Kumar said, the bank has seen credit growth in the last three months and there is a huge amount of sanction for working capital and other area.

New Delhi: The State Bank of India (SBI), the lead banker of the bankrupt Essar Steel, is likely to settle dues of other lenders as it received  ₹40,000 crore on Friday from ArcelorMittal, which is going to takeover the company bringing to an end to the much-prolonged resolution process.
The SBI may settle the dues of all the other lenders on Monday.
The development followed the tabling of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Second Amendment) Bill, 2019, in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, which also provides for protection of buyers from criminal proceedings against previous promoters of the bankrupt firm.
ArcelorMittal had kept the promised  ₹42,000 crore in an escrow account, but didn't release it immediately after the Supreme Court's order in the case last month, as the company wanted immunity for Essar Steel's assets from probe against its previous promoters.
The SBI had the largest exposure to Essar Steel of over  ₹13,000 crore, while the amount approved by the committee of creditors (CoC) stood at  ₹12,161 crore. The other lenders of Essar Steel included IDBI Bank, Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank.
Both ArcelorMittal and SBI, however, are yet to respond to questions sent by IANS.
As per the resolution proposal, banks would recover over 90 per cent of their claims against Essar Steel, amounting to over 40,000 crore. The operational creditors would initially get  ₹196 crore, and another  ₹1,000 crore later, allowed by the CoC, taking the total repayment to  ₹1,196 crore.
The resolution of Essar Steel can be marked as a landmark in the 3-year-old Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). A major roadblock in the resolution was removed by the Supreme Court on November 15 as it set aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal's (NCLAT) ruling that provided for equal distribution of proceeds between financial and operational creditors.
The Essar case, which was among the first 12 cases to be referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for resolution, faced several hurdles as its promoter Prashant Ruia also tried to bid for the company and moved the appellate tribunal for rejection of the ArcelorMittal's  ₹42,000 crore bid.

35,2019-12-16,State Bank,"With effect from today, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has made online NEFT transfers a round-the-clock processNEFT timing cycle will now function round-the-clock

NEW DELHI :
You do not have to look at your watch or calendar while transferring money online from today as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) facility available for 24 hours a day and 365 days a year. So far, you could transfer money only in between 8 am and 6:30 pm and on those days when banks were open.
NEFT timings:
NEFT transfers have now been divided into half-hourly batches with the settlement of the first batch starting after 12:30 am (after midnight) and the last batch ending at midnight. This NEFT timing cycle will function round-the-clock.
Since the settlement of the last NEFT payment batch ends at midnight, you might not be able to make a transaction after 11:30 pm till the beginning of the next batch at 12:30 am the next day.
The RBI has decided to make NEFT money transfer facility available not just for 24 hours a day but also on all days of the year, including holidays. So far, NEFT facility was not available on banking holidays and people had to wait for the bank branches to open even for online money transfers.
So far, NEFT transactions were settled in between 8 am to 7 pm. On first and third Saturdays, the settlement happened from 8 am to 1 pm.
RBI’s move will promote digital transactions in India. So far, IMPS facility allowed 24x7 fund transfers online but it had a limit of  ₹2 lakh.
NEFT transactions done after banking hours will be automated using ‘Straight Through Processing (STP)’ modes by the banks. The existing rule of crediting the beneficiary’s account or returning the transaction (within 2 hours of settlement of the respective batch) to originating bank will continue, RBI said. Banks are supposed to send confirmation messages for all NEFT credits.
The RBI has asked banks to ensure availability of all necessary infrastructural requirements at their end for providing seamless NEFT 24x7 facility to their customers.
NEFT charges:
Most banks like the State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank do not charge anything for online NEFT transfers. In July, the RBI had waived off all charges on fund transfer through NEFT and RTGS and had also asked banks to pass on the benefits to customers. The RBI has also proposed to mandate banks to make all online NEFT transactions free for savings bank account customers from January 2020.
NEFT limits:
There is no minimum limit for NEFT transfer but it is generally used for fund transfers of up to  ₹2 lakh. For high-value transactions, RTGS is used. The maximum NEFT limits vary from bank to bank and also depend on the customer category. For example, ICICI Bank allows NEFT transfers up to  ₹10 lakh for most customers but for others, it may allow NEFT transactions up to  ₹25 lakh. HDFC Bank, too, has a  ₹25 lakh limit for online NEFT transactions.
SBI has a  ₹10 lakh limit for retail customers."
37,2019-12-16,State Bank,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans Personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

38,2019-12-16,State Bank,"As many as 10 banks disclosed they had under-reported NPAs of close to  ₹24,000 crore in the year ended 31 MarchThe country’s largest lender, SBI, reported the largest bad loan divergence so far this year, under-reporting gross NPAs of  ₹11,932 crore

Mumbai: India’s bad loan crisis seems far from over, with as many as 10 banks disclosing they had under-reported non-performing assets (NPAs) of close to  ₹24,000 crore in the year ended 31 March.
These banks are State Bank of India (SBI), Yes Bank, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, UCO Bank, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank and Lakshmi Vilas Bank. For India’s banks, saddled with bad loans of  ₹9.5 trillion, the findings by the Reserve Bank of India do not bode well.
The country’s largest lender, SBI, reported the largest bad loan divergence so far this year, under-reporting gross NPAs of  ₹11,932 crore. Divergence refers to the difference between what a bank reports as its bad loans and provisions, and what the central bank finds when auditing that bank’s books. SBI also reported divergence in provision of  ₹12,036 crore. The bank disclosed the divergence to the stock exchange last week.
Earlier, SBI had reported its highest bad loan divergence of  ₹23,239 crore for 2016-17.
While loans turn bad once the repayment overdue exceeds 90 days, provision is the money set aside for each loan a bank disburses. Provisions mirror the change in an asset’s classification from standard to NPA and increases as the asset deteriorates.
In 2017, the central bank directed banks to disclose the extent to which their assessment of NPAs and their provisioning diverged from that of RBI, and released guidelines for such classification. In April, RBI mandated banks to disclose information about provisioning divergence, if it exceeded 10% of a bank’s pre-provisioning profit. Banks were also directed to disclose information if additional NPAs were more than 15% of reported NPAs. The divergences were disclosed in the notes to accounts in annual financial statements following the RBI directive.
After SBI, the largest divergence in gross NPAs was reported by private lender Yes Bank. According to the bank, RBI found under-reporting of bad loans by  ₹3,277 crore in the year ended 31 March.
Following these disclosures, experts have raised questions about the role of auditors in the reporting process.
“From a regulatory perspective, auditors are the first line of defence, as bank accounts are prepared in accordance with the guidelines determined by RBI, with which bank auditors are well-versed,"" independent analyst Hemindra Hazari wrote in a note on 11 December. “Hence, if the regulator RBI has detected misreported accounts, the auditors have to be held responsible and need to be penalized.""
“As banks hold unsecured deposits from the public, are highly leveraged and play a critical role in payments in the economy, they have to maintain the highest ethical standards. Indeed, by their very nature, banks are meant to stand for integrity and trust,"" added Hazari.
Others said lenders are not always at fault and the central bank would have sought NPA classification of some assets in retrospect and with abundant caution. According to Prakash Agarwal, head of financial institutions at India Ratings and Research, not all divergences are a result of incorrect reporting or error of judgement.
“In many cases, the stress in the account may have become apparent only in subsequent quarters after March ending,"" Agarwal said. “In such cases, it would be challenging for banks to pre-empt stress and, hence, report such account as non-performing. Further, in many cases, divergent accounts would have been factored in the reported results of the first half of the year.""
Banks such as SBI and Yes Bank have said they already provided for some of these loans and the rest will be done in Q3 FY20. SBI said it has to make provisions of  ₹4,654 crore in the December quarter as the rest has been factored in the first half of the fiscal. Yes Bank said its remaining provision is  ₹632 crore in Q3."

Mumbai: Two of India's top bankers on Tuesday opined that Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is best suited to acquire smaller and capital-starved rival Yes Bank.
Yes Bank's capital buffers have dipped on accelerated non-performing assets recognition under new chief executive Ravneet Gill earlier this year.
The private sector lender's capital raising plan is also passing through uncertainties and there are speculations on whether Yes Bank is an acquisition target, which has been denied by its management.
""I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes Bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said at Times Network's India Economic Conclave here.
When the same question was posed to third-largest lender Axis Bank's Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, it was answered with the same suggestion.
""We (Axis Bank) are a smaller bank. We are trying to ensure that we grow big so that at some stage we can acquire others. So, yes Mr Kotak, they are best suited rather than us,"" he said.
When contacted, Kotak Mahindra Group Chief Communication Officer Rohit Rao said, ""these are comments made by other bankers and reflect their views, and not ours"".
In the past, both Axis Bank and KMB have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank.
According to some watchers, acquiring a bank can help Uday Kotak reduce the promoter stake in KMB, and help him get closer to the levels mandated by the RBI.
The regulator has been dragged to the court by KMB for not accepting an earlier attempt at stake dilution and the same petition is slated to be heard early next year.
Meanwhile, speaking at the same event, Kotak said there is a need to resist a ""colonialisation"" of Indian finance, hinting at share sales to foreign investors.
""I'm looking forward to best in class quality but strong Indian-owned and controlled financial sector and while we must attract foreign capital, we must ensure that there is no colonialisation of Indian finance,"" Kotak said.
Yes Bank had to cut its book size by 7 per cent in the September quarter because of the capital constraints and has been looking to finish the capital raising exercise at the earliest.
The lender had first announced it has interest from investors of USD 3 billion, and a few days later disclosed offers of USD 2 billion. It wanted to finalise the same at the last board meet on December 10 but was not able to take a decision.
Yes Bank's share price plummeted to  ₹32 apiece in October as against a high of  ₹400 just a year ago and has been one of the most volatile scrips on the bourses

28,2019-12-17,State Bank,"The bank will list its asset management company before SBI General Insurance, said SBI chairmanKumar reiterated that non-performing assets had touched a peak last quarter and there will be an improvement from this quarter onwards

Mumbai: SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar on Tuesday said it will take up to three years more to list its general insurance arm.
The bank will list its asset management company before SBI General Insurance, Kumar said while speaking at the India Economic Conclave organised by Times Network here.
SBI had last year listed its life insurance arm and the proceeds came in handy to fight difficulties in asset quality. It is also planning to part-sell its stake in SBI Cards.
SBI General Insurance, which is a joint venture with Insurance Australia Group, has to ""mature"" and will await the valuation to touch  ₹50,000 crore, Kumar said.
""We are discussing but if you ask me sequentially then it will be AMC first then SBI General because. We believe that still it is about 2-3 years away before SBI General matures,"" he said.
Speaking on the asset quality position, Kumar reiterated that non-performing assets had touched a peak last quarter and there will be an improvement from this quarter onwards.
On telecom exposure, Kumar said the bank had burnt its ""fingers and body"" in the past, but sounded more confident for the sector now.
He said the risk is a ""lot less"" now and also added that the bank is in a position to absorb setbacks, if any, in the future.
The bank is not getting much of demand for large projects given the state of the economy and the project loans are much smaller now, Kumar said.
Amid a sustained period of liquidity surplus, he said availability of money to fund the debt requirements of corporates is not the problem, but it is equity raising which is proving to be a difficulty.
Companies are facing difficulties for equity raising due to a slew of concerns, including the general economic scenario and the low investor confidence due to setbacks like losing money in the past.
Kumar said he does not see any ""major changes"" when it comes to consolidation of state-owned banks.
He, however, hinted that state ownership of lenders limits the discretion of the management in taking business decisions as compared to private sector rivals.
""When you are a private bank, you still have a choice in terms of selecting your client. In SBI, you don’t have that choice at times, even if business is not generating profits,"" he said.
The SBI chief also admitted that the lender has not delivered to equity investors, but sought the bank to be evaluated on the basis of ""stakeholder value"" that it is generating.
The equity valuations are suppressed because of a ""small segment"" not representing over 10 per cent of the balancesheet, which pulls down the performance, Kumar said.
Rather than looking at returns for equity holders by way of share price appreciation, there is a need to look at wider ""stakeholder returns"" which more number of people across the world are tracking, he said.
Kumar said SBI does not need any capital from the government and will depend on internal accruals and profits itself for its buffers, and also exhorted its peers to do the same.

NEW DELHI :
The Supreme Court Wednesday directed SBICAP Ventures Ltd, which manages government sponsored Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) fund, to take a call within 10 days on financing the completion of stalled projects of the now defunct Amrapali Group.
The top court directed court receiver senior advocate R Venkatramani, who has been appointed custodian of properties of Amrapali Group, to make an application to SBICAP Ventures and furnish the requisite information with regard to the projects.
A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and U U Lalit said, ""We request the receiver to deliberate with the SBICAP Ventures Ltd and furnish the requisite information. On the requisite information being furnished, the SBICAP Ventures Ltd is to deal with the same within 10 days and to submit its proposal.""
The top court noted that Additional Solicitor General Vikramjeet Banerjee placing on record the application of SBICAP Ventures on the process for selection of stalled projects for funding of SWAMIH Investment Fund-U and corresponding timeline which is sponsored by the Government of India and managed by SBICAP Ventures.
He has also placed the criteria for the stalled projects to be considered for the funding including that at least 90 per cent of the available FSI/FAR is being developed as affordable housing units or mid-income housing units and is networth positive -- value of sold receivables plus unsold inventory being greater than cost of construction and to service the investment by the fund.
The top court directed Banerjee to submit a present status report of sale of properties of Amrapali Group undertaken by government owned Metal Scrap Trade Corporation (MSTC) on affidavit.
It asked the banks who have entered into loan agreements with the home buyers directly or through Amrapali Group, to clear their stand on the suggestion of court receiver, that interest amount levied on defaults of the builder and home buyers should be waived off and on disbursal of the loan amount to each homebuyer in terms of payment requirement of NBCC.
Among various issues, the court receiver has also suggested that the legal proceedings including those in the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) cheque bounce cases be withdrawn and closed without levying any penalties on the home buyers, considering the situation in which they have been put in the case, and the CIBIL score of home buyers be restored ignoring their EMI defaults.
""Let the banks submit their stand on these aspects to this Court and in case they are ready, they are free to disburse the loan based on the suggestions made by the Receiver, without approaching this Court,"" the bench said, adding that it is open to the home buyers to approach the respective banks and submit their requirements to the bank’s branch concerned.
The top court also authorised the National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC) in consultation with the receiver, to undertake all urgent works such as lift erection, electricity, water connection and other remedial works and said that the funds required in this regard be made available on intimation to be received.
It also directed the home buyers or respective Residents Welfare Associations (RWAs) other vendors of Amrapali Projects not to create any problem during the construction by NBCC.
""They (RWAs) are directed not to interfere in the work executed by NBCC and any person who may be a bidder or authorised evaluator on behalf of NBCC or MSTC, shall be granted access to the projects concerned without any obstruction so as to work out the details for smooth completion of the projects"", the bench said.
It posted the matter for further hearing on January 10, 2020.
On December 16, the top court has asked the Centre to inform it as to how much time it will take to decide on application for financing the stalled projects of now defunct Amrapali Group from the newly launched  ₹25,000 crore stress fund for the real estate sector.
The Centre has submitted that the State Bank of India has been appointed as a fund manager and it will disburse the amount based on certain norms after an application is made by a real estate entity.
Earlier, the apex court had cracked its whip on errant builders for breaching the trust reposed by home buyers and ordered cancellation of the registration of the Amrapali Group under real estate law RERA, and ousted it from prime properties in the NCR by nixing the land leases.
It had directed the state-run NBCC to complete the stalled projects of the Amrapali Group, whose directors Anil Kumar Sharma, Shiv Priya and Ajay Kumar are behind bars on the top court's order.
It directed the Centre and states to ensure that real estate projects are completed in a time-bound manner as contemplated in RERA and home buyers are not defrauded, and ordered the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to give completion certificate to the homebuyers of Amrapali group who are already residing in various projects."

New Delhi: SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday nudged industry leaders to enrich their borrowing capacity so as to boost investment in the economy, asserting there is no dearth of funds and most of the banks will be in a better position by March-end as far as stressed assets are concerned.
He also said that the State Bank of India (SBI) is underutilising its loan sanction limits as there is not enough credit demand from the industry.
""If India has to achieve its goal of USD 5 trillion economy then it cannot happen unless there is investment in the economy. Today the outstanding banking credit is  ₹96 lakh crore. So for a USD 5 trillion economy, we would at least need to double it,"" Kumar said at the 92nd Annual Convention of industry body FICCI here.
He further said that it is a very good business opportunity for the banks.
The gross capital formation rate which is at about 30 per cent at present also needs to go up to at least 37-38 per cent, Kumar added.
Stressing that there is an adequate availability of funds with the banking system, Kumar said: ""I don't find enough projects where investment is being sought. Our first indication is that we are the largest financier of projects, we have a very big team for project finance and currently it is under-utilised.""

""Other than that, I don't have a project where funding demand is more than  ₹2,000 to  ₹2,500 crore today. So I want to ask you (industry), where are the projects? And if there are no projects then how do I lend and to whom I lend?,"" Kumar asked the industrialists present at the convention.
The State Bank today has loan sanction limits of up to  ₹8 lakh crore, but the utilisation (demand) is of only  ₹5.5-6 lakh crore, the SBI chairman said.
He further said the industry keeps on complaining that banks are not lending and lenders are saying that ""we are ready with funds, you are not borrowing"".

I don't think government can meet more than 25 per cent of this requirement. So 75 per cent will still be an opportunity for investors as well as the banks and the foreign capital.""
On NPAs and liquidity situation, he said banks now have become extra cautious in lending than they used to be earlier and the risks have increased due to defaults.
Talking about reforms such as IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code), Kumar said in the current scenario there is ample liquidity available and the recent judgement by the Supreme Court on Essar Steel will matter a lot.
""Many large ticket stressed assets are getting resolved and by March 31, we are going to be in a very good position as far as most of the banks are concerned where at least the NPA (non-performing asset) ratio and stressed assets hopefully will come down,"" he said.
""And in such scenario, the opportunities which we (SBI) are seeing definitely is infrastructure, consumer lending... There is apparently a demand slowdown, but still our housing loan portfolio, which is a large portfolio, (in that) we are still growing at 16 per cent,"" the SBI chief claimed.
Among others, unsecured loans (such as credit against salaries) are growing at 25 per cent and there is good demand from housing sector also, he said.
""For housing sector, geographies may differ, you may have problem in NCR but it is not all India problem. We may have some problem in some residential markets but office market is doing quite well in certain cites like Hyderabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Pune, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai -- all these markets are doing well and we have seen huge investment interest from all the private equity investors,"" he added.
Replying to a question on lending to the telecom sector in the next round of spectrum auctions, he said, ""For us lending for spectrum is completely unsecured. On paper, it is secured as the auction is to be done by government but practically it is totally unsecured.""
""So in such circumstances, banks will have to evaluate carefully before lending to the sector as the probability of default is very high,"" Kumar said.
Nevertheless, at a time when India is witnessing a demand slowdown from consumers and slowdown in economic growth, he said the scenario is not ""all that gloomy"" as it looks like to be as the country is undergoing a transition phase due to ongoing reforms process.
Also ""the mindset with which people do business, the way we live our lives, everything is undergoing a transition phase. I think we are undergoing through a pain due to this transition...the country is full of opportunities. That have not disappeared. So I think we should not be disheartened by the current scenario,"" Kumar said. PTI KPM MKJ

21,2019-12-21,State Bank,"Rajnish Kumar said there is no dearth of liquidity in the system for lendingOn transmission of monetary policy, he said the banks cannot lower rates beyond a threshold due to asset liability mismatch issues.

New Delhi: SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday said most banks will be in a good position with respect to stressed assets by March and there is no dearth of liquidity in the system for lending.
He added that there are opportunities to lend in sectors such as infrastructure and consumer lending as there is not much of a decline in demand from consumers.
""By March 31st, most of the banks will be in a good position with respect to stressed assets,"" Kumar said at the 92nd Annual Convention of industry chamber FICCI here.
On transmission of monetary policy, he said the banks cannot lower rates beyond a threshold due to asset liability mismatch issues.
Kumar stated that there is no shortage of capital in the system, but the corporates are not borrowing enough and not utilising their capacities well.
On lending to the telecom sector for the next round of spectrum auctions, he said, ""For us lending to the telecom sector for spectrum is completely unsecured. On paper it is secured as the auction is to be done by government but practically it is totally unsecured.""
""So in such circumstances, banks will have to evaluate carefully before lending to the sector as the probability of default is very high,"" Kumar said.

New Delhi: SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Saturday said banks cannot go beyond a threshold to bring down interest rates on deposits as India lacks social security schemes and likewise cannot lend at lower rates to corporates as the risk of default is too high.
On rate transmission by banks, Kumar said when interest rate moves downwards then everybody starts talking and when it goes upwards nobody talks about it.
When the repo rates were going up five-six years back, interest rates for borrowers did not increase in that proportion, he said.
In 2013, the repo rate was around 10 per cent, the SBI Chairman said adding that since 2013, Reserve Bank's repo and bank interest rates for consumers have been moving in a completely aligned manner.
""Secondly, we have repeatedly mentioned that banking system's dependence ...in India is largely on depositors. Today, 90 per cent of my deposit is retail deposit. If I want to lend money cheap, obviously I will have to pay less to depositors; and in a country like ours where there is huge population of senior citizens and in the absence of social security schemes, the interest on deposits is a source of earning,"" Kumar said while speaking at the 92nd Ficci Annual Convention here on the theme 'making financial system robust to aspire a USD 5 trillion economy'.
At present, banks largely offer 3 to 4 per cent interest on deposits in savings accounts, and charge borrowers 8 per cent and above rate on loans.
On getting competition from government saving schemes, he said such instruments do not impact the banks much as they still command huge share in the deposit market.
""We can't lower the interest rates (on lending) without lowering the interest rates for depositors. And there is a point, a threshold below which we cannot reduce the interest rate for depositors. Third thing is that the credit cost in the country is very high because the default rates are very high, so the spread has to be necessarily high,"" said the head of the country's largest lender.
The loss due to defaults is very high currently and in such a scenario the spreads have to be necessarily high to cover for the credit costs, Kumar added.

16,2019-12-22,State Bank,"Banks charge  ₹1,000 as e-BRC fee for every shipment exported from the countryThe issue was raised by exporters in the meeting chaired by Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal

New Delhi: In what can be termed as a major relief to exporters, the State Bank of India (SBI) has decided to withdraw charges levied on the issuance of Bank Realisation Certificate (e-BRC) for the export of shipments.
Banks charge  ₹1,000 as e-BRC fee for every shipment exported from the country. SBI decision to withdraw e-BRC charges came after the intervention of Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.
A source from Commerce and Industry Ministry told ANI that,"" SBI has informed that e-BRC charge has been reduced to nil for all Export Credit Customer. SBI has further agreed to reverse the charges if wrongly levied by its field formation.""
The issue of high banking charges for the issuance of e-BRC was raised by exporters in the meeting chaired by the Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal on December 19.
The exporters said that SBI has raised the charge for issuance of the same to  ₹1000. Thereafter, Commerce and Industry Minister instantly took up the matter with SBI asking them to review the charge as such charges raise the transaction cost of exports making them less competitive.
Talking to ANI Dr Ajay Sahai, DG and CEO Federation of Indian Exports Organisation (FIEO) termed it a big relief for exporters.
""SBI has already done it. Taking lead from SBI now we will request other banks to follow it. There are around 1.5 lakh total active exporters and 25 per cent exporters are a client of SBI, so 40,000 exporters will directly benefit by the decision of SBI,"" said Sahai.
""This decision has set a trend and we will request other banks to withdraw this charge and reverse the fees paid so far by exporters. e BRC fee was charged by the banks since July 2019. Commerce and Industry Minister has played a very big role for withdrawal of this charge,"" he added.
Around 40 representatives from the Federation of Indian Export Organization (FIEO) and Export Promotion Councils met with Commerce and Industry Minister on December 19 and raised their voice against e-BRC charged by Bank. Following which, Minister Piyush Goyal spoke to SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar and on the very next day, SBI decided to withdraw and reverse the charges collected so far.
e-BRC was charged on every shipment of exporters. On an average if a exporter is exporting 50 shipment in a year then he has to pay  ₹50,000 for his shipments.
FIEO DG Sahai also said that such a timely intervention by Minister will not only exude confidence among exporters that we can approach the Government for immediate redressal but will also motivate the community to focus on long term target of contributing towards US$ 5 trillion economy.

15,2019-12-23,State Bank,"A section of traders is betting on SALMAN to lead the next rallyThe asset quality of SBI improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19%

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."
14,2019-12-24,State Bank,"The cigarette business Ebit formed nearly 85% of the firm’s overall Ebit for the half-year ended SeptemberITC's cigarette volume growth for FY20 so far has broadly remained satisfactory

ITC Ltd’s investors have no reason to celebrate. After all, so far in 2019 the stock has declined by about 15%. This compares miserably with the 9% gain in the Nifty 200 index.
A couple of factors have weighed on ITC’s shares. For one, investors are worried that taxes on cigarettes will increase, considering that the last tax hike was two years ago. Furthermore, global tobacco stocks have been derated a lot, said an analyst, adding that ITC’s valuations reflect that. “The primary reason for ITC’s derating during the last two years has been the lack of double-digit Ebit growth in cigarettes,"" analysts of Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a report on 18 December. Ebit is earnings before interest and tax.
Additionally, intense competition in the cigarettes space has been a problem area, too. Note that the cigarette business growth is crucial for ITC, as the segment is a large contributor to profit. For the half-year ended September, cigarette Ebit formed nearly 85% of the company’s overall Ebit.
“Even though ITC is looking to become a more diversified FMCG company, the non-cigarette segments contribute very little to profits,"" said Nitin Gupta, analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd. ITC’s fast-moving consumer goods products are finding it difficult to make a mark in the market and the company has to invest more in this segment, which can keep its margin profile in other-FMCG segment sub-par, added Gupta.
To be sure, ITC’s valuations are compelling; trading at 19 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data. On the brighter side, downside risks appear limited at this level. The moot question now is what are the triggers. Hereon, investors will have to watch out for news flow on cigarette tax hikes. A few analysts say a reasonable increase in tax could be helpful for the company. “We believe that a moderate hike in cigarette duties after a gap could enable ITC to take meaningful price hikes, which in turn provides an opportunity to regain the double-digit Ebit growth and trigger a re-rating,"" said Antique analysts. Besides, better cigarette volume growth may fetch brownie points as well."
13,2019-12-24,State Bank,"The stake sale comes at a time when IFCI has been grappling with massive bad loan issuesThe stake sale values the stock exchange at around  ₹40,000 crore

Mumbai: State-owned development finance institution IFCI Ltd has raised  ₹805.6 crore by selling its stake in the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), the company said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.
On 2 December, IFCI informed the stock exchanges that it has received bids for its entire 2.44% stake in the NSE.
“This is to inform that IFCI has realized an amount of approximately  ₹805.60 crore, representing about 82% of the total committed amount. Process for receipt of approval for remaining quantity is underway,"" the filing said.
IFCI did not disclose the name of the buyers.
On Tuesday, shares of IFCI closed trading at  ₹6.76 apiece, up 7.64%.
The stake sale values the country’s largest stock exchange at around  ₹40,000 crore.
The stake sale comes at a time when the lender has been grappling with massive bad loan issues.
On 3 December, rating agency Icra downgraded IFCI by a notch to BBB- from BBB with negative outlook, citing deteriorating liquidity profile of the lender and delays in monetizing non-core assets to spruce up its balance sheet.
“The rating downgrade factors in the continued deterioration in the liquidity profile of IFCI Ltd (IFCI) as the scheduled loan repayments are being met by reducing the standard loan book and partially from recoveries from non-performing assets (NPAs). Moreover, the planned divestment of certain non-core assets (including investments in subsidiaries), which was expected, has been delayed, thereby impacting the liquidity profile further,"" the rating agency said.
Icra noted that IFCI’s asset quality profile remains weak with gross stage 3 assets (gross NPA) of  ₹12,0671 crore (64.4% of gross advances) as of 30 September 2019, against  ₹12,997 crore (60.7% of gross advances) as on 31 March 2019.
The reduction in gross stage 3 assets in absolute terms was mainly because of some write-offs in H1 FY20, it noted.
Icra added that given IFCI’s repayment obligations and weak loan portfolio, the lender will have to focus on divesting non-core assets. “Given the large repayment obligations in the coming years, it will need to divest its non-core assets continuously, step up NPA recoveries, and reduce its standard advances to ensure timely repayments. While a capital infusion of  ₹200 crore was announced by the government of India in December 2018 and approved in the Union Budget for FY2020, the same is yet to be infused,"" Icra said.
The NSE stake sale is part of IFCI’s plans to mobilize funds to tackle its NPA problems.
In September, IANS news agency had reported that IFCI was looking to sell its stakes in the NSE and Clearing Corp. of India, hoping to raise up to  ₹2,000 crore.
Several state-owned lenders have, over the years, divested their non-core investments in the NSE, given the high liquidity of the company’s shares, despite it being a private company.
In 2016, State Bank of India had sold a 5% stake in the stock exchange to a private equity fund. Last year, SBI had said that it was looking to sell another 3.89% in the NSE.

MUMBAI :
The Hinduja Group is preparing a bid to buy grounded carrier Jet Airways India Ltd., according to people familiar with the matter.
The UK-based group, run by brothers Gopichand Hinduja and Ashok Hinduja, plans to submit an expression of interest by the 15 January deadline, signaling its intent to make a formal offer, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Hinduja is seeking a partner to bid, one of the people said.
Creditors are seeking fresh bids for Jet Airways after earlier getting interest from only a single company, Synergy Group Corp. The Mumbai-based airline, which was once the country’s largest by market value, fell victim to a cut-throat price war initiated by a slew of budget carriers and eventually defaulted to banks, staff and lessors.
State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB) have claimed  ₹8,230 crore ($1.2 billion), while other creditors, like employees and lessors, are seeking  ₹6,400 crore from the airline, which is 24% owned by Abu Dhabi’s Etihad Airways PJSC.
Hinduja Group had earlier this year considered bidding for Jet Airways in partnership with Etihad, but Etihad jettisoned the proposal and Jet Airways was tipped into bankruptcy. Gopichand Hinduja told the Mint newspaper this month that the group was open to buying Jet Airways if indemnified from the airline’s legal liabilities.
Deliberations are at early stage and Hinduja Group may decide against bidding, or other bidders may emerge, the people said. The Hinduja Group didn’t respond to questions sent by email.
While preparing a bid, the Hinduja Group will grapple with the complexities that have sapped Jet’s value, including lapsed landing rights at Heathrow airport, and the validity of the carrier’s now defunct flying slots."

On 19 November, a consortium of lenders led by PNB had invited bids to acquire the said shares along with rights over the debt owed by the company to these lenders.
PNB, as the lead creditor, had appointed SBI Capital Markets Ltd (SBI Caps) as the transaction advisor.

Lenders had invited expression of interests after the company submitted a one-time debt settlement proposal worth  ₹2,430 crore to them. To determine the value of the settlement proposal offer, lenders placed this as the anchor bid or the base offer and opened the floor for other investors to bid.
“Lenders are desirous of establishing the appropriateness of value submitted by JITPL in the proposal though a Swiss Challenge process by inviting bids from interested parties by offering the sale of 73.59% of equity shares and 66% preferential shares of JITPL and settlement of lenders’ outstanding dues to Jindal India Thermal Power Ltd,"" according to the 19 November document.

MUMBAI :
Lenders, bondholders, employees and other creditors to Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) have claimed dues of  ₹87,905.6 crore under the insolvency resolution process, showed data on the debt-laden shadow lender’s website.
This does not include holders of fixed deposits (FD), to whom DHFL owed  ₹6,188 crore as on 6 July. The claims were submitted to DHFL’s administrator R. Subramaniakumar, a former managing director and chief executive of Indian Overseas Bank.
According to the latest available data, financial creditors, including bondholders, have claimed dues of  ₹86,892.3 crore. While bondholders have claimed  ₹45,550.07 crore, lenders and other financial creditors have sought  ₹41,342.23 crore from the mortgage lender.
State Bank of India (including SBI Singapore) is the largest lender with a claim of  ₹10,082.9 crore, followed by Bank of India ( ₹4,125.52 crore), Canara Bank ( ₹2681.81 crore), National Housing Bank ( ₹2,433.79 crore), Union Bank of India ( ₹2,378.05 crore), Syndicate Bank ( ₹2,229.29 crore) and Bank of Baroda ( ₹2,074.92 crore).
Interestingly, the administrator has also received claims of  ₹950.53 crore from a group of four real estate companies. These have been classified as “creditors other than financial and operational creditors"". The largest of these is from Neelkamal Realtors Tower Pvt. Ltd of  ₹757.65 crore. Neelkamal is a subsidiary of Mumbai-based real estate company DB Realty.
Subramaniakumar has, so far, admitted claims of  ₹80,979.85 crore from financial creditors and  ₹1.81 crore from employees. He is yet to admit any claim from operational creditors or the four real estate companies cited above.
On 20 November, the RBI superseded DHFL’s board and later referred the mortgage lender to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The central bank’s initiative seeks to secure the interests of creditors, including over 100,000 fixed deposit holders of DHFL, as a delay in resolution can lead to a rise in slippages and higher non-performing assets for the HFC, which stopped lending a few months ago.
DHFL is the first non-bank lender to be referred to NCLT under new rules notified by the government on 15 November. RBI had cited governance concerns and payment defaults by DHFL as reasons for superseding the board.
According to the RBI order cited by DHFL in a regulatory filing last month, a statutory inspection of DHFL conducted by National Housing Bank with reference to its position as on 31 March, 2018 revealed serious deterioration in its financial position. In September, RBI had also superseded the board of crisis-hit Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank Ltd and appointed Jai Bhagwan Bhoria as the bank’s administrator.
While the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was seen as the panacea for India’s stressed assets, its track record is not too impressive. Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) data showed that most admitted cases led to liquidation as a viable resolution plan could not be arrived at. As on 30 September, 23% of the admitted cases were ordered to be dissolved. Only 6%, or 156 cases, were resolved under the bankruptcy law since December 2016.
Data from IBBI showed that financial creditors were able to resolve insolvency claims of  ₹29,849.28 crore during July-September 2019. The total resolution amount in the given period was 11% less than the preceding three months, when creditors, primarily comprising banks and asset reconstruction companies, had resolved claims of  ₹33,573 crore."

In October, the RBI had cut its benchmark lending rate or repo rate by 25 basis points to 5.15% , the lowest since March 2010. But in this month's review, the central bank kept interest rates unchanged.
Banks are required to reset the external benchmark based rate at least once in three months, depending on the movement of the movement of the underlying external rate like repo rate.

Mumbai: Shares of state-owned banks were trading in the red on Monday as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cautioned that asset quality of scheduled commercial banks may worsen next year owing to changes in the macroeconomic scenario.
In its latest Financial Stability Report released on Friday, the central bank also warned that there remains an inherent risk of “froth""—conditions that precede a market bubble—building up in the system due to excess liquidity.
Citing factors such as an increase in slippages and declining credit growth, the central bank in its biannual commentary said bad loans of SCBs as a percentage of total loans is expected to increase to 9.9% by September 2020 from 9.3% in September 2019.
Scheduled commercial banks' (SCBs) credit growth remained subdued at 8.7% year-on-year in September 2019, though private sector banks registered double digit credit growth of 16.5%. SCBs' capital adequacy ratio improved significantly after the recapitalisation of public sector banks by the government. SCBs' gross non-performing assets ratio remained unchanged at 9.3% between March and September 2019.

Mumbai: State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, on Monday cut its lending rates linked to the central bank’s repo rate by 25 basis points (bps) to 7.8%, lowering borrowing costs for small businesses and homebuyers.
The new rate, SBI said, will be applicable from 1 January.
“New homebuyers will get loans at an interest rate starting from 7.90%. (previously at 8.15%),"" SBI said in a statement. This rate of 7.9% factors in a premium of 10 basis points over the external benchmark-based rate of 7.8%.
A person aware of the development said the 7.9% rate is applicable only to women borrowers for whom there is a concession of 5 basis points; other borrowers would have to pay at least 7.95%.
When SBI had announced the details of its repo-linked home loan scheme in September, the lender said it would charge a spread of 265 bps over the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) repo rate. The central bank lowered its repo rate by 135 bps in five consecutive rate cuts between February and October. However, halting its rate-cutting spree, RBI’s monetary policy committee in December decided to wait for past policy actions undertaken by the government and the central bank to play out. RBI’s repo rate now stands at 5.15%.
On 9 December, SBI announced a 10 bps reduction in its one-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) to 7.9%. It was the eighth consecutive cut in MCLR in FY20. Banks used to follow MCLR norms for setting rates for retail loans before the advent of external benchmarking.
“It is a positive development for the real estate market, especially the housing segment,"" said Satish Magar, national president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India. “With fewer equated monthly instalments, homebuyers will end up saving as well. This will also help push the much-needed housing demand to an extent.""
The economic slowdown has hit the real estate sector hard, with demand for new housing units slumping in the second half of 2019. According to data from Anarock Property Consultants Ltd, sales in top six cities, including Mumbai Metropolitan Region, National Capital Region and Bengaluru, fell 22% in the second half compared to the first six months of 2019. However, sales in 2019 saw an increase of 5% year-on-year to 261,370 units in the cities cited above.
Meanwhile, transmission of repo rate cuts into lower lending rates for customers has been a bone of contention between RBI and banks. The central bank said in its December monetary policy that it was hopeful of quicker transmission in the days ahead.
According to RBI data, the one-year median MCLR has declined by 49 bps. Meanwhile, monetary transmission has been full and reasonably swift across money market segments and the private corporate bond market. Transmission to money and corporate debt market segments ranged from 137 bps (overnight call money market) to 218 bps (three-month commercial papers of non-banking financial companies), RBI said.
RBI had asked banks to link their lending rates on floating rate loans to retail, personal and micro, small and medium enterprise borrowers to an external benchmark from 1 October. Banks were allowed to choose between RBI’s repo rate, the government’s three-month treasury bill yield published by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt. Ltd (FBIL), the government’s six-month treasury bill yield published by FBIL or any other benchmark market interest rate published by FBIL.
While lenders can decide on the spread they charge over the benchmark to calculate the final interest rate, the spread can be changed only if the credit assessment of the borrower undergoes a substantial change. The interest rate under external benchmark has to be reset at least once in three months."
