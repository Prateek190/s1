74,2018-01-02,Titan,"The quarter started off on a good note for all jewellers after the government removed the industry from the purview of the reporting requirement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on 6 October

Bengaluru: Titan Co. Ltd Tuesday said its main business segments—jewellery and watches—performed well in the October-December festive season quarter. 
Bengaluru: Titan Co. Ltd Tuesday said its main business segments—jewellery and watches—performed well in the October-December festive season quarter.
Traditionally, September-December yields the largest revenue for Titan since both Dussehra and Diwali fall during this period and the festive season did not disappoint this year either, the company said in a filing with the BSE.
The quarter started off on a good note for all jewellers after the government removed the industry from the purview of the reporting requirement under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on 6 October.
Under the earlier PMLA provisions, any sale of gold above Rs50,000 required customers to furnish PAN (permanent account number) or Aadhaar. The change in the provisions sparked a surge in sales at Titan’s flagship Tanishq jewellery stores just in time for the festive season, the company said.
The jewellery segment—the largest revenue contributor—clocked double-digit retail growth over the festival dates in the previous year. The 2016-17 festive season, according to Titan, was one of the best in the company’s history with Dussehra and Diwali falling in the same quarter. 
Revenue at Titan’s jewellery business grew 15% during October-December 2016-17, i.e. Q3 2016-17.
Although Dussehra was in September this year, retail growth in the jewellery segment has been healthy and in line with management expectations in Q3 2017-18, Titan said. But primary growth in the quarter was lower due to a higher franchisee billing of about Rs250 crore that happened towards the end of the previous quarter.
Still, Tanishq continued to gain market share with special collections like ‘Padmavati,’ launched in association with the movie of the same name, performing exceptionally well in terms of sales. The company also launched a men’s jewellery sub-brand under Tanishq called ‘Aveer’ in the last quarter.
Titan’s watches segment posted healthy same-store-sales growth in Q3 2017-18 across all retail formats and its end-of-season sale, which began towards the end of the quarter, is expected to boost sales further. The watches business also benefited from a regulatory change during the period, with the government lowering the goods and service tax (GST) rate on the category to 18% from 28%.
The government also reduced the GST rate on sunglasses to 12% from 18% during the quarter and Titan’s watch and eye wear divisions have corrected prices accordingly. Still, the company’s sunglasses business continued to underperform as distributors and dealers remain wary about stocking the category due to changes in the GST rate. However, the prescription eye wear business continued to grow at a healthy pace, Titan said."
73,2018-02-01,Titan,"Titan reports a 21.26% jump in net profit to Rs281.61 crore for the fiscal third quarter as all three key business segments were buoyed by festive season sales

Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd reported a 21.26% jump in net profit to Rs281.61 crore for the fiscal third quarter as all three key business segments were buoyed by festive season sales. 
Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd reported a 21.26% jump in net profit to Rs281.61 crore for the fiscal third quarter as all three key business segments were buoyed by festive season sales.
Revenue rose 7.40% to Rs4,296.16 crore from the year ago for the October-December quarter, the company said in a filing with the BSE on Thursday. Net profit increased to Rs281.61 crore from Rs232.23 crore in the same period last year.
“The third quarter was an eventful quarter with suspension of the applicability of PMLA, favourable to our jewellery business and reduction of GST rates for watches, sunglasses and optical frames. All our businesses recorded good sales in the festival season,"" said Bhaskar Bhat, Titan’s managing director, in a statement.
The government had initially issued a notification under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) that any sale of gold above Rs50,000 required customers to furnish their PAN (Permanent Account Number) or Aadhaar details to the jeweller. But on 6 October it rolled back this notification and there is no need to furnish such details anymore. That lent a boost to the jewellery industry.
Sales at Titan’s jewellery business segment, retailed mainly under the Tanishq brand name, were up 8% at Rs3,569.86 crore. That growth rate is slower on a sequential basis, though, with the segment having grown 36.9% in the July-September quarter.
Titan’s watches segment earned revenue of Rs535.46 crore in the third quarter, a growth of 4.47% over the same period last year. But the company said those numbers were not comparable as its income included excise duty last year as compared with the goods and services tax (GST) this year.
Revenue at its eyewear division—retailed under the Titan EyePlus brand—declined marginally to Rs90.37 crore during the quarter from Rs90.65 crore a year ago.
“It was an extraordinary quarter with the company registering record levels of profits. Many new products were launched by all our brands during the quarter. Our effort continues to be one of generating demand through new product introductions and network expansion,"" Bhat said.
Titan opened 166 new stores in the nine months to December, taking its store count to 1,439 as of 31 December.
On Thursday, Titan shares closed 4.34% lower at Rs831.30 on BSE, while the Sensex ended 0.16% down at 36,906.66 points."
72,2018-02-06,Titan,"Titan is one of the darlings on the bourses, what with a mouth-watering 74% appreciation so far this fiscal despite the losses in the last three trading sessions

The Titan Co. Ltd stock closed 4% lower on 1 February on BSE. The company’s December quarter results, which missed expectations, were announced a few minutes before the equity markets shut that day. The overall pressure on broader markets ensured that Titan shares fell a further 3.3% in the last two trading days.

The overall pressure on broader markets ensured that Titan shares fell a further 3.3% in the last two trading days.
Titan is one of the darlings on the bourses, what with a mouth-watering 74% appreciation so far this fiscal year despite the losses in the last three trading sessions. Undoubtedly, valuations at 49 times expected earnings for FY19, based on Bloomberg data, are pricey.
Market share gains from the unorganized sector and healthy demand for its flagship jewellery business have kept the shares in favour. “Titan has witnessed market share gains consistently over the past few quarters, growing by over 30% in the months of November and December,"" wrote analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, commenting on the jewellery business. The brokerage firm believes that new launches, store expansion and sustained increase in market share will drive sales growth by 22% compound annual growth rate over FY17-20E.
It is encouraging that Titan has maintained its jewellery segment revenue growth guidance at 25% for FY18 despite weaker-than- expected numbers for the December quarter. The company’s jewellery business faced a high base, as the festival season in the December 2016 quarter was a strong one with Dussehra and Diwali falling in the same quarter.
On a consolidated basis, jewellery revenues rose by 8% year-on-year for the December quarter. This pales in comparison to the 37% growth in the September quarter and a far higher 56% growth in the June quarter. Primary jewellery sales growth was slower, as primary billing was much higher towards the end of the September quarter in anticipation of the festive season. However, retail sales growth at 15% wasn’t disappointing given the high base.
Titan’s second key business—of watches—delivered a satisfactory performance. While watch revenue growth was 4.7%, the company said that if figures were restated for excise duty corrections, the growth in the quarter comes to 11%.
Overall, gross margin improvement and better operating efficiencies resulted in 21% net profit growth in the December quarter.
In future, investors should watch the extent of market share gains. Nevertheless, the sharp outperformance in the Titan stock vis-à-vis the benchmark Sensex suggests the price reflects most of the optimism."
71,2018-03-07,Titan,"Titan-owned jewellery brand Tanishq rolls out  a digital campaign urging women to follow their dreams, ahead of the International Women's Day on 8 March

New Delhi: Titan Ltd-owned jewellery brand Tanishq has rolled out an inspirational campaign urging women to follow their dreams, ahead of the International Women’s Day on 8 March. 
New Delhi: Titan Ltd-owned jewellery brand Tanishq has rolled out an inspirational campaign urging women to follow their dreams, ahead of the International Women’s Day on 8 March.
The spot, made by advertising agency Lowe Lintas, features a middle-aged lady who is introduced as a successful chief executive of a company choosing to go back to college.
The larger narrative is hinged on women refusing to let age, circumstances or their family backgrounds make decisions for them. In the meantime, the brand also manages to use the self-aware women ploy to position its solitaire category as individual purchase, urging women to buy solitaires for themselves.
Interestingly, the solitaire has so far been positioned as mostly for gifting purchase category. Last year, Tanishq created two advertising campaigns. One in which a young man is seen proposing to his girlfriend with a solitaire ring and another which shows a husband surprising his wife with a solitaire ring on their anniversary. 
Tanishq, which sells solitaires at a starting price of Rs54,000, in its new ad, asks women to buy solitaires for themselves through its “My Solitaires"" campaign. 
“With this film we target progressive, career oriented women who have achieved something in their life by following their heart and doing things which they really want to do. A Tanishq Solitaire is a marker of their success for everything they’ve achieved, and still keep going. More and more women are indulging in buying jewellery because they are financially independent and believe in indulging themselves,"" said Deepika Sabharwal Tewari, associate vice-president, marketing, jewellery division at Titan Co. Ltd.
The campaign is being promoted across digital and social media platforms.
“It takes great courage to change the course of your life after a certain point, but we’re noticing a lot of women doing it. After all, ambition has no age, and this film is an ode to every such woman, who’s slowly and steadily turning into the woman she’s always wanted to be,"" said Rajesh Ramaswamy, executive director, Lowe Lintas.
Noting that the well-executed campaign targets women who are finding their individuality every day, Saurabh Uboweja, brand expert and chief executive of brand consulting firm Brands Of Desire, said that self buying is not a new category. “In fact, a large number of women have been buying gold jewellery for themselves. However, I must add that owning a platinum or diamond jewellery has become a style statement. I think self-belief is a new category where women make choices that are driven by self interest. The campaign borrows from this new found self-belief and resonates well with the target audience of the brand. I still think solitaire is mostly dominated by engagement rings which will continue to be a major category,"" he added.
Sanjay Sarma, co-founder and chief executive of Design Worldwide, an integrated strategic branding and creative solutions company, said the campaign is a sign of women expressing their individuality as well as a cue to where the society is heading. “Women are no longer romanticising life and neither are they waiting for a man to gift them what they want. I believe, as disposable income of women rises, brands are changing the way they speak to their women consumers and this campaign reflects that. I won’t be surprised if we see housing companies urging women to buy their homes,"" he said."

Bengaluru: With scams and frauds tainting jewellers, Titan Co. Ltd believes the time is just right for its Tanishq brand to burnish its clean image, scoop up market share and boost overall growth. 
Bengaluru: With scams and frauds tainting jewellers, Titan Co. Ltd believes the time is just right for its Tanishq brand to burnish its clean image, scoop up market share and boost overall growth.
The watches and accessories firm is planning to open 44 new Tanishq stores in 2018-19, marking one of its fastest expansion plans to date for the brand. Titan sells a majority of its jewellery under its Tanishq brand of stores, its largest revenue earner, whose footprint stood at 240 stores as of February. 
“When there is suspicion, the industry suffers. Titan will benefit because the impact on consumer sentiment is they want to go to a safe haven, as in a safe place to buy, like Tanishq. They want to buy clean gold rather than buy gold in cash,"" Titan’s managing director Bhaskar Bhat said in an interview. 
In February, India’s second-largest state-run lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) said it had been defrauded of about $2 billion by two jewellery groups, one controlled by billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and the other by his uncle Mehul Choksi. 
On Wednesday, there were reports that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has unearthed another bank fraud to the tune of Rs824.15 crore—this time involving Chennai-based jewellery chain Kanishk Gold Pvt. Ltd. 
The scandals have already been hurting India’s jewellery sector, with banks tightening the reins when it comes to lending to jewellers. Consumer sentiment has also taken a hit. 
Of 25 firms that trade in gems and jewellery on BSE, only six have been trading in the green from 13 February until 22 March. Among them, the biggest losers are Gitanjali Gems and Lypsa Gems, whose shares have lost 83.85% and 41.13%, respectively during the period. In contrast, Titan has gained 9.96% during the same period. 
“We do believe these kinds of events will happen in jewellery very often because of the nature of that beast. The government will get more and more interventionist and we have to deal with that,"" Bhat said. 
Analysts agreed that if there is any company that stands to gain in this period of turmoil, with consumers desperate for safe bets, it is Titan with its Tata Group backing. 
“People will be more sceptical and consumers will be more alert and they will prefer going to larger brands rather than going to a local player and getting some extra discount,"" said Sameer Deshmukh, analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. 
To be sure, Titan is not the only one that could gain. Jewellery firms like PC Chandra, Raikars, Malabar Gold, Joy Alukkas, GRT and others with strong brand presence, albeit in a more regional way, are also in a position to take advantage.
Titan has also made it more attractive for consumers to come and exchange their gold jewellery in the past month or so. The company used to charge consumers 8% earlier to melt down impure gold jewellery earlier but it has brought that rate down drastically, Bhat said. The company’s Golden Harvest Scheme (GHS) is another avenue through which it is attracting customers, with the scheme contributing to under 20% of overall sales.
“Network expansion is definitely important because there is a limit up to which existing stores can grow and their distribution is still quite thin. Forty-four new stores is aggressive. If they do it, nothing like it, but they have overpromised on expansion in the past,"" Deshmukh said.
Of Titan’s Rs12,717 crore revenue in 2016-17, about Rs10,237 crore was from sales of jewellery. Within that, gold accounted for over 70% of sales, protecting Titan from any possible fallout in terms of consumer demand for diamonds.

Mumbai: JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said on Monday it is initiating coverage on Avenue Supermarts Ltd, the parent of supermarket chain D-Mart, with a buy rating as it sees 28% upside in the stock. 
Mumbai: JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said on Monday it is initiating coverage on Avenue Supermarts Ltd, the parent of supermarket chain D-Mart, with a buy rating as it sees 28% upside in the stock.
In reaction, Avenue Supermarts shares rose 2.42% at Rs1,359.15 on the BSE at 11.40am, while benchmark 30-share Sensex traded 0.43% higher at 33,109.45 points. JM’s target price is set at Rs1,675 per share.
In a report titled “BUY, and don’t sell if it ain’t broke"", JM analysts argued that the attractiveness of DMart’s operating model stems from the significantly higher level of throughput that its stores generate, which is nearly 2-3 times what other retailers clock on an average.
They added that this helps justify its choice of owning the stores (including the cost of land on which they are built), and the discounts that it pampers its shoppers with—the latter being one of the key drivers of footfalls and conversions for DMart,
JM Financial analysts Richard Liu and Vicky Punjabi compared the potential of an investment in D’mart’s shares to that made in Titan Ltd 10-11 years ago when it was trading at 42 times its then 5-year average price-earnings (PE) ratio, which is currently around 20 times and has still made a return of 25% per annum on the stock.
Notably, even if the stock was bought at a 100 times forward PE around 10-11 years ago, the return would still have been 15.6% per annum, they said, adding that an above-average EPS (earnings per share) CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) of 23.4% over the last 10 years is what drove Titan’s strong stock performance notwithstanding its rich valuation.
“We see a similar growth trajectory panning out for DMart, which, as per our workings, is well-poised to compound earnings at 25% p.a. over the next 10 years,"" they added.
Currently, Avenue Supermart shares have four buy/outperform ratings, one hold rating, while seven analysts recommend a sell/underperform on the stock."

Bengaluru: Titan Co Ltd said 2017-18 proved to be a satisfactory year in terms of overall business performance, particularly in its watches and jewellery businesses which scaled new heights in terms of revenue and profitability. 
Bengaluru: Titan Co Ltd said 2017-18 proved to be a satisfactory year in terms of overall business performance, particularly in its watches and jewellery businesses which scaled new heights in terms of revenue and profitability.
But underperformance in the sunglasses business, which has been impacted ever since the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), is expected to out under pressure profitability in the eyewear business to a great extent, the company said in a filing with the BSE on Friday.
Sales in the company’s jewellery business, its largest revenue earner, were propped up by Titan’s marketing activations in the diamond space and a more ‘customer-friendly revised gold exchange policy’ during the January-March quarter.
Titan’s jewellery division sells its products mainly through its Tanishq brand of retail outlets. The business division had laid out a strategy of growing to 2.5x of its 2016-17 revenue over 5 years, Titan said. 
A strong push in the wedding and high-value diamond studded jewellery segments, market share gain in key markets with low share, expansion of its Golden Harvest Scheme and retail network expansion will help the company achieve this strategy, it said.
2017-18 was the first year in its 2.5x journey and all levers for growth have performed well, according to Titan. 
It opened 46 new Tanishq stores last year, including 22 Gold Plus stores that were converted to Tanishq stores. Last January, the company said it was merging its Gold Plus retail jewellery brand of stores into its flagship Tanishq retail network. 
Gold Plus was launched in 2005 and targeted small towns in South India and in January 2017, when the company announced consolidation plans, it had 30 of these stores across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra.
The process of conversion of Gold Plus stores into Tanishq will conclude by the end of the next quarter, Titan said on Friday. 
Titan also opened 24 new CaratLane stores in 2017-18, taking the total count to 36. CaratLane, an digital jeweller, became a subsidiary of Titan after the latter acquired a majority stake in Carat Lane Trading Pvt. Ltd in 2016. 
The company’s watches division had a strong January-March quarter on growth in multi-brand retail formats as well as sales from the e-commerce channel, with the latter now contributing about 10% of the division’s sales. A plethora of products are likely to be launched in the tech-enhanced watches space in the coming financial year, Titan added. 
Under watches, the company sells its products through various retail brands and opened 53 new stores during 2017-18.
Although the government reduced the GST rate on sunglasses to 12% from 18% during the October-December quarter, the sunglasses business continued to underperform, Titan had said in January. It attributed the underperformance of distributors and dealers, remaining wary about stocking the category due to changes in the GST rate. 
On Friday, the company said its sunglasses business continued to remain under pressure while the health of its prescription eyewear business continues to improve.

Kolkata: After paying tribute to the victims of 26/11 Mumbai terror attack with its Eternal Mumbai collection, watchmaker Titan Co.

A limited edition of watches, titled Forever Kolkata Collection, has been launched with four designs featuring the Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, Dakshineshwar Temple and the Bengali script. 
Kolkata: After paying tribute to the victims of 26/11 Mumbai terror attack with its Eternal Mumbai collection, watchmaker Titan Co. Ltd has launched a line themed on Kolkata to celebrate 30 years of the brand’s connection with the city. A limited edition of watches, titled Forever Kolkata Collection, has been launched with four designs featuring the Howrah Bridge, Victoria Memorial, Dakshineshwar Temple and the Bengali script.
Unlike the collection themed on Mumbai, this one is not a social initiative, said Suparna Mitra, chief marketing officer. According to her, the Titan brand was launched in 1987, and one of its oldest stores is still in operation at Park Street in Kolkata. Some 20-30 in-house designers, after spending considerable amount of time in the city, took inspiration from the artistic and cultural elements to come up with the designs, she added.
Titan has launched four variants each for men and women, priced between Rs4,610 and Rs6,920. Mitra said the opening response for the collection has been “good"".
Titan’s associate vice president and regional business head (east) Rajeshwari Srinivasan said in the past 30 years, Titan has sold 20 million watches in the eastern region, half of it in Kolkata.
Across the country, the company sold 200 million timepieces till 2017. Of 480 World of Titan and 180 Fastrack stores nationally, there are 45 Titan stores in West Bengal. In Kolkata alone, the company has 22 Titan and five Fastrack stores.
The new collection will be available only at select stores in Kolkata. Options for customisation under the collection will be available for both men and women at the Park Street store.
Mitra said initially the company is looking to offer 5,000 watches under the Forever Kolkata Collection. However, the collection will be available online to give access to customers across the country. She also said there was no plan to add any new design to this collection at the moment. The company hasn’t decided whether it would create similar collections for other cities."

Bengaluru: Watches and accessories company Titan Co. Ltd said it plans to grow its revenue to Rs50,000 crore by 2022-23.
The company hopes to get to that revenue goal—on a uniform consumer price (UCP) basis—by touching 50 million customers across all its businesses, it said in a filing with the BSE on Friday.
UCP revenues are the sum total of the MRP of all products sold by the company, gross of discounts and channel and franchisee partner payouts that are netted off to arrive at the reported revenue, Titan added.
In 2016-17, Titan earned Rs12,717 crore in revenue. It has not reported results yet for the year that ended 31 March 2017. But going by the 2016-17 numbers, it expects revenue to nearly quadruple by 2022-23.
This is part of a “visioning exercise"" that employees and management of the firm have undergone over the past few months to craft Titan’s top-line aspiration, it said.
Of its Rs50,000 crore target, Rs40,000 is expected to come from its jewellery segment, which also has a target of achieving 10% market share by 2022-23.
Jewellery, mainly sold under the brand name Tanishq, is Titan’s biggest revenue earner. In the October-December quarter, it fetched Rs3,569.86 crore in revenue. The company’s overall revenue during that period was Rs4,296.16 crore.
Titan had set a target of growing its jewellery business to 2.5x of its 2016-17 revenue over 5 years. It has now extended the target by another year to FY 2022-23, and expanded it to the rest of the company, it said on Friday.
Other business divisions - watches, accessories, eyewear, fragrances, and new business including its handloom apparel division Taneira - are expected to contribute the remaining Rs10,000 crore in revenue by 2022-23.
At 12.46pm, Titan shares were up 1.18% to Rs988.25 on BSE, while the Sensex gained 0.49% to 34,267.20 points."
64,2018-04-16,Titan,"Technology firms, those ground-breaking companies with research teams hard at work building moats, are more highly prized than media counterparts that merely provide content

Taipei/Hong Kong:Tech or media? What to many people is an esoteric question could end up making a multibillion-dollar difference to Chinese companies that serve up content ranging from jokes to gossip. 
Taipei/Hong Kong:Tech or media? What to many people is an esoteric question could end up making a multibillion-dollar difference to Chinese companies that serve up content ranging from jokes to gossip.
Technology firms, those ground-breaking companies with research teams hard at work building moats, are more highly prized than media counterparts that merely provide content. In the S&P 500, for example, tech firms trade as high as 30 times earnings, with software players leading the field—a handy premium over media companies at 17.5 times. 
Facebook Inc. feels this pain. A drop in its P/E ratio was exacerbated by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which reminded the world that advertising is the company’s business model. From 32 times forward earnings two years ago, Zuckerberg’s monster is now trading at 17.9 times. 
In China, there no longer seems to be any debate on the matter.
Since Beijing can (and often does) step in to decide what’s allowed across search, social media and news, it’s clear that regulators see these companies as more than just technology providers offering a neutral platform.
China wants tech companies on its stock exchanges and is prepared to roll out the red carpet to make that happen, including possibly introducing Chinese depositary receipts. Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group was the beneficiary of this warm welcome when its Foxconn Industrial Internet Co. unit won listing approval in record time.
Foxconn is just the kind of company President Xi Jinping wants.
Vulgar content, not so much. That’s the label regulators gave to Neihan Duanzi, an app developed by Toutiao, one of the country’s hippest startups. The forum for sometimes off-color jokes, and other apps including some run by Tencent Holdings Ltd., was ordered to shut last week.
Weibo Corp. made clear it’s a media company when it announced April 13 that it would delete posts relating to gay culture as part of a three-month “cleanup,"" prompting a swift backlash from users.
Yet Weibo’s 125% rally over the last year—to a market value exceeding that of Twitter Inc. —puts the stock at 41 times 2018 earnings, in the realm of tech companies, not media players. Analysts see Weibo’s revenue growing 57% this year, with EPS rising 76%.
Startups are also thinking a little highly of themselves. Toutiao parent Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., which counts Sequoia Capital China, DST Global and Source Code Capital as investors, is already valued at $11 billion, according to CB Insights. But unicorn status and four rounds of funding clearly aren’t enough: The Information reported in December that Bytedance is looking to a $30 billion valuation. 
China is now fast-tracking the IPO process for technology companies and easing profitability requirements. But here’s the rub: The innovative companies Beijing wants must operate in fields of importance to national security, such as big data, cloud computing and artificial intelligence. Silly jokes and human rights don’t count.
So listed companies had better prepare for new valuation models. And startups might be better off not even attempting a Chinese IPO. Bloomberg

Shares of Titan Co. Ltd touched a 52-week high during trading hours on Wednesday, also the occasion of Akshaya Tritya, considered auspicious for gold purchases. The stock’s pricey though. Valuations at 59 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year (FY19) continue to be stretched. But investors aren’t losing sleep over it. 
Shares of Titan Co. Ltd touched a 52-week high during trading hours on Wednesday, also the occasion of Akshaya Tritya, considered auspicious for gold purchases. The stock’s pricey though. Valuations at 59 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year (FY19) continue to be stretched. But investors aren’t losing sleep over it.
Titan, which derives a lion’s share of its overall revenues from jewellery sales, is in a sweet spot. After the Nirav Modi-Gitanjali Gems scam came to light, it is natural that consumers would seek brands that they think are trustworthy. In that backdrop, Titan being from the house of Tatas offers comfort.
In its quarterly update earlier this month, the company had said, “Regulatory developments like GST (goods and services tax) implementation, continuous drive against unaccounted wealth and the more recent developments related to the credit situation of the jewellers, will pose serious challenges for the jewellery industry in India."" 
Titan also acknowledged that the same situations will prove to be tailwinds for organized corporate jewellers like itself with strong balance sheets.
Market share gains as a result of the above developments are expected to benefit the company. Last week, Titan said it intends to clock Rs40,000 crore worth of revenue in the jewellery business based on the maximum retail price by FY23 with about 10% market share of the industry. Currently, the company’s market share is at about 5%. But whether its market share will double in the next five years is a key question.
According to analysts from JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, this maths, however, would peg the size of the total jewellery market in the country at $61-62 billion in FY23 (estimated) versus approximately $37 billion at present and implies an intrinsic growth of 8-9% per annum over each of the next five years for the total market. 
“We note, however, that while the total gold demand in the country did grow at about 11% CAGR over the last 10 years in value terms, the industry actually shrunk in size in the last 5 years (value-terms),"" wrote the analysts in a report on 13 April. CAGR is compound annual growth rate.
Titan has also extended its 2.5 times jewellery revenue target by a year to FY18-FY23. The earlier guidance was for FY17-FY22. Simply put, the company plans to grow jewellery revenues at a CAGR of 20% for the next five years. Analysts expect the jewellery segment to have increased by 25% in FY18.
For investors, even as the outlook remains favourable from a near-term perspective, how the jewellery market share gains pan out will be the key in the long run."

Bengaluru: Titan Co Ltd’s net profit soared 70.86% as the watches business division recorded its highest-ever profit, even as the jewellery segment continued to be the major driving force behind the company’s overall growth rates.
Consolidated net profit at the company grew to Rs304.41 crore during the fourth quarter of 2017-18, up from Rs178.16 crore a year ago. Revenue grew 11.7% to Rs4,125.69 crore year-over-year.
“The Company achieved excellent top-line and bottom line growth in the jewellery and watches business. The jewellery business scaled new heights in terms of revenue growth and profitability. The business gained from tailwinds provided by regulatory developments like GST,"" Bhaskar Bhat, managing director of Titan, said in a statement filed with the BSE on Thursday.
Jewellery accounted for over 80% of Titan’s total revenue in 2017-18.
The implementation of the goods and services tax (GST) was expected to benefit organised jewellers in the long-run, even as some small jewellers in the unorganised market were forced to shut shop, unable to keep up with compliance costs and faced with a migration of customers to the organised space.
But Titan, in particular, gained another unexpected advantage this year. After the Mehul Choksi- Gitanjali Gems Ltd fraud was brought to light by state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) in February, many jewellery companies lost their shine. Raising money also became a challenge for the industry as banks tightened scrutiny.
Titan – with its Tata Group backing - has since been listed by analysts as the jewellery company that stands to gain the most from the ensuing chaos in the sector, in the organised as well as the unorganised space.
Seemingly lending credibility to that prediction, profits at Titan’s jewellery segment jumped 60% to Rs424.68 crore during the January-March quarter. Revenue from the sales of jewellery, mainly sold under its Tanishq brand, grew 13.6% to Rs2,955.42 crore.
While jewellery has been doing much of the heavy lifting for Titan, this quarter the watches business also reported strong numbers. Although revenue at this division declined 2.5% on a consolidated basis, profits nearly tripled to Rs1,744 crore.
“The Watches business had a great year too with the recrafting strategy resulting in the highest top-line growth in recent years, a jump in margins and the highest ever profit,"" Bhat said in the statement.
For the watches segment, encouraging growth in modern large-format stores and e-commerce, the launch of new licensed brands and the success of the company’s Fastrack smart band, Reflex, were the drivers, the company said.
Titan’s overall consolidated revenue for 2017-18 grew 20.75% to Rs16,244.81 crore. Last month, the company had set itself a revenue target of Rs50,000 crore by 2022-23. It had 1,480 stores and over 1.9 million sq ft of retail space as of 31 March.
In a separate filing, Titan said Noel Tata - nominee of Tata Sons Limited - has been appointed as vice chairman of the board. 
Titan also said Shilpa Prabhakar Satish, a nominee of Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation Limited, has resigned from the board with effect from 10 May. B. Santhanam has been appointed as an independent director on the board, subject to the approval of shareholders, Titan added."

In a stock exchange filing, the company said the group, called the leadership development council, will create succession and development plans for CXOs and key management personnel. 
Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd Monday said its board has formed a sub-group for succession planning. In a stock exchange filing, the company said the group, called the leadership development council, will create succession and development plans for CXOs and key management personnel.
In a recent interview, Bhaskar Bhat, who has led Titan as managing director for 16 years, had told Mint that he will retire by the end of 2019. The Titan stock exchange filing, though, did not mention Bhat.
The company also reiterated its aspiration to achieve Rs50,000 crore revenue in five years, of which Rs40,000 crore is expected to come from jewellery.
Bhat has been associated with Titan since 1983, when the company was called the Tata Watch Project, and later Titan Watches Ltd. He became MD of the re-christened Titan Co. Ltd on 1 April, 2002. He turns 64 later this year.
“If you look at the last 16 years, Titan’s performance has been fantastic. I think their market capitalisation would have grown 100 times if not more. And he (Bhat) obviously has some credit because he has been the leader,"" said Harminder Sahni, founder and managing director of retail consultancy Wazir Advisors. Titan’s market capitalisation on 1 April, 2002 was Rs228.93 crore. It has grown over 350 times since and stands at Rs82,297.78 crore today, according to Bloomberg data.
The leadership development council will also participate in review discussions, mentor specific individuals and run programmes that target young and emerging leaders, apart from those aimed at the senior and top management, Titan said on Monday.
In April, the company announced its five-year plan and said it hoped to get to its Rs50,000 crore revenue target by touching 50 million customers across all its businesses. Of that, it is targeting 10 million customers just for its jewellery segment – its largest revenue earner.
Titan’s overall consolidated revenue for 2017-18 grew 20.75% to Rs16,244.81 crore, with jewellery accounting for over 80% of that.
The company is also looking to ramp up its market share in the organised jewellery space to 10%. Demand for jewellery from the Rs10-50 lakh income group, in particular, is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 23%, Titan said.
Wedding and high-value diamond jewellery are two segments that the company views as key growth opportunities, while expanding its share in cities where it currently has a lower presence compared with competition."

Bengaluru:Watches and accessories company Titan Co Ltd has benefited from the recent churn in the jewellery industry, a top company executive said.
Ever since the Nirav Modi-Mehul Choksi scandal tainted the jewellery sector in India, the entire spectrum, from small and medium jewellers to listed chains, has been severely impacted.
One exception so far has been Tata group-owned Titan. Analysts believe that the company will not only ride out the crisis, but may even gain from it. The company has seen an uptick in the number of new customers, especially high-net worth individuals (HNIs), besides an increase in the average bill size of first-time buyers.
“Customers, particularly high-net worth individuals, were unsettled because of demonetisation, the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), and then Nirav Modi. There was a lot of fear about national jewellers...after the PNB (Punjab National Bank) and Gitanjali issue,"" C.K. Venkataraman, Titan’s jewellery division head, said in an interview.
In February, India’s second-largest state-run lender PNB said it had been defrauded of about $2 billion by two jewellery groups, one controlled by Nirav Modi and the other by Choksi. 
Gitanjali allegedly also sold substandard and fake diamonds to its customers.
A month after the PNB fraud came to light, there were reports that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had unearthed another bank fraud of Rs824.15 crore involving Chennai-based jewellery chain Kanishk Gold Pvt Ltd.
Soon after, stock prices of jewellery firms were severely hit, while banks started avoiding jewellers. Consumer sentiment and behaviour, too, changed. 
In fact, the scandals could not have come at a worse time for the sector, given that it was reeling under the impact of demonetisation, the goods and service tax (GST) and the PMLA.
However, amid all the gloom, Titan was viewed as a trustworthy corporate. According to Venkataraman, the company’s jewellery business, retailed under the Tanishq brand, gained substantially on brand recall and preference. “The on-ground sales performance and customer behaviour in stores are reconfirming that.""
The buying capacity of first-time customers, who would earlier spend Rs30,000-40,000 at Tanishq outlets, has gone up to Rs3-5 lakh.
Besides the Tatas, jewellers such as PC Chandra, Raikars, Malabar Gold, Joyalukkas, and GRT, also have a strong brand presence. 
According to analysts, this may help Titan’s jewellery division achieve its 2022-23 target of clocking 2.5 times annual revenue growth from 2017-18 to touch Rs40,000 crore, and gain a 10% market share in the organised jewellery space from the existing 5%.
“Titan’s jewellery segment recorded good sales on very successful diamond jewellery activation as well as resounding reception to the revised gold exchange policy launched in March 2018, which is now even more attractive to customers. 
Ticket sizes increased nicely in FY18 as well as Q4FY18. Wedding and studded jewellery contribute around one-third of overall business. Footfall has gone up, but larger delta has come from improvement in ticket sizes,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities wrote in a research report."
58,2018-06-08,Titan,"CaratLane's revenue grew more than 60% in 2017-18, Titan had said in its March quarter results declared on 10 May

Two years after the acquisition of CaratLane Trading Pvt. Ltd, watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd has witnessed significant contribution from the jewellery business to its overall revenue, said a top company executive. 
Two years after the acquisition of CaratLane Trading Pvt. Ltd, watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd has witnessed significant contribution from the jewellery business to its overall revenue, said a top company executive.
“CaratLane’s financial performance is going as planned. You have to bet on the long-term and we are quite satisfied with the acquisition. There is total alignment now between the founder of CaratLane and Titan,"" Titan’s jewellery division head C.K. Venkataraman said in an interview.
CaratLane’s revenue grew more than 60% in 2017-18, Titan had said in a filing with the BSE on 10 May, when it reported its quarterly numbers. It was the first time that the firm had announced the growth numbers for CaratLane separately. Titan had acquired a majority stake in CaratLane for an undisclosed all-cash deal from Tiger Global Management in 2016. On the day of announcement of the deal, Titan reported disappointing fourth quarter results for 2015-16, with its biggest revenue earner, the jewellery business, struggling for over a year, primarily because of a host of policy changes.
For instance, Titan was forced to discontinue its Golden Harvest Scheme in July 2014 after the Companies Act termed it a public deposit scheme. With the dust settling on the policy front, the company’s jewellery unit’s growth is also back on track.
The primary reason behind Titan’s decision to buy CaratLane, however, was to target a younger audience, and that continues to hold good even today. Titan has, in fact, allowed CaratLane to operate independently from its Chennai and Mumbai offices. It is still run by the founding team led by co-founder and chief executive officer Mithun Sancheti.
“We bought CaratLane because of the brand, the customer segment it was focusing on, the technology platform that they had put together and because of the entrepreneurial group and spirit. We acquired it because we felt some of it would either take us a very long time to build or it would be virtually impossible to create on our own,"" said Venkataraman.
According to Venkataraman, the young women shoppers space and the gifting segment is set to explode over the next 10 years, and CaratLane is going to be right at the centre of that boom.
While Titan’s flagship jewellery brand Tanishq operates in the premium segment, there is some overlap, given that CaratLane competes with Mia, a Tanishq sub-brand. However, there are enough young women customers for both brands to operate in the space without thinking, let alone worrying, about overlaps, said Venkataraman.
CaratLane has essentially been an online jewellery platform. However, the high average transaction size of Rs17,000-18,000 has led it to ramp up its offline presence with 22 new stores in 2017-18 to take the store count to 36."

Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd expects its jewellery division to fetch  ₹ 40,000 crore out of an overall  ₹ 50,000 crore revenue by 2022-23, its annual report noted. 
Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd expects its jewellery division to fetch  ₹ 40,000 crore out of an overall  ₹ 50,000 crore revenue by 2022-23, its annual report noted.
Titan’s total revenue grew 20.44% in 2017-18 to  ₹ 15,656 crore, of which jewellery sales fetched  ₹ 13,036 crore. The company’s profit after tax soared 52.62% to  ₹ 1,163 crore during the period. 
The company has set several smaller goals for its jewellery division over the next five years to reach its 2023 target. These include strengthening the contribution from the wedding segment to 50% (currently 35%) and increasing the revenue from new products to 45% by 2022-23 (currently 31%).
Titan’s flagship jewellery brand Tanishq is among the leaders in the market. But it does not have a significant presence in the wedding jewellery segment, something the company is looking to change.
Last year, Titan launched a sub-brand under Tanishq called Rivaah, solely targeting the wedding segment. It also created prominent wedding zones at many of its retail stores, with the aim of drawing customers and to communicate that Tanishq has a large wedding jewellery portfolio. 
Titan also expects the high-value diamond jewellery business to fetch half of its overall jewellery sales by 2022-23, up from the current 30%. 
In 2017-18, Titan’s jewellery division recorded its best-ever performance. Both revenue growth and same-store-sales growth in the jewellery business grew 20% in 2017-18, despite the year ending on a sour note for most domestic jewellers.
In February, India’s second-largest state-run lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) said it had been cheated of about $2 billion by two jewellery groups, one controlled by Nirav Modi and the other by Mehul Choksi. The scandal sparked a collapse in the share prices of several jewellers. 
However, Titan proved to be an exception. In the aftermath of the scandal, analysts not only expected Titan to ride out the crisis but even said it stood to gain from it. And in June, Titan’s jewellery business head C.K. Venkataraman told Mint the company had already begun to see an uptick in new customers, especially among the high-net worth individuals (HNIs) segment, besides an increase in the average bill size of first-time buyers.
However, the road ahead could be bumpy. On 4 July, in a stock exchange filing, Titan spoke of the soft patch the jewellery industry is going through. Gold imports declined during the first five months of the year, led by a drop in demand for bullion and to some extent because of weak consumer sentiment, Titan said in that filing."

“We might collaborate and take some of these start-ups and forward ideas may be with our company or with other Tata group companies. There is an opportunity for us to leverage it. It gives us a wide canvas,"" said Revathi Kant, chief design officer of Titan.
Nearly a year ago, Titan initiated the Product Design Award calling for entries that have a social impact. The company got 993 entries of which 121 applicants were asked to submit a detailed plan. From these, 18 were shortlisted and presented to a jury, chaired by Harish Bhat who is brand custodian of Tata group, which then selected eight winners.
The winners included U-Sense, a company that has created a credit card-sized test, for sensing UTI infection quickly using nano-fibre technology at a cost of  ₹ 30 per unit. There was another that tested eight parameters of diabetes called Anupath, offering a small palm-sized solution for a mobile solution. The companies in the field of water conservation and waste water recycling included Nanosolution, a one step low cost solution to treat waste water and Zerodor, a manufacturer of waterless urinals, save 1.5 lakh litres in one PAN per year.

Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co.

Titan’s standalone profit for the June quarter rose to  ₹ 349.17 crore from  ₹ 266.91 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue for the quarter grew 7.40% to  ₹ 4,354.52 crore. 
Bengaluru: Watches and accessories maker Titan Co. Ltd reported a near 31%rise in its net profit for the quarter ended 30 June on increased demand and sales of all key product categories—jewellery, watches and eyewear. Titan’s standalone profit for the June quarter rose to  ₹ 349.17 crore from  ₹ 266.91 crore in the year-ago period. Revenue for the quarter grew 7.40% to  ₹ 4,354.52 crore.
“This has been a great quarter for us recording a growth of over 31% in PBT (profit before tax). All our core businesses have shown a healthy growth in profit in addition to market share gains,"" said Bhaskar Bhat, managing director, Titan.
In the quarter, Titan’s growth was mainly driven by strong profits from its jewellery business. The company’s jewellery products, sold mostly under the brand name Tanishq, typically rake in around 80% of total revenue. Revenue from the division grew 5.65% to  ₹ 3,571.66 crore during the first quarter, even as profits from jewellery sales increased 16.12% to  ₹ 393.38 crore.
“The jewellery industry went through a soft patch in the first quarter with decline in imports of gold by 39%. Despite the single digit revenue growth of our jewellery business in Q1, the profits grew by a healthy 16%,"" Bhat said.
After the Nirav Modi-Mehul Choksi scandal tainted the jewellery sector in India in February, the entire spectrum, from small and medium jewellers to listed chains, had been severely impacted. But the Tata Group-owned Titan stood to gain from that fallout as it was perceived to be a more trustworthy brand by analysts and consumers alike.
In June, Titan said it had already begun to see an uptick in the number of new customers, especially high-net worth individuals (HNIs), besides an increase in the average bill size of first-time buyers.
The company’s confidence in the growth opportunity for its jewellery business even prompted it to set ambitious targets for the division by 2022-23. In its annual report, Titan said it expects the jewellery division to fetch  ₹ 40,000 crore out its overall revenue target of  ₹ 0,000 crore by 2022-23.
Both the watches and eyewear business divisions also propped up Titan’s performance in the first quarter of 2018-19. Revenue from the watches business grew 14.86% to Rs593.52 crore, while eyewear revenue grew 16.43% to Rs131.57 crore.
“The company has put together plans to stimulate demand for all its product categories through innovative advertising campaigns and new product launches in the coming quarters,"" said Bhat."
53,2018-08-07,Titan,"What hurt Titan's Q1 results was that consumer sentiment remained weak in June. Higher gold prices may have discouraged them from purchases, and there were fewer wedding days than usual

Titan Co. Ltd’s profit wasn’t boosted by the jewellery business this time around. Growth in the segment slowed to 5.7% year-on-year for the June quarter (Q1). Sure, the base was high. Even so, jewellery segment performance fell short of the management’s own internal targets and disappointed the Street. For the sake of comparison, the segment had seen 24% growth for fiscal year 2018. 
Titan Co. Ltd’s profit wasn’t boosted by the jewellery business this time around. Growth in the segment slowed to 5.7% year-on-year for the June quarter (Q1). Sure, the base was high. Even so, jewellery segment performance fell short of the management’s own internal targets and disappointed the Street. For the sake of comparison, the segment had seen 24% growth for fiscal year 2018.
As mentioned earlier, the base was unfavourable with jewellery segment revenue increasing by an impressive 54% in the June 2017 quarter. The quarter had included advancement of sales (worth  ₹ 250 crore) in anticipation of a high goods and services tax rate.
Coming back to Q1 FY19, what also hurt Titan’s growth was that consumer sentiment remained weak in the month of June. Higher gold prices may have discouraged some consumers from purchases and there were fewer wedding days than usual.
According to the management, industry revenue declined 10-25% year-on-year and Titan gained market share in line with expectations, even as reported growth was 10 percentage points below internal expectations, pointed out analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities in a report on 3 August.
The company’s earnings presentation says gold grammage declined 3% during the June quarter from a year earlier. That was the poorest performance seen in the last seven quarters.
It helped that Titan’s watch business compensated a bit, with Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) more than doubling (up 128%) to  ₹  111.32 crore. Watch segment revenue grew by 15%. Ebit margin at 18.8% was the highest in the past 13 quarters at least, helped by a better product mix and cost-control measures. However, sustainability of these margins will be a factor to watch out for. Also, the watch business doesn’t move the needle meaningfully for Titan given its much smaller share of revenue (13.6% of total for the June quarter). Jewellery segment revenue accounted for 82% of the total last quarter.
Overall, Titan’s stand-alone revenue and net profit increased 8% and 31% to  ₹ 4,319 crore and  ₹ 349 crore, respectively.
What of the stock?
Titan’s shares have underperformed the Sensex so far this fiscal year. But investors haven’t really lost out. In the past one year, the stock has appreciated as much as 57% from its annual closing low seen on 28 September. Not surprisingly, valuations are steep. Currently, the stock trades at 55 times estimated earnings, based on Bloomberg data. For valuations to sustain at these levels, the jewellery segment performance has to recover on a consistent basis. 
Investors should also keep a tab on any sharp spike in gold prices. In any case, Titan’s valuations suggest most of the good news is baked into the price."

Doug Field, who stepped down as the senior vice president of engineering at Telsa Inc last month, is returning to Apple Inc, Apple told Reuters on Thursday.
Field will be working with Apple executive Bob Mansfield, who has been heading up Apple’s self-driving car program, Project Titan. Field and Mansfield previously worked together on engineering Apple’s line of Mac computers.
Field has spent the past five years at Tesla. In April, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk said in a tweet that he had asked Field to manage the company’s engineering and production while Musk focused more time on Model 3 production.
But in May, reports emerged that Field was leaving the carmaker, which has raced to meet production targets for the Model 3. At the time, Tesla said Field was “just taking some time off to recharge and spend time with his family. He has not left Tesla.""
In July, Tesla announced that Field had left Tesla.
Apple has said little about the scope of its self-driving car project, but court documents filed last month said that as many as 5,000 people were authorized inside the company to access information about the project."

New Delhi: More than two decades after Tata group entered the jewellery business, it wants its brand Tanishq to take a big leap, and multiply revenue by more than 2.5 times in five years. The big target comes with a sharp shift in strategy aiming to multiply the ticket size. 
New Delhi: More than two decades after Tata group entered the jewellery business, it wants its brand Tanishq to take a big leap, and multiply revenue by more than 2.5 times in five years. The big target comes with a sharp shift in strategy aiming to multiply the ticket size.
Tata group entity Titan Co. Ltd, which has built the Tanishq brand with a pointed focus on progressive and independent (working) Indian women and teenagers since it started business in 1996, will now focus on the big, fat Indian wedding market that accounts for more than 50% of the jewellery market.
“Weddings are big business in India. If you do not have a significant presence in the wedding market, you are not a jeweller,"" said Sandeep Kulhalli, senior vice-president (retail and marketing), jewellery division, Titan Co.
However, the existing lines and sub-brands that target independent and progressive Indian women will continue, he said.
By FY23, Kulhalli said, wedding as a segment will account for more than 60% of Tanishq business. Titan Co, in its last annual report for FY18, said it aims to grow revenue to  ₹ 50,000 crore by FY23 with  ₹ 40,000 crore coming from its jewellery business. That means, Titan’s target is to generate at least  ₹ 24,000 crore from wedding jewellery by FY23.
That’s a huge jump from around  ₹ 1,886 crore, or around 20% of Tanishq’s revenue in FY15. To focus on India’s wedding jewellery market, Titan had in March 2017 launched sub-brand Rivaah and created special wedding zones at each Tanishq store.
“Tanishq has the consumer trust, which has been built over the years. The focus on wedding jewellery, coupled with the marketing campaigns around it, is working really well for us,"" added Kulhalli.
At present, there are 265 Tanishq outlets and the company will add 30-40 outlets each year under the franchisee route, said Kulhalli. By FY23, the company plans to have 400 outlets across 250 towns, up from 250 across 150 towns in FY18, according to its annual report.
Besides Tanishq, the company will add 25-30 new outlets of Mia, a sub-brand of Tanishq that was created for workwear jewellery in 2011. “We also have our exquisite diamond boutique brand Zoya. We’ll add one more outlet of Zoya this year,"" said Kulhalli. At present, there are four Zoya outlets."
49,2018-09-18,Titan,"Investors should watch for sales performance in the festive season (the December quarter) and whether it brings some positive surprises

Shares of Titan Co. Ltd have underperformed the BSE 100 index considerably this fiscal year. That does not however mean that valuations have become attractive. Currently, the stock trades at 49.5 times estimated earnings for FY19, according to Bloomberg data. And, that’s not cheap. 
Shares of Titan Co. Ltd have underperformed the BSE 100 index considerably this fiscal year. That does not however mean that valuations have become attractive. Currently, the stock trades at 49.5 times estimated earnings for FY19, according to Bloomberg data. And, that’s not cheap.
However, after a miserable June quarter performance, things could well be looking up for the company. “Our channel checks across several Tanishq stores suggest strong demand over the last two months,"" wrote Amit Sinha of Macquarie Capital Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd, in a 14 September report. Tanishq is Titan’s flagship jewellery brand, which contributes at least three-fourths of its total revenue.
Revenue performance of the jewellery business took a beating in the June quarter, growing at just 5.7% year-on-year over a high base last year. The performance lagged the management’s internal targets, and disappointed Street estimates as well.
Nonetheless, management commentary on jewellery growth in July during the June quarter earnings call was encouraging. Titan said sales in July surged 70% compared with the year-earlier period, aided partly by a lower base. The company maintained its 25% jewellery revenue growth guidance for the remaining three quarters of FY19. Investors should watch for sales performance in the festive season (the December quarter) and whether it brings some positive surprises.
Separately, it helps that the risk of an adverse regulation on gold compared to the last rupee crisis appears lower. Gold imports as a percentage of trade deficit have come down from about 40% during the 2013 rupee crisis to about 15% currently, said Macquarie Capital. “Also, with a 10% import duty the risk of a meaningful increase is lower, as the government would need to balance it with the risk of higher smuggling,"" it added. Still, sharp increases or decreases in gold prices are never good for demand and that will be a key measure to follow.
The company’s second major business is watches, which have done relatively better in the June quarter. But it has a smaller share of overall business and, hence, does not have a big impact as such.
What’s important is that even as Titan’s shares have fallen by 12% so far in FY19, investors haven’t lost out, if one takes a slightly longer time frame. In the last one year, from its closing low on 28 September, the stock has appreciated 43%. 
Titan is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of the shift to the organized market from the unorganized one. While higher valuations could restrict meaningful expansion from current levels, if the jewellery business performs better than expectations, investors might be happy to give it some brownie points."

Bengaluru: Watches and accessories company Titan Co Ltd reported an 8.34% growth in consolidated profit while total revenue jumped significantly during the July-September quarter, led by sales growth in all key product segments.
But the Tata group company’s standalone net profit growth rate for the quarter was a muted 5% on a year-ago basis. Titan listed two reasons for that subdued growth rate - an  ₹ 29 crore provision for investments it made as part of Treasury operations in inter-corporate deposits in the IL&FS group, and certain one-time franchisee compensations due to store takeovers in the jewellery segment.
In June, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) group’s transport arm, IL&FS Transportation Networks Ltd (ITNL), delayed repayment of  ₹ 450 crore of inter-corporate deposits from the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), triggering a ratings downgrade from Icra and CARE on ITNL’s debt papers. IL&FS group and units subsequently defaulted on several other payment obligations.
Consolidated net profit at Titan was  ₹ 301.11 crore in the second quarter, compared with  ₹ 277.93 crore last year. Total income stood at  ₹ 4,595.13 crore during the quarter, up from  ₹ 3,603.01 crore in the same quarter a year ago.
Revenue and profit growth were led by Titan’s largest segment, jewellery, sold mainly under the Tanishq brand. Income from the jewellery segment grew 29.02% to  ₹ 3,645.07 crore on an annual basis.
“The company has done well across all its businesses in the second quarter, delivering 26% growth over last year. The jewellery business picked up this quarter after a soft first quarter and the watches business had one of its best quarters with an extremely healthy growth in bottom line for the first half. The eyewear business has picked up too with our investments in brand building showing results now,"" Titan’s managing director Bhaskar Bhat said in a statement filed with the BSE on Friday."
47,2018-11-13,Titan,"Stan Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when he created superheroes who would enthral generations of young readers

Stan Lee, who dreamed up Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and a cavalcade of other Marvel Comics superheroes that became mythic figures in pop culture with soaring success at the movie box office, died at the age of 95, his daughter said on Monday. As a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would enthral generations of young readers. 
Stan Lee, who dreamed up Spider-Man, Iron Man, the Hulk and a cavalcade of other Marvel Comics superheroes that became mythic figures in pop culture with soaring success at the movie box office, died at the age of 95, his daughter said on Monday. As a writer and editor, Lee was key to the ascension of Marvel into a comic book titan in the 1960s when, in collaboration with artists such as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, he created superheroes who would enthral generations of young readers.
Lee’s daughter J.C. Lee confirmed the death to Reuters.
Americans were familiar with superheroes before Lee, in part thanks to the 1938 launch of Superman by Detective Comics, the company that would become DC Comics, Marvel’s archrival.
Lee was widely credited with adding a new layer of complexity and humanity to superheroes. His characters were not made of stone—even if they appeared to have been chiseled from granite. They had love and money worries and endured tragic flaws or feelings of insecurity.
“I felt it would be fun to learn a little about their private lives, about their personalities and show that they are human as well as super,"" Lee told NPR News in 2010.
He had help in designing the superheroes but he took full ownership of promoting them.
His creations included web-slinging teenager Spider-Man, the muscle-bound Hulk, mutant outsiders The X-Men, the close-knit Fantastic Four and the playboy-inventor Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man.
Dozens of Marvel Comics movies, with nearly all the major characters Lee created, were produced in the first decades of the 21st century, grossing over $20 billion at theatres worldwide, according to box office analysts.
Spider-Man is one of the most successfully licensed characters ever and he has soared through the New York skyline as a giant inflatable in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Lee, as a hired hand at Marvel, received limited payback on the windfall from his characters.
In a 1998 contract, he wrestled a clause for 10% of profits from movies and TV shows with Marvel characters. In 2002, he sued to claim his share, months after Spider-Man conquered movie theatres. In a legal settlement three years later, he received a $10 million one-time payment.
Hollywood studios made superheroes the cornerstone of their strategy of producing fewer films and relying on big profits from blockbusters. Some people assumed that, as a result, Lee’s wealth had soared. He disputed that.
“I don’t have $200 million. I don’t have $150 million. I don’t have $100 million or anywhere near that,"" Lee told Playboy magazine in 2014. Having grown up in the Great Depression, Lee added that he was “happy enough to get a nice paycheck and be treated well"".
In 2008, Lee was awarded the National Medal of Arts, the highest government award for creative artists.
Uncle’s help
Lee was born as Stanley Martin Lieber in New York on 28 December 1922, the son of Jewish immigrants from Romania. At age 17, he became an errand boy at Timely Comics, the company that would evolve into Marvel. He got the job with help from an inside connection, his uncle, according to Lee’s autobiography “Excelsior!""
Lee soon earned writing duties and promotions. He penned Western stories and romances, as well as superhero tales, and often wrote standing on the porch of the Long Island, New York, home he shared with his wife, actress Joan Lee, whom he married in 1947 and who died in 2017.
The couple had two children, Joan Celia born in 1950 and Jan Lee who died within three days of her birth in 1953.
In 1961, Lee’s boss saw a rival publisher’s success with caped crusaders and told Lee to dream up a superhero team.
Lee at the time felt comics were a dead-end career. But his wife urged him to give it one more shot and create the complex characters he wanted to, even if it led to his firing.
The result was the Fantastic Four. There was stretchable Mr. Fantastic, his future wife Invisible Woman, her brother the Human Torch and strongman The Thing. They were like a devoted but dysfunctional family.
“Stan’s characters were always superheroes that had a certain amount of humanity about them or a flaw,"" said Shirrel Rhoades, a former executive vice president of Marvel and its publisher in the mid-1990s.
“As iconic as Superman may be, he’s considered a Boy Scout. He doesn’t have any real flaws,"" Rhoades said. “Whereas you take a Spider-Man, kids identify with him because he had his problems like they did. He suffered from great angst.""
Lee involved his artists in the process of creating the story and even the characters themselves, in what would come to be known as the “Marvel Method"". It sometimes led critics to fault Lee for taking credit for ideas not entirely his own.
He described his creative process to Reuters in outlining how he came up with his character Thor, the god of thunder borrowed from Norse mythology.
“I was trying to think of something that would be totally different,"" he said. “What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god?""
To give Thor more rhetorical punch, Lee gave him dialogue styled after the Bible and Shakespeare.
As for Tony Stark-Iron Man, he was based on industrialist Howard Hughes, Lee told interviewers.
The soapbox
Lee became Marvel’s publisher in 1972. He went on the lecture circuit, moved to Los Angeles in 1980 and pursued opportunities for his characters in movies and television.
Through it all, he kept connected with fans, writing a column called Stan’s Soapbox in which he often slipped in his catchphrase “Nuff Said"" or the sign-off “Excelsior!"" In his later years, he gave constant updates via Twitter.
“Stan was a character. He was a character as much as any he ever created,"" Rhoades said. “He created himself, in a way.""
He also made cameos in most Marvel films, pulling a girl away from falling debris in 2002’s Spider-Man and serving as an emcee at a strip club in 2016’s Deadpool.
The Walt Disney Co. bought Marvel Entertainment in 2009 for $4 billion in a deal to expand Disney’s roster of characters, with the most iconic ones having been Lee’s handiwork.
By that point, Lee had all but parted ways with Marvel after being made a chairman emeritus of the company. But even in his 80s and 90s, Lee was a wellspring of new projects, running a company called POW! Entertainment.
“His greatest legacy will be not only the co-creation of his characters but the way he helped to build the culture that comics have become, which is a pretty significant one,"" said Robert Thompson, a pop culture expert at Syracuse University."

On a dull Monday when the Sensex fell 1%, Titan Co.

On a dull Monday when the Sensex fell 1%, Titan Co. Ltd’s stock went up by 5.3% despite the September quarter results—announced after market hours on Friday—showing a 210 basis point contraction in the Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin to 10.6%. One hundred basis points equal one percentage point.
There were a few one-off costs. “Adjusting for the one-offs during the quarter, the Ebitda margin for the quarter was 11.3%, which was significantly lower than our and consensus estimates,"" wrote Naveen Kulkarni of Reliance Securities Ltd in a report on 12 November.
What was commendable was Titan’s revenue growth, which came in at 26% over the year-ago period, led by the performance of its mainstay jewellery business. Second, in the earnings conference call, management commentary regarding the outlook for the December quarter was encouraging. The company expects the festive season to boost performance. The upbeat outlook is exciting for investors, said analysts commenting on the share price rise on Monday.
Jewellery revenues in the September quarter increased by 28.5%, largely driven by the 24% jump in sales volumes. However, jewellery segment Ebit grew at a much slower pace of 6.6% on account of higher advertising spends and a one-time franchisee compensation.
Titan’s second main business, the watch segment, saw encouraging revenues and profitability. Product launches and better merchandise helped watch revenues rise by 17%. Operational costs for the watch business were in check, leading to good margins during the quarter.
Overall, Titan’s reported profit after tax increased by 3% year-on-year to  ₹ 314 crore. 
What of the stock? Despite the positive movement in the share price on Monday, the Titan stock has underperformed the BSE 100 index so far this fiscal year. However, that does not mean valuations are not demanding. The stock trades at 54 times estimated earnings for FY19, according to Bloomberg data. The current quarter outlook is promising, and from a long-term perspective, Titan is expected to benefit from the shift to the organized sector.
Valuations suggest that much of these positives are baked into the price.
What should investors worry about? “While overall topline traction is healthy, it remains volatile depending on consumer sentiment and the overall jewellery market is not growing. This is a concern,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in an 11 November report."

Xiaomi’s Mi band 3 fitness tracker, which was launched in India at the end of September, has quickly become India’s largest selling smart wearable product, the report said.
“The newly launched Mi band 3 became the most shipped wearable product ever in the history of wearables in India,"" the IDC report said. In the third quarter of 2018, Xiaomi maintained its leadership in the market for the 5th consecutive quarter with a 41% market share.
“Although their shipments witnessed a decline of 20% quarter-over-quarter, but it saw a healthy growth of 77% in this quarter when compared to the same time a year ago,"" it said.
IDC’s ‘Quarterly Wearables Device Tracker’ saw two successive quarters of double-digit growth and shipped 102,000 units in the quarter, making it the first quarter to cross the 100,000 units shipment mark in the country.
In the list of top five wearable companies, GOQii holds the second position with 19% market share and remains the leading player in the commercial segment, as two-thirds of its shipments are billed to enterprises under the corporate wellness program.
Fastrack’s Reflex 2.0 helped maintain Titan retain the third spot in the wearables market.
Samsung returned to among the top five wearable companies in India by replacing Fitbit. Samsung bundled Gear Sport and Galaxy Watch with the launch of Samsung Note 9, and later, offered them at a discounted price which helped the brand to acquire a strong momentum in this quarter.
Fossil was able to capture the fifth position in the quarter with the help of Q Explorist Gen 3.
The overall India wearables market saw a 17% year-over-year (YoY) growth in the third quarter of the year as vendors shipped a total of 897,000 units in the country, the report said. However, the overall shipments declined 11% from the previous quarter largely because of the double-digit decline in the basic wearables. 
“It is too early to say that the India wearables market has started moving towards the smart wearables. However, vendors have started analyzing the big pricing gaps between the basic and smart wearables,"" said Jaipal Singh, Associate Research Manager, Client Devices , IDC India."

New Delhi: Taneira, the saree brand from Titan Co. Ltd, is aiming to double its existing business to touch  ₹ 40-45 crore in revenue in 2019, said the company’s managing director Bhaskar Bhat at the launch of brand’s biggest flagship store in New Delhi.
“Our primary target is to open 10 stores in the next 12-18 months in the top 15 cities of the country. Currently, we are doing between  ₹ 30 lakh and  ₹ 70 lakh a month per store. We will end this year with  ₹ 20 crore in revenue, which we want to more than double and take it to  ₹ 45 crore by next year,"" Bhat told Mint.
Spread over 7,500 sq. ft, the store stocks sarees for all occasions, bridal lehengas, stoles, dupattas and dress material. It is also offering ready-to-wear blouses, customization and tailoring services.
Taneria was soft launched in February 2017 at Bengaluru’s upscale Indiranagar, marking its entry into the women’s wear segment. The 6,000 sq. ft handloom store was targeted mostly at the young urban woman looking for traditional Indian weaves with contemporary designs. At present, the it has four stores—two each in Bengaluru and Delhi—including the newly launched store.
Titan wants to reach not just the metros but also Tier I cities where demand for high-quality branded sarees is increasing. The company is looking to open stores in cities such as Mumbai, Hyderabad, Chennai, Patna, Lucknow and Indore.
“Similar to the jewellery market, when we began, this 5,000-year-old category is a large, unorganized market and underserved in terms of authenticity of the product,"" said Bhat. “Seeing the tremendous reception we have had in our pilot stage of the business, we are confident this venture will be an opportunity for us to build relevance and enable transparency and authenticity for the customer.""
With an average ticket size of  ₹ 8,000, Kanchipuram (handwoven silk sarees from Tamil Nadu), Benarasi (silk sarees from Varanasi), Bhagalpuri (silk sarees from Bihar) and south silks are the top selling varieties of sarees at Taneira. The brand is sourcing its products from over 400 weavers’ communities and cooperative societies across India.
Titan is looking to turn the largely unorganized saree business into a organised one by catering to the mid-premium to premium segment of the market with a starting price of  ₹ 2,000, which can go up to  ₹ 2 lakh. The brand competes with organised saree retail chains such as Nalli Silk as well as Meena Bazaar.
According to Rajat Wahi, partner at Deloitte India, sarees—as a category—is exciting but equally challenging because it is stock keeping unit (SKU) intensive, assortment sensitive and has design complexity.
“Besides colour cosmetics, sarees are one of the most complicated categories since a brand has to predict designs and colours which will work across different geographies.The category is also undergoing fundamental changes owing to evolving consumer preferences which makes it even more challenging,"" Wahi said."

40,2019-01-08,Titan,"Titan expects full-year growth in Tanishq, its jewellery business, to be around 22%. This assumes 29% sales growth in second half of 2018-19

Titan Co. Ltd’s pre-quarterly update for the December quarter brought cheers for investors. The company said there was good growth momentum across all its businesses in the seasonally strong third quarter. On a day when broader markets were upbeat, Titan shares touched a high of  ₹ 964 on Monday during market hours, up 3.8% over Friday’s closing price. 
Titan Co. Ltd’s pre-quarterly update for the December quarter brought cheers for investors. The company said there was good growth momentum across all its businesses in the seasonally strong third quarter. On a day when broader markets were upbeat, Titan shares touched a high of  ₹ 964 on Monday during market hours, up 3.8% over Friday’s closing price.
The company said it expects the full-year growth in its jewellery business to be around 22%. This assumes 29% sales growth in the second half of 2018-19.
This is good news considering that the performance of Titan’s mainstay jewellery business hasn’t been particularly impressive for the first two quarters of FY19. During the June quarter, jewellery growth was slow on a high base and fell short of the management’s internal targets. In the September quarter, the business margins had contracted. For the half-year ended September, jewellery revenue increased by about 16% over the same period last year.
To be sure, management comments regarding this year’s festival season were upbeat during its September quarter earnings call. “The Dussehra, Diwali season performance has been very-very encouraging, we are in the (+25%) growth rate in this 30-day period,"" Titan had said during its second quarter call. In that sense, its update on the December quarter may not come as a big surprise for investors. Nonetheless, it does instil some confidence.
On the flip side, outlook on the watch business is not as rosy. “With significantly higher spends on advertising, the EBIT margins in the watches segment will be substantially subdued in Q3,"" says the company. Ebit is earnings before interest and tax.
Eventually, the Titan stock closed 1.7% higher on Monday at  ₹ 944. So far in FY19, it has marginally underperformed the Nifty 500 index by 1.7%. Valuations are on the higher side with the stock trading at 46 times estimated earnings for FY20, shows Bloomberg data. 
Titan is expected to be a key beneficiary of the shift to the organized market. But the stock’s high valuation suggests a good portion of the optimism is baked into the price."
39,2019-01-22,Titan,"External candidates may include those from Tata group firms, says Bhat, who will retire by end-2019At least six other top executives in Titan are also close to hitting retirement age over the next few years

Titan Co. Ltd is considering external as well as internal candidates as part of a formal search to find a successor to long-time managing director Bhaskar Bhat.
Bhat is set to retire by end-2019 after helming India’s largest jewellery and watch retailer for more than 16 years. At least six more top executives in Titan are also close to attaining superannuation over the next few years.
“We’ve already started working on the succession planning. The board has considered internal and external candidates but which one it is likely to be, we don’t know,"" Bhat said, adding that external candidates could include those from other Tata group companies.
The retirements of senior executives is not a concern as Titan has been working to build a strong leadership base just below the top management for the past three years, he said.
Management consultants say if Titan were to look internally, which is what Tata Group companies usually do, then the company may choose one of the larger division heads. Of those, jewellery division head C.K. Venkataraman and watches division head Ravi Kant have an edge, they said.
Jewellery is the company’s biggest revenue earner and Venkataraman has been with Titan since 1990 and worked in the advertising and marketing functions before taking over as his current role in January 2005. Kant has been with Titan since 1988 and has had stints in marketing, retailing and exports, and was also the chief executive of the eyewear division.
But a whole bunch of the top brass – from Venkataraman and Kant, to eyewear CEO Ronnie Talati, chief financial officer S. Subramaniam, human resource head Raj Narayan, and Tanishq’s retail and marketing head Sandeep Kulhalli – will be reaching retirement age (65 for the managing director, 60 for others) over the next few years.
“Titan has a tendency to favour internal candidates. But in this case, since a lot of executives are going to reach retirement age soon, I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if it brings in someone externally. Titan has always been buzzing with innovation and creativity but they have got too much fat at the top. Have they showcased younger talent enough is still a question,"" a management consultant said, requesting anonymity.
Still, the company’s primary instinct will be to choose someone internally, even if it is someone close to retirement, and let them run the show for a few years as it continues to groom the next rung, another consultant said, also requesting not to be named.
No matter which way the search swings, one thing is clear, that the new managing director will have large shoes to fill. When Bhat took over as managing director, Titan was not quite the stellar performer it is today. Overall revenue was  ₹674.45 crore in 2001-02, according to Bloomberg data. In 2017-18, just the watches division generated more than three times that number. Total revenue was  ₹16,244.81 crore in 2017-18.
Bhat has served across various functions at Titan – from sales and marketing to even human resources. He has immense knowledge about the firm, having been with it since the 1980s when it was called the Tata Watch Project. He was instrumental in adding new sub-brands for the companies, including Zoya and Mia in jewellery, setting up the Helios premium watches showrooms and growing the eyewear business. The company also entered the perfume business with its Skinn brand and more recently, the handloom sari segment through Taneira.
“He is extremely hard working, connected with even retailers and distributors on the ground, and is a very hands-on boss. Although much of the vision for Titan was, to be fair, laid out by the founder Xerxes Desai, it was Bhaskar who helped execute that vision,"" said Raghu Viswanath, founder of Vertebrand Management Consulting Pvt. Ltd and a former executive at Titan."
38,2019-02-01,Titan,"Jewellery aside, revenue from other segments also grew in the high double-digitsRevenue from the jewellery business grew 36.95% to Rs4,997.03 crore

BENGALURU :
Watches and accessories maker Titan Co Ltd’s net profit jumped 45.97% while revenue increased 35.35% in the third quarter, mainly due to a strong festive season that boosted demand for all its product categories, led by jewellery.
Consolidated net profit grew to Rs411.09 crore during the October-December quarter of 2018-19 from Rs281.61 crore during the same period last year. Total revenue increased to Rs5,934.11 crore from Rs4,384.40 crore on a year-ago basis, the company reported in a filing with the BSE on Friday.
Jewellery, sold mainly under its Tanishq brand, accounted for around 84% of the company’s overall revenue during the quarter. “The festive quarter of 2018-19 turned out to be one of the best quarters for jewellery as well as for other businesses - watches and eyewear,"" managing director Bhaskar Bhat said in a statement.
Revenue from the jewellery business grew 36.95% to Rs4,997.03 crore, while profits from the division (before finance costs and taxes) increased 76.51% to Rs646.58 crore.
“All our new product launches like ‘Utsava’ and ‘Preen’ in jewellery and the ‘Grandmaster, Reflex Wav, Raga I Am’ in watches have received a very good response. The topline growth of 35% for the company in the third quarter was driven by these new introductions, some successful activations as well as measured network expansion,"" Bhat said.
Titan’s various brands together opened 140 stores in total during the nine months to December. Its retail chain was 1,574 stores strong as of 31 December, with a total of 2.02 million square feet of retail cover nationally. The company expects this momentum to continue and to help it achieve its annual targets.
Jewellery aside, revenue from other segments also grew in the high double-digits, with watches and eyewear clocking growth rates of 18.16% and 39.68% respectively."
37,2019-02-01,Titan,"CK Venkataraman will take over on 1 OctoberJewellery is the company’s biggest revenue earner 

BENGALURU :
Watches and accessories maker Titan Co Ltd on Friday said its board has decided on a successor for its current managing director, Bhaskar Bhat. Jewellery business head, CK Venkataraman, will take over the reins from Bhat, who reaches retirement age on 30 September 2019.
The company also reported a 45.97% jump in net profit and a 35.35% growth in revenue during the third quarter, mainly due to a strong festive season that boosted demand for all its product categories, led by jewellery.
Venkataraman will take over on 1 October and the formal process to induct him into the board will be completed in due time, subject to shareholders’ approval, the company said in a filing with the BSE.
Bhat told Mint in an interview that the board was weighing both external and internal candidates for the post. However, management consultants had said last month the company’s primary instinct was to choose someone internally. And when it came to internal candidates, consultants had listed Venkataraman and Ravi Kant, its watches business head, as those who had an edge.
Jewellery is the company’s biggest revenue earner and Venkataraman has been with Titan since 1990 and worked in the advertising and marketing functions before taking over as his current role in January 2005. But Bhat has been at the helm of the Tata Group company for more than 16 years. It will take some time to get used to imagining a Titan without Bhat, ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala who holds a stake in Titan alluded on the company’s results conference call, held Friday evening.
Apart from Bhat, at least five other top executives are due to hit retirement age over the next few years. But the company said it has been working to build a strong leadership base over the past three years.
“We’ve had this process on for the last three years and we’ve had leadership programs at different levels – young leaders, emerging leaders, senior and top management development. We have a very strong pool of successors whom we can choose from. Wherever we feel that there is a gap we have not hesitated to look outside as well,"" Titan’s human resource head Raj Narayan said on the call.
Titan’s consolidated net profit grew to Rs411.09 crore during the October-December quarter of 2018-19 from Rs281.61 crore during the same period last year. Total revenue increased to Rs5,934.11 crore from Rs4,384.40 crore on a year-ago basis, the company reported in a filing with the BSE on Friday.

36,2019-02-04,Titan,"Titan's jewellery business saw an impressive 37% revenue growth year-on-year to  ₹4,890 croreThe company has done a great job at making the most of the market share gain opportunity presented by favourable externalities in the past couple of years

Investors were evidently thrilled with Titan Co. Ltd’s December quarter results announced last Friday. Its stock price hit a 52-week high on Monday, and ended the day 3.4% higher at  ₹1,025.75.
The company’s mainstay jewellery business, which accounts for 85% of stand-alone revenue, saw an impressive 37% revenue growth year-on-year to  ₹4,890 crore. With the December quarter revenue in the bag, analysts reckon Titan is poised to deliver its jewellery revenue growth guidance of about 22% for fiscal year 2019 (FY19).
In fact, investors have been taking cognizance of the strong outlook for the jewellery business for some time now. Note that Titan’s shares have risen nearly 37% from their lows in October.
During the September quarter earnings call, Titan’s management was upbeat about festive season sales, and it turns out its optimism wasn’t misplaced. Further, the pre-quarterly update released last month had alluded to a robust outlook for the jewellery business for the second half of FY19. Thanks to this backdrop, the stock has more than recovered losses seen earlier this year.
Coming back to the December quarter, the jewellery business did well owing to strong growth in both studded and plain categories. The plain category also benefited from a large institutional order of gold coins worth  ₹200 crore. The jewellery business’s Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin came in at 13.3%, 250 basis points more than the year-ago period.
The watch business saw a decent 19% year-on-year revenue growth. However, its Ebit margin fell by a steep 680 basis points year-on-year to 8.5% in the December quarter. That’s because of higher advertising spends to back the company’s new product launches.
But this is a relatively small segment for Titan and the overall net profit increased 35% to  ₹416 crore on the back of a 34% rise in revenues.
Titan is one of the key beneficiaries of the anticipated shift to the formal market. As analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities point out, the company has done a great job at making the most of the market share gain opportunity presented by favourable externalities in the past couple of years. “Some of these externalities continue to sustain and strong performance should sustain for the next few years,"" they added.
But note that the stock trades at an expensive 50-times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year, based on Bloomberg data. This essentially means sharp upsides could be limited."
35,2019-02-15,Titan,"Wedding jewellery, which has been a focus area for the company, will be a key driver in reaching the target The company has around 2-3% market share in the wedding jewellery space

Bengaluru: Titan Co Ltd is looking to double its market share in the jewellery space over the next 3-4 years from around 5% now, the company’s managing director-designate CK Venkataraman said in an interview. Wedding jewellery, which has been a focus area for the company within the segment, will be a key driver in reaching that target.
“We’ve done exceptionally well. And we know our first-time customer acquisition is happening at a brisk pace even in the middle- to top-end segments, so there’s clearly a migration from other jewellers,"" said Venkataraman, who currently heads Titan’s jewellery business.
India’s jewellery industry did not have a good 2018. In February, the Nirav Modi-Mehul Choksi orchestrated PNB fraud tainted the entire sector, impacting small and medium jewellers as well as listed chains. But the Tata Group-backed Titan has stood out as among the few brands consumers trust, and that was reflected in its financial performance through 2018-19.
On 1 February, it reported a 45.97% jump in net profit and a 35.35% growth in revenue during the third quarter. Revenue from the jewellery business — mainly retailed under the Tanishq brand — grew 36.95% while profits from the division, before finance costs and taxes, increased 76.51%. Titan earns more than 80% of its total revenue from sales of jewellery.
The company opened 40 new Tanishq stores in 2018-19, its highest number in a year, and expects that kind of acceleration over the next many years, Venkataraman said. Footprint expansion aside, it expects four other drivers to help it achieve its market share target – the wedding segment, high-value diamond jewellery, its Golden Harvest purchase scheme, and its exchange programme for customers.
“We expect Tanishq to achieve 21.9% sales and 26.5% EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) compounded annualised growth rate over FY18-21 as it gains from the shift towards organized players led by strong brand, growing store network and focus on high-value studded and wedding jewellery,"" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher wrote in a report after Titan reported results on 1 February.
In December, in an interview with Mint, Titan’s current and longstanding MD Bhaskar Bhat said the company expects the 2019 wedding season to be much stronger than 2018. The average bill value for the wedding segment is almost double when compared with the average bill for other categories at Tanishq, Venkataraman said. The company has around 2-3% market share in the wedding jewellery space, leaving immense headroom for growth.
“We’re already a very, very, profitable business (in jewellery) and, therefore, the emphasis is more on becoming stronger in terms of share and focusing less so on margin. But margin comes when sales growth happens,"" Venkataraman said."

Bengaluru: Titan Co. Ltd aims to double its market share in the jewellery space over the next three to four years from around 5% currently, said its managing director-designate C.K. Venkataraman.
Wedding jewellery will be a key driver in reaching the market share goal, he said in an interview.
“We’ve done exceptionally well. We know our first-time customer acquisition is happening at a brisk pace even in the middle to top-end segments, so there’s clearly a migration from other jewellers,"" said Venkataraman, who currently heads Titan’s jewellery business.
India’s jewellery industry did not have a good run in 2018. The Rs. 14,000-crore scam at Punjab National Bank orchestrated by Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi in February last year affected the entire sector. However, Titan has been among the few trusted brands.
On 1 February, the company reported a 46% jump in net profit and a 35% growth in revenue during the quarter ending December 2018. Revenue from the jewellery business grew 37%, while profits (before finance costs and taxes) surged 76.5%. The company earns more than 80% of its revenue from sale of jewellery.
Titan opened 40 new Tanishq stores in 2018-19, a record for a year, and expects to sustain the pace, Venkataraman said. It also expects four other key drivers to help reach the targeted market share—wedding segment, high-value diamond jewellery, the “golden harvest"" purchase scheme, and an exchange programme for customers.
“We expect Tanishq to achieve 21.9% sales and 26.5% Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation) compounded annualized growth rate over FY18-21 as it gains from a shift towards organised players led by strong brand, growing store network, and focus on high value studded and wedding jewellery,"" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher said after Titan’s last quarter results.

33,2019-02-23,Titan,"Titan’s chief design officer on taking the latest brands to greater heights despite not being a trained designer Titan has always followed the path of entering a market that is highly unorganized and consolidating it

Titan Co. Ltd’s new campus in Bengaluru’s Electronic City, six months old, is not only a strikingly pretty office, it is an ode to sustainable building design. Walk into the main lobby on a warm, sunny afternoon and you get the feeling of being inside an airy, subterranean cave: the temperature falls and the eye is immediately drawn to a large, curving water body around which the cello-shaped main building rises to a two-storey height. Walking around the lobby, one also notices large colourful posters with photographs of attractive couples; look closer and you realize that they are all same-sex couples—part of a campaign the company is creating in the wake of the repeal of Section 377 of the Constitution, which criminalized homosexuality. The campaign is for Titan’s youth-focused Fastrack brand, with the distinctive Fastrack logo filled in with rainbow colours.
The “biophilic"" campus consists of three low-rise buildings surrounded by extensive water bodies that help keep temperatures low, both indoors and outdoors. This is important because none of the buildings on the campus has air-conditioning. The temperature is maintained at or around 27 degrees Celsius with the help of not just industrial-sized and regular fans, but also structurally, with the generous use of water features, greenery, the shape of the buildings, and the creation of wind tunnels.
Design is clearly important to Titan—and it informs everything that the company does, says Titan’s chief design officer Revathi Kant, 50, whom we are meeting today. Kant is an old hand at Titan—her official bio shared by the communications team prior to this interview said she has been with the company for 25 years. “It’s actually 29,"" says Kant with a laugh as we settle down in her spare, neat room on the second floor of the building. You don’t find too many people these days who have only worked with one company over the span of their career, but Kant is that rare exception. “It speaks a lot about the company itself—the culture, the freedom. Titan has always kept things exciting, fresh and challenging, otherwise can you imagine working with a company for 30 years and not feeling bored or tired? I am very excited about what I do every day,"" she says.
And indeed, her role within the company has changed quite dramatically from the time she joined as a fresh recruit in the market research department in 1990 after completing a master’s degree in operations research from Regional Engineering College (REC), Tiruchirappalli. A few years later she was heading marketing at the company’s fledgling operations in West Asia and Africa, based out of Dubai. “I moved fields every five years or so. My funda in life is when I get bored, I’ll quit,"" says Kant.
When she moved to Dubai, Titan was just one brand and one category, wristwatches, and the international market was dominated by Swiss and Japanese brands. Creating a market for an Indian brand—even in a demographic that had a strong Indian diaspora—was not easy. “It was not the India of today—it was not ‘India shining’. The locals would often say ‘al Hind ?’ in a derogatory tone,"" says Kant. Adding to the challenge was the fact that she was a woman in a male-dominated field. “In a market like Saudi Arabia, it’s difficult to travel on your own as a woman; even to get a visa was so tough. We had an influential distributor who managed to get me a visa and I wore my burqa and all and went to meet with this sheikh,"" recalls Kant. “Our ad agency guy who was present at the meeting later told me it was an unusual sight—me in a burqa with this sheikh in a huge conference room, discussing the media plan. It was such an experience, and so much learning. You learn to respect different cultures, and be mindful of everything. And the more you understand the culture, the better you understand your customer.""
By the time she wound up her stint in West Asia in 2005, Titan was doing pretty well in the region—it was the No.1 brand in Oman and among the top 3 in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Despite being in marketing, Kant had always been closely involved with developing products specific to the market requirement. “I realized I was quite passionate about the product development side of it. When we were on the other side, we always relied on the design team to give us products and frankly I felt there was some gap, and I felt I could fill it,"" says Kant. “So when I came back to India, I told Bhaskar (Titan managing director Bhaskar Bhat), I wanted to do something different, like create products that made sense from a consumer point of view.""
Kant gives credit to the company for taking a “leap of faith"" by making her the head of business of the design vertical at a time when Titan was expanding into different categories—especially jewellery, with its game-changing Tanishq brand. “Titan has always followed the path of entering a market that is highly unorganized and fragmented and consolidating that market. It has happened again and again—with jewellery, then bags and accessories and eyewear. We are quite a restless company,"" says Kant. In the late 1990s, when Tanishq launched, there were hardly any national players and each jewellery market had its local leaders. The first few years were tough for the brand, as most people perceived Tanishq as an upscale brand with expensive designs and high making charges. Turning that perception around and creating a brand image based on trust and dependability, as well as fresh and unique designs for the modern Indian woman, were instrumental to the brand’s later success, when it became one of the top 3 jewellery retailers in the country. “For me to head design innovation in jewellery was a gamble from both sides that paid off,"" she says.
It certainly was something of a gamble—Kant was not a trained designer and Titan had always been a design-led company with superstar designers like Michael and Neil Foley. “It certainly was a learning. For the first two years, I didn’t talk. I just listened and spent time getting to know and understand designers. It was important to me that before a thorough understanding of design, I should understand the people who created it,"" says Kant. She soon realized that there was a gap between the design and sales/marketing teams and set about filling this. And ultimately it paid off, she says, when products created by the creative team sold in huge numbers, became the focus of ad campaigns and “big stories within the company."" “Then it started to flow back, and they realized that integrating the business aspect with design was important. Today, I’d say I understand design very well, but I started with the low-hanging fruit, which was bringing the business connect to designers,"" says Kant.
After heading the design, innovation, and development department at Titan, Kant was recently given the title of chief design officer—a pretty unusual designation for a non-designer and a testimony to Kant’s leadership of the design team. She counts the growth of the Titan Raga brand as one of her success stories. Under her watch, Raga underwent a transformation. “We said, let’s understand the Indian woman. We asked, ‘what should Raga stand for?’ Then, year after year we started coming up with a blockbuster collection. Every Diwali saw a huge Raga collection. Today, Raga is an almost  ₹300 crore brand, and yes, I will take a little bit of credit for that,"" says Kant with a laugh. She’s visibly proud of Raga and says it’s unique, possibly in the world, by virtue of being a watch brand only for women. “If you look at Swiss watches for women, they are smaller counterparts of men’s watches. But Raga has no male counterpart,"" she says.
Initially, Raga was associated with terms like “sensuality"" and “jewellery-like"", but Kant says both the consumer and the design language have evolved over the years. Today the designs are more aligned with values like strength and capability. The same is true for Fastrack, Titan’s youth-focused brand in watches, accessories and eyewear, says Kant. For several years now, Fastrack has had a “bold"", almost risque image—carefully developed by several advertising campaigns that aimed to represent a new, sex-positive Indian youth. Some of the ads even crossed the line and the company had to issue apologies—for instance, an ad that showed a female model wrapped in ribbon printed with the words “sale"". But the image is again evolving, Kant says, with campaigns that are more socially conscious and in line with values that are dear to millennials rather than brash and rebellious.
Kant believes Indian design has come a long way and so has appreciation for design among Indian consumers. “Design starts off as nice-to-have and then it becomes mainstream, and in India we are somewhere in between at this point. Our spaces have become interesting—while our roads are terrible, look at the Metro in various cities, or Church Street in Bangalore, or F&B companies spending good money on restaurant design and that being used to differentiate the brand.... People do appreciate it. Design is not just about aesthetics—it’s about functionality. It has to be robust, it has to function well,"" says Kant.
Women in top corporate positions are always asked about how they “balance family and work"" (in a way that male CXOs are not) and Kant says she is aware of this, but her take on work-life balance is different. “Sometimes it’s not possible to have that balance, and that’s okay! If I’m at home and there’s a lot of work to be done, I’d rather just sit and finish it off instead of feeling anxious, because of some rule that says work should not eat into my personal time,"" she says. As mother to a 19-year-old, she has faced her share of child-care challenges earlier in her career, and says it’s important to have a solid support system in place, be it family or employed help, while acknowledging that it’s not always easy for Indian women to have this support.
“For more and more women to come to the senior level, we have to drop the guilt,"" she says.

32,2019-03-06,Titan,"Titan’s present market cap at  ₹90,000 crore outweighs that of revenue giants like Tata Steel & Motors

In a $110 billion group, comprising 30 companies scattered across such diverse areas as steel and software, who would have thought that a small watch company would emerge as the second largest in terms of market capitalization and the fastest growing over the last three years?
Yet, this week, as a Business Standard story pointed out on Monday, Titan’s market cap scaled  ₹90,000 crore, well below that of software heavyweight Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), but nearly 60% more than that of revenue giants Tata Steel and Tata Motors.
Titan’s success is the story of steady and sterling leadership by two men, Xerxes Desai and Bhaskar Bhat, who helmed the company for all its 34 years in business. Desai, the man who wanted to be an Oxford don but came back at J.R.D. Tata’s bidding to set up a watch company, presided over the company’s first decade and a half of growth, in which time it established itself as India’s leading watch brand. Under Desai, the humble watch—till then symbolized by public sector entity HMT’s mechanical products or imports from abroad—became a fashion statement, a symbol of class best exemplified by its signature tune, an excerpt from Mozart’s 25th Symphony, personally picked by Desai.
However, by the end of the last century, as the watch business slowed, the company’s diversification into the jewellery business in 1995 was weighing heavily on its overall performance, already dragged down by debts following an ill-advised blitz into several European markets.
Enter Bhaskar Bhat as managing director in 2002. Tasked with engineering a turnaround of sorts, he faced a baptism by fire as a large-scale layoff was followed by a lockout at the company’s plant. After dousing those early fires, Bhat proceeded to execute a well-honed strategy of entering unorganized segments of the Indian market and gentrifying them. With this came crafted watches, jewellery, youth accessories such as bags and belts, eyecare products and, later, fragrances and saris.
The results have been spectacular. Titan is today one of the two jewels in the Tata crown. And, therein lies the problem, since its continuing success casts a questioning shadow over many of the other companies that are a part of India’s largest conglomerate and have, for years, been sucking up resources without really delivering results.
The conglomerate model, as rolled out by the likes of Harold Geneen and Jack Welch, was a consequence of the low interest rate regimes in the US following the Second World War, which in turn, helped finance a spate of leveraged buyouts. Conglomerates made sense till such time as capital markets lacked the depth and sophistication needed to back businesses at various stages of evolution and growth. They lost steam once those markets evolved to serve all comers.
Through the 1960s, Geneen made hundreds of acquisitions across a diverse collection of businesses ranging from telegraph equipment to insurance and hotels, to build International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., the company he headed, into a $17 billion conglomerate by 1970. Today, some four decades later, all that remains of that diversified portfolio colossus is a $2.5 billion business making specialty components for the aerospace, transportation, energy and industrial markets.
By the 1990s, most US corporations had come around to reaffirming their faith in specialization and focus, prompted in large measure by the teachings of management gurus like the late Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad, who in 1990 co-authored an article for the Harvard Business Review titled The Core Competence Of The Corporation, in which he urged executives to identify their organization’s core competencies that could foster growth.
It wasn’t as if the conglomerate idea fell off the cliff overnight. A 1994 study showed that for each of the years 1985, 1989 and 1992, over two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies were active in at least five distinct lines of business.
Late last year, United Technologies, one of the best known industrial conglomerates after its acquisition of Otis Elevator in 1976 and Carrier Refrigeration in 1979, announced that it would spin off both those divisions into separate companies and focus on its core aerospace business.
This, coupled with the struggles of General Electric—once the world’s largest industrial conglomerate—as it looks to sell off pieces of its operations indicates that the era of conglomerates seems to have ended in the US.
In India though, conglomerates still rule the roost, accounting for nearly 50% of the corporate sector’s revenues. Yet, the success of focused companies in newer businesses such as IT, telecom, banking, auto, aviation and e-commerce shows that the conglomerate premium may be declining even in India. A study by Bain and Co. last year concluded: “Conglomerates in India and Southeast Asia no longer hold an advantage in total shareholder returns over pure plays and have begun to underperform in revenue growth and margin improvement.""
Significantly, the study’s list of conglomerates in the region that have continued to thrive despite the odds had a number of Indian groups, including Bajaj, Wadia, Murugappa, Lalbhai, Godrej, Emami and Torrent, but not Tata.

NEW DELHI :
Watch and jewellery retailer Titan Company has increased its stake in jewellery retailer CaratLane to 69.47% for  ₹99.99 crore, the company said in a regulatory filing on March 31.
“Titan Company has subscribed to 30,48,780 additional equity shares of CaratLane thereby increasing its stake in CaratLane on 30 March, 2019. Pursuant to the above, the shareholding of the company in CaratLane has increased from 66.39% to 69.47%,"" it said in the filing.
Titan, that also sells jewellery through its Tanishq stores across India, first picked up a majority stake in CaratLane back in 2016 in a bid to expand its presence online. Currently, CaratLane operates over 50 retail stores across India apart from selling jewellery online. For the year ended March 31, 2018, CaratLane’s total revenue stood at  ₹292.50 crore.
CaratLane was started in September 2007 by Mithun Sacheti and Srinivasa Gopalan.
It designs, manufactures, trades and retails gems and jewellery online as well as through physical stores in India."
30,2019-04-10,Titan,"For FY19, jewellery sales increased 22% with Titan adding 35 Tanishq stores during the periodTitan's jewellery business housed under the Tanishq brand has been a key revenue growth driver

While many companies have been laid low by the consumption slowdown, investors in Titan Co. Ltd don’t have that worry. After all, the jewellery retailer’s March quarter pre-result update last week said it was aiming for a 20% revenue growth in fiscal year 2020 (FY20). That is an encouraging goal when the broader Indian consumption theme isn’t very inspiring.
Analysts from Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd say Titan’s 20% revenue growth aspiration indicates that not only are all divisions firing well but also that jewellery sales will grow even faster than the company’s overall sales growth. “If achieved, it will be the third year of better-than-expected jewellery sales,"" the brokerage said in a 4 April report.
Titan would be one of the key beneficiaries of the shift to the formal market. Investors, of course, have taken cognizance and that is reflected in the gains the stock has made. Year to date, it has risen almost 18%.
The Titan stock currently trades at an enormous 52.5 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data. No doubt, valuations are expensive, suggesting investors are folding into the price a good share of the optimism. Nevertheless, given that the company is set to capitalize on the anticipated shift to the regulated market, high valuations could be well-supported.
For FY19, Titan said total sales have grown about 21%. Boosted by store additions, jewellery sales increased 22%. It added 35 Tanishq stores (net) during FY19. For the March quarter, jewellery revenue can be expected to have grown about 16%.
Titan derives over 80% of its revenue from jewellery sales and the division has consistently been its key growth driver. The remainder comes primarily from watches and eyewear.
The watches business is Titan’s second-largest revenue grosser. The segment has seen about 16% growth for FY19 aided by product launches, according to the company. Eyewear revenue grew 23% in FY19.
Even as the revenue growth performance and outlook has brought cheer, investors would do well to focus on Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margins when the March quarter and year-ended results are declared. Management commentary during the earnings conference call could offer notable insights regarding the demand outlook and business environment."

His wife Rekha Jhunjhunwala’s stake has risen marginally to 1.32% during the same period.
Titan is a tad away from being a company with a trillion-rupee market capitalization. As of 11:42 an IST, shares of the jewellery-retailing company traded at  ₹1,094 on the BSE, giving it a market cap of  ₹97,150 crore.
According to the company’s January-March pre-result update, Titan is aiming a 20% revenue growth in fiscal 2019-20 (April-March).
The company achieved overall sales growth of 21% in FY19. Jewellery sales grew by 22% after increasing by 25% in FY18, thereby exceeding the originally envisaged 20% five-year sales CAGR target for the second consecutive year.
Moreover, management’s confidence in further 20% overall sales growth in FY20—despite a muted economic outlook—is “heartening,"" brokerage Motilal Oswal said last week.

Jewellers are expecting double-digit volume growth in gold sales this Akshaya Tritiya, hoping that stable prices of the yellow metal will attract more buyers. Retail price of gold in India has come down to around  ₹31,500 per 10 grams from close to  ₹34,000 in mid-February. Many jewelers have launched pre-booking scheme through which customers can select and place their jewellery orders in advance. Akshaya Tritiya, which falls on May 7, is considered auspicious for purchasing gold.
Kalyan Jewellers has launched a pre-booking scheme through which customers can select and place their jewellery orders in advance, and simply pick it up on Akshaya Tritiya or closer to that date, thus avoiding the rush and long wait.
""We have seen a 30% growth in pre-booking compared to last year,"" said Kalyan Jewellers chairman TS Kalyanaraman.
Titans jewellery division chief executive for CK Venkataraman said the current sentiment and jewellery market outlook look positive. ""In past five years, we have seen a double-digit growth every year and we expect this Akshaya Tritiya season to be very good.""
India Bullion and Jewellers Association National vice-president Saurabh Gadgil expects 15-20% growth in demand this Akshaya Tritiya, which will be celebrated tomorrow. ""The sentiment is positive as in most places voting will be over and also the festival falls virtually at the beginning of the month when salaried people have thicker pockets,"" he added.
Echoing similar views, All-India Gems & Jewellery Domestic Council chairman Anantha Padmanabhan, said: ""We expect robust demand for gold/gold jewellery this Akshaya Tritiya due to price stability since the past few months and the improved consumer sentiment since Gudi Padwa. Looking at the current momentum we expect at least 10 percent demand growth this auspicious occasion.""
World Gold Council managing director Somasundaram PR said this Akshaya Tritiya looks more optimistic than last year as the market has settled down after policy changes including note-ban and GST which had hit the industry very badly.
""Organised retail players, who are gaining ground with their more targeted marketing, are having greater impact on the positive consumer sentiment,"" he said.

Hindus buy valuables including gold and silver on Akshaya Tritiya, which falls on Tuesday this year, in the belief that it will bring luck and prosperity. That faith coupled with discounts and an about 7 percent drop in prices from an over five-year high in February is underpinning jewelers’ expectations for brisk sales.
Retailers like Malabar Gold & Diamonds are offering as much as 50 percent off on jewelry-making charges, while Tata Group’s Titan Co. is giving a discount of up to 25 percent. The charges vary from store to store and city to city and can contribute as much as 10 percent to the total cost of an ornament. Others are giving freebies such as Kerala-based Kalyan Jewellers, which said it is giving away gold coins for free to some customers.
“Lower prices are expected to be a key trigger in pushing sales on a higher trajectory,"" Ahammed MP, chairman of Malabar Gold & Diamonds, said in a statement. “There are reports of robust pre-Akshaya Tritiya sales in the markets. A higher sales volume is expected as compared with last year and in percentage terms, we can expect sales growth of around 15-20 percent.""
Gold demand in India is picking after slow sales in the last couple of years as higher prices and government curbs to crack down on unaccounted wealth weighed on the sector. Purchases in the second-biggest gold buying nation may be boosted this quarter because of the traditional wedding season purchases, the auspicious Akshaya Tritiya festival and rising crop prices, the World Gold Council said last week.
People profiting from the equity market will also turn toward gold to diversify their portfolio, boosting demand for the precious metal, according to digital gold platform Augmont, which is offering buyers opting for home delivery of their gold purchases an equal amount of silver free during the festival. The benchmark index has gained about 7 percent so far this year."

NEW DELHI :
Watches and accessories maker Titan Company Ltd on Wednesday reported a 14.4% jump in its consolidated net profit for the quarter ended March 31, while revenue at the maker of Titan watches and Tanishq jewellery was up over 19%.  The company's jewellery business recorded a strong performance for the quarter, while its profit after tax came below estimates on account of one-offs during the quarter. 
Consolidated net profit for the fourth quarter of FY19 stood at  ₹348.3 crore from  ₹304 crore in the same quarter last year, while total revenue stood at  ₹4,945 crore up from  ₹4,125 crore on a year ago basis.
During the quarter, the company made provisions to the tune of  ₹46 crore for investments made as part of treasury operations in inter-corporate deposits in the IL&FS Group.
""Keeping all the factors in mind, the numbers actually came above expectations, jewellery continued to hold a strong show,"" said an analyst on the condition of anonymity.
For the full year, consolidated income stood at  ₹19,779 crore, while consolidated net profit was  ₹1,389 crore.
During the year, the company witnessed a net addition of 115 stores.
“The growth momentum of the past few years continued in 2018-19 backed by the strong revenue as well as profit growth across all key divisions,"" Bhaskar Bhat, managing director said in a press release.
The company also made provisions of  ₹70 crore for impairment of investment in its Swiss subsidiary (Favre Leuba AG, Switzerland) in FY19. “Titan had three one offs in the quarter of which one will reverse in coming quarter. Gold valuation at year end took a hit due to lower gold prices in the latter half of the quarter resulting in margins being depressed by  ₹37 crore,"" saidAbneesh Roy, analyst at Mumbai-based brokerage firm Edelweiss Securities. “This is expected to be largely reversed in the next quarter,"" he added. Roy said the results were in line with expectations.
Segmental performance at Titan was mixed with its jewellery business holding a strong double digit growth.
The company's jewellery business, grew 22% to  ₹4,105 crore during the quarter while profit for the business stood at  ₹499 crore. While the watches segment grew modestly at 8% to  ₹531 crore. ""Gross margins in watches were disappointing on account of weak sales and has been volatile,"" said Roy
However, the company has maintained its growth outlook for FY20 at 20%. In fact, in a post-earnings call, the company's management said that it was already seeing a strong demand in the year-to-date period (i.e. April 1 2019 onwards) where it has witnessed a 19% growth in jewellery business.
""We continue to remain positive on Titan due to its ability to keep getting market share in jewellery, strong guidance of 20% growth (an outlier in FY20 consumption, and seeding future growth drivers like Sarees, smart wearables etc"",Roy at Edelweiss said."
24,2019-05-09,Titan,"Adjusting for the certain one-off items, the numbers are more or less in line with expectationsPre-tax profits for Q4 were impacted by additional provisions for investments in IL&FS ( ₹46 crore), temporary inventory valuation hit in the jewellery business ( ₹37 crore) and ex-gratia for staff ( ₹34 crore)

Titan Co. Ltd’s shares closed marginally higher in a weak market on Wednesday, just ahead of the announcement of its March quarter results.
However, if investors were hoping for great results, they will be disappointed. The jewellery retailer’s last quarter results were not earth shattering. Revenue increased by 19.3% year-on-year to  ₹4,672 crore, but adjusted profits were flat at year-ago levels, according to analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
However, management commentary on the future outlook was relatively positive compared to some other consumer goods firms. Titan hopes to benefit from higher number of wedding days in FY20, it said during an earnings conference call. Additionally, the company has benefitted from market share gains from the unorganized segment.
These factors, say analysts, will help support the company’s expensive valuations from a near-term perspective. The Titan stock trades at about 50 times estimated earnings for FY20.
“We continue to remain positive on Titan due to its ability to keep getting market share in jewellery, strong guidance of 20% growth (an outlier in 2019-20 across the consumption theme),"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice-president at Edelweiss Securities. The company is also preparing for the future with drivers such as saris, smart wearables and rapid retail expansion, he added.
Coming back to the March quarter earnings, Titan’s results were adversely affected owing to certain one-off items. Adjusting for that, the numbers are more or less in line with expectations, say analysts.
The company’s pre-tax profits for the March quarter were impacted by additional provisions for investments in Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd ( ₹46 crore), temporary inventory valuation hit in the jewellery business ( ₹37 crore) and ex-gratia for staff ( ₹34 crore).
Titan’s jewellery revenue, which accounted for 84% of its total revenue, increased by 21% year-on-year, a shade better than expected. The inventory valuation knock seen in the March quarter is likely to be reversed in the next quarter, it said. Titan derived about 11% of its revenue from the watch business, which delivered muted performance.
According to the company, Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin was at 5.5%, impacted by lower gross margin due to product and channel mix, and ex-gratia provisions made in Q4 for employees.
Investors have continued to make good returns on the Titan investment, which is now the second-most valuable firm in the Tata group, ahead of Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd. So far this calendar year, Titan shares have risen nearly 17%, whereas the Nifty 100 index has gained 3.2%. However, expensive valuations indicate that investors are baking in a good portion of the optimism into the price."

Sotheby’s, the auction house whose shares have dropped 40% in the past year, is being sold to telecom titan Patrick Drahi for $2.7 billion.
Investors will receive $57 in cash per share of Sotheby’s common stock under terms of the agreement, according to a statement Monday from the New York-based company. The offer represents a 61% premium to the closing price on Friday. Sotheby’s shares rose 57% to $55.58 as of 9:40am in New York. The enterprise value is $3.7 billion.
Sotheby’s is returning to private ownership after 31 years as a public company, the last few spent battling expenses and margins even as masterpieces and contemporary works soared in value. Drahi, 55, is the president of Altice Europe NV, a publicly traded telecommunications business with more than 30 million customers. An avid art collector, he’s worth $8.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.
“Sotheby’s is one of the most elegant and aspirational brands in the world,"" Drahi said in the statement. “As a long time client and lifetime admirer of the company, I am acquiring Sotheby’s together with my family.""
Drahi’s latest purchase is a surprise move for a man known for the telecoms empire he built, which grew out of a string of debt-financed acquisitions in France before eventually expanding to the U.S. in 2015. Drahi said he intends to monetize a small piece of the U.S. business for as much as $400 million to fund the Sotheby’s deal.
Altice Europe’s main asset is SFR in France. The business is finally returning to growth after years of customer losses amid cutthroat competition for subscribers in France. Shares in Altice Europe have gained more than 70% this year.
Drahi’s takeover would mean that French citizens will own the world’s two major auction houses.

21,2019-07-02,Titan,"Titan has performed well relatively at a time when consumer companies are feeling the pinch of a consumption slowdownThe jewellery business is the mainstay for Titan, accounting for about 83% of FY19 revenues

Some of the glitter of gold seems to be rubbing off on Titan Co. Ltd. Its shares touched a new 52-week high on Monday, even as the price of the yellow metal rose.
However, as has often been seen, consumers tend to delay purchases when gold prices spike and adopt a wait and watch policy. That means in the near term there could be some pressure on volumes. In India, much also depends on the festive and wedding season demand when jewellery sales tend to be robust.
Nonetheless, a consistent improvement in gold prices augurs well for Titan, as it improves profit margin, said analysts requesting anonymity. Of course, whether the net impact of higher prices on volumes and margins is positive or not will only be known when the company announces its quarterly results. What also remains to be seen is whether the current strength in gold prices persists.
The jewellery business is the mainstay for Titan, accounting for about 83% of FY19 revenues. Jewellery Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin stood at 12.2% for FY19.
Titan has performed well relatively at a time when consumer companies are feeling the pinch of a consumption slowdown.
The recently concluded March quarter’s revenues had risen by nearly 20% from a year ago. This includes revenues from watches, eyewear and others. In its March quarter earnings presentation, Titan said it will target around 20% growth for FY20 despite the muted outlook for the economy.
“The company’s execution remains strong, as demonstrated by the continued success of its new jewellery collections,"" said a Deutsche Bank Research report on 13 May. “We believe that a combination of macro tailwinds and micro-initiatives (such as new collections, its focus on wedding jewellery and value deals) is resulting in increasing consumer acceptance.""
The company has remained a beneficiary of market share gains from the unorganized sector. “Plus, if you want to play gold, people seem to trust the Titan brand more,"" said an analyst, who also declined to be named.
To be sure, investors are ascribing the requisite brownie points to Titan. In the past year, the stock has risen by 47%. This means it now trades at nearly 63 times estimated earnings for FY20 based on Bloomberg’s consensus estimates. That’s not cheap. But there’s little evidence to say that valuations won’t sustain at these levels if Titan continues to deliver steady growth.
Deutsche Bank’s analysts say they are modelling for compound annual earnings growth of 28% between FY19 and FY22, which is the highest among Indian consumer companies."
20,2019-07-07,Titan,"Investors must stay tuned to management commentaries on demand conditions in the upcoming June-quarter results seasonManagement commentary can offer meaningful clues on rural demand conditions, impact of liquidity tightness

The Union budget has not made life any easier for consumer staples companies, which means demand worries in the near term will continue to be a major overhang for them.
“Expenditure on rural schemes and disposable incomes for low-end consumption are largely unchanged (from the interim budget) in the absence of a fresh stimulus,"" pointed out Varun Lohchab of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a 5 July note.
The imposition of a nominal tax on cigarettes is slightly negative for ITC Ltd. What needs monitoring for ITC now is whether the goods and services tax rates change in the coming months. Separately, the government raised customs duty on gold from 10% to 12.5%, which will make the yellow metal pricier. As a result, consumers may shy away from shopping for gold, which Titan Co. Ltd’s investors won’t appreciate.
More crucially, investors must stay tuned to management commentaries on demand conditions in the forthcoming June quarter results season. As such, expectations are not high, which is understandable after consumer staples firms threw up a tepid March quarter performance owing to a demand slowdown.
“We expect the aggregate volume growth of FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) companies to further moderate in Q1 FY20 to ~5.3%, compared to ~6.1% in Q4 FY19 and 8.2% in Q3 FY19,"" wrote analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 3 July.
Some companies have indicated the emergence of some green-shoots in June even as the weak start to the quarter would likely mean restrained growth for the quarter as a whole, said analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities in a consumer staples June quarter preview report on 4 July.
Management commentary, therefore, can offer meaningful clues on rural demand conditions and the impact of liquidity tightness.
So far, commentaries are lukewarm. Quarterly updates of Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) and Marico Ltd were not heartening. GCPL said its domestic volume growth was in mid-single digits in the June quarter, which is more or less in line with Street estimates. In its update, Marico said the June quarter was characterized by moderation in the overall demand environment.
In a nutshell, there are hardly any triggers for FMCG stocks going ahead. It’s worth noting here that the Nifty FMCG index has declined 1.8% so far this calendar year. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has increased 8.7%."

Everyone in the market has the same question, but not many have the answer.
However, there are visible signs and put together, they show that Indians have no plan to ratchet up their consumption like they used to.
Discretionary spending is being axed and the ripple effects are visible in the equity markets now.
Titan Co. Ltd’s shares ended a massive 12% down on Tuesday. The company said it witnessed a tough macroeconomic environment in the June quarter with consumption being hit due to rising gold prices.
Bajaj Finance Ltd, a key lender to consumers for discretionary spending, fell as much as 8% on Monday, although it has since then recovered about three-fifths of those losses.
Sanjiv Bajaj, who steers this successful consumer lending business, believes when cricket-obsessed Indians refrain from buying a television set to watch the World Cup, it is time to worry more.
In an interview with CNBC- TV18 on Monday, Bajaj said that the slowdown is dramatic.
The lender’s business model is wrapped around hooking Indians to spend more, one equated monthly instalment to another. Even though Bajaj expressed worry that his firm is not seeing the growth rates it used to, the company reported an impressive 41% growth in assets under management (AUM) for the first quarter.
While investors were initially troubled by the “dramatic slowdown"" comment, they seem to have later concluded that Bajaj Finance has had a good track record of bucking the trend, something its AUM growth in the June quarter also suggests.
Titan, on the other hand, has more pain. Gold prices have surged and the government announced a 2.5% hike in customs duty on gold and precious metals in the budget. Ergo, a slew of broking houses such as HSBC Securities Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd and Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd have downgraded the stock, citing stretched valuations amid slowing growth.
According to Credit Suisse, Titan’s price-to-earnings multiple has no room to further rerate. Domestic broking house Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd has lowered its earnings per share estimates by 2.7%/1.8% for FY20/FY21.
Indeed, it would be unfair to pin the entire weakness in consumption stocks to just the slowdown.
“Discretionary stocks show more volatility than those of consumer staples. Therefore, part of the fall could also be because of stretched valuations,"" said Nitin Gupta, an analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd.
Nevertheless, the fact that consumption is benign has triggered a long overdue correction in stocks. “Also, the increase in income tax for high-income individuals would impact consumption demand for high ticket discretionary items. So, if the June quarter earnings from other big companies in this space are below estimates, then the expected earnings recovery will get pushed further,"" said an analyst with a global brokerage firm on condition of anonymity.
To be sure, discretionary buying is the first casualty during a widespread economic slowdown. But even toothpaste makers are feeling the hit, along with home gadget makers.
Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) company Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) in its June quarter pre-result update said that it witnessed relatively softer demand across some of its geographies of operations during the quarter. “In India, demand continued to be challenging, impacted by a general consumption slowdown,"" it said in a press release on 3 July. The company said that it has recorded volume growth of close to mid-single digits during the quarter.
Analysts expect an extended summer to impact GCPL’s household insecticide sales in India, whereas the soaps category is likely to be subdued owing to an unfavourable base and demand slowdown in rural areas. Analysts are estimating volume growth of 4-5% and value growth of 2-3% in the India business for GCPL.
So, the slowdown is real but is it, as Bajaj says, dramatic?
Abheek Barua, chief economist and executive vice president at HDFC Bank Ltd, believes that the slowdown is on anticipated lines. “One of the indicators that I have found very useful is the growth of regional FMCG brands rather than large national ones. You tend to move down to lower price category in items like toothpaste or other staples during a broad-based slowdown. There is the substitution effect and performance of some regional brands suggest that their growth was higher than normal in the March quarter,"" he said.
The next key question is how long will the slowdown stretch.
The answer would be visible if one monitors the rural markets. The delay in the onset of the monsoon has already impacted the outlook on incomes in rural markets. Already facing a tightening of the purse strings, farmers are even more wary of spending now.
With the Union budget giving no immediate fillip to consumption, all eyes are now on the monetary policy to push consumption demand. Even so, it is likely that it could get worse before it gets better and most analysts are foreseeing a delay in consumption revival.
“The consumption slowdown may have bottomed out due to passing of uncertainties of elections, but is unlikely to fly much higher. There is a lot of expectation that stimulus provided to farmers (in the interim budget) will translate into better rural demand. However, these amounts could be first used to repay debts and even if they start spending immediately, it would be for low-value basic items and not high-value items,"" said Indranil Pan, chief economist at IDFC First Bank Ltd."

NEW DELHI :
Shares of Titan Company Ltd on Tuesday slumped nearly 13%, its steepest fall in six years, after the company reported subdued revenue growth for the April-June quarter on the back of tough macroeconomic environment and weak consumption trend.
So far today, the stock has touched a low of  ₹1,091.10 on BSE, down 12.9%, its biggest slide since June 2013. At 10.13 am, the scrip traded at  ₹1091.40. The stock was down for the fourth consecutive session today, having declined 18% during the period. So far this year, the stock has risen 20%.
Revenue grew a muted 13% in June quarter as sharp increases in gold prices hit consumer demand last month. Analysts expected a 25% year-on-year growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2019-20.
In June, global gold prices rose 8% month-on-month which analysts believe hurt consumer demand for the precious metal.
Brokerage firm Reliance Securities has lowered its estimate for Titan Company’s fiscal 2020 revenue by 3.3% and that of FY21 by 5.6%, given the general economic slowdown. The brokerage firm estimates the company’s total revenue to grow 15.6% year-on-year in FY20 to  ₹22,000 crore, and expects 15.8% growth in FY21 to  ₹25,500 crore. EBITDA growth and net profit estimates have also been lowered by 3.9% for FY20 and 6.5% for FY21.
""Current economic slowdown is likely to impact the quarterly run-rates. However, Titan is likely to return the higher growth path once the consumer spending picks up in the economy. Hence, we continue to value Titan at 50 times based on FY21 estimates EPS and re-iterate HOLD rating,"" Reliance Securities said in an 8 July report. The brokerage firm has revised its target price on Titan’s stock to  ₹1,221 from  ₹1,304, and cut its earning per share estimate by 3.9% to 20.4 for fiscal 2020, and 6.3% to 24.4 for FY21.
The company said its watches division reported revenue growth of 19%, partly aided by execution of a large institutional order from Tata Consultancy Services while eye-wear segment witnessed revenue growth of 13%, aided by activation during the quarter."

CHIKAMAGALUR :
Hundreds of people came out on Wednesday afternoon to pay their last respects to Café Coffee Day (CCD) founder and top boss V.G. Siddhartha, whose body was kept at the CCD head office in Chikmagalur.
Siddhartha’s body was recovered on Wednesday morning around 6.30am by local fishermen from the backwaters of the Netravathi river.
The queue of people trudging up to the decorated pandal cut across all strata of the society—from coffee estate workers and littérateurs to swamis and politicians, including Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yediyurappa.
The body was moved in the evening to his estate in Mudigere, about 30km away, for the last rites.
The family had requested privacy and barred the media.
Siddhartha’s wife, Malavika, and their two sons, along with his father-in-law and former CM S.M Krishna and his wife, Prerna, were present to pay their respects for the last time. People came in droves to bid a tearful farewell to the man who considered the 30,000 employees who were part of his business empire—from coffee estates and factories and hospitality, to IT and financial services—his family.
“People in and around the region always considered working for Siddhartha as a great opportunity, even better than a government job,"" said Manju Chetan, an HR manager in one of the resorts run by Siddhartha. Chetan, along with three other colleagues, were in Mangaluru throughout the search operation praying for his return.
The 36-hour suspense following Siddhartha’s mysterious disappearance ended around 6.30am when fishermen found his body in the backwaters near Hoige Bazaar. The dead body was sent to the Wenlock government hospital for post-mortem.
District medical officer Dr K. Rajeshwari said that the post-mortem report is expected on Thursday.
Siddhartha went missing on Monday evening—he had told his driver that he wanted to take a stroll, but did not return even after an hour.
He was suspected to have jumped off the bridge on the Netravathi river. Subsequently, search operations began early on Tuesday morning near Mangaluru.
Café Coffee Day traces its roots to the IT hub of Bengaluru, where Siddhartha started the café network in 1996 with a single store.
On Wednesday, nearly everyone from the coffee industry in Karnataka was in Chikmagalur, a reminder of the 1990s, when Siddhartha led their fight from the front to be freed of government regulation on pricing and procurement, which helped turn around the coffee trade.
“We have 50,000 members and he was the richest. All the growers are tense by this incident. All are curious to know what’s going on and why this has happened to him,"" said Theertha Mallesh, president of Karnataka Grower’s Federation. Some members of the coffee growers’ apex body had performed a pooja through Tuesday at the Sakaleswara temple, nearly 100km away from Mangaluru, for his return.
“He was a religious man. He believed in God’s judgement as much in his self-esteem. Maybe he did something wrong, maybe he didn’t want to bend down before anyone,"" said a seer who knew Siddhartha for the past 40 years, requesting anonymity.

New Delhi: Tata Group firm Titan Company Ltd on Tuesday reported a 10.84% rise in consolidated net profit to  ₹363.74 crore for the the first quarter ended on 30 June.
The company had reported a net profit of  ₹328.15 crore in the June 2018 quarter, Titan said in a regulatory filing.

Shares of Titan Co. Ltd have declined by almost 22% from their annual closing high seen on 28 June.
The company released its pre-quarterly update for the three months ended June on 8 July, wherein it said that the quarter had witnessed a tough macroeconomic environment.
Given that, expectations from the June quarter results were not particularly high. On a stand-alone basis, Titan’s mainstay jewellery business, accounting for 81% of total revenues, clocked 13% growth, below the company’s internal expectations. A sharp surge in gold prices and slowdown in consumption weighed on consumer demand in June.
However, outlook for the September quarter, too, doesn’t appear to be great. In a post-results conference call, the management indicated that July has been almost as bad as the second half of June.
“We have started to see some early green shoots in last weekend of July and early August,"" it pointed out. Still, how demand conditions pan out remains to be seen.
The company is hopeful of demand revival in the second half of the current fiscal year, which includes the festive season, a time when sales are typically robust.
“To be sure, it is difficult to say whether demand will improve from festival season. It’s worth noting that many factors such as high gold prices, 2.5% increase in customs duty and weaker consumer sentiment have all come together this time,"" said Amnish Aggarwal, head of research at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.
Titan’s watch business revenues, accounting for 14% of the total, increased at a relatively faster pace of 20%.
The company said the watch revenue growth was partly aided by part execution of a large institutional order from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd.
However, given that the segment’s contribution to the overall scheme of things is small, it doesn’t move the needle as much.
Overall, Titan’s revenues increased 14% year-on-year to  ₹4,940 crore, a tad below Bloomberg’s consensus estimates. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization increased by 14% as well. Even as employee costs and other expenses increased at a faster pace, a decline in advertising expenses helped.
Analysts said the Titan stock is capturing a good share of the pessimism surrounding the demand environment.
Still, valuations are not exactly inexpensive. Currently, the Titan stock trade at almost 51 times estimated earnings for FY20. Lacklustre June quarter results and muted demand outlook could well keep meaningful appreciation at bay from a near- to medium-term perspective."

Titan: Shares of the company pared early losses, trading down more than 3% revenues as per financials declined 2% on a year-on-year basis mainly due to the adverse impact of the hedges matured during the quarter. A 7% rise in jewellery retail sales in the September quarter failed to cheer investors.

Some users are logging out of wearable fitness devices and apps, exhausted by the overload of information and notifications, and obsessive tracking of calories and steps

Sometimes, in a toxic relationship, it’s the guilt and the hope of the situation improving that keeps you from quitting. But Samera Khan had had enough. After five months, she decided to give up her smart wearable device that she had bought a year earlier in the hope that it would encourage her to be more active. “For two months, I was a maniac trying to achieve the targets. Soon, instead of focusing on exercise, I was fixated on the numbers displayed by the device,"" recalls the Mumbai-based co-founder of design studio 2point5.
While Khan, 41, felt she was chasing numbers, Shardul Srivastava, international sales coordinator at manufacturing firm Conquest Medtech, stopped wearing his fitness tracker after using it for nearly a year. He felt the device wasn’t useful for people interested in an advanced level of fitness. Yet, Srivastava, 33, who has competed in professional bodybuilding shows, has started wearing it again, as an accessory. “It’s has a bright orange band and looks good. I don’t check how many steps I have taken or my heart rate,"" he says.
The demand for smartwear devices shows no sign of receding in India, though. According to the second quarter data compiled by the International Data Corporation (IDC) last year, wristbands formed a major chuck of the shipment in smartwear device category, with some of the major players being Xiaomi, GOQii, Titan (Fastrack Reflex), Fitbit and Lenovo, in that order. What’s more, the recent acquisition of Fitbit by Google for $2.1 billion is being seen as a move to aid Google’s entry into the fitness tracker market.
But there are many like Khan and Srivastava, who have bought fitness devices or have downloaded fitness apps with great expectations only to cut them out of their routine owing to overload of information and notifications, data inaccuracy and unreachable or too simple targets. While the concept of wearable devices is a decade old, in India, the fitness tracker device has gained popularity only in the past three-four years due to the increased dialogue on healthy lifestyle.
Jaipal Singh, associate research manager (client devices), IDC India, divides the fitness device users in two segments—hard-core users and enthusiasts. “When the enthusiasts buy the device, they initially feel motivated and the use is high. However, most activities like steps, heart rate, and sleep are routine tasks. After some time, as there is no engagement, many quit,"" he says. While he doesn’t have specific numbers, Singh admits that he has seen many enthusiastic users quit fitness trackers.
Logging out
While the device encourages the user to move about, several users complain of inaccuracy in the captured data. For instance, Mumbai’s Sabaah Potia, 26, associate at the strategy communication and corporate social responsibility advisory company The Good Edge, says she got fed up with her wristband as she started yoga. “The band was not useful. It wouldn’t count the movement in Hatha and Aerial yoga."" She used the device for four months, and eventually, like Khan, decided to give it up after she felt she was obsessing over the steps target. “I also felt the device never got my heartbeat or sleeping pattern right. Sometimes I had to manually log the information.""
When Gaurav Rastogi, 42, started using his smartwear fitness device earlier this year, he would track his activity and the progress on a daily basis. His excitement lasted for a month and a half. “It’s an overkill of information and forces me to track more frequently than I want to. I just couldn’t see the upside of using it,"" says Singapore-based Rastogi, co-founder of online mutual fund investments platform Kuvera, who cycles to work. ""When people invest in mutual funds, they ask us tons of questions about prices, past returns, fund managers, etc. But none of these predict future returns at all. But somehow when we have the data, we think we are empowered,"" he says.
Some people got tired was the constant checking of the device. During the initial days, Khan used to check her wearable device almost every minute. Rohan Kumar, 35, manager at Capgemini, used to do the same. After using a smartwear device for six years, he gave it up last year. The reason: “I just got bored.""
Kumar admits the device encouraged him to be fit initially because of its one unique feature: much like social media, the device allowed his friends to check his data and vice-versa. “I would compare my friends’ stats and try to do better. It was a healthy competition,"" he says. But the addictive nature of the device was not helping me, he adds.
During the peak of her obsession with finishing the day’s target of 8,000 steps, Khan would resort to cheating. “The device counts the train journey as activity and counts them as steps. I would happily count them too in my day’s quota of steps."" Then there were times, when she would feel guilty about not achieving the target and keep walking at home before going to sleep. “When you don’t achieve the target the device would give a negative feedback. It made me feel so guilty,"" she says.
AT THE COST OF HEALTH
Having read about how fitness trackers and apps help users embrace a healthy lifestyle, Delhi’s Nilofar Shamim Haja, 36, content and marketing lead, Nivi India, an online platform providing information for family planning, downloaded a fitness and a calorie calculator app in May.
“I didn’t want to invest in a wearable device without first trying out free apps. Seeing data on screen about the number of steps I had taken in a day or week and how many calories I have burnt was motivation enough to keep checking in,"" she says. So, began the task of being mindful about calorie consumption. Within three weeks, her “love affair turned sour"". “It became obsessive and I would end up overdoing the walks and physical movement just to get to that ideal daily calorie count. Every meal was quantified and tracked, with the associated guilt that comes with an extra portion,"" she says.
While the apps aren’t holding the users at gunpoint to follow their recommendation, Haja believes the nature of any interactive platform or digital service is such that “they incrementally modify our behaviour and turn it into compulsive habits. Being mindful about how we eat is helpful and necessary, so that we can take charge of faulty eating habits. But micromanaging our food intake and constantly tracking every toss and turn, bend and kick and walk is tedious and tiring.""
Once an activity feels like a chore, procrastination sets in. This is something Altaf Patel, 36, manager at a consumer durable company, is well aware of. On a friend’s suggestion, Patel downloaded the nutrition and calorie-calculator app and used it merely a week. “The intention was to keep a track of the calorie. But who will keep track of how much each food portion’s calorie value is and feed it at the end of the meal? Initially, I was motivated but it was short-lived,"" he says. Now, he is mindful of the food portion he has and goes for a three to five-kilometre walk every morning. He doesn’t track his progress.
2point5’s Khan, meanwhile, goes to gym at her convenience. “I feel much better in every sense."""

(With Agency Inputs)"
6,2019-11-06,Titan,"Titan now expects revenue from its jewellery biz for H2 fiscal 2020 to increase 11-13% y-o-y from about 20% earlierFor the September quarter, jewellery business accounted for 79% of the company’s standalone revenues, down 1.5% y-o-y

Before Titan Co. Ltd announced its September quarter earnings, the stock was trading at nearly 65 times its estimated earnings for this fiscal year. This is based on Tuesday’s closing price on the NSE. No doubt, valuations were pricey and expectations were high. But Titan’s September quarter results, announced after market hours on Tuesday, have disappointed investors.
Consumers shied away from purchasing jewellery, thanks to higher gold prices. This translated into a year-on-year drop of 14% in Titan’s gold jewellery grammage during the last quarter.
More importantly, Titan has tapered future expectations. It now expects revenue from its jewellery business for the second half of fiscal year 2020 (H2 FY20) to increase 11-13% year-on-year from about 20% earlier.
Titan shares shed a tenth of their value on Wednesday. The big question now for investors would be whether Titan is able to achieve its new lowered guidance. “There are risks to meeting this lowered 11-13% growth guidance for H2 FY20,"" wrote analysts from Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a report on 5 November. “December quarter will be very challenging as: (1) the festive season was early this year and some primary sales to franchisees would have been pushed to Q2 in FY20 and (2) there is a  ₹200 crore institutional order in the Q3 FY20 base,"" pointed out the Credit Suisse report.
Titan derives a large chunk of its revenue from the jewellery business, which contributed as much as 79% of stand-alone revenue for the September quarter. Jewellery revenue declined 1.5% on a year-on-year basis. “After a sudden surge in gold prices in mid-June, there was a considerable decline in sales in July. Higher level of promotion and schemes led to strong growth in the months of August and September,"" said the earnings presentation.
What next? With consumer sentiment subdued across the country, a near-term weakness in demand cannot be ruled out for Titan. Profit margin outlook isn’t bright either. “Though promotions have been reduced as per management, higher margin comparables in H2 FY19 (due to inventory gains and lower ad spends) and a weak consumer spending are unlikely to drive margin upsides,"" highlight analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a report on 5 November. “Slower-than-expected pick up in consumer spending can drive further downsides to our FY21-22 estimates,"" added the brokerage firm.
Given these challenging business conditions, it won’t be surprising if the Titan stock takes a while to start shining again. After Wednesday’s share price fall, the stock now trades at about 58 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data."

On the Global front as well – markets are continuing their positive movement on the hope of US-China phase 1 trade deal negotiation,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, head - retail research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
