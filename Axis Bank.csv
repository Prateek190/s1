253,2018-01-17,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank's move to hike its MCLR comes days after SBI lowered its lending rate under the older base rate system by 0.30 percentage points

Mumbai: In a surprise move, the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, which has been facing earning pressure in the past quarters, on Wednesday hiked its lending rates by a marginal 0.05 percentage points. 
Mumbai: In a surprise move, the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank, which has been facing earning pressure in the past quarters, on Wednesday hiked its lending rates by a marginal 0.05 percentage points.
The move to increase the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) comes days after the nation’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) had lowered its rates under the older base rate system by a steep 0.30 percentage points.
“The bank has decided to increase the MCLRs by 0.05 percentage points across all tenors,"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing late in the evening.
The hike is effective from Thursday, the bank added. The one-year MCLR, at which rate its home loans and other important products are priced, will now stand at 8.30%, the bank said. The lender, which has been witnessing mounting asset quality and bottom-line pressures for the past many quarters, however, did not give any rationale for the move.
The rate action comes amid a hardening of bond yields over the past few months, which is bound to make banks report huge mark-to-market losses, which domestic rating Icra had pegged at around Rs15,000 crore in the December quarter.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has also virtually told the banks that it would not allow any special dispensation to safeguard their bottom lines. The MCLR replaced the earlier base rate system in April 2016, to better translate policy actions and cost of funding faster into the pricing of loans. 
Banks calculate the rate on a pre-disclosed formula and rates are reviewed on a monthly basis. It can be noted that there have been deposit rate hikes by a few lenders in select tenors. Also, the review comes amid a virtual doubling in the credit growth to the double digit figure after a dull FY17. 
At its September quarter earnings, the bank had reported a slippage in its net interest margin to 3.45%, affirmed that was in line with the guidance of a 0.20% compression given earlier."
252,2018-01-18,Axis Bank,"Sembcorp India is expected to file its draft IPO papers with Sebi in February, Credit Suisse and Axis Bank are lead investment banks for the share sale

Mumbai: Singapore-based utility group Sembcorp Industries is gearing up to file for an initial public offering (IPO) of its Indian arm which could see the company raise around $500-600 million (about Rs3,200-3,800 crore), two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: Singapore-based utility group Sembcorp Industries is gearing up to file for an initial public offering (IPO) of its Indian arm which could see the company raise around $500-600 million (about Rs3,200-3,800 crore), two people aware of the development said.
Sembcorp’s Indian arm comprises thermal and renewable power assets. “Sembcorp India is expected to file its draft IPO prospectus with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) sometime next month. The proposed IPO could see Sembcorp raise as much as $500-600 million,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to talk to reporters. 
“Investment banks Credit Suisse and Axis Capital are managing the initial share sale of the company,"" he said, adding that the company is yet to decide on the final structure of the share sale in terms of whether it will be a complete primary offering or a mix of primary and secondary share sale. 
Mint reported on 3 October about Singapore-based power producer’s plans to list its Indian unit.
According to the second person cited above, Sembcorp India has a portfolio of 4,000 megawatt (MW) of operating power assets across thermal and renewable. “Its thermal power business comprises over 2,600MW, while the renewable business comprises of 1,400MW of operational and under development assets,"" he said. 
Credit Suisse declined to comment. An email sent to Axis Capital on Tuesday did not elicit any response. “We have a strong commitment to the growth and sustainability of our over 4,000MW renewable and thermal energy portfolio in India, for which we continually evaluate various commercial and financial options. We have no further comment at this stage but will make an official announcement if and when appropriate,"" a spokesperson for Sembcorp said in an email response to queries regarding the Indian unit’s IPO plans. The company made its first power sector investment in India in 2010 when it acquired a stake in Gayatri Energy Ventures’s Thermal Powertech Corp. India, a thermal power plant.
In February 2015, Sembcorp Industries acquired a 60% stake in IDFC Alternatives Ltd-backed renewable energy firm Green Infra Ltd for Singapore $227 million. In August, Sembcorp Industries announced the acquisition of IDFC’s remaining 28% stake in SGI for Rs1,410 crore (around Singapore $301 million) to become its sole owner.
Sembcorp is among the few foreign utility firms that owns thermal power assets in India. Others include American firm AES and China Light and Power. 
Sembcorp India’s plans to go public come at a time when the Indian IPO market has seen its best year ever and other renewable power producers too have been contemplating public listings. In 2017, 36 companies raised Rs67,147 crore through the IPO route, while 26 companies raised Rs26,493.8 crore in 2016, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
In December, The Economic Times reported that renewable energy producer Renew Power Ventures had appointed investment banks Goldmans Sachs, Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. Ltd and JM Financial for a $700 million IPO. In September, ACME Solar Holdings filed draft papers with Sebi for a Rs2,200 crore initial share sale."

Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd on Monday reported a 25.3% increase in its fiscal-third quarter profit as the bank provided lower provisions against its bad loans. 
Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd on Monday reported a 25.3% increase in its fiscal-third quarter profit as the bank provided lower provisions against its bad loans.
Net profit rose to Rs726.44 crore for the quarter ended 31 December from Rs579.57 crore a year ago. According to 16 Bloomberg analysts’ estimates, the bank was expected to post a net profit of Rs818.70 crore.
Net interest income (NII) or the core income a bank earns by giving loans was up 9.18% to Rs4,731.52 crore compared with Rs4,333.73 crore last year. Other income was at Rs2,593.08 crore, down 23.74% from Rs3,400.21 crore a year ago.
Provisions and contingencies fell 26% to Rs2,811.04 crore from Rs3,795.80 crore a year ago. On quarter-on-quarter basis, it fell 10.49% from Rs3,140.41 crore.
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 22.15% to Rs25,000.51 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs20,466.82 crore in the same quarter last year.
As a percentage of total loans, gross NPAs stood at 5.28% as compared to 5.90% in the previous quarter and 5.22% in the year-ago quarter. Net NPAs were at 2.56% in the December quarter compared to 3.12% in the previous quarter and 2.18% in the same quarter last year.
Gross NPA additions declined 50.5% to Rs4,428 crore. The bank said that corporate slippages stood at Rs2,980 crore and 93% of its came from low-rated BB and below accounts.
Recoveries and upgrades were at Rs4,008 crore, while write-offs during the quarter was at Rs2,822 crore.
“During the quarter bank recovered substantial amount in cash from an IT/ITES account and also upgraded one account in the Steel Sector. These two accounts were part of the nine accounts that were reclassified as NPA by the Bank in second quarter of fiscal year 2018,"" it said in a notice to the BSE.
Its total loan amount outstanding against IBC accounts and watchlist stood at Rs6,074 crore and Rs5,309 crore, down 14% and 12%, respectively, from its previous quarter.

The tide seems to be turning for Axis Bank Ltd.  
The tide seems to be turning for Axis Bank Ltd. 
India’s third-largest private sector lender saw significant improvement in its asset quality in the December quarter.
Gross non-performing assets or NPAs (as a percentage of gross advances) declined to 5.28% from 5.9% in the September quarter and net NPAs were lower sequentially at 2.56% from 3.12%.
Slippages, which had got out of hand in the previous quarter, declined by 50% sequentially. Fresh slippages fell to Rs4,430 crore in the December quarter from Rs8,940 crore in the three months ended September. 
“The worst in terms of fresh slippages is behind us. There has been no material addition to the bank’s stressed assets pool in the recent past. Now, the focus will shift from recognition phase to the resolution phase, be it through NCLT route or any other,"" the management said in a post-earnings media conference call. NCLT is short for National Company Law Tribunal.
During the third quarter, Axis Bank recovered a substantial amount in cash from a stressed IT/ITeS (IT enabled services) account and also upgraded one account in the steel sector. These two accounts were part of the nine accounts that were reclassified as NPAs by the bank in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, it said.
As a result, the bank’s recoveries and upgrades stood at Rs4,008 crore, which the management says is the highest in many quarters.
Further, its watch-list exposures also fell. As the accompanying chart shows, the watch-list now constitutes just 1.3% of the bank’s loan book as compared to 6.7% in the March quarter of fiscal year 2016. (FY16). According to analysts, this is an indication that Axis Bank is approaching the end of its stressed loan recognition cycle.
Moderation in the credit cost is another positive. The lender has retained its FY18 credit cost guidance of 220-260 basis points. Also, it aims to maintain the provision coverage ratio in the range of 60-65%. A basis point is 0.01%.
Meanwhile, lower bad loan provisions and higher net interest income pushed its net profit 25% higher on a year-on-year basis to Rs726.4 crore. However, a decline in other income and operating income restricted the improvement and consequently, the profit growth fell short of expectations. A Bloomberg poll of 16 analysts estimated the bank’s net profit at Rs818.70 crore.
Nonetheless, the Street cheered the December quarter earnings. The Axis Bank stock touched a 52-week high of Rs621.35 intraday on BSE on Monday. Analysts see limited upside in the stock from current levels, adding that sustaining the turnaround in asset quality is key for the bank."
247,2018-01-23,Axis Bank,"In other news, Axis Bank's  fee income grew 24% to Rs2,246 crore from a year earlier, of which retail contributed almost 50%

25% 
25%
What is it? The increase in the net profit of Axis Bank, India’s third largest private sector lender, to Rs726.4 crore in the October-December quarter, from Rs579.6 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.
Why is it important? This is due to a decrease in provisions against bad loans, a sharp slowdown in bad loan additions and an increase in fee income. Axis Bank’s provisions and contingencies decreased by 26% to Rs2,811 crore, while it added Rs4,428 crore of bad loans, less than half the levels in the September quarter. Its fee income grew 24% to Rs2,246 crore from a year earlier, of which retail contributed almost 50%. 
Tell me more: Shares of Axis Bank rose 3.5% on Monday to close at Rs612, their highest levels since September 2016.
3.9%
What is it? The world’s projected GDP (gross domestic product) growth in 2018 and 2019, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Why is it important? The projections for both years have been revised upwards by 0.2 percentage points. If these hold true, the world economy would grow at its fastest pace since 2011. The IMF says the world economy is gathering speed, though the present economic upturn is a “reflection of confluence of factors that is unlikely to last long"". The US tax policy changes passed in December and enacted this year would account for about half the increase in global growth projections. 
Tell me more: The primary reasons the upturn will taper off is that advanced economies are reaching the limits of their growth potential and the growth in the world’s two biggest economies, US and China, may slow down. The IMF retained India’s GDP projections for 2018 and 2019 at 7.4% and 7.8%, respectively.
10
What is it? The number of years since the 2008 Ahmedabad bombings, where 21 bomb blasts occurred in 70 minutes.
Why is it important? The Delhi police arrested Abdul Subhan Qureshi, the alleged mastermind of the blasts that hit Ahmedabad on 26 July 2008, which killed 56 people and injured over 200. He is the co-founder of Indian Mujahideen, which has been behind some of the most deadly bombings in India. Qureshi is wanted by the National Investigation Agency in connection with terror attacks in Delhi, Bengaluru and the 2006 local train bombings in Mumbai.
Tell me more: Qureshi was reportedly planning a revival of the Indian Mujahideen in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where it had a stronghold earlier.
25 million
What is it? The number of items that Amazon will make available for delivery within two days under its priority programme Amazon Prime, as against 11 million earlier.
Why is it important? It signals greater use of Prime as a lever by the e-commerce major, which is locked in a tough fight against Flipkart in India, to build customer stickiness while growing at a fast clip. Other forthcoming enhancements in Prime—which costs Rs999 a year—include a wider video selection and a music service. Flipkart, too, is reportedly looking to revive its customer loyalty programme.
Tell me more: In India, Prime members reportedly account for 30% of Amazon revenues. In the US, Amazon had 90 million Prime subscribers, as of September 2017—a 100% growth in 27 months.

What is it? The singles ranking of Hyeon Chung of South Korea, who on Monday upset 12-time grand slam winner Novak Djokovic to reach the quarter-finals of the Australian Open. 
Why is it important? Chung is the first South Korean to reach the quarter-finals in the singles of a grand slam. He thus completed an eight-player lineup whose average ranking is a high 29 and which has three rank outsiders in the form of Chung, Kyle Edmund of UK (world ranking 49) and Tennys Sandgren of US (world ranking 97). 
Tell me more: Even as the younger brigade makes a charge, the draw is set up nicely for the two old guards, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who have been the two best men’s singles players in the past 12 months and who played an epic final last year.

244,2018-02-16,Axis Bank,"Shares of Union Bank of India, Axis Bank and Allahabad Bank ended lower on Friday on news that they might have exposure to the PNB fraud allegedly perpetrated by Nirav Modi

New Delhi: Shares of Union Bank of India on Friday ended 1.50% lower after the lender said it has an exposure of Rs1,900 crore to the PNB fraud case. 
New Delhi: Shares of Union Bank of India on Friday ended 1.50% lower after the lender said it has an exposure of Rs1,900 crore to the PNB fraud case.
During the day, Union Bank shares had slumped to its 52-week low on BSE. “We wish to inform you that the bank through our foreign branches has been taking exposure with Punjab National Bank (PNB) as counterparty under various letters of undertakings (LoU) issued through authenticated SWIFT message,"" Union Bank of India said in a late night filing to stock exchanges on Thursday.
Punjab National Bank had on 14 February said it has detected a Rs11,400 crore scam where billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi allegedly acquired fraudulent letters of undertaking from a branch in Mumbai to secure overseas credit from other Indian lenders.
While PNB did not name the other lenders, besides Union Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank are said to have offered credit based on LOUs issued by PNB.
On Friday, shares of Allahabad Bank settled at Rs54.75, down 0.36% on BSE. During the day the stock had plunged to its 52-week low level of Rs53.10.
Axis Bank ended the day at  ₹ 537.75, down 1.10%.
As the Enforcement Directorate conducted multiple searches at establishments linked to Modi, seizing diamonds, jewellery and gold worth Rs5,100 crore and sealing six properties, the finance ministry said recovery would be made and nobody would be spared.
PNB has already suspended 10 officers and referred the matter to CBI for investigation."
243,2018-02-18,Axis Bank,"Officials of Hong Kong branches of Indian lenders including Allahabad Bank, SBI, Union Bank, UCO Bank and Axis Bank are part of the fraud which continued for 7 years

New Delhi: As investigations into the Rs11,400 crore scam at PNB (Punjab National Bank) gather momentum, officials at overseas branches of other banks, where the fraudulently issued Letter of Undertakings (LoUs) were encashed, are under scanner, sources said.  
New Delhi: As investigations into the Rs11,400 crore scam at PNB (Punjab National Bank) gather momentum, officials at overseas branches of other banks, where the fraudulently issued Letter of Undertakings (LoUs) were encashed, are under scanner, sources said. 
Officials of Hong Kong branches of Indian lenders including Allahabad Bank, State Bank of India (SBI), Union Bank, UCO Bank and Axis Bank are part of the entire fraud which continued for 7 years. 
As per the guidelines, the tenure for the encashment of LoUs for the jems and jewellery sector is usually of 90 days and not 365 days—the maturity period of most of the LoUs linked with the PNB fraud, sources said, adding that the deviation from the usual practice should have raised alarm in the minds of officials working at the Hong Kong branch of other lenders. 
But surprisingly this did not happen till last month when PNB refused to honour LoU fraudulently issued by some of the staff at its Brady House branch in Mumbai, sources said. 
Had someone raised alarm earlier, the quantum of fraud could have been lower, sources said, adding that it is like alert citizen informing police about some nefarious activity to authorities for the further action.
As many as 11 Indian banks have operations in Hong Kong. Branches of Allahabad Bank, UCO Bank, Union Bank of India, Axis Bank, SBI, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, and Indian Overseas Bank are present in the city state. 
Among the lenders having a branch in Hong Kong, country’s largest lender SBI has already announced an exposure of $212 million to the PNB fraud involving Nirav Modi-promoted companies. At the same time, another public sector lender Union Bank of India’s exposure stood at $300 million, while UCO Bank has to realise $411.82 million. Allahabad Bank suspects it exposure of around Rs2,000 crore. 
Last week, fraud-hit PNB said it will honour its bonafide commitments and entire liability will be known after the investigation. 
The PNB fraud pertains to issuance of fake Letters of Understanding (LoUs) to companies associated with billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi by errant PNB employees, which enabled these companies to raise buyers credit from international branches of other Indian lenders. 
Last month, PNB had lodged an FIR with CBI stating that fraudulent LoUs worth Rs280.7 crore were first issued on 16 January. At the time, PNB had said it was digging into records to examine the magnitude of the fraud. In the complaint, PNB had named three diamond firms—Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds—saying they had approached it on 16 January with a request for buyers credit for making payment to overseas suppliers."

The Nostro account refers to an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank overseas to enable foreign trade by its clients. 
The CBI has now written to these five banks, having branches in Antwerp, Frankfurt, Mauritius, Hong Kong and Bahrain, to provide details of all such transactions to dig out a clear money trail of Rs11,400 crore."

Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd has deferred a $500-million bond sale after international investors expressed concerns about the health of India’s banking system in the wake of the $2-billion fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB), two people aware of the development said. The bonds were due for placement on 19 February. 
Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd has deferred a $500-million bond sale after international investors expressed concerns about the health of India’s banking system in the wake of the $2-billion fraud at Punjab National Bank (PNB), two people aware of the development said. The bonds were due for placement on 19 February.
The bank, India’s third largest private sector lender, is yet to decide on a fresh issue date for the senior unsecured notes with a tenor of 5.5 years and a coupon of around 3.25%, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
“The Nirav Modi saga has caused concerns among the international investor community with respect to the overall health of banks in India, since the impact of the fraud is not fully understood yet,"" said one of the two people cited earlier. 
“Accordingly, some investors have sought additional details pertaining to any contingent liability that may occur.""
“However, Axis Bank is working to address investor concerns and plans the bond issue in coming weeks,"" the second person cited earlier said.
“The Nirav Modi and Rotomac scams have soured the sentiment of global investors vis-à-vis Indian banks and widened the trading spreads of existing bonds. This has pushed back any new issuance, till investors come to grips with the extent of provisioning losses suffered by the banks. Furthermore, the rise in the yields on US treasuries and the outcome of the FOMC meeting, coupled with the Chinese New Year break, paused issuance momentum,"" said Nachiket Naik, managing director at IREP Credit Capital, a Mumbai-based non-banking financial company.
An Axis Bank spokesperson said in an email, “Axis Bank evaluates various opportunities on a continuous basis and the bank as a matter of policy does not comment on market speculation.""
In its first information report (FIR) filed with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on 31 January, PNB had named the Hong Kong branches of Axis Bank and Allahabad Bank, which had received the fraudulent letters of undertaking (LoUs) against which both banks had released payments.
In a 15 February regulatory filing, Axis Bank, however, said it had “sold down all the buyers’ credit transactions"" undertaken by its Hong Kong branch with Punjab National Bank.
Buyers’ credit is a loan extended by a bank to an importer to finance imports. Axis Bank had clarified that in the normal course of business, it undertakes transactions against LoUs issued by other banks through its overseas branches.
The private sector bank said it has undertaken such transactions in the past with PNB against their authenticated SWIFT LoUs.
In August last year, Axis Bank raised $500 million in bonds as part of its $5 billion global medium-term note programme. 
Institutional investors from Asia, Africa, Europe and the US had subscribed to the issue.
Mint reported on Monday that the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has sought details of financial transactions in the Nostro accounts of Punjab National Bank on the basis of 293 fraudulent LoUs issued by it to jewellers Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi to establish the money trail. 
Nostro account refers to an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank overseas to facilitate overseas trade by its clients."

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday said it has imposed a penalty of Rs3 crore on Axis Bank for violation of non-performing asset (NPA) classification norms, and Rs2 crore on Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) for not complying with the know your customer (KYC) regulations.  
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Monday said it has imposed a penalty of Rs3 crore on Axis Bank for violation of non-performing asset (NPA) classification norms, and Rs2 crore on Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) for not complying with the know your customer (KYC) regulations. 
RBI said it had carried out a statutory inspection of private sector player Axis Bank with reference to its financial position as on 31 March 2016. The inspection, inter alia, revealed “violations of various regulations issued by RBI in the assessment of non-performing assets (NPA)"",the central bank said in a statement. 
“The RBI has imposed, on February 27, 2018, a monetary penalty of  ₹ 30 million on Axis Bank Limited for non-compliance with the directions issued by RBI on Income Recognition and Asset Classification (IRAC) norms,"" it said. 
Regarding the state-owned Indian Overseas Bank, the regulator said in a separate release that a “fraud was detected"" in one of the branches of the bank. “The examination of the documents, including the bank’s internal inspection report, revealed, inter alia, non-compliance with the directions issued by RBI on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms"", RBI said, while imposing the Rs2 crore penalty on IOB.

237,2018-03-20,Axis Bank,"The DoT order comes after Axis Bank failed to invoke a bank guarantee issued by them on behalf of Aircel group of companies

New Delhi: The department of telecommunications has written to all telecom and Internet service providers that it will not accept any bank guarantees by Axis Bank after the lender failed to invoke a bank guarantee issued by it on behalf of Aircel. 
New Delhi: The department of telecommunications has written to all telecom and Internet service providers that it will not accept any bank guarantees by Axis Bank after the lender failed to invoke a bank guarantee issued by it on behalf of Aircel.
“Axis Bank has failed to invoke a bank guarantee issued by them on behalf of Aircel group of companies. This action by Axis Bank is a serious breach of trust and contract with the government of India. In view of this, you are hereby directed not to accept any new bank guarantee from Axis Bank, including renewals,"" a 16 March letter from DoT to all operators stated. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
A bank guarantee is a pledge from a bank or a lending institution that if a certain borrower defaults on a loan, the bank will cover the loss.
“The matter pertains to Aircel. So just before Aircel went to NCLT... because we knew once NCLT gives a go-ahead, we will not be able to encash (the bank guarantee)... so before that we issued the letter requesting Axis bank (to pay),"" a senior official of the DoT said requesting anonymity, adding that Aircel owes the government Rs411 crore in spectrum usage charges, licence fee, etc.
Aircel had on 28 February filed an application at the Mumbai bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) along with its units, citing high unsustainable debt, price wars, and legal and regulatory challenges. The NCLT on 8 March admitted Aircel’s bankruptcy petition.
However, Axis Bank said that if it encashes the guarantee, it will be a violation of an order by the telecom tribunal.
“The bank guarantees have been issued by us on behalf of Bharti Airtel,"" an official spokesperson for Axis Bank said. Bharti Airtel had in April 2016 entered into an agreement with Aircel to acquire its 2,300-MHz spectrum band in eight circles for Rs3,500 crore.
“Payment of the said guarantees, at present, will be in violation of the orders of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). Once the order is vacated the bank will be pleased to honour the said guarantees, as per the underlying terms. This matter has been communicated to the DoT,"" Axis Bank said in the statement.
A recent TDSAT order on a dispute involving DoT and Aircel prevents Axis Bank from making payments on the invoked bank guarantee.
“They (Axis Bank) have mentioned some case in TDSAT...but that is between the DoT and the operator. It is not between DoT and Axis Bank. Axis Bank has fiduciary relationship with DoT and in no way can the bank refuse our demand, it is against the law,"" the official cited above said.
“Aircel had gone to TDSAT seeking a stay so that the DoT is not able to encash bank guarantees. But that does not give Axis Bank any elbow room to refuse our demand...We have written to CMD of Axis Bank also that we will not honour any bank guarantee,"" the official added.
However, the DoT’s demand to invoke bank guarantee may be illegal, a legal professional said requesting anonymity, adding that “If the invocation of a bank guarantee is stayed by a court order then how can the bank pay? The DoT cannot force the bank to committ contempt of court"".
An email query sent to Bharti Airtel remained unanswered at press time."
236,2018-03-23,Axis Bank,"Resignations of corporate banking head Sidharth Rath and deputy MD V. Srinivasan come at a time when Axis Bank's corporate portfolio has taken a beating due to asset quality issues

Mumbai: Two top executives at Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third largest private bank, have quit, two people aware of the development said.  
Mumbai: Two top executives at Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third largest private bank, have quit, two people aware of the development said. 
Sidharth Rath, head of corporate and transaction banking, and V. Srinivasan, deputy managing director, have resigned, these people said on condition of anonymity. The Mumbai-based bank has seen a drastic fall in corporate loans in the recent past.
Rath’s exit followed the hiring of S.M. Sundaresan, head of corporate banking at Standard Chartered, as head of corporate banking at Axis Bank. Rath is now likely to join Standard Chartered as head of corporate banking in Sundaresan’s place, the first of the two people said.
Rath, who has been with Axis Bank since 2001, has served in various roles such as senior vice-president, president-corporate banking, and president-transaction banking. He was instrumental in setting up the corporate and project advisory services, syndication and debt capital markets, investment banking businesses, and the formation of the transaction banking vertical, according to the bank’s website. 
Srinivasan, who joined Axis Bank as executive director-corporate banking in 2009, was elevated as a director in October 2012. Earlier, he was managing director and head of markets with J.P. Morgan India. His next move is not yet known.
“As a matter of policy, Axis Bank does not comment on speculative assertions around its internal functioning,"" said an Axis Bank spokesperson. A Standard Chartered spokesperson declined to comment.
“Corporate lending business is undergoing a major underwriting change. That will have a major impact on the way business is contributed in future. In that scenario, we believe management and board of Axis will be able to maintain continuity,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.
The resignations come at a time when Axis Bank’s corporate portfolio has taken a beating due to asset quality issues. The Reserve Bank of India’s asset quality review prompted a six-fold increase in its non-performing assets over the past two years, followed by instances of divergences in NPA disclosures, which the regulator asked the bank to make public.
 Recently, RBI also imposed a fine of Rs3 crore on the bank for flouting NPA norms.
Separately, the bank is also being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India for leakage of price-sensitive information relating to financial results on WhatsApp groups before they were officially announced.
The private bank sector has witnessed a handful of senior-level churn in corporate lending divisions.
This month, Rahul Shukla, former managing director and head of corporate banking-South Asia at Citibank, quit after a 12-year tenure and joined as head of corporate banking at HDFC Bank. Shukla has swapped the position with Balasubramanian K., who moved from HDFC Bank in November and joined Citi Bank’s South Asia Corporate Bank head.
“The corporate banking space has been traditionally dominated by PSU as well as large Indian private sector banks,"" said Mukesh Bhasin, partner at domestic executive search firm Career Connect India. “Their dominance is being challenged by new and some nimbler players who don’t have legacy issues on portfolio quality and this is one of the key reasons for the talent movements happening recently,"" he added."

Mumbai: Axis Bank’s failure to honour a bank guarantee due to legal tangles does not amount to a default, and the third largest private sector lender’s ratings will not be affected, said Fitch Ratings on Monday. 
Mumbai: Axis Bank’s failure to honour a bank guarantee due to legal tangles does not amount to a default, and the third largest private sector lender’s ratings will not be affected, said Fitch Ratings on Monday.
“Axis Bank’s failure to honour a guarantee it issued is not a default and thus, does not affect the bank’s long-term rating,"" it said in a note. The agency has a ‘BBB-’ rating with a stable outlook on the Shikha Sharma-led bank.
Fitch said that the bank decided not to honour the guarantee because it believed doing so would have “contravened a court order related to a separate legal case."" The agency said its bank rating criteria does not view a bank as having failed if it has defaulted as a result of “legal restrictions"" on servicing obligations while it remains solvent and liquid. It also took note of a communication to exchanges, wherein the bank had affirmed to honour all commitments.
Fitch said the issue has arisen because of a legal battle between the now-bankrupt telecom company Aircel and the department of telecommunication (DoT). The rating agency said the Axis Bank has informed it that the guarantee was issued to Bharti Airtel, which had an agreement to trade spectrum held by Aircel but the bankruptcy filing led to the DoT calling on the bank to cover the amount guaranteed.
“However, an earlier order from the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal prevented Axis Bank from doing so, and thus, revoking the payment under the bank guarantee was the only way the bank could avoid being in contempt of court,"" the agency said.
It added that the bank does not have any other exposure to Aircel and a bulk of its Rs9,200-crore outstanding non-funded exposure to the telecom sector, including this, is almost entirely to well-rated borrowers. It can be noted that following the Axis Bank’s failure to honour the said guarantee, the DoT had ordered that bank guarantees from the lender should not be taken, calling it as a serious breach of trust and contract with the government.
Axis Bank shares closed at Rs507.50, up 1.30% on BSE, while the Sensex gained 1.44% to 33,066.41 points."

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked Axis Bank’s board to re-consider the decision to re-appoint Shikha Sharma as its managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) for a fourth term, amid concerns over rising bad loans at the country’s third largest private sector lender, people in the know said.  
New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has asked Axis Bank’s board to re-consider the decision to re-appoint Shikha Sharma as its managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) for a fourth term, amid concerns over rising bad loans at the country’s third largest private sector lender, people in the know said. 
The move comes against the backdrop of persisting concerns over mounting non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system. People in the know said the RBI has shot off a letter to the chairman of Axis Bank Sanjiv Misra, who is also a former expenditure secretary, with regard to the board’s decision to re-appoint Sharma. 
The bank’s board has been asked to re-consider the decision to give a fourth three-year term for Sharma as managing director and CEO, the people in the know said. According to them, the RBI’s letter has also cited the bank’s performance and deteriorating asset quality condition over the years. 
In July 2017, the board of Axis Bank had approved re-appointment of Sharma. Her new term is to start from June 2018. The people familiar with the matter said the re-appointment is yet to be ratified by the RBI. As per regulations, appointments of top management personnel at private sector banks require the RBI’s clearance. 
“We wish to inform you that the bank’s board follows a standard process with regard to senior appointments, and forwards its recommendations to the regulator (to the extent required). This process is currently in progress,"" Axis Bank said in a statement on Monday. 
The private sector lender’s NPAs jumped by over five-fold in recent financial years. The gross NPAs worth Rs4,110 crore at the end of March 2015 surged to Rs21,280 crore at the end of March 2017. During the same period, the lender’s net profit halved from Rs7,357.8 crore to Rs3,679.2 crore. 
Recently, RBI had also penalised the bank for incorrectly reporting bad loans. The asset-class divergence uncovered by RBI was Rs9,480 crore in 2015-16 and Rs5,633 crore in 2016-17. Laden with infrastructure loans, the bank has struggled to contain NPAs. 
During demonetisation, Axis Bank was in the news for alleged involvement of its staff for suspected money laundering activities and illegal note conversions. Income Tax Department had conducted several raids and arrested few of its employees for indulging in illegal activities during the note ban initiated on 8 November 2016. 
Last year, market regulator Sebi also ordered Axis Bank to strengthen its systems and conduct an internal probe to fix responsibility as the initial investigation showed the leakage of price sensitive financial information was due to “inadequacy"" of processes at the bank in the WhatsApp leak case. 
The bank’s results for the April-June 2017 quarter were “either identical or matched closely with the figures"" that were in circulation on WhatsApp prior to an official announcement, Sebi had noted in its order. Sebi’s move followed a probe initiated after reports about unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) being circulated in various private WhatsApp groups about certain companies, including Axis Bank, ahead of their official announcements."

New Delhi: Private sector Axis Bank on Monday said there was a standard process for senior appointments in the bank and the process of reappointment of managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Shikha Sharma was still on. 
The bank statement came in as a clarification sought from stock exchanges in response to a media report on Monday saying the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had asked Axis Bank to reconsider Sharma’s reappointment. 
Earlier in July 2017, the board of directors of the bank had approved the re-appointment of Shikha Sharma as the MD and CEO for three years with effect from 1 June, 2018. The board decision is pending regulatory approval. 
The veteran banker is serving the second term that comes to an end in June 2018. She joined Axis Bank in 2009 with a five-year mandate which was subsequently extended. “The bank’s board follows a standard process with regard to senior appointments, and forwards its recommendations to the regulator (to the extent required). This process is currently under progress,"" Axis Bank said in a regulatory filing. 
“We have no further comments to offer as the report appearing in the media is speculative,"" the bank clarified. 
Media reports were rife until a year ago about her reappointment with the bank and also that she was sounded out by salt-to-information technology conglomerate Tata Sons to head company’s financial services business. Stock of Axis Bank ended 2.20% down at Rs498.20 on BSE."
230,2018-04-03,Axis Bank,"CBI has questioned GMs and Deputy GMs of Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bankbanks that received the fake PNB LoUs from Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi companies

New Delhi: Widening the scope of its probe into the Rs12,636 crore PNB fraud, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has started questioning senior executives of other Indian banks, the overseas branches of which were issued letters of undertaking (LoU) by Punjab National Bank. 
New Delhi: Widening the scope of its probe into the Rs12,636 crore PNB fraud, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has started questioning senior executives of other Indian banks, the overseas branches of which were issued letters of undertaking (LoU) by Punjab National Bank.
The agency questioned the general managers and deputy general managers of Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank on Sunday and Monday. CBI did not name the executives.
However, senior agency officials confirmed that these executives were not based out of overseas branches, but were part of the Indian operations of the banks. 
“CBI has been questioning senior officers of other Indian banks whose overseas branches were involved in the issue of buyers’ credit on the basis of LoUs issued by PNB. During the last two days, CBI has been questioning officers of the rank of GM and DGM of these banks who were in charge of the international and treasury operations. So far, five officers of the banks have been questioned,"" said a person familiar with the developments on condition of anonymity. 
The person said that the questioning was being carried out in order to “understand their role, so that we can come to a conclusion,"" and added that CBI had not yet been able to determine criminality “because there are shell companies that are also involved and the ongoing investigation is trying to ascertain the role of these officials.""
Bank of India, Allahabad Bank and Axis Bank did not respond to requests for comment till press time.
The move comes three weeks after the CBI questioned PNB’s general manager (treasury) S.K. Chand on 5 March, a day after it arrested four people—two employees and an auditor of jeweller Nirav Modi’s group of companies, and a director of the Gitanjali group of companies.
The agency confirmed then that Manish K. Bosamiya, former additional general manager (operation) and Miten Anil Pandya, then finance manager, both of Firestar International, were arrested for their alleged role in the preparation of applications for the fraudulent LoUs.
In February, the Nirav Modi group as well as Mehul Choksi’s Gitanjali group were accused of defrauding PNB of Rs12,636 crore by allegedly colluding with bank employees to secure credit from overseas lenders using fraudulent guarantees for the past eight years.
While both Modi and Choksi have denied wrongdoing and have declined from joining the ongoing investigation, their lawyers told Mint that the two were unable to travel to India since their passports had been suspended. 
On 17 February, CBI had arrested Gokulnath Shetty, a former deputy manager at PNB; Manoj Kharat, a single-window operator at the bank; and Hemant Bhat, the authorized signatory of the Nirav Modi group. 
On Monday, the agency questioned four other officials from the Nirav Modi group—chief financial officer Ravi Gupta, vice-president (finance) Vipul Ambani, president of the Nirav Modi group’s international finance division Saurabh Sharma, and Subhash Parab, a senior finance executive of the group.
In its second complaint to CBI on 13 February, PNB, admitting the involvement of some of its officials, said, “They have fraudulently issued letters of undertaking, without following the bank’s prescribed procedures… and without making entries in the banking system, avoiding detection of the transactions... transmitted SWIFT instructions to the overseas branches of Indian banks under buyer’s credit.""
So far, the CBI has arrested 19 people as part of the ongoing probe. 
In a statement issued last week, PNB stated that it was going to bear the entire liability of the LoUs that had been issued.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has dropped Axis Bank, which has been one of the largest importers of bullion, from the list of lenders allowed to ship in gold and silver for the current fiscal year.  
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has dropped Axis Bank, which has been one of the largest importers of bullion, from the list of lenders allowed to ship in gold and silver for the current fiscal year. 
The action comes a day after reports said the central bank asked the board of the third largest private sector lender to re-look at the three-year fourth term offered to Shikha Sharma as the managing director and chief executive, citing a massive spike in bad loans. 
The Axis Bank board had late last year re-appointed her for a fourth term beginning this June. She joined the bank from ICICI Bank in June 2009. During her stewardship non performing assets (NPAs) at the bank rose over fivefold to over 5.3% in the December 2017 quarter. 
The RBI published the list of 16 banks which have been allowed to import the precious metals on Monday on its website, wherein Axis Bank is excluded. Axis Bank was one of the leading importers for gold and silver among all the 19 lenders which were given the licence last year. 
Banks import raw gold and silver, and sell it to the trade participants. This activity helps a bank with fees and deepen its relationships with key clientele, according the industry analysts. The spokespersons for neither Axis Bank, nor the RBI chose to comment on the development. 
The 16 banks which have been given the licence to import gold and silver for FY19 also include the scam-hit Punjab National Bank reeling under a nearly Rs13,000 crore fraud created by from the gems and jewellery sector itself. 
The list also has other top private sector banks, including Axis Bank’s larger rival ICICI Bank which is fighting allegations of conflict of interest or quid pro quo by its chief Chanda Kochhar, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Federal Bank and Yes Bank. 
The State Bank leads the pack of state-run lenders, while there are also international lenders like the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of Nova Scotia. Other banks dropped for the current fiscal include the South-focused private sector lender Karur Vysya Bank and South Indian Bank. 
Interestingly, Axis Bank had held on to the licence even after the allegations of wrongdoing by a few staffers during the demonetisation period. After getting battered on Monday following the news, the Axis Bank counter rose 1.02% to Rs503.30 on the BSE, whose benchmark Sensex rose 0.35%."

227,2018-04-06,Axis Bank,"CEO Shikha Sharma changed Axis Bank's image as a corporate lender by expanding its retail base, but things changed in late 2015 when RBI announced an asset quality review

Mumbai: In her eight years and 10 months at the helm of Axis Bank Ltd, Shikha Sharma has managed to change the private sector bank’s image as a corporate lender by expanding its retail base, besides making key acquisitions. 
Mumbai: In her eight years and 10 months at the helm of Axis Bank Ltd, Shikha Sharma has managed to change the private sector bank’s image as a corporate lender by expanding its retail base, besides making key acquisitions.
After spending nearly three decades at ICICI Group across the bank, investment banking and insurance arm, Sharma took over as Axis Bank’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) in June 2009.
In July 2017, Sharma got her fourth extension as CEO for another three years. On Monday, Economic Times reported that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has written to the Axis Bank board to review the extension, citing poor performance and worsening asset quality at the bank. 
It wasn’t a smooth beginning at Axis Bank for Sharma, with her predecessor P.J. Nayak having quit before the end of his tenure, opposing her appointment. This meant Sharma received no hand-holding in her new role.
Sharma made her big move a year later, when the bank announced the acquisition of investment banking firm Enam Securities Pvt. Ltd in November 2010. The deal valuation came under criticism.
In April 2012, the deal size was cut by almost one-third to Rs1,396 crore from Rs2,070 crore. Eventually, the deal paid off as Axis Capital, which was carved out of Enam business, grew to feature in league tables.
Meanwhile, getting more retail business became a priority, even as the bank continued to focus on corporate lending. This worked, as the share of retail loans in Axis Bank’s total book rose to 46% at the end of December 2017 from 21% in June 2009, the quarter when Sharma took over. 
The story is same on the liability side as Axis Bank is now recognized as a lender with a strong franchise of low-cost current and savings account deposits. 
Profits also rose steadily in the period.
On the corporate side, infrastructure lending also continued, given the opportunities it provided for most banks including Axis Bank.
Meanwhile, asset quality trends remained healthy. 
However, analysts had expressed concern despite Axis Bank’s seemingly healthy asset quality with gross bad loan ratio below 2% and net NPA below 1%. That’s because its peers with similar infrastructure focus were reporting higher bad loan ratios and Axis Bank’s numbers were divergent from the broad sectoral trend. 
Things were fine until late 2015, when RBI announced an asset quality review (AQR). In the quarters that followed, Axis Bank turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR. Gross NPA ratio, which ranged between 0.94-1.68% between June 2009 and March 2016, jumped to over 2% for the first time since Sharma took over.
In the quarters that followed, Axis Bank turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR. Gross NPA ratio, which ranged between 0.94-1.68% between June 2009 and March 2016, jumped to over 2% for the first time since Sharma took over. 
It rose further to reach 5.28% by end of 2017. During her tenure, gross bad loans of Axis Bank have ballooned from Rs915 crore to Rs25,000 crore.
According to analysts, the stock of bad loans remained elevated because of divergence in reporting of NPAs by the bank and those assessed by the RBI.
In April 2017, RBI told banks to make a disclosure in their financial statements if the divergence between the bank’s and the RBI’s estimates exceeded 15%.
Axis Bank, along with other leading banks, disclosed such divergences.
For fiscal 2016, RBI’s classification of Axis Bank’s bad loans was 156% more, or Rs9,478 crore, more than the bank’s own classification. Such divergence was at Rs5,632 crore for the March 2017 fiscal. 
On 27 February, 2018 the RBI fined Axis Bank Rs3 crore for failing to follow its rules on classification of loans.
Apart from asset quality issues, Sharma had other crises to handle. During late 2016, when the government invalidated over 86% of the total currency in circulation, some staff of the bank came under investigation for alleged involvement in money laundering.
Last December, market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) ordered Axis Bank to conduct an internal inquiry into a suspected leak of its June quarter financial results—they had found their way to WhatsApp groups a day after the results were finalized.
“It prima facie appears that the financial results of Axis Bank for quarter ended June 2017 were finalized by July 24, 2017, which was before circulation of the WhatsApp message on July 25, 2017,"" according to the Sebi order.
Between these two crises, Sharma announced her second acquisition in July 2017, this time in the digital fintech space.
On 27 July, Sharma announced Axis Bank’s acquisition of Snapdeal-owned mobile wallet FreeCharge in a Rs385 crore all-cash deal, strengthening its position in the payments space.
On the same day, the board gave her an extension as CEO for another three years starting June 2018, putting at rest speculation that she was leaving the bank. 
That reappointment now seems to have drawn the regulator’s attention, according to reports.
On Monday, stock exchanges sought reply from Axis Bank on the ET story.
In its reply to exchanges, Axis Bank said, “In this connection, we wish to inform you that the bank’s board follows a standard process with regard to senior appointments, and forwards its recommendations to the regulator (to the extent required). This process is currently in progress. We have no further comments to offer as the report appearing in the media is speculative."""
226,2018-04-06,Axis Bank,"RBI delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks  HDFC, ICICI and Axis Bankas it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders' performance issues

Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter. 
Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter.
Chief executive officers at HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. —the nation’s largest private lenders by assets — are among bankers yet to receive bonuses for the financial year ended 31 March 2017, as the Reserve Bank of India hasn’t signed off on the proposed payments, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. They declined to give further details. Business Standard newspaper had previously reported the delays.
ICICI’s board had approved a bonus of Rs2.2 crore ($340,000) for CEO Chanda Kochhar while Axis Bank’s Shikha Sharma was set to receive Rs1.35 crore and HDFC Bank’s Aditya Puri about Rs2.9 crore, exchange filings show. A spokesman for Axis Bank declined to comment. Spokesmen for HDFC Bank and ICICI didn’t reply to emails and phone calls. An email to the RBI wasn’t immediately answered.
Long considered healthier than their government-run peers, India’s private banks have had a tough time over the past year, plagued by revelations of hidden bad loans and alleged lapses in corporate governance. Rising defaults have enraged the public, piling pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act against the perpetrators and reinforce his anti-graft image before elections next year.
Going by historical evidence, the RBI should have approved the bonuses well before 31 March 2018, said Asutosh Kumar Mishra, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. “We have never noticed such delay in approving the payouts, but then we haven’t seen a year in which so many skeletons were brought out of the closet — from under-reporting of bad loans to serious governance issues.""
In the year ended March 2017 — for which the bonuses are under contention — an RBI audit showed Axis hadn’t disclosed bad loans worth about Rs5,600 crore. HDFC Bank also reported a divergence and ICICI said it isn’t required to make disclosures on the topic even as provisions for bad loans climbed.
Axis Bank shares rose about 10% and ICICI 17% in Mumbai trading during the year ended March 2017, while the 10-member Bankex Index added 33%. HDFC Bank shares jumped had 35% during the period.
“Private banks will likely report sharp rise in slippages, led by ICICI Bank and Axis Bank,"" said analysts led by M.B. Mahesh at Kotak Institutional Equities, referring to higher delinquent loans. They predict January-March 2018 results would confirm a quarter of “pain"" for Indian lenders. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Shikha Sharma will leave on 31 December, India’s third largest private bank said, after its board granted her request to cut short her latest term of three years that begins on 1 June. 
Mumbai: Axis Bank managing director and chief executive officer Shikha Sharma will leave on 31 December, India’s third largest private bank said, after its board granted her request to cut short her latest term of three years that begins on 1 June.
Sharma’s fourth term as MD and CEO, which was granted last year, was originally set to end in June 2021.
“In this connection, kindly note that Smt. Shikha Sharma, managing director and CEO of the bank, has requested the board to reconsider the period of her reappointment as the managing director and CEO of the bank to be revised from 1st June 2018 up to 31st December 2018,"" Axis Bank said in a stock exchange notice. 
Currently in her third three-year term, Sharma joined Axis Bank as MD and CEO in June 2009, after spending nearly three decades at ICICI Group across its bank, investment banking and insurance arms. Last year, Axis Bank hired executive recruitment firm Egon Zehnder to find its next CEO, which conducted a preliminary search before the board decided to reappoint Sharma. On 8 December, the board gave her an extension as CEO for another three years starting June 2018.
On 1 April, The Economic Times reported that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had asked Axis Bank to review the reappointment. In a stock exchange notice, the bank had said its board followed a standard process for senior appointments, and forwarded its recommendations to the regulator and that the process was in progress. 
“As Axis Bank goes for a change in leadership, there are grounds to rebuild credibility and regain currency with regulators and other stakeholders, which augurs well for the bank. So, it’s now possible to place this headwind behind and focus purely on fundamentals. There will also be earnings catalysts for the bank starting the first quarter of FY19, as the resolution of big-ticket NCLT cases begin kicking in,"" said A.S.V. Krishnan, vice-president, SBICap Securities.
Sharma’s request to end her tenure early comes at a time her bank has posted a sharp rise in bad loans.
Analysts say the central bank’s asset quality review (AQR) in late 2015 led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders including Axis Bank. In the quarters that followed, it turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR. The gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio, which was 0.94-1.68% between June 2009 and March 2016, jumped to cross 2% for the first time since Sharma took over.
It rose further to reach 5.28% by the end of 2017. During her tenure, Axis Bank’s gross bad loans have ballooned from Rs915 crore to Rs25,000 crore. 
The stock of Axis Bank’s NPAs remained elevated, as bad loans assessed by RBI differed from those reported by the bank. In April 2017, RBI told banks to make a disclosure in their financial statements if the divergence between the bank’s and the RBI’s estimates exceeded 15%. Axis Bank, along with other leading banks, disclosed such divergences for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 earnings.
Sharma is credited with turning Axis Bank from a predominantly corporate lender by expanding its retail base. The share of retail loans in Axis Bank’s total book rose to 46% at the end of December 2017 from 21% in June 2009, the quarter when Sharma took over. 
On Monday, shares of Axis Bank Ltd rose 3.44%, or Rs17.20, to Rs517.90 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.48%, or 161.57 points, to end the day at 33,788.54."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to take over servicing of all debt liabilities of the Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RInfra) unit, Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. (DAMEPL), in connection with the construction, operation and maintenance of the Airport Metro Express Line project, amounting to Rs1,618 crore. 
New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to take over servicing of all debt liabilities of the Reliance Infrastructure Limited (RInfra) unit, Delhi Airport Metro Express Pvt. Ltd. (DAMEPL), in connection with the construction, operation and maintenance of the Airport Metro Express Line project, amounting to Rs1,618 crore.
The court further directed Axis bank, one of the eleven project lenders to provide DMRC with the “exact figure of dues"" payable by DAMEPL to the lenders. 
A bench comprising Sanjiv Khanna and Chander Shekhar passed the interim order while hearing DMRC’s appeal against a 6 March order of a single judge bench of the high court which had upheld a May 2017 arbitral award against DMRC, directing it to pay Rs2,950 crore as compensation, along with interest to the RInfra unit. 
The bench clarified that the interim order was subject to the final outcome of the appeal and DMRC would be liable to pay the interest on the amount due to project lenders, in case the appeal did not succeed. 
While upholding the arbitral award, the single judge bench had asked DMRC to deposit 75% of the amount awarded under the arbitral award “directly"" with project lenders—in the escrow account maintained with them in four weeks.
DMRC and DAMEPL had entered into an agreement for construction, operation and maintenance of a high speed metro rail line that intended to operate between New Delhi Metro and Dwarka Sector 21 via IGI Airport Terminal-3, over a stretch of 23km, known as the Airport Metro Express Line project. 
The agreement was, however, terminated by DAMEPL after DMRC failed to rectify certain defects in the civil structure of the project, which “severely impaired the performance of the obligations of DAMEPL under the Concession Agreement."" Subsequently, DAMEPL invoked the arbitration clause in the agreement for compensation which was granted in May 2017.
The matter would be next heard by the division bench in July on a day-to-day basis. 
Meanwhile, DAMEPL’s plea for execution of the arbitral award was put on hold by the high court till the pendency of the appeal before the division bench.

Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months. 
Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months.
Sharma, who joined Axis Bank in 2009, will now step down on 31 December. Her fourth term as managing director and chief executive was originally set to end in June 2021.
“Our assessment suggests that Axis Bank will have to look for an external CEO. We believe this presents a great opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire one of the largest liability/retail asset franchises,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Shares of Axis Bank touched a 16-month high of Rs627.50 on 23 January, but have eroded 13% since then.
In an interview to Bloomberg in November, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak had said the bank was open to acquisitions.
“We are pretty open to acquisitions as long as they make strategic sense, are value-accretive and are a good cultural fit,"" Kotak said.
According to Nomura, at current prices, the deal would be more than 40% accretive to the EPS/BPS (earnings per share/book value per share) of Kotak Bank.
“This should make it possible for Kotak Bank to offer some premium to Axis Bank shareholders to make the deal attractive to Axis Bank minority shareholders,"" Nomura analysts said, adding that the deal would be more than 25% accretive for Kotak Bank even after paying a 10-30% premium for Axis Bank.
A Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson said the bank does not comment on rumours and speculation. An Axis Bank spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said it continues to prefer Axis Bank to ICICI Bank Ltd.
“We recommend a positive outlook for the stock. The stock has corrected 11% in the last three months vs ~3% correction for the broader market index,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note on Monday.
“We believe this captures a fair amount of bad news in the Mar ’18 quarter. If indeed the bank undertakes a clean-up exercise, we believe the H2FY19 outlook and beyond should improve dramatically,"" Jefferies added.
Larger rival ICICI Bank also saw its shares rise 3% on Tuesday, taking respite from rating agency Fitch Ratings’ comments on Monday that the bank’s rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalization and profitability, and its core capitalisation would remain strong even if the Videocon loan in question were completely written off. 
The ratings agency, however, said the allegations did pose “reputational risks"" to the bank. 
The allegation relates to a loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the husband of ICICI Bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing."

Mumbai: There is concern over the governance premium in India in the wake of developments at private sector banks Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, M. Damodaran, a former chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said in an interview to CNBC TV 18 on Tuesday. 
Mumbai: There is concern over the governance premium in India in the wake of developments at private sector banks Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, M. Damodaran, a former chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said in an interview to CNBC TV 18 on Tuesday.
According to Damodaran, there are far too many things at ICICI Bank that are “uncomfortable"" and it is suffering from a huge reputation risk. “It is disquieting to use a very-very mild word and board should have appointed an independent inquiry authority, not do its own inquiry because there are stakeholders, there is reputation management. This can be done only by conducting an impartial inquiry, and that is what everyone does whether in India or outside,"" Damodaran said in the interview.
“The mitigation for reputational risk resides at the level of the board and nowhere else,"" he added.
News reports have raised questions about ICICI Bank sanctioning loans to Videocon because its chairman Venugopal Dhoot allegedly had dealings with NuPower, founded by Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar. Mint could not independently ascertain the veracity of these allegations.
According to the former bureaucrat, ICICI Bank being a systemically important bank, stakeholders have reasonably higher expectations from it. 
“What the board has done is to put it in telegraphic form, they seem to have jumped the gun,"" Damodaran said.
Typically, when someone joins a firm at a senior management post he/she is required to give a list of firms one is associated with to the board companies you are associated with, Damodaran said. 
“If a firm was set up subsequently, you are becoming a director of board. The minute it was set up and you perceive there was a conflict, which clearly there was, you were obliged to bring it to the notice of the board,"" he said. 
On Axis, where its chief executive and managing director Shikha Sharma decided to reduce her tenure on Monday and will now step down on 31 December, Damodaran said the board should have approached succession planning better. Sharma’s term was slated to end in June 2021.
If there were valid reasons to look at a fourth term of three years and the board decided collectively, when the regulator denied it there should have been a reason on why the board thinks Sharma should continue, said Damodaran. 
“The way the decision is taken is that when the term is about to expire, you ask yourself two questions. Who is best to lead the bank in next three-five years? You don’t ask the question, should we give her another extension? That is not the way to approach succession issue,"" said Damodaran."

217,2018-04-11,Axis Bank,"Most actors in the Axis Bank drama do not come out smelling of roses. We will be fooling ourselves in thinking that Shikha Sharma's resignation makes everything right

In October 2017, under fire from investors for the large divergence between its own bad loan count and that of its regulator, Axis Bank Ltd’s chief executive officer (CEO) Shikha Sharma told The Economic Times, “We are obedient children. They (RBI) told us do it (make additional provisions). We did it."" 
In October 2017, under fire from investors for the large divergence between its own bad loan count and that of its regulator, Axis Bank Ltd’s chief executive officer (CEO) Shikha Sharma told The Economic Times, “We are obedient children. They (RBI) told us do it (make additional provisions). We did it.""
Ironically, less than six months later, the central bank has expressed its displeasure with the lender’s decision to continue with Sharma as CEO, according to reports. And like obedient children, Sharma and the bank’s board have fallen in line.
If the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to step in and guide a bank on its accounting policies and key appointments, it gives rise to the suspicion that things at the bank are not what they seem. To start with, these events call to question the role of the bank’s board.
“Members of Axis Bank’s nomination and remuneration committee need to be really thick skinned to take the insult from RBI lying down. They should justify their stance or resign,"" an executive at a foreign institutional investor said, requesting anonymity. The reference is to Sharma’s appointment, which was approved by the board less than a year ago.
Are we are making a mountain out of a molehill? That’s really a question for the central bank to answer. It may be feeling smug after delaying a hefty bonus Axis Bank had approved for Sharma last year, and now playing a role in her ouster; but it will be irresponsible on its part to not articulate what drove its decision. Surely, if RBI has serious concerns about the running of the bank, it can’t be content with just the resignation of its CEO. And if it doesn’t have serious enough concerns, then Sharma may well be justified in thinking she’s being made a scapegoat.
But that’s unlikely. Soon after Axis Bank announced Sharma’s decision to cut short her tenure, its shares rose by 5.5%. Investors were evidently relieved by the decision. 
“We hope the new person is an outsider, allowing fresh thoughts and strategy, and rebuild credibility with investors. Across our investor meetings in the past few years, the one thing that was common was that a large percentage of investors were a little hesitant to be optimistic on Axis Bank—the inherent fear being that NPL (non-performing loan) ratios could increase sharply,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients on Tuesday.
Indeed, it’s troubling that through the upheaval at Axis Bank in the past year, investors were more or less mute spectators. They have no one else to blame but themselves for tolerating the underperformance at Axis Bank. It’s easy to blame the board, but investors need to take equal blame for not engaging enough with independent directors. As the chart above shows, shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, which is rumoured to be in merger talks with Axis Bank, have risen sharply in the past year. In the event of a merger, Axis Bank shareholders will now have to settle for a much lower swap ratio compared to, say, a year ago.
In short, none of the actors in the Axis Bank drama come out smelling of roses. We will be fooling ourselves in thinking that a resignation by the CEO makes everything right."

Axis Bank Ltd’s board mustn’t feel even the slightest embarrassment for being so wrong for so long. In fact, it deserves a vote of thanks for helping to create possibly the biggest and juiciest takeover target in the history of Indian banking.
Rewind to last July. The Indian lender’s board had just rewarded CEO Shikha Sharma with a fourth term—until June 2021—even though she still had almost a year to run on her existing tenure. That was when the bank was busy telling the world that its stinking pile of corporate bad loans was yesterday’s news, and that things were so under control management might even consider paring its guidance of 1.75% to 2.25% in full-year credit costs.
However, by October it was clear the central bank had a very different view of the non-state-owned lender’s asset quality.
After the regulator forced it to downgrade nine large corporate accounts to non-performing from standard assets, Axis closed its books in March with credit expenses as high as 2.82%, the most in at least 14 years.

If that slippage wasn’t enough to fill the board with buyer’s remorse, news this month that the Reserve Bank of India has asked it to reconsider Sharma’s reappointment was a plateful of eggs hurled straight at its face. Ultimately, though, Sharma gave the board an out when she said she wanted to leave by June. That sent shares in Axis up 5.2% Tuesday.
The board, which should have spent at least the past year looking for new leadership, now wants permission to cling on to Sharma until December; apparently it can’t find a replacement by end of May.
Shareholders won’t care two hoots if the RBI accepts its plea. As far as they’re concerned, it’s time to look beyond the current boss, or for that matter, the current board.
Axis, in which Bain Capital LP made a smart investment in November, is now a “special situation."" Nomura Holdings Inc. published a research note Tuesday saying billionaire Uday Kotak’s Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd is best placed to acquire the seventh-largest Indian lender by assets.
The reason Axis trades at a price-to-book ratio of 2.3 times, compared with a multiple of 4 for Kotak Mahindra, is partly because Sharma’s push into corporate lending bulked up the balance sheet, but that also weakened it from within. By not acting quickly enough to rectify the situation, the men and women on Axis’s board have done their bit.
It would be fairly easy for a new owner to turn Axis around once operational breaches—like quarterly results getting leaked on WhatsApp message groups—get fixed.
But for their role in helping to create a reasonably large (total assets of $94 billion), but relatively cheap lender, the current set of directors at least deserve a thank-you note. From Bain, and—should he succeed in buying it—Uday Kotak, too. Bloomberg Gadfly"

Mumbai: S&P Global Ratings on Thursday said Indian banks need to improve their risk management, and maintain strong governance processes, practices, and systems. 
The commentary comes at a time when two of India’s leading private sector lenders, ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd, are in the spotlight for over the role of their leaders—Chanda Kochhar and Shikha Sharma, respectively.
“As a number of banks in India confront serious governance and risk issues, the ‘tone at the top’ is crucial. Leadership groups in Indian banks need to ensure that they enhance the risk culture, reputation, and financial strength of banks,"" S&P credit analyst Michael Puli said in a note.
S&P said that while rating banks, management's ability and expertise to grow the business sustainably is assessed. “We view governance and transparency in Indian banking as a negative factor. This is similar to many other emerging markets."" 
At Axis Bank, the board has accepted current CEO Sharma’s request to cut short her fourth term of three years that begins on 1 June to seven months. On 2 April, The Economic Times reported that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has written to the Axis Bank board to review the extension, citing poor performance and worsening asset quality at the bank. 
S&P said that in its view smooth transition and continuity in management will be important for the bank. 
The rating agency noted efforts made by Axis Bank to resolve asset quality issues, improve provisioning levels, and restructuring of its operating controls to make it central point rather than the relevant business heads. 
“On 21 December 2017, we revised down our assessment of Axis Bank's stand-alone creditworthiness to reflect higher risks associated with asset quality and under-reporting of non-performing loans. While the effect of our assessment is the same as ICICI Bank, we assess Axis's risk management as weaker than that of private sector peer HDFC Bank Ltd,"" the rating agency said. 
At ICICI Bank, CEO Kochhar faces allegations of conflict of interest over grant of loans to a corporate group. On ICICI, S&P said that while the bank’s board has offered full support to the leadership team, in case the allegations against the management prove to be true, they could hit the bank's reputation and expose it to legal and financial risk."

To say that India’s public sector banks have had a rough run in the past two years would be an understatement. A ballooning pile of bad loans, precarious capital positions and massive frauds are but only a slice of their problems. Little wonder that there has been a cacophony of voices clamouring for privatization of the state-run banks. 
To say that India’s public sector banks have had a rough run in the past two years would be an understatement. A ballooning pile of bad loans, precarious capital positions and massive frauds are but only a slice of their problems. Little wonder that there has been a cacophony of voices clamouring for privatization of the state-run banks.
But in the past two weeks, an unprecedented set of events has turned that argument on its head. The developments have highlighted issues related to corporate governance at ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s second largest private bank, and performance issues at Axis Bank Ltd, the country’s third largest, exposing, as some say, the darker underbelly of the private banking business in India.
ALSO READ: Salaries of private bank CEOs rise despite surge in NPAs
For Axis Bank’s managing director Shikha Sharma, matters came to a head when the banking regulator, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), asked the lender’s board to re-consider the decision to give Shikha Sharma a fourth term, citing concerns over rising NPAs under her watch.
Sharma has since sought an early termination of her fourth tenure that starts on 1 June. The request, which Axis Bank’s board has granted, will cut short her fourth three-year term by two-and-a-half years. 
The allegations against Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of ICICI Bank, are of a more serious nature.
These relate to the controversy surrounding loans made by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group, whose controlling shareholders have business links with Chanda Kochhar’s husband. Later, allegations also surfaced that Kochhar’s brother-in-law was involved in restructuring foreign currency debt given by this bank.
ALSO READ: Chanda Kochhar, family had links with Videocon group since at least 2001
The ICICI Bank board headed by chairman M.K. Sharma has so far backed its CEO, expressing full faith and confidence in her and denying any quid pro quo, nepotism or conflict of interest in her dealings as head of the bank. The board also reviewed the bank’s internal processes for credit approval and found them robust. N. Vaghul, a former chairman of the group, has also backed Kochhar, although he has said an independent enquiry to clear her name could have been undertaken. That enquiry has so far not been announced.
“I am puzzled by the board’s reluctance to order an independent enquiry into the matter without the managing director’s presence. Perhaps, long tenure distorts the balance of power between outside directors and the management in favour of the management,"" said R. Narayanaswamy, professor of finance and control at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore.
ALSO READ: Embattled ICICI Bank board plans investor outreach
To compound Kochhar’s problems, federal agency Central Bureau of Investigation has started a preliminary enquiry into the alleged nexus between Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot and Kochhar’s husband, Deepak.
To be sure, some have alleged that the raising of the issue of the loan to Videocon group now points to a concerted campaign against Chanda Kochhar.
The issue was first brought to the board’s notice in 2016 and all the regulators had prior information about it, ICICI Bank chairman Sharma said.
“I don’t know if it is about diverting attention from other things such as Nirav Modi and Gitanjali Gems issues. All the regulators had this information in 2016. I do not see any reason for having a fresh look again and revive interest in the issue,"" he said in an interview to Mint.
Videocon loan case: Can Chanda Kochhar see off her biggest crisis yet?
While the developments have rightly shone the light on the nation’s private banks, it has given some respite to the beleaguered state-run banks, at least from the daily headline cycle. The focus on Kochhar has relegated developments about the $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank and the alleged mastermind, fugitive billionaire Nirav Modi, off the front pages of newspapers for a while. Modi and his jeweller uncle, Mehul Choksi, the controlling shareholder of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, allegedly in collusion with bank officials, obtained buyer’s credit for cheaper foreign-currency loans, without posting any collateral. When the loans matured, they took out even bigger ones to pay them off, somewhat like a Ponzi scheme. Investigating agencies say Modi is in Hong Kong while Choksi is in the US. The nephew-uncle duo left the country before the fraud was uncovered.
ALSO READ: How Nirav Modi pulled off the great Indian bank robbery
The controversy surrounding Kochhar has already led to problems for the bank. The initial public offering (IPO) of ICICI Securities Ltd, the investment banking unit of the lender, received a poor response from investors in the wake of the corporate governance issues. The weak response forced the company to cut its IPO size to Rs3,500 crore from Rs4,017-crore.
Large shareholders of ICICI Bank are already seeking answers from the lender’s board about the alleged governance failures and the steps the lender is taking to address them. In the coming days, this will determine the fate of Kochhar.  “We have had some meetings with the bank on concerns, whether there was any conflict of interest in granting these loans, whether the board was aware of these conflicts, and if they were, what (then) did the board do. We have also raised concerns on the possibility that the current CEO may step down. So far, the bank has assured us there was no conflict of interest and the CEO has the backing of the board,"" a fund manager told Mint on condition of anonymity.

212,2018-04-14,Axis Bank,"BJP's income was twice that of all other national parties combined, Delhi airport is the 16th busiest in the world, Volkswagen gets a new CEO and Axis Bank is also due for one

1. BJP income jumps 81% in 2016-17 to Rs1,034 crore 
1. BJP income jumps 81% in 2016-17 to Rs1,034 crore
The total income of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2016-17 was nearly twice that of all the other national parties put together. Between 2015-16 and 2016-17, the BJP registered an increase in income of nearly 81% to Rs1,034 crore. By comparison, the income of the Congress in 2016-17 declined 14%. With Rs225 crore, its income in 2016-17 was about one-fourth that of the BJP. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) registered a spike in income, from Rs47.4 crore to Rs173.6 crore.
2. Delhi airport among world’s 20 busiest airports
Passenger traffic at the world’s 20 busiest airports increased by 5.2% last year. With 1.5 billion passengers that enplaned and deplaned at these airports, they accounted for 17% of global passenger traffic. While Atlanta, Beijing and Dubai led the list, New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport appeared in this list for the first time. It handled 63.5 million passengers in 2017, a year-on-year growth of 14.1, which was the highest in this set; the next best was Guangzhou (10.3%).
3. Shikha Sharma cuts short Axis Bank tenure
Axis Bank managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Shikha Sharma has cut short her tenure and will leave the bank on 31 December. Her fourth term, granted for three years, was to begin in June 2018 and end in June 2021. Sharma joined Axis Bank as MD and CEO in June 2009. Her decision comes in the backdrop of an increase in Axis Bank’s bad loans since late-2015. Earlier this year, the board of Axis Bank had cleared a three-year term for Sharma, which the central bank reportedly asked it to reconsider. Under Sharma, the bank’s stock has delivered nearly five-fold returns in nine years.
4. Volkswagen appoints new CEO with revamp in mind
Volkswagen has replaced Matthias Mueller with brand chief Herbert Diess. Mueller was appointed chief executive in September 2015, after the company admitted to tampering with its engines for better emission readings. It resulted in the company paying $30 billion in fines and seeing its share price move in a band. The new appointment, in a sense, turns that page, and shifts the company’s focus from protecting reputation to reorganizing business.
5. Real Madrid, Roma in Champions League semis
The semi-final lineup for the Champions League was decided last week via intriguing storylines In three of the four quarterfinal ties, teams had to overcome a large first-leg deficit to advance. One did (Roma over Barcelona), one almost did (Juventus over Real Madrid) and one promised to do so but imploded (Manchester City over Liverpool). This will be the 13th semi-final appearance for Real Madrid since 1993, when the tournament format changed, tenth for Bayern, fourth for Liverpool and first for Roma.
6. Leander Paes leads all in Davis Cup doubles
Leander Paes won his 43rd doubles match in Davis Cup, as India came back from 0-2 down to beat China 3-2 to be one step away from the world group. With this win, the 44-year-old who played his first Davis Cup doubles match 28 years ago stands alone on the doubles perch. Paes reached this landmark in his 56th tie. Of his 43 wins, 25 came with Mahesh Bhupathi, the current Indian team captain with whom he has shared a relationship of animosity for some years now. The next best in Davis Cup doubles wins is Nicola Pietrangeli of Italy, who took 66 ties to win 42 doubles matches.
7. India to grow faster in 2018 and 2019
The Asian Development Bank (ADB), in its latest report, has projected for the Indian economy a growth rate of 7.3% in 2017-18 and 7.6% in 2018-19. Such growth rates should enable India to retain its tag of being the fastest-growing Asian economy. The ADB projected inflation to average 4.6% in 2017-18 and rise to 5% in 2018-19 due to higher global oil prices, food procurement prices and rural wages.
8. Online hiring activities steady in March
According to the Monster Employment Index, online hiring activities in March registered a year-on-year increase of 12%, but a marginal dip of 0.3% on a month-on-month basis. The Monster Employment Index stood at 292 for March 2018, compared to 293 in February 2018 and 261 in March 2017. The report said the government’s economic reforms have begun to have a positive impact on the economy, and that online hiring activities around key sectors such as production and manufacturing can be possibly attributed to it.
9. India’s industrial output slows to 7.1% in February
The country’s factory output, as measured by the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), grew 7.1% in February. Although it was slower than the 7.5% in January, February marked the fourth consecutive month of IIP growth staying above 7%, indicating that industrial recovery may be on track. The lower growth in February 2018 was mainly due to a decline in mining activity, while growth in other sectors was several times that in February 2017.
10. 13% of Karnataka electorate is below 25 years
There are 6.5 million young voters—those between the age of 18 and 25 years—in Karnataka. Thus, they account for 13% of the electorate in the state, shows a fact sheet on the Karnataka assembly released by the Press Information Bureau. In all, there are 49.6 million people in the state who are eligible to vote, and 38% of them are in the age bracket of 25 to 40 years.

211,2018-04-16,Axis Bank,"The latest developments at ICICI Bank and Axis Bank warrants a look at what the Banking Regulation Act has to say about corporate governance at banks

The latest developments at two large private banks in India spotlight the role of the board of banks, the chief executive officer (CEO), corporate governance and the so-called conflict of interest. 
The latest developments at two large private banks in India spotlight the role of the board of banks, the chief executive officer (CEO), corporate governance and the so-called conflict of interest.
Eliminating conflict of interest is at the heart of provisions in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which governs the banking companies in India. Bimal Jalan was the first Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor to make a formal policy announcement on corporate governance in the mid-term review of the monetary and credit policy on 21 October 2001. A consultative group was set up the following month under the chairmanship of A.S. Ganguly, an industry expert and former chairman of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. Before that, in March 2001, an advisory group on corporate governance, headed by R.H. Patil—founder of NSE Ltd—had examined the relevant issues in the Indian banking industry and made recommendations to raise the governance standards. Yet another advisory group on banking supervision, chaired by former chairman of State Bank of India M.S. Verma, submitted its report in January 2003.
The mid-term review of the monetary and credit policy in November 2003 introduced the concept of “fit and proper"" criteria for directors of banks, following the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee. The exercise dealt with the process of collecting information, doing due diligence and the constitution of a nomination committee of the board to scrutinize the declarations made by the bank directors.
An RBI circular, dated 24 June 2004, lays down norms for selection of directors on boards of private banks, based on their qualification, expertise, track record and integrity. At least 51% of the directors need to have special knowledge or practical experience in areas such as accountancy, agriculture and rural economy, banking, cooperation, economics, finance, law and small-scale industry. This requirement arises out of Section 10A(2)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act.
Where the buck stops
Indeed, the board plays a critical role in running a bank, but the buck stops at the managing director and CEO. Section 10B of the Banking Regulation Act makes it abundantly clear that the management of the affairs of a private bank is “entrusted"" to a managing director, who exercises his powers, “subject to the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors"".
For governance, the various committees of a bank board oversee different aspects of business, but I am not sure whether each of them is as effective as they are meant to be. For instance, the credit committee of a large private bank at this point has three members—its chairman, who is a legal expert; its managing director and CEO; and another independent director, who is a public policy specialist with expertise in water management. Apart from the managing director and CEO of the bank, do the other people have expertise to clear high-value loans? Are they there to challenge and question the decisions of the managing director and CEO, or endorse them? How many credit proposals get rejected by such a panel?
Section 36ACA of the Banking Regulation Act empowers RBI to supersede the board of directors of banks—“in public interest or for preventing the affairs of any banking company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors""—but for a period not exceeding six months. The supersession of the board can be extended but not beyond 12 months. During this period, an administrator with experience in law, finance, banking, economics or accountancy needs to be appointed, but the person cannot be an officer of the central or any state government. RBI can constitute a committee of at least three people to help the administrator run the bank.
The punishment
Under Section 46 of the Act, if any bank official furnishes a false statement or suppresses facts in “any return, balance-sheet or other document"", the punishment can be imprisonment up to three years or a penalty of Rs1 crore or both. Depending on the nature of the offence, the penalty varies, and there is a provision of imposing a fine of Rs50,000 for every day during which the offence/default continues.
In all these cases, there is a legal process involved; but for certain offences, the courts have no role to play. Section 47A of the Act which defines RBI’s power to impose penalty says the central bank needs to issue a show cause notice to a bank before imposing penalty for certain offences and must offer a “reasonable opportunity of being heard"" and “no complaint can be filed against any bank in any court of law in respect of any contravention or default in respect of which any penalty has been imposed"". A bank needs to pay the penalty within two weeks of receiving the RBI notice.
CEO’s appointment
Under the Banking Regulation Act, RBI’s “prior"" approval is a must for appointment and reappointment of the CEO; the central bank could seek the CEO’s removal also. . Apart from solvency, it does not specify what qualities a CEO should possess, but points out what the person should not. An individual being appointed as CEO should be solvent, should not have suspended payment to creditors or settled for payment of a lesser amount and must not be convicted by a criminal court of an offence involving moral turpitude.
In the application form for RBI approval of a CEO’s appointment/reappointment, a private bank needs to explain whether the person to be appointed as CEO is subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in Section 10B(4) of the Banking Regulation Act.
This particular section deals with the “substantial interest"" that a prospective CEO should not have in any other company or a partnership firm.
What is substantial interest? It is “direct"" or “beneficial interest"" held by the individual or spouse of such an individual, or minor child of such an individual, whether singly or taken together, in the shares of a company which exceeds Rs5 lakh or 10% of the paid up capital of the company—whichever is less. “Substantial interest"" in partnership firms does not specify any value, but says the holding should not be more than 10% of the total capital subscribed by all the partners.
Who is a relative?
Against the backdrop of recent developments, at the centre stage is the definition of “relative"". Going by the provision of the Companies Act, 1956, a person is a relative of another if they are members of a Hindu undivided family—or, they are husband and wife.
Besides, Schedule 1A of the Act lists 22 relations. They are: father, mother (including step mother), son (step son), son’s wife, daughter (step daughter), father’s father, father’s mother, mother’s father, mother’s mother, son’s son, son’s wife’s son, son’s daughter, son’s daughter’s husband, daughter’s husband, daughter’s son, daughter’s son’s wife, daughter’s daughter, daughter’s daughter’s husband, bothers (step brothers), brother’s wife, sister (step sister) and sister’s husband.
Companies Act, 2013, which replaced the old Act, compressed the list; now, only eight relations feature there. They are: father (including step father), mother (step mother), son, son’s wife, daughter, daughter’s husband, brother (step brother) and sister (step sister).
The new Act got the assent of the President of India on 29 August 2013 and was notified on 30 August. Various provisions of the Act were enforced on different dates. The definition of relative was enforced on 12 September 2013. This means, till then, the old definition as outlined in the earlier Act continued.
Section 184(1) of the new Companies Act says every director at the first meeting of the board in which he participates and, subsequently, at the first board meeting in every financial year, or whenever there is any change in the disclosures already made and at the first board meeting held after such change, should disclose his interest in any company. If a director violates this provision, the punishment is imprisonment for up to one year or Rs50,000-Rs1 lakh penalty or both.
Also, the rules that define the meetings of a board and its powers dictate that the companies that are required to set up an audit committee (banks fall in this category) must ensure that if any of the members of the committee has a conflict of interest in a given case, the person should recuse himself from attending the relevant meeting. Also, every director must disclose interest in any company by giving a notice.
Finally, even where the director himself has no personal interest in any contract or arrangement but any of his relatives has, the director is deemed to be indirectly interested.
Anomalies and absurdities
Indeed, all provisions of the law as well as definitions need to be seen in the context of developments; if we take them literally, there will be many anomalies and absurdities. For instance, in 1949, when the Banking Regulation Act was framed, the value of Rs5 lakh was enormous. (I am not sure whether this amount has remained unchanged since inception of the Act)
Over time, many parts of the law have become archaic. Sections 5 and 6 of the Act list the businesses that a bank can undertake but the list does not include many contemporary business opportunities. For instance, insurance, mutual funds, management of pension funds, hire purchase, among many other businesses, do not feature in the list. The banks could get into these after the government allowed them through special notifications.
Still, all of us are curious whether the bank CEOs make all the disclosures they need to do. Most CEOs in private banks have long innings and, often, they are home-bred, rising from the ranks. This means they join the board as a director even before becoming the boss. Do they make the disclosures through their career? After all, perception about governance is as important as governance itself.
There are many ways to restore the perceived erosion of standards about governance in Indian banks—both private and public. One of them could be appointment of governance officers. Their task is very different from that of ethics officers, which some of the Indian companies, including banks, have started appointing. But then, the company secretary of a bank, to a large extent, is the governance officer in a bank. Are they doing their jobs properly?

210,2018-04-18,Axis Bank,"Several other lenders, including PNB, Canara Bank and Axis Bank claimed that cash shortage at ATMs was limited to select pockets

New Delhi: India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said on Wednesday that cash availability at its ATMs has increased in the past 24 hours following reports of currency shortages and ATMs running dry from different parts of the country.  
New Delhi: India’s largest lender State Bank of India (SBI) said on Wednesday that cash availability at its ATMs has increased in the past 24 hours following reports of currency shortages and ATMs running dry from different parts of the country. 
Several other lenders, including PNB, Canara Bank and Axis Bank claimed that cash shortage at ATMs was limited to select pockets. Unusual spurt in demand for currency led to many ATMs and banks running out of cash in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, poll-bound Karnataka and some other states even as the government and the RBI assured the public that there was no currency shortage. 
“Availability of cash in SBI ATM has improved in the last 24 hours. Efforts are being made on a continuous basis to improve the cash availability further in a few geographies. Overall issue of less cash should come to normalcy within soonest possible time, “ said Neeraj Vyas, DMD (Chief Operating Officer), SBI.
In a statement by SBI, he further said that the bank is constantly monitoring the situation and making immense efforts to ensure the supply of currency in abundance at all our ATMs. A SBI spokesperson said that in general, the normalcy rates at the bank’s ATMs remains at 92%. 
“It had dropped to around 85 per cent yesterday. But the situation has improved today."" When asked about its ATMs, private sector Axis Bank said it has enough cash, which is “better than the industry average and there is no such crisis"". 
“Even if there are cases of ATMs running out of money it is because people from other banks are coming to withdraw money,"" a Axis Bank official said. 
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had said last evening that there was no shortage of currency even as it has ramped up printing of notes at all its four presses. The finance ministry too had said printing of  ₹ 500 notes was being increased five-fold. 
When contacted, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India and Canara Bank claimed that shortage of cash at their ATMs was limited to some pockets only and they are dealing with the situation."

Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd has started the process to select a new Managing Director and chief executive as incumbent Shikha Sharma is scheduled to resign from the post in December, the private sector bank said in a regulatory filing on Friday.
Sharma had requested the bank’s board to relieve her by 31 December 2018 after Axis Bank decided to give her a three-year term beginning 1 June 2018.
“This is to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Bank has commenced the succession process to appoint a new managing director and chief executive of the bank,"" Axis Bank said in the regulatory filing.
The bank’s board has appointed Egon Zehnder, a global leadership advisory firm, to conduct the succession process and evaluate candidates for the said post. The bank further said the board will ensure that the process will be completed before the end of Sharma’s tenure and “thus facilitate smooth transition of leadership responsibilities at the bank"".
Axis Bank had in December 2017 said its board decided to reappoint Sharma as the MD and CEO for a period of three years with effect from 1 June 2018, subject to receipt of requisite approvals. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised questions over her reappointment for a fourth term in the wake of mounting non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans at the bank.
Sharma would be completing her third term as Axis Bank’s MD and CEO on 31 May."

Mumbai: Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. and Kotak group company Phoenix ARC Pvt. Ltd are the top contenders to buy Rs4,300 crore of debt of Jhabua Power Ltd (JPL)—a unit of Avantha Power & Infrastructure Ltd—from a group of lenders led by Axis Bank, two people aware of the development said.  
Mumbai: Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. and Kotak group company Phoenix ARC Pvt. Ltd are the top contenders to buy Rs4,300 crore of debt of Jhabua Power Ltd (JPL)—a unit of Avantha Power & Infrastructure Ltd—from a group of lenders led by Axis Bank, two people aware of the development said. 
According to the people cited above, the lenders are yet to decide as both ARCs are seeking up to 50% haircut on the transaction. A third strategic suitor is also in the fray but has not made a formal offer, the people said. 
The development comes following reports that Avantha group, led by industrialist Gautam Thapar, is in talks to sell the unit. 
Business Standard reported in July last year that Avantha group was in talks with Resurgent Power, a joint venture between Tata Power Ltd and ICICI Ventures, the private equity arm of ICICI Bank. In June 2017, Economic Times reported that the group was in talks with Adani Power to sell the unit.
“None of the previous discussions to sell the asset were fruitful, following which the banks have decided to sell the loans,"" said one of the two people. “The urgency to do so is more now because of RBI’s 12 February circular, under which the lenders have to find a solution or refer the case to bankruptcy court,"" the person added. 
The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) revised framework for resolution of stressed assets aim at quick reporting of defaults, coming out with resolution plans for defaulting companies, and time-bound referrals of defaulting firms to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). 
Responding to a query from Mint, an Axis Bank spokesperson said, “As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on client-specific matters."" 
Emails seeking comments to Avantha group, Edelweiss and Phoenix ARC remained unanswered until press time.
JPL is based at Seoni district in Madhya Pradesh and currently has 600MW thermal capacity fully operational and another 660MW under implementation. The plant has long-term power purchase agreements (PPA) for 71% of its total generation, with Madhya Pradesh buying 35% and Kerala buying 36%. It has full fuel linkage with Coal India. 
“If Edelweiss does acquire the debt, then there is a high probability that it will work with the existing promoters to turn assets around instead of taking the asset to NCLT for a change in control,"" said the second person cited above. 
For Edelweiss, this will be the second such transaction in Avantha group if its bid is accepted. In April last year, it acquired a large portion of the debt of BILT Graphic Paper Products Ltd. BILT Graphic is part of Ballarpur Industries Ltd, the flagship firm of the Avantha Group, and is one of India’s largest producers of writing and printing paper. 
The group, burdened with debt, is looking to sell assets to raise cash. In 2014, it sold its Korba power plant to Adani Power for Rs4,200 crore. Another group company, Crompton Greaves Consumer Electricals Ltd, sold a large stake in its consumer electrical business to private equity funds Advent International Corp. and Temasek Holdings for Rs2,000 crore."

How many bankers does it take to change a light bulb? Apparently none at Axis Bank, as the lender faced its darkest hour on asset quality in the March quarter. The stock in all probability will face its own on Friday. 
How many bankers does it take to change a light bulb? Apparently none at Axis Bank, as the lender faced its darkest hour on asset quality in the March quarter. The stock in all probability will face its own on Friday.
The bank reported a massive Rs2,189 crore loss for the fourth quarter of 2017-18, a far cry from Street expectations of a small profit of Rs662.3 crore as shown by a Bloomberg survey. The private lender had to carve out a massive Rs7,179 crore towards bad loan provisioning during the quarter, three times more than in the previous year.
The lender did worse than Street expectations on its bad loan ratios. Its gross bad loans now form 6.77% of its loan book and as the bank stuck to prudence in provisioning, the net bad loan ratio was a less scary 3.4%.
But what will terrorize investors is the Rs16,536 crore of slippages in a single quarter, unheard for the bank. The management put up a brave face and said that the bank has reached the end of the bad loan recognition process. Indeed, at this level of slippages, the recognition had better be over. 
With this slippage wave, the watch-list stands obliterated and on a cumulative basis, Axis Bank has recognized close to Rs28,000 crore worth of bad loans since the Reserve Bank of India mandated banks to do so in 2016. 
What led the debacle on asset quality were loans to power generators and distributors who could no longer pay up. 
More than 40% of the slippages during the quarter are from the power sector.
The bank has learnt its lesson and its growth in the corporate loan book during the quarter came entirely from working capital.
It has moved away from project finance loans that hurt it in every quarter on asset quality. The management vowed to bring down credit costs in FY19 and stressed that incremental bad loans will be far less than what the lender has reported so far. 
The fact that the lender’s profile of corporate borrowers has improved, retail book has grown fast and some encouraging signs on loans referred under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code support the management’s claim of a decent year ahead. 
While investors may have run out of reasons to justify the stock’s valuation, perhaps the leadership change ahead would power up the stock."

Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd rose the most in six months as an unprecedented recognition of bad loans prompted investors to overlook the Indian lender’s first-ever loss. 
Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd rose the most in six months as an unprecedented recognition of bad loans prompted investors to overlook the Indian lender’s first-ever loss.
Provisions climbed to Rs7,180 crore ($1.1 billion) in the three months ended March from Rs2,810 crore the previous quarter as an additional Rs16,500 crore of fresh defaults were identified after the implementation of tighter regulations, the bank said in an exchange filing late Thursday. The Mumbai-based bank reported a loss of Rs2,190 crore, the first in data going back to 2006, and compared with a Rs662 crore profit predicted in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.
With this, the recognition of bad loans in this cycle is “nearly complete,"" said outgoing chief executive officer Shikha Sharma. The lender’s so-called watchlist shrank to 0.1% of its total loan book from 1.3% the previous quarter and 2.5% the previous financial year.
“The worst seems to be over for Axis Bank,"" Gaurang Shah, head investment strategist at Geojit Financial Services Ltd in Mumbai, said by phone. “We expect the lender to step up stressed loan recovery after recognizing the stressed assets this quarter.""
‘Return to normalcy’
Bad-loan formation will be lower in the year through March 2019 and resolutions of stressed accounts should be expected in the first half, analysts at Prabhudas Lilladher, led by R. Sreesankar, wrote in a note. “Margins look bottomed out.""
The Mumbai-based brokerage cut its target price on India’s third-largest private bank to Rs585 from Rs621 with a recommendation to buy the stock. Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd cut its target to Rs560 from Rs591 with a recommendation to accumulate. BOB Capital Markets cut its forecast to Rs595 from Rs660 with a call to add.
Axis’s CEO Sharma will step down at the end of 2018, more than two years before the proposed end of her term, after the regulator reportedly question the lender’s performance.
“Currently, we do not factor any disruptions due to change in management and shall wait for the event to play out,"" Ravikant Bhat, an analyst in Mumbai at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, wrote in a note. Despite the bank’s upfront recognition of stressed assets, “residual pain is still left"" and he expects Axis “to return to earnings normalcy"" in the year ending March 2020.
Axis Bank shares fell as much as 3% early on Friday before rebounding to trade 5% higher at Rs518.55 as of 9:58am in Mumbai. It was the most traded Indian stock by value and volume, and the best performer on the nation’s main equity indexes.

The board also authorised Axis Bank to borrow/ raise funds in Indian currency/foreign currency by issue of debt instruments up to an amount of Rs35,000 crore.
Axis Bank yesterday reported a loss of Rs2,189 crore for the three months to March on an over Rs16,000 crore addition to the bad loan pile, driven majorly by regulatory changes in impaired assets recognition.

206,2018-04-27,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank posted a shock loss of Rs2,189 crore in the January-March quarter, its first quarterly loss ever, as the private sector lender made heavy provisions against bad loans

Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd on Thursday posted a shock loss of Rs2,189 crore in the January-March quarter, its first quarterly loss ever, as the private sector lender made heavy provisions against bad loans. The bank, though, said asset quality is expected to normalize in 2018-19.  
Mumbai: Axis Bank Ltd on Thursday posted a shock loss of Rs2,189 crore in the January-March quarter, its first quarterly loss ever, as the private sector lender made heavy provisions against bad loans. The bank, though, said asset quality is expected to normalize in 2018-19. 
A Bloomberg poll of 15 analysts had expected a net profit of Rs662.30 crore. 
Bad loans ballooned as the bank speeded up recognition of bad assets, as well as due to new central bank rules on handling stressed assets. In a post-earnings call with reporters, Axis Bank chief financial officer Jairam Sridharan said that with this, the current cycle of asset recognition is nearing an end and bad loan formations in fiscal 2019 will be lower than the previous year. The accelerated recognition was particularly stark in the power sector. 
Sridharan also said the new regulatory norms on bad loan resolution drove recognition in the restructured book. 
In the March quarter, Axis Bank added Rs16,536 crore to the bad loan category, sharply higher than Rs4,428 crore added in the December quarter. Accordingly, total gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to Rs34,249 crore at the end of March from Rs25,000 crore three months ago. 
Gross NPAs as a percentage of total advances stood at 6.77% in the March quarter compared with 5.28% in the December quarter and 5.04% in the year-ago March quarter. 
According to the lender, over Rs13,900 crore of slippages came from its corporate loan book, and 90% of these accounts were lower-rated (BB & below). Accordingly, the pool of such loans fell to Rs8,994 crore. 
Separately, stressed accounts under its so-called watch list also fell to Rs428 crore in fourth quarter from Rs5,309 crore a quarter before. The list was at Rs22,628 crore when the bank first revealed it in April 2016. The bank said the provision coverage ratio has been retained at 65%. 
Axis Bank managing director and chief executive Shikha Sharma said the bank’s NPA recognition phase of this credit cycle is now nearly complete and the focus shifts to resolution. 
Sharma’s term will end in December, after the board accepted her request to reduce her latest three-year term.
“Axis is a great institution with a very promising future, and I am confident that our board will find the right person to lead this institution in its next phase. While we go through that process, I am fully committed to maintain high performance levels at the bank. The four pillars of delivery that we have set out for the bank for FY19 are normalize credit risk, deliver profitable growth, enhance capabilities and invest in the future,"" she said. 
According to Sridharan, with a much smaller pool of potential stress and high provision coverage, credit cost is expected to normalize, especially in the second half of the current fiscal. The bank, however, did not give any guidance on credit costs. Sridharan said this is because the lender wants to see how the impact of RBI’s recent circular, particularly on the disclosure of default on the first day itself, plays out. 
Provisions in the quarter rose almost three-fold to Rs7,179.53 crore from Rs2,581.25 crore a year ago. In the October-December quarter, the bank had set aside Rs2,811.04 crore in provisions."

Gold prices fell by Rs120 to Rs32,200 per 10 gram at the bullion market on Monday, tracking a weak trend overseas and muted demand from local jewellers.

Traders said a weak trend overseas as strength in dollar against some currencies eroded appeal of the precious metal as a safe-haven investment and fading demand from local jewellers at the domestic spot markets pulled down gold prices.

201,2018-05-03,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank has committed to increasing scrutiny of third parties with access to financial results

New Delhi: Axis Bank Ltd has ruled out any leakage of information from the bank in a report submitted to the markets regulator on the alleged leaks of price-sensitive information on WhatsApp groups ahead of its June quarter results last year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.  
New Delhi: Axis Bank Ltd has ruled out any leakage of information from the bank in a report submitted to the markets regulator on the alleged leaks of price-sensitive information on WhatsApp groups ahead of its June quarter results last year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. 
“The bank has submitted its report and relevant findings in the stipulated time. It has committed to further tightening the internal mechanisms while dealing with price sensitive information,"" one of the two people mentioned above  said on condition of anonymity.
On 27 December, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had asked Axis Bank to conduct an internal inquiry into the suspected leak of its June-quarter financial results on WhatsApp groups and pinpoint the source of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). 
The deadline for submitting the probe report expired in the second week of April.
Financial figures pertaining to the quarterly results of Axis Bank were either identical or matched closely with those in circulation prior to the official announcement of the results, Sebi had said in the order. 
The regulator has so far asked Axis Bank, HDFC Bank Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Bata India Ltd to conduct internal inquiries and strengthen their systems. 
HDFC Bank’s report is due for submission in the first week of June.
“The bank has ruled out any inside leakages as none of the officials handling results were found to be violating the model code of conduct (norms which protect inside information). In the report, the bank has also committed to increasing its scrutiny of third parties such as statutory auditors who are typically provided with financial results before they are made public. It has also informed Sebi that it follows the highest compliance standards and has further tightened norms to treat price sensitive information,"" said the second of the two people quoted above.
A spokesperson for Axis Bank declined to comment on an email query sent on Wednesday. 
An email sent to capital markets regulator Sebi remained unanswered. 
The development has made it hard for Sebi to proceed as it has failed to pinpoint the source of unpublished price sensitive information and as WhatsApp has declined to provide user information. 
Business Standard on 1 March first reported that WhatsApp refused to share user specific information to aid the regulator in its probe. 
“In such a circumstance, it will be up to Sebi to take the investigations forward, if needed. Sebi could go deeper if it finds the report by Axis Bank unsatisfactory. It could seek documents, information from Axis Bank, statutory auditors etc to complete fact finding,"" said Tejesh Chitlangi, senior partner at IC Universal Legal. 
Axis Bank also said in the report that it always resorted to preparing a list of unpublished price sensitive information and has now made it more exhaustive. 
The bank will also consider a comprehensive audit, monitoring big price changes before important events like earnings announcements. 
“Some of the other measures that the bank has highlighted to the regulator include—a separate dedicated work space with secured access for those preparing, discussing, finalizing unpublished price sensitive information has been created. Increased background checks for staff dealing with unpublished price sensitive information , identify persons involved in major deals and ensure information given to junior or external teams is on need to know basis,"" said the second of the two persons aware of the issue quoted above."
200,2018-05-15,Axis Bank,"Mounting bad loans, corporate governance issues at bigger lenders, such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are putting off investors

Mumbai: With state-run banks facing the brunt of mounting bad loans and frauds in some cases, and a few leading private banks grabbing headlines for the wrong reasons, small finance banks and select non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have been grabbing investors’ eyeballs more than before. 
Mumbai: With state-run banks facing the brunt of mounting bad loans and frauds in some cases, and a few leading private banks grabbing headlines for the wrong reasons, small finance banks and select non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have been grabbing investors’ eyeballs more than before.
The top losing financial stock is fraud-hit Punjab National Bank, which has eroded 48% in value year-to-date. Competitors Bank of India and Union Bank of India followed next, with declines of 41% and 39%, respectively. Clearly, state-run lenders have largely been off the radar of many investors.
However, in recent times, private banks such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd have also been at the forefront of debates and investor angst, and have been bothered by alleged corporate governance and performance issues in their respective cases.
Year to date, while BSE’s Sensex and Bankex index have risen 4.40% and 3.06%, respectively, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank shares have shed 1.29% and 1.80%, respectively.
Their peers, HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, have gained 7.88% and 25.75%, respectively, since the start of 2018 and have been the favourites of investors for a while.
However, the problems of mounting bad loans and the alleged issues of corporate governance and performance, coupled with the cases of fraud that have hit state-run banks and some private banks have given other private financial services providers an opportunity to shine. And it looks like they are doing exactly that.
“Small finance banks are getting a lot of attention. Selective NBFCs are regaining interest. They are doing well. The performance has been good. There has been incremental interest in select private banks, which have been in favour for a while now,"" said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
Further, there seems to be consensus that public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to stay out of favour despite the efforts to recapitalize them as, apart from the usual problems, they may also end up bearing the brunt of populism in the light of the upcoming general election.
“The BJP’s manifesto for Karnataka, released prior to the forthcoming election, includes the now-all-too-familiar agriculture loan waiver. The waiver would apply to loans of up to Rs1 lakh from nationalized banks and co-operatives,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 6 May note.
“If the BJP does win, it would be a while before the details of any waivers are released or put into effect; meanwhile, the temptation to default is likely to be high. Public sector banks and MFIs (micro-finance institutions) are likely to bear the brunt of this impact,"" Kotak added.
Concerned about this, Kotak analysts have downgraded the Karnataka-focused Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd from add to reduce, adding that they see negligible upside in the stock.
Amid all this, the recently-listed Bandhan Bank is gaining huge investor interest despite lofty valuations.
“Bandhan’s profitability ratios are the best amongst Indian banks and we expect them to remain so over the medium term,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, said in a 7 May report while initiating coverage with a buy rating on the stock.
In the note, JM analysts argued that while the recent large capital raise has driven a dip from historical high levels of 26-28% return on equities (RoEs), it also implies a high cushion in case of any systemic shocks.
The increasing interest is translating into higher market share for some of them.
“Well capitalized mid-sized private sector banks such as IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank are gaining market share at the expense of some PSBs that are not performing well. NBFCs have seen decent growth in the vehicle financing segment. In this quarter, disbursals of companies such as Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd have been strong, which is an indication that they are gaining market share,"" said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Institutional Equities. 
On a year-to-date basis, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd is up nearly 22%.
Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd concurred. In its March quarter interim earnings review for fiscal year 2018, it pointed out that value migration is accelerating in favour of private financials."

Mumbai: The Delhi high court on Monday directed Axis Bank to renew all pending bank guarantees with respect to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), whether expired or yet to expire, as an interim measure.  
Mumbai: The Delhi high court on Monday directed Axis Bank to renew all pending bank guarantees with respect to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), whether expired or yet to expire, as an interim measure. 
A high court bench comprising justice Rajiv Shakdher was hearing an appeal moved by Anil Ambani-owned RCom against a 16 March direction by the department of telecommunications (DoT) informing all telecom and internet provider companies, associations and officials in the telecom ministry to not accept any new bank guarantees from Axis Bank. The court asked the Centre to submit its response to RCom’s appeal within two weeks. 
Counsel appearing for RCom argued that the stay on accepting bank guarantees furnished by Axis Bank was related to the Aircel group and not RCom. 
A similar direction staying payments to be made to DoT was passed by the Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal in January 2018 with respect to Aircel group, which was upheld in March. 
The DoT direction was issued after Axis Bank, the country’s third-largest private sector lender, had failed to honour a bank guarantee it had issued on behalf of Aircel group of companies.
Apart from Aircel group, the instruction was sent to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Idea Cellular, Reliance Jio Infocomm and RCom.
Bank guarantees are issued by banks or lending institutions promising to make up for a pre-stated sum of money in case of a default by the entity on whose behalf it is issued.
Telecom companies furnish bank guarantees from time to time to meet their contractual commitments, failing which the government can encash them.
The matter would be next heard on 25 October.
RCom is currently facing insolvency proceedings before a Mumbai bench of the NCLT, on a plea filed by Sweden-based Ericsson earlier this month. The telecom firm’s total debt is of over Rs45,000 crore. 
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

Mumbai: Facebook Inc. is set to launch its WhatsApp payment services to the whole of India as early as next week in an attempt to win market share from rivals Paytm and Google Tez, even though its partners aren’t all ready, said people familiar with the matter.
WhatsApp Pay will partner HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. to process the transfers, and State Bank of India (SBI) will join once it has the necessary systems in place, the people said. Facebook was aiming for a full rollout with four partners but decided to go ahead with just three as its rivals were racing ahead, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.
The entry of WhatsApp into India’s payments space has been likened to WeChat, which reshaped payments in China when it expanded beyond messaging. The pilot version of WhatsApp Pay—started with 1 million users in February—received rave reviews, threatening the market share of incumbents Google Tez and Alibaba-backed Paytm, which lack the benefits of a social network.
“WhatsApp has a great starting point: a monopoly in chat,"" said Vivek Belgavi, leader for financial technology at PwC India. “High engagement makes it a credible competition.""
More than 200 million Indians already use WhatsApp messaging, equivalent to 60% of the US population and a daily active usage that Forrester Inc. estimates to be about 20 times higher than Paytm’s.
Emails to representatives of WhatsApp, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank weren’t immediately answered."

ICICI Bank Ltd is back in the eye of the storm after its board issued a statement on Wednesday that it would begin an independent enquiry against the lender’s top executive Chanda Kochhar. 
ICICI Bank Ltd is back in the eye of the storm after its board issued a statement on Wednesday that it would begin an independent enquiry against the lender’s top executive Chanda Kochhar.
This has come in the wake of an anonymous whistleblower accusing Kochhar of impropriety in dealing with certain borrowers. The reference is to allegations made in 2016 by another whistleblower that ICICI Bank disbursed loans to the Videocon group, violating regulations on conflict of interest.
The largest private sector lender’s stock slipped 1.97% intraday on Thursday in response to the board’s statement (it ended up 0.79%). The stock’s reaction looks rather muted because the board, the only unflinching support Kochhar has had amid the accusations of wrongdoing, has now taken a step away to establish its own credibility.
READ: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar asked to be on leave till probe is over
Recall that the board had issued a strong statement exonerating Kochhar in response to the allegations when they first appeared over two months ago. But investors felt a probe would have been a better idea and hence the board’s support has been looked at with a sceptical eye. Kochhar’s stoic silence has also worsened the situation. Ergo, the stock has been just meandering along, underperforming the broad market over the last two months with no breakthrough in sight.
To be sure, a large part of the stock’s underperformance is also due to the weakening asset quality metrics the bank reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. However, the stock has underperformed its peer Axis Bank Ltd, which had reported a large quarterly loss due to rising bad loans. This goes to show that investors still have fears over what would come out of multiple enquiries by regulators and even the Central Bureau of Investigation.
What would have made the stock get back its mojo?
If one draws a parallel with ICICI Bank’s peer Axis Bank, it can safely be said a change of leadership would have infused life into the stock. Indeed, the exit of Kochhar, even temporarily until the conclusion of enquiries, would have been given a thumbs up by the market. To be sure, it is unfair to accuse Kochhar of wrongdoing and oust her without the allegations being proved.
READ: Should Chanda Kochhar resign as ICICI Bank CEO?
But the market would have welcomed it, taking this as a sign of upholding the corporate governance of the bank.
In the absence of the above, the next relief for the stock will be visible only if the independent enquiry of the board finds Kochhar guilty, necessitating her exit. Markets are not necessarily fair and they would only lift the cloud over ICICI Bank if all the investigating agencies give a clean chit to Kochhar. Exoneration by the board-appointed investigators is unlikely to be enough."
196,2018-06-07,Axis Bank,"The removal of the disguise on restructured loans was the biggest reason to push public sector lenders and even a private lender Axis Bank into losses in March quarter

Three years ago, Indian bankers had the belief that the assets they had financed were just facing temporary headwinds and would soon begin to pay up. Hence, they tweaked loan clauses to give borrowers some leeway in payment. 
Three years ago, Indian bankers had the belief that the assets they had financed were just facing temporary headwinds and would soon begin to pay up. Hence, they tweaked loan clauses to give borrowers some leeway in payment.
What followed was the revelation that not only some of these assets, but even lenders are in their twilight zone.
Most of the restructured loans are now bad and those that were still disguised as standard have been forcibly stripped off their label and clubbed with non-performing assets (NPAs).
Of course, it took another regulatory diktat to make banks remove the disguise of standard from their restructured loans.
A February circular by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put an end to all forbearance, thereby making every restructured loan an NPA. That has caused the bad loan stockpile to swell to Rs9.8 trillion, or roughly 12% of the loans of the 38 listed banks. Needless to say, public sector lenders carry 88% of these dud assets on their books.
The removal of the disguise on restructured loans was the biggest reason to push public sector lenders and even a private lender, Axis Bank Ltd, into losses. Other private banks found their profits hit badly.
Considering the poor capital position of public sector lenders with 11 of them already under prompt corrective action (PCA) of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the capital infusion by the government went into a sinkhole of bad loans. The central government poured Rs88,139 crore capital into the lenders it owns, with the weakest of them getting the biggest share in recapitalization.
But all of this seems to have gone into provisioning of toxic assets. Indeed, public sector lenders did all kinds of provisioning in the fourth quarter, and some had to take a little leeway under RBI rules to spread provisioning over four quarters. Lenders provided for bad loans, for bond losses and for employee costs. At the aggregate level, public sector lenders had to provide Rs1.22 trillion during the fourth quarter, a 127% rise from a year ago.
The mantra during the past two fiscal years has been to provide, provide and provide. Bankers don’t see anything different in the first half of 2018-19, too. As bad loans under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) begin to get resolved, the provisioning load will lighten but not until September, bankers feel. The chiefs of State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and even scam-hit Punjab National Bank said that reversals in credit costs would be only towards the end of FY19.
So, which lender will see the sunrise and which one would go down?
The answer to that depends on how the IBC cases are resolved and the haircuts involved. But the survivors may not reflect their historic size or form.
Stocks of most public sector lenders are trading at a discount to estimated book value for fiscal year 2020, an indication that investors are far from sanguine on their prospects."

Without mentioning the name of the company Axis Bank called Expression of Interest (EoI) for the sale of three gas-based power projects with a combined capacity of 1,476 MW.
People familiar with the matter said the power projects are of Lanco Kondapalli, which was once a subsidiary of beleaguered Lanco Infratech Limited.
They said the lenders have to find a suitable resolution for their debts before 16 September, lest the creditors approach the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for a resolution.
“If the lenders cannot find a solution before the deadline set by the Supreme Court (16 September 2018), then the matter has to be referred to NCLT for a resolution. The NCLT in turn may appoint a Resolution Professional and give time for a resolution plan,"" the sources told PTI.

While Phase-I is operating with limited gas supplies, Phase II and III are not producing any power due to lack of gas supplies. 
Lanco officials were not available for comment.

It wanted the financial investors with Rs1,000 crore worth of Assets Under Management or Rs500 crore committed funds available for investment in future on the plants.
Lanco Kondapalli Power Limited was earlier a subsidiary of Lanco Infratech Limited, which is currently under insolvency proceedings.

Mumbai: The board of Axis Bank has shortlisted names of three candidates to succeed managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Shikha Sharma once she demits office on 31 December 2018, according to a notice filed with the exchanges.
The board will send the list of names in order of preference to the Reserve Bank of India for its approval. Once the regulator selects a candidate, the bank will start the process of succession, the notification said.
The bank had appointed leadership advisory firm Egon Zehnder to find these candidates, it said in a stock exchange filing in April.
The notification did not mention the names of these candidates or their whereabouts. However, the names doing the rounds include P.S. Jayakumar, MD and CEO of Bank of Baroda, and Pramit Jhaveri, CEO of Citibank India. 
Sharma had in April announced her decision to step down from the position of MD and CEO of the bank by the end of the year. Sharma’s term was to end in June 2021, with the board in December 2017 announcing a three-year extension of her term that was then to end in June 2018.
Sharma’s request to end her tenure early comes at a time her bank has posted a sharp rise in bad loans. On 1 April, The Economic Times reported that Reserve Bank of India had asked the board to review her appointment.
Analysts say the central bank’s asset quality review (AQR) in late 2015 led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders, including Axis Bank. 
In the quarters that followed, it turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR. The gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio, which was 0.94-1.68% between June 2009 and March 2016, crossed 2% for the first time after Sharma took over. It rose further to reach 5.28% by the end of 2017.
During Sharma’s tenure, Axis Bank’s gross bad loans have ballooned from  ₹ 915 crore to  ₹ 25,000 crore.
On Tuesday, Axis Bank shares rose 1.70% to  ₹  532.55 on BSE while the benchmark Sensex rose 0.85% to 36,239.62 points."

Mumbai: Mumbai-based JM Financial Asset Reconstruction and banks including Axis Bank, IDBI Bank and YES Bank have approached the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to be included under the category of financial creditors. 
The lenders are alleging that the resolution professional (RP) of the company is not accepting their claims since they had provided money against corporate guarantee provided by KSS Petron. 
“KSS Petron is a construction company and each project they undertook, they had floated a special purpose vehicle (SPV) which had raised the funds. While doing so, KSS Petron used to give a corporate guarantee as collateral,"" argued Rohit Gupta who was appearing for JM Financial ARC. “Now, the RP is not accepting the claims.""
Gupta further argued that the lenders are facing a double-edged sword. “If we invoke the corporate guarantee, that would not be possible because moratorium period is going on and if we don’t invoke the corporate guarantee, the RP will say that we have not made any claim,"" he added. 
KSS Petron’s subsidiary had collectively borrowed around  ₹ 500 crore from the lenders where it had furnished the corporate guarantees. Loan to KSS Petron was classified as a non-performing asset, in 2015.
After hearing arguments from the banks and JM Financial ARC, Presiding Officer M.K. Shrawat posted the matter for further hearing on 2 August. 
“We have already filed our reply into the matter. The corporate guarantees were not invoked at the time of submitting the claims and hence we could not accept those guarantees,"" said Mohan Lal Sharma, the resolution professional of KSS Petron, while contacted. 
Earlier in May, the lenders to Essar Steel had asked ArcelorMittal to clear the debt outstanding for two defaulting companies—Uttam Galva and KSS Petron—in which it was a large shareholder until recently.
Currently, ArcelorMittal India Pvt Ltd—which is vying for Essar Steel and which once owned shares in loan defaulter Uttam Galva as well as KSS Petron—has deposited  ₹ 7,000 crore in an escrow account to qualify for the bidding. If NCLAT declares ArcelorMittal eligible, the money in the escrow account will go towards settling Uttam Galva’s debt."

On Wednesday, The Economic Times reported that potential candidates for the bank’s CEO position are speculated to be outsiders, including Zarin Daruwala, CEO for India operations at Standard Chartered Plc and Murali M. Natrajan, CEO of DCB Bank. 
The report said, citing two unnamed people, that the bank’s nominations and remunerations committee believed that RBI was unhappy with the management, and hence would not be agreeable to an internal candidate even though there were suitable candidates for the job with inside knowledge of the bank.
The bank on Tuesday said it will make necessary disclosures as soon as it hears from RBI.
In April, Sharma had announced her decision to step down by the end of the year. Her term was originally supposed to end in June 2021. The bank’s board had given Sharma an extension of three years in December 2017.

Sticking with financial stocks and not chasing returns has helped Axis Asset Management Co. to ride the wave of volatility in Indian markets that has hammered many of its competitors.
The Axis Bluechip Fund is up 25% over the past year, beating nine index funds and 35 other actively managed portfolios to the mantle of India’s top performing large-cap fund, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its biggest holdings - HDFC Bank Ltd., Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. Housing Development Finance Corp. and Tata Consultancy Services - have contributed more than three quarters of gains on the S&P BSE Sensex Index this year.
“Our portfolio tilt toward very high-quality stocks has helped us ride out the market volatility,"" Shreyash Devalkar, senior fund manager at Axis, which has $12 billion in assets, said in an interview. The fund exited some smaller companies in December after a gush of inflows lifted valuations, he said.
Gains in Indian equities this year have been lopsided as investors sought safety in the biggest stocks amid headwinds from a brewing trade conflict and elevated prices of oil, India’s top import. A selloff in stocks of medium and smaller-sized companies was made worse by stringent margins requirements imposed in June. That’s left those smaller firms trading near the biggest discount to the Sensex in two years, according to Bloomberg data.
Axis expects a boost in government spending in India’s countryside ahead of next year’s general elections to benefit companies able to capture improved consumer demand. The government this month raised minimum assured prices for crops like cotton and rice to boost rural incomes and spending. “We are tracking earnings closely to see how consumer demand is panning out,"" he said, without naming the stocks he’s watching.
New Record
The Sensex is up more than 8% this year, surpassing a previous all-time high reached in January, after turmoil in the first quarter dragged equities into a correction. Despite the rebound, volatility may remain elevated amid uncertainty over international politics and in the run up to next year’s national ballot, Devalkar said.
Rising crude prices and its impact on public finances remains a cause for concern, he said. Brent oil held above $72 per barrel, up about 45% from a year ago, fueling concern inflation will quicken. India is the world’s third-biggest oil user and relies on imports to meet about two-thirds of its fuel requirements.
Prior to his fund’s outperformance over the past 12 months, Devalkar’s fund lost about 3.6% in 2016 compared with a 3% gain in the NSE Nifty 50 Index that year."

Axis Bank Ltd’s first quarter (Q1) results offer much-needed succour to investors on asset quality. The lender is finally healing. Recall that the bank had a disastrous two years that ended with a nasty quarterly loss in March. The lender had reported its worst ever slippage ratio and labelled its entire restructured portfolio as bad.
For the June quarter, slippages have normalized as much as they can with about  ₹ 4,300 crore turning non-performing. This led to the bank’s bad loan ratios improving sequentially, although they appear ugly when compared with the year-ago numbers. 
What is more reassuring is that loans that the lender considers most likely to turn non-performing in the coming quarters are now just 2.5% of its loan book, sharply down from about 9% a year back.
Essentially, there are unlikely to be nasty surprises ahead, unlike what the bank’s investors saw in the past four quarters. 
Of course, Axis Bank has an exposure of  ₹ 4,600 crore to accounts undergoing bankruptcy proceedings. But the lender seems to have learnt the lesson on risk management. It has smartly provided 83% towards these accounts, having covered itself for possible steep losses.
Axis Bank has focused on retail and small businesses for lending, which are the safer assets to accumulate. The management has already indicated that it’s shutters down for project financing but it would continue to give working capital loans. Its exposure to stressed sectors has fallen. 
Lastly, with much of the toxic loan pain behind it, the overhang on the lender’s core income and margins too would recede. The management indicates that the compression of net interest margin over the past two years is now over.

RBI also raised the average inflation projection for the second half of the year to 4.8% from 4.7% in June.

The monetary policy statement also cited the MSP hike for kharif crops as the primary factor stoking inflation this year. The government has fixed the MSP at 150% of the cost of production of all kharif crops.

Earlier Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist with Kotak Institutional Equities, said: “We pencil in a repo rate of 25 bps in the August policy.

Crude oil prices have declined from $75.3 per barrel to $74.2 per barrel from the last monetary policy in June. An agreement between OPEC members to increase oil production, concerns over global demand amid worsening global trade relations and increased production in the US have led to a decline in oil prices.

For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of the current FD rates from some popular banks for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

Goyal Gases has agreed to pay  ₹  2,350 crore in enterprise value for a controlling stake in JPL which was auctioned by a consortium of lenders led by Axis Bank, the people cited above told Mint.
Goyal Gases, a late entrant in the race, outbid rivals such as Adani Power, Resurgent Power Ventures Pte Ltd, Edelweiss Asset Reconstruction Co. (ARC) and Phoenix ARC. JPL was put up for sale in the first week of May. The lenders hold close to 61% of JPL’s pledged shares while the remaining stake is with the Avantha group, said the second person cited above.
“Goyal Gases has furnished the necessary bank guarantees sought by the lenders and is expected to sign the asset transfer agreement in the coming week,"" said the first person cited above. 
“The company has tied up funding from several investors including some foreign banks and private equity funds,"" the person added. “As a matter of policy, Axis Bank does not comment on client-specific matters,"" a spokesperson for the bank said in response to a query from Mint.
An email sent to the senior management of Goyal Gases remained unanswered until press time. 
Founded by entrepreneur S.C. Goyal in 1973, Goyal Gases is a closely held company and manufactures and trades in industrial gases. The company is also involved in renewable power generation and has a 26.8 megawatt (MW) wind plant in Tamil Nadu. 
Goyal Gases is part of Goyal Group of companies which also has presence in finance and real estate in Northern India. Mint had reported on 24 April that Edelweiss ARC and Phoenix ARC (part of Kotak Mahindra group) were in talks to buy close to  ₹  4,300 crore of loans of JPL from the lenders’ consortium. JPL has 600 megawatts (MW) of fully operational thermal capacity at its plant in Madhya Pradesh with an additional 660MW under implementation. 
The plant has long-term power purchase agreements for 71% of its total generation, with Madhya Pradesh and Kerala buying 35% and 36% respectively. It has fuel linkage with Coal India Ltd. 
In 2014, Avantha Power sold its Korba power plant to Adani for  ₹  4,200 crore. 
The transaction comes close on the heels of a ruling this week by the Allahabad high court, refusing to grant interim relief to power companies against the recent RBI circular. Consequently, several power companies are now likely to be referred to NCLT. 
The high court had earlier ordered lenders to avoid acting against these power producers. Among those who are likely to be referred to bankruptcy courts are Essar Power, Korba West Power Co. Ltd, Jindal India Thermal Ltd and Sravant Energy Pvt Ltd, Mint reported on 28 August.
Mint had also reported on July 25 that GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd (GCEL) and Lanco Anpara Power Ltd may be referred to national company law tribunal (NCLT) for corporate insolvency proceedings."

“Please note that a meeting of the Board will be convened in due course to inter alia, approve the appointment of Shri Amitabh Chaudhry as an additional director of the bank and as the managing director & CEO of the bank, in terms of the said RBI approval and subject to compliance with the prescribed formalities under extant law,"" according to a press statement released on Saturday. 
Prior to joining HDFC Life, Chaudhry was heading Infosys BPO. He was also the head of the independent validation and testing Unit of Infosys Technologies Ltd.
Chaudhry started his career in corporate banking with Bank of America in 1987. He also worked in diverse roles ranging from country finance officer to managing director and technology officer, investment banking, Asia.
“After an extensive search, my fellow directors and I are pleased to welcome Amitabh as the bank’s MD & CEO. Amitabh has a proven track record and is well-equipped to lead Axis Bank in pursuing its growth ambitions balanced with a strong emphasis on risk and compliance management,"" Axis Bank Chairman Sanjiv Misra said.
The announcement comes after Sharma decided to leave on 31 December, cutting short her term of three years that began on 1 June. Sharma’s move comes at a time when Axis Bank had posted a sharp rise in bad loans.
According to analysts, the central bank’s asset quality review (AQR) in late 2015 led to a rise in bad loans for most lenders, including Axis Bank. In the quarters that followed, Axis Bank turned out to be among the banks worst hit by the AQR."

India’s third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd will have a new chief four months from now.

Its stressed assets have fallen, it has made large provisions towards all toxic loans and the bank has improved its loan mix by focusing on retail.  
India’s third-largest private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd will have a new chief four months from now. After a tumultuous three years, the private sector lender’s books are on the mend as its June quarter results showed. Its stressed assets have fallen, it has made large provisions towards all toxic loans and the bank has improved its loan mix by focusing on retail. 
With toxic assets reducing as a part of total loans, the overhang on interest income and margins will recede. Shikha Sharma, current managing director and chief executive officer at the bank, will have some more time to fix the balance sheet.
Amitabh Chaudhry, currently heading HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, is likely to have a far better book to inherit next year. 
Chaudhry will have a lender poised to grow, especially in the retail and small business space. Of course, a lot of this depends on how resolution of the assets under the insolvency code pan out towards which Axis Bank has an exposure of close to  ₹ 6,000 crore. 
What does Chaudhry bring to the table and what changes can one expect at the lender given that an outsider will be at the helm?
Chaudhry has deep exposure to technology through his BPO (business process outsourcing) days at Infosys Ltd. He also has knowledge on the retail segment for financial products through HDFC Standard Life. 
Analysts are already taking the leadership change positively as it puts an end to the uncertainty. “We would describe Mr Chaudhry as a turnaround expert,"" wrote analysts at IDFC Securities Ltd. They believe that his past success with HDFC Standard Life ensures that Axis Bank too will see its profitability grow. 
Many analysts have upgraded the Axis Bank stock, and it rose marginally amid broad weakness in the markets on Monday. 
However, Chaudhry has all but five years of experience in banking before he headed the Infosys BPO business. As far as risk management and assessment, and corporate banking goes, it could be a blind spot given that his banking experience was as early as 1990s. 
As analyst Hemindra Hazari notes in Smartkarma, a research website, Chaudhry may need to seek help from experts in the field of banking to bring Axis Bank to the next growth level. 
Growth through using technology in conjunction with banking solutions is something Chaudhry should be adept at. But for risk management and assessment, he perhaps may need to seek external advice.
For now, investors are relieved that the uncertainty over leadership is over and Axis Bank is being passed on to able hands."

New Delhi: Change is coming to some of India’s top private banks as regulators shunt aside a previous generation of leaders in a bid to improve corporate governance and get to grips with a mountain of bad loans.
By cutting short the terms of the chief executives of Axis Bank Ltd. and Yes Bank Ltd., both of which were found to have a higher ratio of bad assets than initially reported, the Reserve Bank of India has signalled that management will be held accountable. That’s a positive development for bank shareholders.
“The RBI action sends a strong signal to boards to take their jobs a lot more seriously when it comes to evaluating CEO performance and the question of succession planning,"" said T.T. Ram Mohan, a professor of Finance and Economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad. “That can only be good for shareholders from the long-term point of view.""
Further out, two other senior bankers are due to move on in 2020. Aditya Puri will step down as CEO of HDFC Bank Ltd., and Romesh Sobti is due to leave his CEO role at IndusInd Bank Ltd. The boards of both these lenders have said that they are putting in place succession plans, without providing further details.
Here’s a summary of the main changes so far:
Yes Bank
The central bank last month refused to approve a renewed term for Yes Bank’s Chief Executive Officer, Rana Kapoor, asking him to step down by January. Yes Bank shares have tumbled 27% since news last month that Kapoor will depart from a bank he has headed since it was founded 14 years ago.
While the central bank didn’t give a reason for its decision, it had tussled with Yes Bank about how much of its loans should be recognized as nonperforming.
An internal candidate would be less likely to tamper with “Kapoor’s focus on growth,"" according to Payal Pandya, an analyst at Centrum Wealth Management. On the other hand, if there was a problem with internal controls, then an external candidate may provide greater accountability on the bad loan issues, according to Suyash Rai, senior consultant at National Institute of Public Finance and Policy.
Axis Bank
Axis Bank too saw CEO Shikha Sharma’s term curtailed by the RBI, after a nine year tenure. She will step down by the end of this year, to be succeeded by Amitabh Chaudhry, former head of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co.
Punit Srivastava, head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said the transition should be positive for the bank, whose shares have risen 13.5% since news of Sharma’s departure in April.
“They are on a stronger wicket in terms of their balance sheet, with sufficient capital"" said Srivastava. “The top leadership issue has been cleared.""
ICICI Bank
ICICI Bank ltd. announced last week that its longstanding CEO Chanda Kochhar had stepped down. The reasons weren’t disclosed but her resignation follows a period of three months during which she has been on leave, pending the results of an inquiry into allegations against her, including claims of a “quid pro quo"" in dealings with certain of the bank’s borrowers.
She has been replaced by the bank’s Chief Operating Officer Sandeep Bakhshi, who was appointed for a 5-year term, subject to approval by the RBI. Kochhar had headed the bank since 2009.
“Sandeep Bakhshi enjoys a good reputation in the industry. I don’t see any red flag there,"" said Rai.

Mumbai: Bengaluru-based Shriram Properties Ltd plans to file its draft prospectus with markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) by December for its proposed initial public offering (IPO), said two people aware of the matter.
The real estate subsidiary of the Shriram group has hired Axis Bank Ltd, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities Ltd and Edelweiss Financial Services to manage the share sale, its managing director Murali Malayappan said.
Murali, however, declined to give a specific timeline for filing the draft prospectus, but said the company plans to launch the IPO before the end of this financial year.
“We are in a preparatory stage to file documents before the end of this year,"" said Gopal Krishnan, executive director and chief financial officer, Shriram Properties.
“We have started working with bankers and lawyers exploring opportunities for capital raising and, hopefully, we will test the market soon,"" Krishnan said.
An Axis Bank spokesperson declined to comment, while queries sent to Nomura and Edelweiss remained unanswered.
Private equity firms TPG Capital, Starwood Capital, Walton Street Capital and Tata Capital, which hold a combined 58% stake in Shriram Properties, will partly monetize their shares in the company through the proposed IPO, said Krishnan.
“The IPO will provide the kind of liquidity that our investors would be looking at. So all will be monetizing their existing positions. It will be a good liquidity from their perspective as well,"" he said.
This year, real estate companies Lodha Group and Puranik Builders Ltd have filed documents to launch IPOs.
The last time a private real estate firm launched an IPO was in 2010. That year, several companies, such as DB Realty Ltd, Prestige Estates Projects Ltd, Oberoi Realty Ltd, Nitesh Estates Ltd and Man Infraconstruction Ltd, had collectively raised around  ₹ 4,275 crore.
“(The) economy is growing. We see a good demand. There is no slowdown (for good developers),"" said Murali. “Customers are choosing to buy homes from good developers. The market has been able to differentiate who can deliver and who cannot,"" he said.
Shriram Properties plans to rapidly expand and has adopted an asset light model of development management (DM) to ramp up its residential portfolio. It is also actively looking at acquiring distressed assets to strengthen its property businesses in existing markets, including Bengaluru, Chennai and Hyderabad.
Under the DM model, large realty firms step in as development managers for smaller developers and landowners in return for a share of the revenue, share of profit or a management fee.
“In this changing landscape, we have taken the DM route as a model to grow in an asset light way, and at the same time scale up quickly. We are giving greater emphasis on the DM model, which has gained large share of our portfolio now,"" said Krishnan.
Till 2017-18, Shriram had one project under DM. However, in the last one year, it has signed a dozen such projects and this is likely to comprise a third of its upcoming project pipeline, Krishnan said."

Mumbai:Net profit at Axis Bank Ltd rose 82.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) to  ₹ 789.6 crore in the September quarter because of higher net interest income and lower provisions, the private sector lender reported on Friday. 
Its profit was higher than the  ₹ 758.9 crore estimated by a Bloomberg poll of 22 analysts. Net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, increased 15.25% y-o-y to  ₹ 5,232 crore. 
Net interest margin (NIM), a key measure of profitability, stood at 3.59%, down 12 basis points (bps) y-o-y and 8bps sequentially. 
Axis Bank’s other income, which includes core fee income, rose 3.5% to  ₹ 2,678.38 crore in the three months to September 2018.
Axis Bank chief financial officer Jairam Sridharan said that Q1 was “the bottom"" as far as NIMs are concerned. 
“You might recall me saying last quarter that we have now had about 2.5 years of consistent NIM compression and now we feel like we have hit the bottom. My guess is that you will continue to see some strength in the NIM metric, either stability or further strengthening from these levels,"" said Sridharan.
The bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio—bad loans as a percentage of gross advances—stood at 5.96%, up 6bps y-o-y but down 56bps sequentially.
The bank is seeing an improvement in the overall asset quality environment and all key metrics, such as new NPA formation, recoveries, credit costs and NPA ratios, continue to see strong improvement, said Shikha Sharma, the managing director and chief executive officer of the bank.
“So it would be prudent not to declare victory and take our eye off the ball on asset quality. That said, it is clear that new NPA formation has noticeably slowed,"" Sharma said.
The lender is witnessing much more benign slippage levels than seen in the last three years and that special mention 2 (SMA-2) levels are at historic lows, she said. 
Provisions during the quarter decreased 6.78% y-o-y to  ₹ 2,927.3 crore. 
In the June quarter, the bank had set aside  ₹ 3,337.7 crore as provisions. Post-provisions, the net NPA ratio was at 2.54%, against 3.09% in the June quarter and 3.12% in the year-ago quarter.
The bank saw slippages of  ₹ 2,777 crore in the quarter, down 69% y-o-y and down 36% sequentially. 
Corporate slippages stood at  ₹ 1,090 crore and the bank said that 88% of this originated from previously-disclosed accounts rated BB and below. 
The bank’s BB and below book stood at  ₹ 8,860 crore, or 1.7% of its gross customer assets, and was down to less than one-fourth of the 7.3% peak seen earlier.
Axis Bank’s total advances grew 11% y-o-y to  ₹ 4.56 trillion as of 30 September. While domestic loans grew 15% y-o-y, the overseas book shrank by 12% y-o-y. Its retail loans grew 20% y-o-y to  ₹ 2.21 trillion and accounted for 49% of net advances.

Two banks reported markedly divergent performances for the September quarter (Q2). 
Two banks reported markedly divergent performances for the September quarter (Q2).
Axis Bank Ltd surprised investors by reporting a cracker of a performance for the second quarter. The private sector lender’s net profit jumped a stupendous 83% because of lower provisioning. Punjab National Bank (PNB), on the other hand, reported a massive loss as its provisions surged by 300%.
Axis Bank’s slippages fell to  ₹ 2,777 crore, the lowest in six quarters. Asset quality metrics improved, with the gross bad loan ratio falling for the third straight quarter to 5.96% of the loan book.
Recall that this column had pointed to the healing of the balance sheet in the June quarter. That seems to be now reflecting in the improvement in operating metrics.
Indeed, Axis Bank has succeeded in mending its balance sheet to a great extent. Most of this mending has come from avoiding project finance altogether and shrinking its corporate loan book.
The lender’s disastrous mistakes on credit risk assessment and the impact of these are now behind it. 
That said, Axis Bank has an exposure of  ₹ 825 crore to Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS). But a hit from this is unlikely to cause much damage to the lender.
Further, Axis Bank’s exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) including housing finance companies, is about 2% of its total loan book. NBFCs have been under pressure since IL&FS defaulted on its repayments, sparking concerns across the sector.
The private sector lender also has 73% provision coverage ratio, which gives it adequate insurance against bad loan risk. Combine this with a healthy 15% growth in the loan book and investors have no reason to avoid the stock.
In a nutshell, Axis Bank’s future asset quality looks better, which should please investors. The change in leadership has also infused new life into the stock. The lender will have a new chief in Amitabh Chaudhry, with Shikha Sharma’s term ending in December.
In sharp contrast, public sector lender PNB is still reeling under the massive scam that surfaced a few quarters before. Far from healing, its loan book has worsened further. Gross bad loans are now more than 17% of its total loan book.

Mumbai: HSBC on Tuesday raised its rating on Indian equities to “neutral"" from “underweight"", citing recent underperformance and more reasonable valuations.
“Since end-August, India underperformed because of issues in local banks, currency weakness and oil price volatility,"" HSBC analysts said in a note.
“Despite recent underperformance, these risks remain for Indian equity market. But investors’ holdings now lowest relative to history, valuations more reasonable, 2019e (expected) earnings growth highest in region,"" they said, adding, “We raise Indian equities from underweight to neutral in a regional context."" 
BSE’s 30-share Sensex rose 0.45% to close at 35,513.14 points on Tuesday, while the National Stock Exchange’s 50-share Nifty rose 0.54% to 10,685.60 points.
HSBC analysts said MSCI India EPS (earnings per share) growth consensus expectations are for 18.8% in 2018 and 24% in 2019, which means India is one of the fastest growing markets across the region.
However, five stocks—State Bank of India, Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd—account for nearly half of all 2019 earnings growth, they said, expressing concerns that they estimate 65% market-cap weighted average earnings growth for these five stocks.
Against this background of high growth and the much-anticipated rate hikes, India’s valuation now appears fair and almost in line with the five-year average 12-month forward PE (price to earnings), they said, adding that it was still far from cheap as India trades at 17.4 times whereas MSCI AxJ trades at 11 times.
“Meanwhile, investors’ weights in India are now at historically low levels and there is an opportunity to add to this. In the past, elections have tended to be a key catalyst for performance,"" HSBC analysts said. “A key risk is the dependency on a few large-cap stocks for growth. These are mostly banks. Thus, rising NPLs (non-performing loans) can quickly and significantly change India’s earnings outlook,"" they warned.
The currency could weaken from here, prompting more interest rate hikes, while lower oil prices are supportive now, HSBC said, though it expects oil to rise in 2019-20."

Mumbai: Axis Bank will be offering its new home loan customers an alternative to reduce their principal amount on a monthly basis, in departure from the current system wherein the lion’s share of repayment initially is the interest component. 
Mumbai: Axis Bank will be offering its new home loan customers an alternative to reduce their principal amount on a monthly basis, in departure from the current system wherein the lion’s share of repayment initially is the interest component.
By reducing the principal with every month’s repayment, the gross amount repaid by a borrower during the duration of a loan will also go down as the interest outgo comes down, officials at the private sector lender said Wednesday.
However, the interest outgo for a borrower has been kept at a higher level of 9.05-9.25% as against 8.85- 9.05% for the older product.
“The new home loan product will reduce the overall interest burden on the borrower. We are confident that this unique concept of ‘reducing monthly installments’, along with big savings on the interest side, will be an attractive proposition for home buyers,"" executive director for retail banking Rajiv Anand told reporters.
In a statement, the bank cited a case of a  ₹ 50-lakh home loan, saying by the end of the 20th year, the interest outgo under the current equated monthly installment (EMI) system, a borrower will be paying  ₹ 57.96 lakh in interest alone assuming an interest rate of 9%.
But under the new offering, even assuming for a higher interest rate of 9.20%, the total interest outgo will be  ₹ 46.19 lakh only on the same amount of loan.
The bank said it will extend loans between  ₹ 3 lakh and  ₹ 5 crore under the new product."

Mumbai: As the curtains draw down on a year that saw a shake-up in the private banking space, 2019 promises to be a year of redemption and repair. A new set of leaders will assert its authority at ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd next year. While Sandeep Bakhshi has replaced Chanda Kochhar at ICICI Bank, Shikha Sharma of Axis Bank will pass on the mantle to Amitabh Chaudhry in January and Yes Bank is expected to appoint Rana Kapoor’s successor by the end of next month. 
Mumbai: As the curtains draw down on a year that saw a shake-up in the private banking space, 2019 promises to be a year of redemption and repair. A new set of leaders will assert its authority at ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd next year. While Sandeep Bakhshi has replaced Chanda Kochhar at ICICI Bank, Shikha Sharma of Axis Bank will pass on the mantle to Amitabh Chaudhry in January and Yes Bank is expected to appoint Rana Kapoor’s successor by the end of next month.
With three of the leading private banks undergoing a leadership transition, it will be interesting to see the change in strategy and execution. Mint’s analysis of the transition period and access to discussions at these banks shows that it will be back to the basics: focus on quality, bottom line, technology, people and processes.
Bakhshi’s top priority will be to restore ICICI Bank’s credibility, which took a beating after former chief executive Kochhar was forced to exit because of allegations relating to violation of corporate governance. That said, during the September quarter, ICICI Bank swung to a profit after reporting a historic loss in the June quarter.

The new CEO is focused on the bottom line. “Mr Bakhshi keeps reminding us to focus upon two important things,"" said Sandeep Batra, president, ICICI Bank. “First, improve core operating profit further through granular and risk-calibrated business growth. Second, make delivery more seamless and frictionless by decongesting processes and appropriately empowering teams.""
As the bank shifts its strategy to target highly rated borrowers, Batra believes that there has always been a trade-off between the quality of customers and the impact on a bank’s net interest margin (NIM). “However, we are not looking at NIM on a stand-alone basis. We are focused to give better value to our shareholders,"" said Batra.
The bank had started changing its strategy under Kochhar. It reduced the corporate loan exposure on its books to 25% of its total loan book, while increasing the retail loan exposure to 57%.
 Bakhshi is acquainted with the bank’s culture and processes. The institution, therefore, is unlikely to see a radical change in strategy.
That, however, may not be true of Amitabh Chaudhry who will take charge at Axis Bank after having spent eight years at HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Chaudhry’s exposure to technology through his business process outsourcing days at Infosys Ltd, combined with his knowledge of retail financial products through HDFC Standard Life, is expected to give the bank a much-needed facelift and the retail engine that it lacks.
Chaudhry’s focus will be on investing in digital banking, improving operational efficiency and scaling up subsidiaries, according to the bank’s chief financial officer Jairam Sridharan.
However, Chaudhry’s first priority will be to put in place a new team. Axis Bank’s executive director in charge of retail banking Rajiv Anand has replaced Srinivasan Varadarajan, the outgoing deputy managing director in charge of corporate banking. Anand has been appointed the executive director of its wholesale banking arm. Chaudhry’s entry into the Axis Bank corner room is likely to be accompanied by the induction of some close associates from the insurance industry.

Axis Bank’s financial performance has been improving and it is set to enter the last leg of its balance sheet clean-up. The bank reported an 83% jump in net profit in Q2 FY19 and saw its gross NPAs fall for the third straight quarter to 5.96% of its loan book.
“We see a lot of opportunity in growing the housing loan business in the wake of the NBFC crisis. Lower-end small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are typically underserved, are another area of opportunity,"" said Sridharan, reiterating that the bank’s confidence in corporate lending is still intact. “However, we will make sure not to concentrate on specific clients or industries,"" he said. Axis Bank, like ICICI Bank, has been reducing its exposure to companies and concentrating on the retail franchise.
Among the three banks, Yes Bank’s new CEO, who is yet to be chosen, is likely to face the toughest challenge. The new executive will replace promoter and CEO Rana Kapoor, who was forced to step down after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised concerns about the lender’s poor corporate governance and accounting practices, and under-reporting of bad loans.
Besides restoring the bank’s credibility, the new leader will have to clean up its balance sheet. The bank has seen a flurry of exits from the board in recent months.

Amitabh Chaudhry will be the new managing director and CEO of the bank with effect from January 1, 2019, it said further.
Chaudhry, the former MD and CEO of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company, was in September named the MD and CEO of Axis Bank for a period of three years, with effect from January 1, 2019. Earlier on December 8, Axis Bank had inducted Chaudhry as additional director on its board, three weeks ahead of his taking over as the new managing director and CEO of the private sector lender.
Chaudhry, 54, started his career in corporate banking with the Bank of America in 1987, where he worked in diverse roles. He is a BTech (Electronic & Electricals) from the Birla Institute of Technology & Science, Pilani and an alumnus of the lndian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.
In July 2017, the board of Axis Bank had approved the reappointment of Sharma, who was to start her fourth term as MD and CEO from June 2018.
However, in April this year, Sharma wanted her new term to be reduced to seven months from a three-year tenure without citing any reasons, which was accepted by the board.
It was learnt that the RBI had asked Axis Bank’s board to reconsider the decision to reappoint Sharma amid concerns over rising bad loans on the bank’s books. She had completed her third term as the bank’s head on May 31."

147,2019-01-30,Axis Bank,"Clearly, the lender needs to have an eye on its entire loan book and not just errant corporate borrowersAxis Bank’s gross bad loan ratio was 5.75%, 100 basis points lower than the peak it had hit in the quarter ended March 2018

Axis Bank Ltd’s hat-trick of strong quarterly performance should bring investors enough cheer. After all, the private sector lender beat Street estimates not just on net profit, but also core income growth.
The bank’s net interest income rose 18% from a year earlier, the fastest growth in six quarters, and its net interest margin improved to 3.47%. The fixing of asset quality has now borne fruits in the form of improved bad loan ratios. The lender has moved away from project finance and focused on retail and better quality corporate borrowers.
Axis Bank’s gross bad loan ratio was 5.75%, 100 basis points lower than the peak it had hit in the quarter ended March 2018. Quarterly fresh slippages are down to manageable levels.
Its overall risky loans, which the bank says are rated BB and below, are down to 1.4% of its book, and its move to boost provision coverage ratio to 75% shows it wants to leave nothing to chance any more. Growth in loans is coming from the retail segment, which grew 20%. The 4% growth of the corporate book shows the bank is cautious and choosy.
This would mean that new chief Amitabh Chaudhry, who took charge earlier this month, will have it easy in terms of bad assets. He has not inherited a large toxic pool of assets, as much of the problem seems to have been fixed by the management.
That said, Chaudhry still needs to be vigilant on the lender’s loan book, besides chalking a growth path in the coming quarters. Investors also need to be aware that not all is well with Axis Bank, yet. Perhaps that is why five brokerage firms still have a sell rating on the stock.
Firstly, fresh slippages have grown sequentially. But what should worry is nearly half of these slippages are non-corporate. Axis Bank has done well to repair its corporate loan book by weaning off low-rated risky loans. It was also lucky by having just about  ₹800 crore exposure to the beleaguered Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd, which hit its peers hard.
However, slippages outside the corporate book have grown. Clearly, the bank needs to have an eye on its entire loan book and not just on errant corporate borrowers. The management explained that some of the stress has been from farm loans.
Chaudhry has laid out a plan for growth and profitability but hasn’t given numerical values to these, which would have been appreciated by investors. Nevertheless, part of the 16% rise in the Axis Bank stock in the last three months has been due to Chaudhry taking over from former head Shikha Sharma. Despite the rise, the stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY20. Investors don’t seem too convinced the clean-up is done."
146,2019-01-31,Axis Bank,"Debt-laden BSR Diagnostics owns two hospitals: Apollo BSR Hospitals and BSR Cancer Hospital in Bhilai A Mumbai bench of NCLT approved the  ₹67 cr resolution plan

MUMBAI :
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved the resolution plan submitted by the US-based Tri-County Premier Hearing Services Inc. to acquire debt-ridden Bhilai Scan and Research Pvt. Ltd (BSR) Diagnostics Ltd.
On 22 January, a Mumbai bench of NCLT presided over by justices V.P. Singh and Ravikumar Duraiswami approved the American company’s  ₹67-crore resolution plan for the Chhattisgarh-based diagnostics chain.
“The resolution plan provides that within 30 business days of the effective date, the company shall appoint a monitoring agency constituting of two representatives of the secured financial creditors, one of resolution applicant (successful bidder) and one of resolution professional (RP) to monitor and supervise the implementation of the resolution plan,"" the order said. 
The monitoring agency must have representatives each from Axis Bank, State Bank of India and the RP.
BSR Diagnostics owes around  ₹170 crore to financial and operational creditors. 
The committee of creditors (CoC), which includes State Bank of India and Axis Bank, had approved the resolution plan with 99% voting in favour. The lenders agreed to a 58% haircut while approving the plan on 5 November. 
The resolution professional for BSR—Sundaresh Bhat of BDO—confirmed the development. 
“BSR will be Tri-County Premier Hearing Services’ first acquisition in India and will allow it to enter into radiology diagnostics as well,"" Bhat said. 
BSR operates about 19 diagnostic centres in central and eastern India, in cities such as Bhilai, Raipur, Nagpur, Jagdalpur and Cuttack. 
Florida-based Tri-County’s plan involves paying around  ₹67 crore to lenders and infusing fresh equity into the company.  The debt-laden company also owns two hospitals: Apollo BSR Hospitals and BSR Cancer Hospital in Bhilai.
The RP received expressions of interest (EoI) from six entities, of which three filed their resolution plans. However, the CoC approved only one resolution plan of Tri-County Premier Hearing Services Inc. 
Hyderabad-based advisory firm Medium Healthcare Consulting Pvt. Ltd will carry out the business of the BSR Diagnostics, under an agreement between Tri-County and Medium.
Tri-County has also formed a strategic tie-up with Odisha-based diagnostic chain Geeta Diagnostics Centre, which has agreed to infuse an additional  ₹9 crore in lieu of 20% equity stake in BSR’s Odisha operations. 
According to the court order, law firm Link Legal India Law Services is advising the RP in the case, while company’s promoters Rohit Khanduja and M.K. Khanduja are being represented by Ashish Pyasi, an advocate with Dhir & Dhir Associates.

Indian markets gained over 1% on Thursday after a dovish Federal Reserve signaled a prolonged pause in its latest policy statement. Also better-than-expected earnings from Axis Bank and ICICI Bank also cheered the investors. At 11.29 am, the Sensex was trading at 35993.33, up 1.13% or 402 points higher, while the Nifty climbed 0.9% to 10,747.55.
Overnight, the Federal Reserve signaled it is done raising interest rates for at least a while and will be flexible in reducing its bond holdings. Traders will now focus on jobs data which will be out on Friday.
Domestically, traders awaiting fiscal deficit data for April-December and revised annual gross domestic product estimate for fiscal year 2018 due later today. Traders will also watch the interim budget, scheduled to be presented tomorrow.
""Budget could give some indication of the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation, which is one of the main sensitivities in the sovereign rating"", says Fitch Ratings. “Higher pre-election spending could risk a second consecutive year of fiscal slippage relative to the government's targets and would further delay plans to reduce the high general government fiscal deficit and debt burden,"" Fitch Rating said in a note.
Of the 20 NSE Nifty 50 Index companies that have announced results so far, 13 have either met or exceeded analyst estimates, Bloomberg reported.
Axis Bank posted robust performance as bottomline jumped 131% year on year at  ₹1,680 crore, ahead of analyst estimates, on the back of non-interest income growth of 54% year on year and net interest income (NII) of  ₹5,600 crore vs expectation of  ₹5,400 crore. Gross slippage at  ₹3700 crore for the quarter was largely in line with expectations.
""We believe that the bank is closer to the end of its stress loan recognition cycle, which along with improving PCR clearly indicates sharp moderation in credit cost in FY20E. The contingent provisioning on residual stressed loans is also expected to limit incremental provisions on these. Looking ahead, we expect the bank to deliver sustained improvement in operating metrics led by dwindling headwinds on asset quality, improvement in capital efficiency and higher balance sheet growth,"" Reliance Securities said in a note.
ICICI Bank has also reported a decent performance in December quarter with NII, pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) and PBT growing by 23%, 22% and 28%, respectively on year-on-year basis. Further, 80 basis points decline in non-performing loans and sharp 900 bps quarter-on-quarter rise in PCR (provision coverage ratio) to 69% were the key positives.
""ICICI Bank continues to show promise with trending lower new NPL formation, and balance sheet growth with higher granularity on both asset and liability side. We expect core bank RoE to improve to 16-17% by FY21E"", said Jefferies India in a note."

Global private equity giant KKR and Co. on  Thursday said former Axis Bank managing director (MD) and chief executive officer (CEO) Shikha Sharma will join the company as an adviser for its alternative credit business on 1 February.
A KKR statement said Sharma will advise its corporate and real estate-focused non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) in India, and will advise on business growth, value-creation opportunities, and strategic mergers and acquisitions, among other areas. 
KKR’s alternative credit businesses in India currently have a combined net worth of approximately  ₹4,640 crore.
Sharma’s term at Axis Bank ended in December. Her appointment comes at a time when KKR is looking to expand its credit business and exploring acquisition opportunities, including select portfolios of NBFCs, and entire NBFCs with operating teams.
Mint reported in October that KKR was in talks to acquire a controlling stake in Aadhar Housing Finance Ltd, a unit of Wadhawan Global Capital (WGC), which also controls Dewan Housing Finance Co. Ltd (DHFL). Several NBFCs are expected to put large portions of their assets on the block to tide over their liquidity problem, which has resulted in asset liability mismatches and triggered a re-rating of the NBFC sector. 
Prior to Axis Bank, Sharma had a stint in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. as its MD and CEO. 
She had also served as the founding MD and CEO of ICICI Personal Financial Services, besides helping establish ICICI Bank’s retail lending business. She was also instrumental in facilitating ICICI Securities’ joint venture with JPMorgan. 
“I am very excited that we will be able to benefit from Shikha’s deep expertise and counsel. India is structurally short of long-term capital, and this provides a compelling opportunity for our NBFCs to diversify and scale in many areas, including working with mid-market companies and SMEs,"" said Sanjay Nayar, member and CEO, KKR India. 
“Having built a broader financial services business, Shikha’s experience will help us expand our presence in the financing sector and build on our NBFC’s large equity base to meet the ongoing need for capital in corporate India."" 
“I look forward to working alongside the team and help them identify further areas of growth and opportunity,"" Sharma said in the statement.
KKR’s alternative credit business is currently headed by B.V. Krishnan, who Nayar hired in 2009 from Citigroup, where he was the head of structured products for fixed income, currencies, commodities and equity capital markets in India.

138,2019-02-12,Axis Bank,"City Union Bank Ltd., a small lender based in Kumbakonam, has risen more than 27% over the last twelve monthsCity Union had gross bad loans of 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December

Mumbai: A policy of cautious lending to the silk weavers and shopkeepers of Tamil Nadu has allowed a small local bank to outpace the largest Indian banks in terms of share price performance.
City Union Bank Ltd., a small lender based in Kumbakonam, has risen more than 27 percent over the last twelve months, the best performance of any Indian lender in the Bankex index after Axis Bank Ltd. It has beaten out larger rivals such as HDFC Bank Ltd. and State Bank of India thanks to its successful record in lending to small and medium sized enterprises, or SME sector, while keeping a lid on bad loans.
“They are the gold standard in SME lending,"" said Yuvraj Choudhary, an analyst at Anand Rathi Financial Services. “They have very good insight into how small industries work in their region.""
SME lending in India tends to be a higher margin business, because banks can charge hefty interest rates, but many avoid the segment because of the difficulty in assessing risks and the danger of piling on bad loans. Many of the country’s banks are struggling under the weight of a mountain of problem assets, denting their share prices and posing a threat to the wider Indian economy.
In addition, SMEs have been especially vulnerable to recent economic upheavals such as the temporary ban on high-valued currency notes in 2016, and the introduction of a nationwide goods and services tax the following year.
City Union had gross bad loans of 2.9 percent for the quarter ending December, below its regional peers and its larger Mumbai-based rivals. Meanwhile, its net interest margin of 4.4 percent puts it in the top quartile of India’s banking system.
Many of City Union’s customers are small businesses in Tamil Nadu’s textile industry, working on different parts of the supply chain from spinning and weaving to garment manufacture. The bank also lends to the retail and wholesale dealers selling anything from toothpaste to spare parts for trucks, whose shops line the streets of towns across the state.
“Unlike larger lenders, City Union does more relationship-based lending, catering to the needs of the SME borrower, which can be quite volatile,"" said Pankaj Agarwal, an analyst at Ambit Capital. “That’s why they can charge a premium in this relatively untapped segment.""
Another positive is City Union’s relatively stable history at a time when faster growing lenders with similar profit numbers have sprung unpleasant surprises. Yes Bank Ltd., whose shares have dropped 47 percent over the past 12 months, has only recently resolved a leadership crisis. IndusInd Bank Ltd., down nearly 9 percent, last year disclosed significant exposure to the troubled infrastructure lender IL&FS.
Still, a smaller ratio of low-cost deposits in City Union’s liabilities compared with its peers could weigh on profits at a time when money market rates are tightening. The bank’s cost of funds rose by eight basis points in the last quarter.
But the bank has never reported a loss and has always announced a dividend in each of the previous 115 years, according to Chief Executive Officer N Kamakodi. He said the bank insists on collateral in the form of land or buildings when it lends to Tamil Nadu’s SMEs, ensuring it nearly always gets its money back.
“By nature we are a conservative bank,"" Kamakodi said in an interview. “We run marathons and not 100 meter sprints.""

Mumbai: From cloth makers to shipyards, Indian banks are getting stuck with shares of companies that are rapidly losing value even as the lenders seek to turn more loans they have made into equity in borrower firms.
In the latest move, State Bank of India and other creditors are planning to convert part of their loans to the beleaguered carrier Jet Airways Ltd. into equity as it struggles to repay debt. That’s a risk for the largest Indian bank, whose equity holdings’ market value crashed to about $104 million last quarter from $480 million a year earlier, while its stakes remained largely unchanged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
State Bank of India isn’t alone: competitors including ICICI Bank Ltd., Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank Ltd. saw the market value of their equity holdings drop last year. Those banks switched debt into equity in stressed companies from Bombay Rayon Fashions Ltd. to ABG Shipyard Ltd.
“No bank in India has expertise in turning around companies. None of them engage with the companies,"" said A. K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd. “Converting debt to equity normally leads to losses without such expertise.""

132,2019-03-15,Axis Bank,"IL&FS defaults and a new e-bidding platform have disrupted the $108 billion India bond market, says Axis Bank's Shashikant RathiIt may take until after Lok Sabha elections in May for the bond market to settle down and issuance to pick up, says Rathi

Mumbai: Shashikant Rathi, who has dominated India’s local bond underwriting business for over a decade at Axis Bank, says the industry now faces its biggest challenge since the global financial crisis.
Shock defaults since last year by shadow bank IL&FS and a new electronic bidding platform have disrupted the $108 billion India bond market where underwriters like Rathi help companies raise money by selling debt securities. Sales of rupee corporate bonds that tend to pay the highest fees have fallen this quarter to a 2016 low.
“The market is in complete chaos,"" Rathi, the 41-year-old executive vice president and head of treasury and markets at Axis Bank in Mumbai, said in an interview. “I haven’t seen such a crisis since the 2008 Lehman bankruptcy.""
A surprise rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) last month and expectations of further easing as early as April haven’t lowered funding costs much, with bond yields near the highest levels since 2009. It may take until after Lok Sabha elections in May for the bond market to settle down and issuance to pick up, says Rathi.
The bumps have slowed India’s drive to make the local corporate bond market bigger. Rathi is trying to weather it by doing what he’s always done, using long-standing relationships to arrange more deals.
India’s corporate bond market remains puny compared with the funding needs of the $2.6 trillion economy, and big issuers are still for the most part limited to quasi-state enterprises. Policymakers are trying to change that. Starting April, large companies will be required to meet 25% of their annual funding requirements from the bond market.
Overall rupee bond sales have risen nearly 15% so far this year, but that’s mainly driven by issuance by state firms that don’t tend to pay underwriting fees. Deals that bankers rely on to earn commissions involving notes without AAA ratings have dropped 49%  this quarter from the last three months of 2018, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Complicating matters for arrangers is the introduction of an electronic bidding platform, which enables investors to put in buy orders for any issuer without going through a broker. New rules last year that required investors to make some of their bids on the e-platform, which can be viewed by the public, caused rupee bond sales to slump.
Rathi said there remains a big role for arrangers in India’s primary market, which isn’t fully developed.
“Issuers still need arrangers as we are the bankers who can give them a firm commitment, advise on the right borrowing level and help market-making,"" he said.
The credit market slump is a threat to one of the world’s fastest growing economies, affecting everyone from electronics shop owners to home buyers. That’s because such business owners and consumers depend on shadow banks, and those lenders themselves are now having trouble getting financing.
Such non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) have provided 30% of all new loans in the economy over the past three years, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. research.
Companies also have been coughing up more for money. The spread of top-rated 10-year corporate paper over similar government bonds has climbed to around 121 basis points, not far from levels last seen in 2009.
In spite of the market’s weakness, Rathi is still making big deals. He helped raise  ₹7,000 crore as the lead underwriter this month for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), the country’s biggest corporate issuer.
Rathi hails from the Marwari community in Rajasthan, a community that counts among its own other business notables including billionaires Kumar Mangalam Birla and Lakshmi Mittal. A chartered accountant, Rathi is a fan of the investment style of Howard Marks, the co-founder of Oaktree Capital Group.
“I’m a conservative risk taker,"" Rathi said. “I will not take undue risk, and tend to change my strategies as the need of the hour is.""
Rathi’s next aim is to place his bank among the top three arrangers for Indian corporate issuers selling foreign currency bonds—something which he hopes to achieve with his database of more than a thousand Indian companies. Axis Bank is already among the leaders in arranging so-called masala bonds, which are rupee notes sold to offshore investors.
“In fact, in Singapore, we are known as the masala bank,"" Rathi said."
131,2019-03-19,Axis Bank,"Cred founder Kunal Shah is looking to raise the funds at a valuation of $300 million, unprecedented for the four month-old startupThere is immense in-bound interest to invest in Cred even though the company recently raised money and is only four months old

Mumbai: FreeCharge co-founder Kunal Shah’s second venture, Cred, that incentivizes credit card payments with reward points, is in talks to raise $100 million in its next funding round, with massive inbound interest for second time founders who have a proven track record, said two people aware of the development.
Shah is looking to raise the funds at a valuation of $300 million, unprecedented for the four month-old startup, said one of the people cited above. Mint was not able to immediately ascertain the names of potential new investors.
Dreamplug Technologies Pvt. Ltd, which runs Cred, had previously raised about $25 million in June. “There is immense in-bound interest to invest in Cred even though the company recently raised money and is only four months old,"" said one of the people cited above, requesting anonymity.
Sequoia Capital, RPT Global, China’s Morningside Ventures and the personal office of Russian billionaire Yuri Milner were among those who invested in Cred’s seed fund raise last year.
Individuals with high credit scores can make credit card payments on Cred’s platform.
Timely payments will fetch rewards and offers and discounts for shopping, health services and other sites. The app will also discover hidden charges in credit cards and point them out to customers. Cred has partnered companies, including furniture rental platform Furlenco, travel booking site ixigo, healthcare startup Curefit, and holiday rental platform Airbnb to provide offers and discounts. The offers increase in value as customers use Cred more, Mint had reported on 27 November.
Shah’s first venture FreeCharge was acquired by online marketplace Snapdeal for $400 million in 2015, in one of India’s biggest consumer internet deals at the time. Just a couple of years later, Axis Bank acquired FreeCharge for  ₹385 crore ($60 million), as Snapdeal scurried to raise capital.
Kunal Shah declined to comment for this story.
Sequoia Capital did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Startups whose founders were previously successful with other ventures tend to find it easier to raise funds regardless of the business model, as investors trust the founders’ skills. One example is Mukesh Bansal and Ankit Nagori's Curefit, which has repeatedly raised large sums since launch.
“Because of Kunal’s track record, investors are quite confident that he’ll pull off something interesting with Cred, although they may not be quite sure on what the end game is,"" said an investor with one of India’s leading venture capital funds, on condition of anonymity. “So even if the valuation may be a little excessive, they still believe that the founder will make it big."""
130,2019-03-20,Axis Bank,"In the eighth episode of Brand Studio Live—a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more—seven brand custodians established that transparency and customer-centricity play an important role in fostering brand trust

A brand is simply trust, proclaimed Steve Jobs once.
The statement has gathered huge momentum today, when more and more consumers engage with brands on the internet. Although the internet has its own set of perks when it comes to reaching out to customers, it also raises a question mark on brand authenticity.
How, then, do brands go about gaining customers’ trust in the digital era?
The same was taken up for discussion at the eighth edition of HT Brand Studio Live—a series that gets the brains behind India’s top brands to decode marketing innovations and more.
This episode marked the Mumbai Chapter of Brand Studio Live, where the show was webcast from the iconic BSE instead of the HT newsroom.
Speaking at the session on Tuesday, Pankaj Gupta, chief marketing officer and head of strategic alliances, credit life, speciality sales and government business, HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “There are three trust elements that every brand needs—transparency, customer-centricity, and reliability.""
Trust is especially crucial in the financial services sector because of the monetary and emotional investments involved. According to the 2015 Edelman Trust Barometer, banking and financial services are the least trusted of industries, compared to technology, consumer electronics, or food/beverages.
“If people trust you with their savings of a lifetime, then your responsibility level automatically goes up several notches,"" said Asha Kharga, chief marketing officer at Axis Bank.
For Kharga, the “human quotient"" also plays an important role in gaining a customer’s trust. “Always humanize a brand. In the banking industry, the human touch is still important,"" the ace marketer said.
Shankar Jadhav, managing director, BSE Investments Ltd, highlighted how “timeliness"" also matters in the financial services sector.
“Trust is built in the financial services sector if you are prompt in letting people know of all developments,"" he said, while also outlining how BSE—which is the world’s fastest stock exchange—contributed towards the growth of the Indian economy.
Venkat Mallik, co-founder and chief strategy officer at Tidal7 Brand Digital, however, pointed out that brand relevance matters as much as brand trust in the digital era.
“A lot of brands have lost value not because people lost their trust in them, but because they have lost relevance,"" he said, adding that brand relevance begins with “making conversations with people that matter.""
In the same vein, Sharad Mathur, head (sales and distribution) at SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd, said: “Today, customers are well-informed and intelligent; they expect as well as cherish interactions with a brand. They leave queries for companies online, and expect them to be answered immediately.""
Discussing how trust is built in the mutual funds space, Balaji Vaidyanathan, marketing director at Franklin Templeton Investments, said: “Trust is closely linked to transparency in the mutual funds space. In other words, customers must not be in the dark about where their money is being invested.""
The show ended with HT Digital Streams CEO Rajiv Bansal shedding light on how trust is fostered in the news industry. “Timeliness is of essence in the digital newsroom. You cannot build brand trust without it,"" he said. Bansal also emphasized that customer loyalty is a byproduct of brand trust.

129,2019-03-26,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank CEO Amitabh Chaudhry is making all the right noises on strategy, RoE target of 18% by FY22 now seems achievable Axis Bank shares have risen 20% so far this year, while stocks of larger rivals HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank have grown 9% each

Investors can’t stop piling up on the stock of Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third-largest private sector lender. Part of this is driven by the hope that the bank’s new CEO will narrow the gap with the top private sector lender, HDFC Bank Ltd.
Axis Bank’s stock has risen 20% so far this year, while HDFC Bank and second-ranked ICICI Bank Ltd haven’t managed to notch up more than 9% increase, each. Axis Bank’s new managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Amitabh Chaudhry, is making all the right noises on strategy, and analysts seem to have bought the idea that the bank’s return on equity target of 18% by 2021-22 is achievable. 
The bank’s management made a presentation to analysts last week, wherein Chaudhry outlined a cautious game plan, which was laced with enough aggression.
“I did not come here and appear for the interview to remain No. 3. Let me put it that way,"" Chaudhry told The Hindu Business Line newspaper. This reveals much about his aggression. But he is not willing to compromise on the quality of the assets either, which is a heartening sign.
Especially so, since the lender saw its worst year in FY18, which ended with a massive loss of  ₹2,188 core for the March 2018 quarter. This was a direct fallout of its past mistakes of taking on too much risk. Axis Bank has been on the mend ever since, consciously hacking off the dodgy BB-rated loans and bringing down the share of even loans rated BBB. Its slippages have been on the decline, and it has built a reasonable insurance against risk, with a provision coverage ratio of 75%.
Under the new leadership, the lender is clear that project financing is a strict no-no and new borrowers need to be strong, if not pristine, on credit quality. At the same time, the bank is firing on all cylinders to grab retail business as well as growth in working capital financing.
But falling risk tempers returns. Axis Bank is chasing good credit and more retail loans at a time when interest rates are poised to slip. Ergo, analysts are expecting margins to compress going forward.
Besides, a superior performance under the new leadership has already been factored in by the Axis Bank stock when Chaudhry took over in January. In fact, the recent surge in the stock price looks like an overkill. The stock trades at 2.5 times its estimated book value for FY20, more expensive than ICICI Bank’s 2.1 valuation. This is beginning to make some investors edgy.
Also, not all analysts believe that Axis Bank’s performance would improve markedly from previous quarters. Citing that the stock is priced to perfection, Centrum Broking Ltd said, “While we are optimistic that management will deliver on guidance for the long term, we remain circumspect about the near to mid-term outlook."""

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday stayed the two notices issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to debt-ridden Reliance Communications for cancellation of its spectrum licence for delay in payment.
A two-member bench headed by chairman justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya also stayed the DoT's letter dated 20 March 2019 to Axis Bank to encash the bank guarantee of  ₹2,000 crore given by the Anil Ambani group firm.
The appellate tribunal said the show cause notices to RCom and letter to Axis Bank by the government were against the order passed by it on 4 February, when it had granted protection against any asset sale without its permission.
""The show cause notices of 14 and 15 March and letter dated 20 March 2019 by DoT is against the direction passed by this tribunal,"" the NCLAT said.
The appellate tribunal also issued a notice to the DoT and directed to list the matter on April 8 along with the main case.
The NCLAT's direction came after the hearing of an application moved by RCom.
Earlier on 4 February, the tribunal had said that until further orders of the NCLAT or the Supreme Court, no one can sell, alienate, or create third-party rights over RCom's assets.

126,2019-03-29,Axis Bank,"Catholic Syrian Bank has hired Axis Capital Ltd to manage a listing that may involve a  ₹400 crore IPO, says CEO C.V.R. Rajendran RBI has told Catholic Syrian Bank, in which Fairfax holds 51% stake, that it should list its shares before 30 September

Mumbai: Canadian investor Prem Watsa’s Indian bank has started preparations for a stock market listing this year, its chief executive said. Catholic Syrian Bank Ltd, in which Watsa’s Fairfax India Holdings Corp. received approval to take a controlling stake, is gearing up for a listing that may involve a  ₹400 crore ($58 million) initial public offering (IPO), according to chief executive officer C.V.R. Rajendran.
Last year, Toronto-based Fairfax agreed to invest $168 million for a 51% stake in the bank, the first time the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed a foreign firm to take a majority interest in a local lender. At the same time, the RBI told privately held Catholic Syrian Bank that it should list its shares before 30 September this year, according to Fairfax India’s latest annual report.
Catholic Syrian Bank has hired Axis Capital Ltd to manage the listing, and is debating exactly which route to market it will take, Rajendran said in a recent interview. He said he’s seeking approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for a direct listing—where all existing shares become tradable without the need for an initial public offering. But if the bank doesn’t get the nod from Sebi, he will instead pursue an IPO that may involve the sale of both new and existing shares, Rajendran added.
The listing of Catholic Syrian will attract many investors, said A. K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital Market Services Ltd.
“Fairfax investment would have changed a lot of things at the bank, from the way it works to the way it reports.""
Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd owns assets around the world, with Watsa particularly enthused by opportunities in India. Since August 2015 he has invested about $1.6 billion in Indian assets, from chemicals manufacturers to financial services providers, according to the Fairfax annual report."
125,2019-04-03,Axis Bank,"More than 200 institutions are using the blockchain technology built by Ripple to transact dailyBlockchain has advantages because it is open source, decentralized, reliable and trusted

We want to move money around the world like information moves today. We should be able to send money the way we are able to send emails and WhatsApp messages. When I say money, I mean legal money which is fully authenticated, regulated and controlled,"" Navin Gupta, managing director of South Asia and the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) region for Ripple, a provider of leading enterprise blockchain solutions for payments, said at the Mint Digital Innovation Summit held in Bengaluru on 15 March. He was speaking on “Understanding Blockchain’s Impact on Payments"".
It is estimated that today the world sends more than $155 trillion across borders. Yet, the underlying infrastructure is dated and flawed. This is where Ripple with its blockchain technology connects banks, payment providers and digital asset exchanges to provide a seamless experience to send money globally. More than 200 institutions are using the blockchain technology built by Ripple to transact daily, Gupta claims. “In India, banks like Axis and Yes Bank are using our technology to process their customers’ payments anywhere in the world. We live in 40 corridors and 6 continents, besides having offices in 8 countries,"" said Gupta.
Blockchain has advantages because it is open source, decentralized, reliable and trusted, Gupta said. The cost of transaction is consistent—there is no fee or timing loss and it is scalable. There are no physical assets and enterprises that leverage Ripple’s digital asset XRP (cryptocurrency used by the Ripple payment network) when sending payments on behalf of customers. Using XRP for liquidity when sending a cross-border payment helps financial institutions avoid the hassle of pre-funding accounts in destination currencies. It allows them to make faster, lower cost payments than they can through the traditional correspondent banking system. Banks can now help global companies send on-demand payments around the world without fail. There is an opportunity to “secure a greater share of cross-border payments volume"", said Gupta.
Ripple also helps bank customers send money to people in many emerging markets including Mexico, India, and Thailand to increase their share of “this large and growing market"". What’s next? “Ripple is moving beyond blockchain, and connecting networks so that we can move money across networks. Again this is open-source and lightweight so it becomes easy to transfer money across networks. So we are building the ecosystem for networks to connect with each other and in our view globalization will be completed when data, goods and money flow seamlessly. That’s the way we think of it as an internet of value when the whole world gets connected through payment systems,"" Gupta said."
124,2019-04-17,Axis Bank,"Banking stocks led the rally, with the Nifty Bank index rising 1.5%ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank surged 4% each while Axis Bank and HDFC were among the other top gainers

Benchmark stock market indices Sensex and Nifty today closed at record highs, led by gains in banking stocks and IT heavyweight TCS. The Sensex rose as much as 458 points intraday to 39,364, before ending at 39,275, up 369 points. Broader benchmark index Nifty, which hit a fresh high of 11,810 intraday, settled 0.90% higher at 11,787. Banking stocks led the gains with Nifty Bank index rising 1.5%. Earnings, investment flows and elections are likely to be the key drivers for Indian markets this truncated week. Indian markets would remain closed on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday. Voting for the second phase of Lok Sabha elections will take place on April 18. The global cues remained positive with Asian and European markets higher today.
Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets:
1) The earnings season got off to a good start with market heavyweight TCS reporting yet another quarter of strong results and the management expects continued strong growth in the new fiscal year starting April 1. TCS shares ended 1% higher, extending their Monday's 5% gain.
2) ICICI Bank surged 4% on reports that Goldman Sachs has raised its target price to  ₹492, from  ₹451. IndusInd Bank (4%), Axis Bank (1.6%), and HDFC Bank (0.80%) were among the other top gainers in the banking pack.
3) Infosys shares continued to drag after its margin and growth guidance disappointed the Street. Infosys shares ended 0.40% lower, after falling nearly 3% on Monday.
4) Wipro shares ended 2.3% lower ahead of its earnings announcement later in the day. RIL and HDFC Bank are also set to report quarterly numbers later this week.
5) Polycab India made a blockbuster debut today on bourses, with shares listing at 20% premium. Shares of Polycab India Ltd was listed on the stock exchanges at  ₹644.45, up 19.8% from its issue price of  ₹538 per share on Monday. The IPO had got a massive response, with subscription of over 50 times.
6) Elsewhere, SpiceJet shares extended gains to the fourth day as investors bet that the airline will be able to increase capacity amid Jet Airways's financial woes. SpiceJet shares rose 11% today. Jet Airways shares fell 7% after reports, citing sources, said that the management of airline has proposed to suspend all operations of the debt-laden airline at its board meeting today.
7) ""Indian markets had a dream run over the last few weeks on the back of dovish and accommodative global central banks and unprecedented foreign flows. The sentiment got a fillip once the Meteorological Department forecast near normal south-west monsoon,"" said Devang Mehta, head of equity advisory at Centrum Wealth Management.
8) ""The Street is also anticipating further rate cuts to reverse the economic slowdown and sensing a return of consumption demand, post the election results. The banks continue to have a lion’s share in the ongoing rally and the onus to lead the earnings for Nifty will lie with the corporate banks,"" Mehta said. ""With two good primary market listings (Metropolis Healthcare and Polycab India) in two days and upbeat mood, all eyes are now set on the ongoing fourth quarter earnings season.""
9) Expectations are rising that the RBI could deliver yet another rate cut in June to boost the economy. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at a measly 0.1% in February. Consumer inflation rose at a faster pace than anticipated in March, but remained below the central bank's target for an eighth straight month, increasing the chances for a key interest rate cut in June.
10) Crude oil price remains a key risk for Indian markets as any substantial movement beyond $70 per barrel is not conducive for the Indian economy, analysts say. Brent crude prices are hovering near five-month high of around $71 a barrel."

March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this week. In the global markets too, earnings will be key for equities. This week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by US companies.
In the US, big companies like Facebook, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft will report earnings this week. Among key Indian companies to declare March quarter earnings this week are Maruti Suzuki, Yes Bank, Hero Motocorp, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Bharti Infratel ACC, SBI Life, HDFC Life.
During this week, the markets are expected to consolidate and then turn volatile due to expiry of April series Futures and Options.
“The near term trend of Nifty is range bound and one may expect this high low range of 11,750-11,550 levels to continue for the next curtailed week. Further upside from here could encounter a resistance at 11,710-11,750 levels in the next week. The expected range or consolidation movement is unlikely to damage the near term uptrend status of the market, ""Nagaraj Shetti Technical Research Analyst HDFC securities.
On Monday, HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries stocks will be in focus after posting their quarterly earnings.
Net profit of Reliance Industries rose 9.79% to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March while revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion in the same period. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.
HDFC Bank Ltd reported a record Q4 net profit of  ₹5885 crore up 22.6% meeting market expectations as the country's biggest lender by market value raked in higher interest and fee income. Asset quality improved slightly, with gross bad loans as a percentage of the total at 1.36 % by the end of March, compared with 1.38 % in the previous quarter and 1.30 % in the same period last year."

After three days of fall, Indian markets surged nearly 1.3% as earnings optimism outweighed concerns over elevated oil prices. The benchmark BSE Sensex rose 1.27% to close at 39,054 while the broader NSE Nifty 50 Index rose 1.3% to end at 11,726.

Brent crude prices fell marginally today as an industry report signaling a gain in U.S. crude inventories partly offset concerns over America’s campaign to halt Iranian exports. Oil was trading at $74.44 barrel, down 0.1% from its previous close.
BSE oil & gas index surged 2.3%, powered by strong gains from oil marketing companies and market heavyweight RIL. Hindustan Petroleum Corp rose 5.7%, Bharat Petroleum Corp gained 3.6% while Indian Oil Corp gained 2.8%. Market heavyweight RIL rose nearly 2%. 
According to Abhishek Gupta, economist at Bloomberg, the rebound in crude oil prices won’t pack enough inflationary punch to deter India’s central bank from cutting interest rates another notch. 
""Sluggish consumer price inflation - which undershot the Reserve Bank of India’s 4% target for eight straight months through March - has given the RBI room to ease policy to support a recovery in growth,"" said Gupta.
""We expect the RBI to cut rates by another 25 basis points at its June review, adding to the 50 bps of easing since February. Whether that marks the end of the easing cycle is likely to be determined over the next few months as more clarity emerges on monsoons, oil prices, and the fiscal stance of the new government to be elected on May 23"" Gupta added.
Axis Bank closed flat ahead of its March quarter earnings on Thursday. According to a poll of 24 Bloomberg analysts, the bank is expected to post a profit of  ₹1,636.70 crore.

MUMBAI :
Private sector lender Axis Bank on Thursday reported a net profit of  ₹1,505 crore in the March quarter of FY19, as against a loss of  ₹2,188.7 crore in the same period last year.
The rise in profit was aided by a fall in total provisions, which more than halved on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis to  ₹2,711.4 crore in Q4 Fy19.
Its profit was lower than  ₹1,636.7 crore estimated by a Bloomberg poll of 24 analysts. The net interest income (NII) -- difference between interest earned and interest expended -- increased 21% y-o-y to  ₹5,706 crore and its domestic net interest margin (NIM) – a key measure of profitability – stood at 3.61%, up 2 basis points (bps) y-o-y and down 5 bps sequentially. Axis Bank’s other income, which includes core fee income, rose 26% y-o-y to  ₹3,526.28 crore in the three months to March 2019.
The bank’s gross non-performing assets (NPAs) ratio –bad loans as a percentage of gross advances -- were at 5.26% in Q4 FY19, down 151 bps y-o-y and down 49 bps sequentially.
Provisions during the quarter decreased 62.2% y-o-y to  ₹2,711 crore. In the December quarter of FY19, the bank had set aside  ₹3,054.51 crore as provisions. Post-provisions, the net NPA ratio was at 2.06% in Q4, against 2.36% in the December quarter and 3.4% in the year-ago quarter.
Axis Bank said it had acquired some land parcels under debt swap transactions in earlier years, carrying value of  ₹2,140 crore as classified under non-banking assets acquired in satisfaction of claims. It added that following an advice from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to assign a 100% provisioning against these assets over four quarters starting 31 March, 2019, the bank has set aside  ₹535 crore by debiting the profit and loss (P&L) account in the current quarter. The balance of  ₹1,605 crore, Axis Bank said, has been provided by debiting its reserves.
The private lender also said that with effect from 31 March, 2019, it has adopted a more stringent policy of maintaining provision on corporate standard loans rated BB and below and all special mention account-2 (SMA-2) loans at rates that are higher than those prescribed by RBI.
Asked about the rate of the extra provisioning for these loans, Jairam Sridharan, group executive and chief financial officer, Axis Bank said, “As far as specific provisioning with respect to stressed sectors is concerned, we have not put that in the public domain.""
Sridharan added that the bank’s (SMA 2) loans - loans where repayment is overdue between 60-90 days -- is at considerably low levels. “Well below half a percent of our loans is SMA 2. That gives you an indication of what incipient stress is there and it is relatively low,"" he said.
The bank saw slippages of  ₹3,012 crore in Q4 FY19, down 81.7% y-o-y and down 19.5% sequentially. Corporate slippages stood at  ₹1,369 crore and the bank said that 72% of this originated from accounts rated BB and below. The bank’s BB and below book stood at  ₹7,467 crore, or 1.3% of its gross customer assets, and was down from the 7.3% peak seen earlier.
Axis Bank’s total advances grew 12.5% y-o-y to  ₹4.94 trillion as on 31 March 2019. While domestic loans grew 18% y-o-y, the overseas book shrunk by 29% y-o-y. Its retail loans grew 19% y-o-y to  ₹2.45 trillion and accounted for 50% of the net advances. The bank saw a corporate credit growth of 5%.
Sridharan explained that the bank is seeing fairly diversified interest from various industries in terms of corporate loans. “What we are not seeing at this point of time is strong, organic, new-project kind of demand. So if the question is, are you seeing strong investment demand come back? The answer is probably no,"" he explained.
On Thursday, shares of the bank fell 1.08% to close at  ₹744.45 on the BSE."
118,2019-04-25,Axis Bank,"For the lender, the share of riskier unsecured loans in the retail book is growingThe bank has a new leadership and an unshackled balance sheet ready to grow

Private lender Axis Bank has fixed its big bad loan problems that had dragged it down to a loss making lender a year back.
Its gross bad loan ratio has dropped to 5.26% in March quarter from the peak of 6.77% a year ago. The share of loans rated ‘BB’ and below in the lender’s overall corporate loan book has reduced to just 1.3%, from 7.3% a year back.
But the share of the non-corporate book in fresh slippages is rising and more than 45% of slippages are outside of corporate loans. The management said that most of the slippages are from loans to agriculture and small and medium enterprises (SME).
Concerns over the stress among small borrowers had been raised by the regulator a year ago. A report by TransUnion and SIDBI on such borrowers showed that bad loan ratios are highest among SME borrowers.
For the lender, the share of riskier unsecured loans in the retail book is growing. Besides, the share of safe mortgage loans has dropped.
To be sure, retail bad loan ratios have been ultra low for the lender and for the industry as a whole. In its post earnings call with the media, the management didn’t indicate any worry on its retail portfolio. “Overall performance of the retail portfolio continues to be very strong,"" said Jairam Sridharan, chief financial officer of the bank.
For the bank now, it is imperative to monitor its non-corporate book and Sridharan said that the lender intends to have a close eye on the portfolio.
Meanwhile, the bank has shown investors in each of last four quarters that incremental corporate loans are going to strong borrowers with better credit ratings.
The bank has upped the ante on insurance against risk too. Its provisions towards bad loans has risen every quarter and the coverage ratio has reached 77% in the fourth quarter. The lender has chosen to make higher provisions over and above regulatory requirement against standard assets too.
In a nutshell, Axis Bank has not only fixed its bruised corporate loan book but it has build a provision moat that protects it from potential risk.
Investors have already rewarded the lender for all the work it did on its asset quality. The stock has gained an impressive 18% this year so far.
The bank has a new leadership and an unshackled balance sheet ready to grow.
Ergo, the fast growth of 17% in its corporate loan book and 18% of overall domestic advances growth should add to delight."

Brent crude traded $73.05/bbl, down 1.75% from its previous close. Oil has climbed more than 40% this year amid output cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies and disruptions from Venezuela to Libya.

Of the 11 Nifty companies that have announced their fourth quarter results so far, nine have either met or exceeded analyst estimates. Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd are scheduled to announce results later today.
Investors await US GDP data due later Friday for potential confirmation that the US economy was outperforming its peers. US GDP probably expanded 2.3% quarter on quarter in the first quarter compared with a 2.2% expansion in the previous three months, according to a Bloomberg survey.
Back home, Tata Steel Ltd surged 6.7% to  ₹545 after the company reported better-than-expected consolidated net profit of  ₹2,430.92 crore for the March-ended quarter, on a revenue of  ₹41,186 crore.

It reported a profit of  ₹1,505 crore compared to a loss of  ₹2,189 crore a year ago.

116,2019-04-26,Axis Bank,"The tribunal posted the matter for further hearing on June 7The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) issued contempt notices

NEW DELHI :
The NCLT Friday issued contempt notices to the heads of Axis Bank and StandardC for allowing the former head of ILFS Financial Services Ramesh Chandra Bawa to withdraw money and access the lockers in breach of its orders, and directed them to reply in two weeks.
The tribunal posted the matter for further hearing on June 7.
The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) issued contempt notices to Axis Bank chief executive Amitabh Chaudhry, Standard Chartered Bank India chief executive Zarin Daruwala and Bawa after the corporate affairs ministry alleged that the banks facilitated Bawa to withdraw/transfer money from their accounts to his wife Ashakiran and daughter Akansha, apart from letting him access the lockers.
Ministry's counsel Sanjay Shorey, in a separate petition, also sought to implead Ashakiran and Akansha as they are the beneficiaries of these funds.
The ministry informed the tribunal that Bawa withdrew/ transferred  ₹1 crore and  ₹14 lakh from Axis Bank accounts in two instances which are in violation of the December 3, 2018 order of the tribunal which had frozen these accounts.
The counsel also said Bawa accessed his lockers with these bank four times since December 3.
Shorey also said Bawa withdrew money from ICICI Bank but is not impleading the bank it as it had happened on the same day.
On December 3, the ministry had mailed a petition to Bawa at 8 am but despite that he withdrew  ₹3 crore from his accounts from an ICICI Bank branch at 10 am, he said.
""But we are not including ICICI Bank in the petition as the hearing was still on when the money was withdrawn. But all the banks, including Axis Bank and StanC, were informed about the NCLT order on December 6 and still these two allowed Bawa to transfer the funds,"" Shorey explained.
The NCLT On December 3 2018, had restrained the former directors of IL&FS group from disposing of or creating any third-party rights on their properties.
Later, the NCLAT on January 16, 2019 had allowed them to withdraw up to  ₹2 lakh a month from any one of the bank accounts after intimating the tribunal.
A two-member NCLT bench of VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy Friday also accepted another plea from the governments to add Ashakiran and Akansha as respondents numbers 319 and 320 into the contempt petitions since they are the beneficiaries of the transferred money and which is allegedly siphoned off from the company.
Meanwhile, the tribunal also granted the relaxation to the resolution professional's plea seeking on exemption in appointing independent and women directors to the listed entities of the IF&FS group which is mandatory under section 149 of Company's Act of 2013."

113,2019-05-02,Axis Bank,"Out of the entire pool of government bonds, MFs owned 0.64% in December 2018, down from 1.41% three months agoR. Sivakumar of Axis Mutual Fund said the switch to SDLs may also indicate the flow of funds favouring it

Mumbai: A few months after the liquidity crisis erupted in September, mutual funds switched a chunk of their sovereign bond holdings from central government securities to state development loans (SDLs), showed data from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
According to the data, mutual funds held  ₹36,851 crore worth government securities (G-Sec) in December 2018, against  ₹78,999 crore in September 2018, and  ₹70,241 crore in December 2017. Out of the entire pool of government bonds, MFs owned 0.64% in December 2018, down from 1.41% three months ago. This data is typically released with a lag of four months. The December data is the latest available so far.
Following a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) last year, mutual funds with exposure to debt papers of the company had to write off a chunk of their holdings. This, and the ensuing defaults by some non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), had led to the liquidity crisis.
Interestingly, in the same period, mutual funds bought SDLs issued by state governments. They increased their holding in SDLs to  ₹32,833 crore in December 2018, from  ₹26,951 crore in September 2018. Of the total base of SDLs, mutual funds had a share of 1.23% in December, against 1.05% in September.
States raise money from the market through SDLs, which are dated securities issued through auctions similar to those conducted for those issued by the central government. Interest on SDLs is paid every six months and the principal is repaid on the maturity date. SDLs are backed by the sovereign and acknowledge the government’s debt obligation.
According to a treasurer at a mid-sized public sector bank, G-sec yields dropped in the last quarter of 2018, and liquidated some of their holdings. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions. “The spread between the G-sec and SDLs is typically 50-100 basis points (bps), and while SDLs are not very liquid compared to G-secs, they have the same sovereign backing,"" the banker said, asking not to be identified.
The yield on the 10-year G-sec fell to 7.283% on 31 December, from 8.024% on 29 September.
R. Sivakumar, head-fixed income, Axis Mutual Fund said the switch to SDLs may also indicate the flow of funds favouring it.
The central bank’s holding of G-secs rose 205 bps between September and December 2018, as it conducted open market operations (OMO) to infuse liquidity. In December alone, the RBI had announced OMOs of  ₹50,000 crore.
Lakshmi Iyer, chief investment officer (debt) and head (products), Kotak AMC, attributed the uncertainty on the fiscal front to mutual funds reducing exposure to government securities. “Given that there is a question mark over the pace and quantum of OMOs, one is not sure of the demand levers. Besides, the FPI continues to be net negative sales in debt.""
Iyer added that until clarity emerges on the fiscal front, this situation may continue. “The market also needs clarity on the political outcome, which is a month away. Hence, near-term uncertainty may not abate anytime soon.""
Others said that if inflation measured on the consumer price index (CPI) pans out as per the RBI’s projections, room for further easing of monetary policy and liquidity should open up.
Murthy Nagarajan, head, fixed income, Tata Mutual Fund, said that supply of state government papers is the highest in the third and fourth quarter of the financial year.
“The supply tapers off in the first and second quarter of the financial year. The spread between government securities and state government papers tends to widen in the third and fourth quarter, and comes down when supply reduces in the first and second quarter,"" said Nagarajan.
Meanwhile, the central bank announced on Tuesday that it will inject  ₹25,000-crore liquidity through open market operations (OMOs) in May. The RBI also conducted its second successful dollar swap auction of $5 billion, receiving bids worth $18.65 billion, or more than three times what was on offer, besides injecting  ₹34,874 crore liquidity into the system.
To be sure, debt mutual funds witnessed outflows last December. Data from industry body, Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), showed that there was a net outflow of  ₹3,387.5 crore in debt mutual funds in December 2018, while there was a net inflow of  ₹12,939.70 crore in March."

Mumbai: SBI Card raised  ₹700 crore from several financial institutions including its parent State Bank of India (SBI) in the second half of FY19 as it aims to grow above the industry average.
SBI Cards and Payment Services Pvt. Ltd (SBI Card) raised  ₹100 crore from ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd,  ₹250 crore from State Bank of India and  ₹50 crore each from Canara Bank and Axis Bank by issuing non-convertible debentures (NCDs) at 9.15% coupon, documents available with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) seen by Mint showed. The company also raised another  ₹250 crore from Axis Bank through a coupon of 9.55%.
Hardayal Prasad, MD & CEO, SBI Card said in an emailed response that the company will leverage the strong customer base of SBI for customer acquisition. “Now, we are also tapping the vast SBI customer base through Project Shikhar under which we are offering pre-approved cards to eligible SBI customers. We believe that this will significantly drive new card acquisition,"" said Prasad. According to the latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, as on February 2019, HDFC Bank was the market leader in terms of the number of outstanding credit cards at 12.48 million.
SBI Card is over 4 million cards behind the private sector lender at 7.9 million outstanding credit cards in the same period. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have 6.4 million and 5.7 million cards, respectively. While HDFC Bank’s market share is at 27.1%, SBI Card has a market share of 17.3%.
“We have been able to maintain a sharp focus on our business that has resulted in increased acquisition rate of over 2.5- 3 lakh cards per month currently from 1 lakh cards per month in December 2016,"" said Prasad.
The  ₹700-crore fundraise is part of SBI Card’s plan to raise  ₹1,500 crore in a few tranches.
Asked about the plan to raise the remaining  ₹800 crore, he declined to give specifics and said the company “may raise the remaining amount as per business requirement and suitable market conditions"".
SBI Card has also availed of a  ₹1,500 crore working capital line from Central Bank of India as part of its  ₹14,000-crore aggregate working capital limit. The rest is from SBI, the lead banker of the consortium of lenders to SBI Card, ( ₹11,000 crore) and Canara Bank ( ₹1,500 crore).
According to documents, the deed for this working capital facility was signed on 10 January 2019 after being sanctioned by Central Bank of India on 6 December 2018.
“SBI Card is witnessing a tremendous growth phase and we will continue to evaluate new partnerships to support our business growth plans to sustain this momentum,"" added Prasad.

Home-grown real estate funds are stepping up investments in residential projects, but are unable to address the huge funding gap as non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) continue to lag in financing real estate projects.
The demand for capital is significant, particularly in the housing sector, as home sales continue to be slow and external financing is needed for construction and to service debt.
The NBFC liquidity crisis has opened up a financing opportunity for alternative investment funds (AIF), privately pooled investment vehicles that are incorporated in India, which are actively investing and evaluating real estate deals.
As banks remained cautious, NBFCs and housing finance companies (HFCs) had taken over the reins of real estate financing in recent years, offering debt or loans at a lower cost and accounting for 50-60% of funding to developers.
AIFs had taken a step back as the funding scenario got competitive with NBFCs and HFCs ruling the show, until the Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) defaulted on repayments last October, which led to the liquidity stress.
“Opportunistically, the deal flow has increased for private equity funds, but they are only a part of the funding ecosystem and cannot fill the gap created by the absence of other major sources of financing. When there is serious shortage of liquidity, all kinds of developers want to raise money, but we are being very cautious and investing carefully,"" said Sharad Mittal, chief executive officer, Motilal Oswal Real Estate, the realty-focused private equity arm of financial services conglomerate Motilal Oswal.
A March report by CLSA had said that 15-20% of the debt ($60-70 billion) may be stressed because of high leverage of developers and weak sales, mostly in the under-construction housing segment.
The need for capital is across the developer spectrum, but unlike NBFCs, which made debt easily accessible for even smaller, mediocre builders, PE funds are more careful about where they put their money.
Amit Goenka, managing director and chief executive of Nisus Finance Services Co. Pvt. Ltd, said real estate funds are the last bastion of capital for developers. “Developers are okay with slightly expensive capital now and it’s getting us better deals, with better quality developers and projects.
Today, there is  ₹10,000-12,000 crore of PE money available for residential projects, but that’s a fairly small part of the kind of exposure NBFCs and HFCs have had, and it is impossible to match that,"" Goenka added.
While the top 15-20% developers can access bank debt and equity funding, there is a good 30-40% whom banks and funds won’t entertain.
“Funding is a challenge. With very little loan to value remaining in projects, we have to think multiple times before committing any capital. But with the slowdown and regulatory changes, we are finally adopting a bottoms up approach with a focus on mid-income housing,"" said Balaji Rao, managing partner-real estate, Axis AMC. Axis AMC signed its first deal, from its maiden fund, to invest  ₹60 crore in a township project of Chennai’s Akshaya Pvt. Ltd in May. After being on a long wait-and-watch mode, ASK Property Investment Advisors has invested close to  ₹670 crore this year, across projects of multiple developers. Amit Bhagat, CEO and MD, ASK Property Investment, said there were many refinancing and distress opportunities today.

104,2019-05-26,Axis Bank,"L&T acquired shares from the open market throughout the weekL&T mopped up about 32.25 lakh shares during the said week

New Delhi: Infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has raised its stake in IT firm Mindtree by about 2 per cent between May 20-24 by picking up shares worth over  ₹316 crore, according to regulatory data.
The development assumes significance as L&T has already acquired around 20 per cent stake in the mid-sized IT firm from V G Siddhartha and Cafe Coffee Day and is keen to increase its shareholding up to 66 per cent.
According to BSE data, L&T acquired shares from the open market throughout the week with the highest quantum of shares being purchased on May 24 when it picked up nearly 25 lakh shares of Mindtree at  ₹980 a piece.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the company spent over  ₹316 crore during the week for these transactions which took its overall shareholding to 28.45 per cent from 26.48 per cent at the start of the week.
In multiple tranches, L&T mopped up about 32.25 lakh shares during the said week. Shares of Mindtree ended flat at  ₹980 apiece on the BSE on Friday.
In March, L&T mounted a hostile takeover bid on Mindtree when it entered into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha's 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree and also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15 per cent of the company shares from the open market.
Subsequent to these deals, L&T was to also make an open offer to buy additional stake. In all, the infrastructure major is eyeing up to 66 per cent stake in Mindtree for around  ₹10,800 crore.
L&T's open offer - which was earlier slated to begin on May 14 - has been postponed as the engineering major is awaiting a nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
In a recent interview to PTI, L&T Group Chairman A M Naik had said the acquisition of Mindtree is the topmost agenda for the company at the moment.
""Right now, our mind is completely occupied on Mindtree and I hope, we will be able to eventually make this into a big company as well...We have got around 26 per cent stake in Mindtree and now, we will wait till we get 51 per cent,"" he had said adding that the offer would be launched in a fortnight's time.

103,2019-06-04,Axis Bank,"The rating action comes amid the challenges ICICI bank faces in its operating environment, Fitch Ratings said in a statementFitch said ICICI Bank's core capitalisation is higher than that of most other Indian banks but within the current operating environment poses only a moderate buffer against risks

New Delhi: Global ratings agency Fitch said Monday it has downgraded two leading private sector lenders ICICI Bank and Axis Bank as the banking sector of the country remains under stress.
Fitch said it took the rating action after lowering its midpoint for India's operating environment to 'bb ' from 'bbb-' following a review of the banking sector's performance, particularly in the last three years, the regulatory framework for the sector, and the outlook in the near term.
The performance of India's banking sector is expected to be below-average over the next one to two years despite high growth prospects, it said.
""Fitch Ratings has downgraded ICICI Bank Limited's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB ' from 'BBB-' and its Viability Rating to 'bb ' from 'bbb-'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable,"" it said.
The rating action comes amid the challenges the bank faces in its operating environment, Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
The rating agency has also affirmed ICICI's Support Rating at '3' and Support Rating Floor at 'BB '. BB rating indicates speculative grade while BBB points at good credit quality.
Fitch also downgraded the Long-Term IDR and Viability Rating of Axis Bank to 'BB ' and 'bb ', respectively, from 'BBB-' and 'bbb-'.
""We expect the performance of India's banking sector to be below average over the next one to two years despite our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects,"" it said.
Banks in India - which remain the biggest credit intermediaries in the country - are positioned to take advantage of this opportunity, provided their damaged balance sheets recover sustainably with the infusion of fresh equity that encourage them to support credit growth in a meaningful way, it added.
It also concluded the sector will perform below the average of its peers over the next one to two years in spite of our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects in India.
The performance of Indian banks should have largely bottomed out, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalisation, it said.
""We estimate that Indian banks' impaired-loan ratio declined to an average of 10.8 per cent by 9 months of 2019-20 from 11.5 per cent in the financial year ended March 2018 (FY18), which continues to be high by global standards,"" it said.
Capital buffers are assessed by Fitch as moderate, including for private-sector banks, especially in light of their high impaired-loan ratio, risk appetite and the challenging but competitive operating environment, it said.
Fitch further said ICICI Bank's core capitalisation is higher than that of most other Indian banks but within the current operating environment poses only a moderate buffer against risks.
That said, Fitch believes the bank has some capital fungibility through the sale of stakes in profitable subsidiaries and the repatriation of excess capital from foreign subsidiaries.
Its impaired-loan ratio is weaker than that of other large private banks and most banks with Viability Ratings in the 'bb' category, even though the measure has improved slightly to 7.5 per cent in 2019-20 from 10 per cent in the previous fiscal, it added.

Two major Indian lenders slumped in the bond market after their credit ratings were cut to junk by Fitch Ratings, in the latest sign of concerns about the nation’s banks that are battling the world’s worst bad-loan ratio.
Fitch lowered its long-term issuer default ratings on ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. to BB+ from BBB- late on Monday. Certain dollar bonds from ICICI slumped the most in more than a year, while ones from Axis Bank fell the most in over six months on Tuesday.
“We expect the performance of India’s banking sector to be below average over the next one to two years despite our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects,"" Fitch said in a statement Monday. “The sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalization.""
What happened
ICICI Bank’s 3.25% notes due 2022 fell 0.5 cent, the most in over a year, to 99.7 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Axis Bank’s 3.25% due 2020 dropped 0.2 cent, the most in over six months, to 100. Fitch said that the performance of Indian banks has largely bottomed out but the sector is still addressing poor asset quality and weak core capitalization. The rating company said that ICICI’s key financial indicators are generally weaker than those of banks rated higher. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have investment-grade ratings from other credit assessors.
Analysis
Nomura sees Fitch’s move as “harsh and backward-looking"" as the rating’s company has cut the scores at a time when both these banks have reported a decline in gross non-performing assets in their FY19 financial results. “We agree that the operating environment for Indian banks will remain challenging, notwithstanding the recent positive election outcome which saw PM Narendra Modi return to power with an increased majority, which along with relatively rich valuations, is why we continue to advocate an Underweight positioning in Indian banks’ seniors,"" Nomura desk analyst Nicholas Yap says in a note. A $190 billion pile of stressed debt along with eroding capital buffers is constraining lenders ability to navigate the “challenging but competitive operating environment,"" Fitch said.

101,2019-06-04,Axis Bank,"Fitch downgraded the long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to BB+ from BBB- for both banksThe one-notch downgrade of ICICI Bank, Fitch said, reflects its assessment of India’s operating environment

Mumbai: Fitch has downgraded the credit ratings of two private sector lenders— ICICI Bank and Axis Bank—to junk at a time when the banking sector is struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalization.
Reacting to the development, ICICI Bank lost 1.6% in intraday trading on Tuesday, ending the day lower by 0.92% at  ₹418.95 on the BSE. Axis Bank, on the other hand, lost 0.8% on an intraday basis but ended the day gaining 1.12% to close at  ₹821.40. The benchmark Sensex lost 0.46% to close at 40,083.54 points.
Fitch downgraded the long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to BB+ from BBB- for both banks. These downgrades follow Fitch lowering its midpoint for India’s operating environment to BB+ from BBB- after a review of the banking sector’s performance in the last three years, its regulatory framework, and the outlook in the near term.
An analyst who declined to be named said the rating downgrades, which cited a difficult operating environment in India, are strange because other banks operating in the same environment have not been downgraded.
Fitch said it “compared the operating environment in India, using key metrics such as gross domestic product per capita and the ease-of-doing-business ranking, with those of other sovereigns in Asia rated in the BBB category"".
The rating agency expects the performance of India’s banking sector to be below average over the next one to two years despite faster growth and improved business prospects. Banks in India can take advantage of this only if their damaged balance sheets recover sustainably with the infusion of fresh equity that encourage them to support credit growth, said Fitch.
The one-notch downgrade of ICICI Bank, Fitch said, reflects its assessment of India’s operating environment and its belief that several of ICICI Bank’s key financial indicators are generally weaker than those of banks rated higher by Fitch. It said the downgrade of Axis Bank’s viability rating reflects its relatively weak core capitalization and asset quality, which, despite some improvements in the near term, are not commensurate with Fitch’s expectations of higher rated entities.
Fitch believes the performance of Indian banks has largely bottomed out, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalization. It said Indian banks’ impaired loan ratio fell to 10.8% at end-December 2018 from 11.5% on 31 March 2018, which continues to be high by global standards.
“Capital buffers are still assessed by Fitch as moderate, including for private-sector banks, especially in light of their high impaired loan ratios, high risk appetite and the challenging but competitive operating environment,"" it said.
Bad debts seem to have eased for public sector banks and also somewhat for private lenders in FY19. Mint reported on 4 June that aggregate bad loans of state-run banks declined 12% to  ₹7.17 trillion in the year ended 31 March.
For private sector banks, the reduction in gross bad loans was 1.3% during the same period."
99,2019-06-05,Axis Bank,"Top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and others offer fixed deposits (FDs) starting from 6 months up to above 5 yearsRemember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures.

100,2019-06-06,Axis Bank,"Fitch’s argument is that there seems to be no resolution in sight for assets stuck in insolvency proceedingsThe problem for the lenders arising out of these downgrades is that cost of borrowing overseas goes up

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd both found their ratings for foreign issuances downgraded to so-called junk or below investment grade earlier this week by Fitch Ratings.
Fitch’s reason: The operating environment doesn’t warrant a BBB- rating for these lenders. Both these lenders are now rated lower at BB+.
The problem for the lenders, arising out of these downgrades, is that their cost of overseas borrowings go up. Indeed, Bloomberg shows that the yield on both ICICI Bank’s and Axis Bank’s dollar bonds rose in international trade after the downgrades. But the rise was marginal largely because Fitch’s reasons for the downgrade have already been largely factored in by the markets.
Fitch Ratings’ argument is that there seems to be no resolution in sight for assets stuck in insolvency proceedings and of bad loans outside courts. Considering the slowing of the Indian economy, resolution for banks is going to be tricky.
This means that further additions to bad loans cannot be ruled out, which in turn has implications for capital adequacy and profitability.
“Indian banks are looking at a tough year ahead as resolution is slow. These are known facts, but FY19 has been a good year for some of them. A downgrade now sends a wrong signal,"" said an analyst from a global brokerage firm, requesting anonymity.
To be sure, analysts believe that the timing of the rating agency’s move is unfair as the lenders reported an improvement in their metrics in FY19.
Both ICICI Bank and Axis Bank reported notable improvement in asset quality compared with their peers. Kotak Institutional Equities in a note pointed out that overall stressed assets dropped 150 basis points sequentially to 11% for ICICI Bank and the fall for Axis Bank was 80 basis points to 9%. A basis point is 0.01%
That said, Fitch Ratings’ downgrade is a wake-up call for Indian policymakers and lenders.
Foreign capital is impatient and to keep attracting it, it is not just necessary to fix the banking sector, but to fix it quickly.
For that to happen, insolvency resolutions should pick up pace and recoveries should increase. Most large corporate lenders have shown encouraging signs in recoveries, but their write-offs too are high. In other words, lenders are simply writing off loans after providing for them through capital, instead of getting their money back from errant borrowers.
As for rating agencies, analysts believe that Fitch’s move may not hurt private sector lenders, but if other rating agencies follow suit, banks would find themselves in a bind for raising capital. Axis Bank has already issued $3.5 billion worth of medium-term notes, while ICICI Bank has raised $3.7 billion through such notes over the last four years."

97,2019-06-08,Axis Bank,"The Income Tax department has revised Form 15H to incorporate changes made in the interim budgetThe old Form 15H did not took into account the maximum allowable rebate of  ₹12,500

The income tax department has issued a revised Form 15H, using which senior citizens with taxable income of up to  ₹5 lakh can claim TDS exemption on interest from deposits.
As announced in this year's interim budget by the then finance minister Piyush Goyal, individuals with annual taxable income of up to  ₹5 lakh will get full tax rebate. In the last financial year, the limit for seeking tax deducted at source (TDS) exemption was  ₹2.5 lakh.
The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has recently issued a notification amending Form 15H according to the budget announcement.
The finance ministry has now amended Section 87A of the Income Tax Act under which a resident individual, having total income of up to  ₹5 lakh, shall be entitled to a rebate of an amount being the amount of tax chargeable or  ₹12,500, whichever is less.
The amendments by the CBDT states that banks and financial institutions would accept Form 15H from assessees whose tax liability is 'nil' after considering rebate available under Section 87A of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The old Form 15H did not took into account the maximum allowable rebate of  ₹12,500.
The revised Form 15H can now be submitted in banks and post offices to claim exemption from TDS on interest income on deposits. Senior citizens, above 60 years of age, have to submit Form 15H to banks at the beginning of a financial year to ensure that no tax is deducted at source on interest income.
Nangia Advisors (Andersen Global) Executive Director Neha Malhotra told PTI that had this change not been brought, taxpayers earning income up to  ₹5 lakh would have suffered TDS on interest from banks and would have had to file a tax return to claim refund of such TDS.
""This change not only saves the taxpayer from the hassle of filing ITR to claim refund but also reduces the administrative burden of CPC (central processing centre) to process such returns and issue refunds,"" Malhotra said."

Mumbai: Debt-ridden Essel group is looking to sell a minority stake in broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) to a financial investor by the end of July to meet immediate payment obligations, said two people directly aware of the matter.
This will be in addition to its ongoing efforts to find a strategic buyer, as well as sell some of the group’s infrastructure assets, the people said on condition of anonymity.
Subhash Chandra-led Essel group has been in talks with potential buyers, mainly strategic investors, to sell the promoters’ stake in ZEEL since it was announced in November. The sale of a minority stake in ZEEL to a financial investor will take care of the immediate debt owed to mutual funds and banks.
“Overall, Zee is looking to sell up to 50% in the business, which could be to a strategic or a financial investor or both,"" one of the two people cited earlier said. “The months of August and September will be devoted to getting regulatory clearances, so July is a sacrosanct deadline. The sale of non-media assets (primarily infrastructure) will be announced as early as this month.""
Essel group owes mutual funds (MFs) over  ₹7,000 crore. The MFs had invested in papers issued by Essel group firms, which were backed by shares pledged by the promoters. The fund houses had agreed to refrain from selling the pledged shares to recover dues till September-end. The total debt on the books of Essel as of December is  ₹16,237 crore, whereas the promoter debt is  ₹13,000 crore.
A ZEEL spokesperson said: “The process of ZEEL’s stake sale is at an advanced stage. The group has already received two non-binding term sheets. The stake sale process is well within the purview of the September 2019 deadline. Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements.""
In a related development, fund houses appointed P.J. Nayak, former chairman and CEO of Axis Bank, as a mediator for talks with Essel group.
Nayak’s appointment, the people cited earlier said, is an effort towards ensuring that there is seamless transmission of information from Essel group to its 11 lenders. “Nayak will oversee repayments to lenders on the basis of their claims as soon as the asset sale concludes,"" said the second of the two people cited earlier.
Essel group recently sold two transmission assets owned by Essel Infraprojects Ltd—Darbhanga-Motihari Transmission Co. Ltd and NRSS XXXI (B) Transmission Ltd—to a fund managed by Edelweiss.

Private sector lender Axis Bank has revised fixed deposit (FD) interest rates on select maturities with effect from 15 June 2019. Axis Bank has lowered the FD interest rates applicable on the maturity periods of two years to less than three years, according to the bank's website, axisbank.com. The bank is offering an interest rate of 7.3% now. Previously, the bank paid an interest rate of 7.5% to general public on fixed deposits below  ₹2 crore for maturity periods between 2 years to less than 3 years. This comes after SBI and ICICI Bank cut its deposit rates in select buckets. The move by lenders including ICICI Bank and Axis Bank come within days of a rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) earlier this month.
Axis Bank is offering an interest rate of 6.25% on FDs with maturity between 7 days and 6 months, 6.75% for FDs maturing between 6 and 9 months and 7.1% for between 9 months and 1 year. Axis Bank is offering 7.3% for fixed deposits maturing in one and two years.

Mumbai: Indian stock markets may gain on Thursday but most investors are cautious due to corporate earnings for June quarter. Analysts feel that companies performance in April-June is likely to be soft across sectors.
Among global markets, Asian stocks gained and the dollar dropped on Thursday after Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell reinforced prospects of a US interest rate cut later this month.
In an appearance before his congressional overseers on Wednesday, Powell confirmed that the US economy is still under threat from disappointing factory activity, tame inflation and a simmering trade war. Powell said the central bank stands ready to “act as appropriate"".
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8%, while Japan’s Nikkei added 0.4%. The Shanghai Composite Index advanced 0.8%, South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 1% and Australian stocks edged up 0.3%.
The US stocks ended higher on Wednesday and the S&P 500 briefly crossed the 3,000-point mark for the first time following Powell’s remarks.
A strong June US jobs report released earlier this month had curbed market expectations that the Fed could lower rates by 50 basis points (bps), and the markets had viewed a 25 bps cut as a more likely option. But the Fed chair’s cautious stance on the world’s largest economy helped revive some bets on heftier easing at its next policy meeting on July 30-31.
Minutes from the Fed’ last meeting in mid-June, however, showed some policymakers felt there was not yet a strong case for easing.
In the domestic market, as the IndiGo saga continues, shares of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd may stay in focus. The government will now scrutinize a disputed shareholder pact between Rakesh Gangwal and Rahul Bhatia, the founders of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd that runs India’s largest airline IndiGo, even as it will let the markets regulator look into Gangwal’s allegations of governance failure in the company.
Private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd has appointed investment banks Citigroup, JPMorgan and its investment banking arm Axis Capital to help it raise up to $1.3 billion through a share sale, according to a Mint report.
Meanwhile, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood little changed at 97.001 after falling 0.4% overnight, when it pulled back from a three-week peak of 97.588 in the wake of Powell’s comments.
The greenback was down 0.35% at 108.080 yen, forced off a six-week high of 108.990 scaled the previous day. The euro nudged up 0.1% to $1.1263 after gaining 0.4% on Wednesday. The Australian dollar was steady at $0.6962 following an overnight rise of 0.5% against the broadly weaker dollar. The surge helped the Aussie pull away from a 2.5-week trough of $0.6910.
The 10-year US Treasury yield was at 2.038% after dropping on Wednesday from a three-week high of 2.113% following the Fed chair’s congressional testimony.
In commodities, US crude oil futures extended the previous day’s large gains to touch $60.67 per barrel, their highest since 23 May. The contract had surged 4.5% on Wednesday after U.S. crude inventories shrank and as major producers cut nearly a third of offshore Gulf of Mexico production ahead of an expected storm. Brent crude brushed a six-week high of $67.15 per barrel and last traded at $66.91.

87,2019-07-12,Axis Bank,"Of DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt,  ₹38,000 crore has been raised from banks. The rest was raised by selling debt securitiesDHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July

Mumbai: Lenders to Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) are planning to ask the company’s 86,000 non-convertible debenture holders to be part of the inter-creditor agreement to pre-empt likely litigation over dues, three bankers aware of the matter said.
Seven state-run lenders to DHFL, including State Bank of India and Union Bank of India, met 300 institutional bondholders comprising mutual funds, provident funds and pension funds on Thursday to explore options of working together to restructure DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt. DHFL’s chairman Kapil Wadhawan was also part of the meeting.
“We are looking at restructuring the company as a going concern. Lenders will work with NCD holders, shoulder-to-shoulder, to realize the maximum value,"" said a senior banker, one of the three cited above, on the condition of anonymity. “It’s not mandatory on the part of NCD holders to sign the ICA.""
Of DHFL’s total  ₹1 trillion debt as of February,  ₹38,000 crore has been borrowed from banks. The remaining amount was raised by selling debt securities. On 5 July, close to 30 banks signed the ICA to restructure the debt of the home financier.
The decision to include these investors as part of ICA is mainly to prevent NCD holders from moving the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover outstanding dues, stalling the restructuring process. Currently, financial institutions cannot be referred to the National Company’s Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings.
The Indian Banks’ Association, on behalf of lenders, has already written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to permit investors to participate in the ICA. Under the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines on resolution of stressed assets released on 7 June, only banks and non-banking financial companies are allowed to be part of the ICA.
However, in the case of DHFL, as the number of debenture holders is large, lenders say that the debenture trustees can seek permission from these holders before signing the ICA. This involves going through a voting process and giving the holders 21 days’ time to exercise their vote.
Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd and IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd act as the debenture trustees for the NCDs issued by the housing company.
“This is the first time that NCD holders could be part of a restructuring process. There are not too many cases where such a large portion of debt is being held by NCD holders,"" said the second banker, also requesting anonymity. “DRT is equipped to handle these cases. Hence it’s necessary that it goes through restructuring,"" he added.
Meanwhile, DHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July.
The restructuring plan, which is being prepared under RBI’s 7 June circular, could include extension of the tenure of loans, conversion of debt into equity, infusion of fresh working capital and induction of a new management team and financial investors.
Currently, DHFL is a “special mention account-zero"", indicating an asset where interest and principal is not overdue for more than 30 days and the account exhibits signs of incipient stress. Lenders have to ensure the restructuring is completed by end-September in order to avoid the account being classified as non-performing.
Under RBI’s new framework, lenders have 30 days to decide on a resolution plan. The decision of lenders who constitute 75% by value of total outstanding facilities (fund-based as well non-fund based) and 60% by number shall be binding on all other lenders.
DHFL’s consortium of lenders also includes Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. SBI has the largest exposure of around  ₹10,000 crore.
Over the past few months, DHFL has sold retail loans worth ₹30,000 crore. It has also sold several of its strategic assets, including affordable housing arm Aadhar Housing Finance Ltd, educational loan business Avanse and DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers. In January, DHFL sold wholesale loans worth  ₹1,375 crore to alternative investment management fund Oaktree Capital, which buys distressed loan portfolios at a discount."

MUMBAI :
Better safe than sorry has never been more relevant to Indian banks.
The first quarter results of Indian banks would kickstart today with IndusInd Bank announcing its numbers later in the day.
While investors will monitor several parameters to determine which banks are safer and which would be sorry, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) is expected to be a deciding factor.
After all, insurance against risks is the best way to ensure future profits.
In its financial stability report, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted that there is a wide disparity between banks with regards to PCR. “PSBs, in particular, showed a range of 42% to 74% in PCRs,"" the report said.
Analysts believe that banks having superior PCR would be better placed to tide over any future stress and therefore are more likely to show improved profitability for the June quarter.
Kotak Securities noted that private banks mainly into corporate lending such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will benefit given their superior provision levels.
For the March quarter, ICICI Bank’s PCR was 80.7% while that of Axis Bank was 77%.
“We believe large banks with a strong liability franchise and higher provision coverage are well-placed vis-à-vis others, and therefore should attract premium valuations,"" said analysts at Reliance Securities in a recent note.
Lenders that start with a high level of PCR may not need to make large incremental provisions towards stressed assets.
RBI’s report noted that public sector banks have seen the sharpest improvement in PCR. On aggregate level, public sector lenders saw their PCR rise to 60.6% in March from 48.3% a year ago. The PCR for private banks was lower at 57%.
As for provisions, analysts believe that lenders are likely to increase provisions to beef up the PCR and deal with the fresh stress seen in Q1."

Mumbai: Indian stock markets may be sluggish on Tuesday weighed down by widespread weak sentiment.
Meanwhile, Asian stocks edged higher in early deals on Tuesday as investors prepared for an expected US interest rate cut this week, while heightened concern in currency markets about a no-deal Brexit sent the pound to a 28-month low.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.15%. South Korea's KOSPI advanced 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei added 0.7%. Australian stocks climbed as much as 0.7% to touch a record high, supported by buoyant mining shares and adding to previous day's tech-driven gains.
The US Federal Reserve begins its two-day policy review meeting later on Tuesday, at which it is widely expected to lower interest rates by 25 basis points. If implemented, it would be the central bank’s first rate cut in a decade.

77,2019-07-30,Axis Bank,"In the June quarter of FY19, the bank reported 46.30% y-o-y decline in net profitAnalysts expect loan growth of 13% y-o-y with greater focus on retail

Mumbai: Private-sector lender Axis Bank is expected to report a net profit of  ₹1,855 crore for the June quarter of FY20 compared with a net profit of  ₹701.09 crore in the year-ago period, according to a consensus estimate of 23 analysts polled by Bloomberg.
In April-June last fiscal, the bank’s net profit had slumped 46.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) due to higher provisions and lower other income.
Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect loan growth of 13% y-o-y with greater focus on retail, and net interest margin (NIM) at 3.5%. The brokerage said Axis Bank is likely to post fresh slippages of  ₹2,500 crore (2% of its loans) mostly from below investment grade book and expects more traction on recovery as well from the write-off pool., with no major concerns on asset quality.
Stock broking firm Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report that Axis Bank’s Q1 FY20 net interest income (NII) – the difference between interest earned and expended – will be at  ₹5,924 crore, up 14.7% from the same period last year. Its pre-provisioning operating profit is likely to be at  ₹5,343 crore, up 6.6% on a year-on-year basis.
Meanwhile, Reliance Securities believes fee income of the bank will gain traction and its margins will remain stable in the June quarter. Moreover, increased focus on retail term deposits will limit its NIM expansion in the interim, it said."
75,2019-07-31,Axis Bank,"Perhaps Axis Bank is aware of this, which explains it ramping up provisions and lending to only top-rated borrowers to ward off future stressThis preference for safety is writ large over Axis Bank’s balance sheet

At a time when there is a broad-based economic slowdown, growth in lending is hard to come by.
In that scenario, Axis Bank Ltd’s swift turnaround to a robust core income growth, driven by 19% increase in domestic loans, should cheer investors.
The fact that this growth comes in tandem with a reduction in the private sector lender’s toxic loan pile is an added positive. Indeed, the management said the bank is not chasing extraordinary growth, but would rather lend to good borrowers, a message given by most other private sector lenders that have announced results so far.
This preference for safety is writ large over Axis Bank’s balance sheet. Loan growth is driven by retail; small businesses, especially the dealership network of the automobile sector, have been avoided. Another safety net is provisions, which rose 14% from a year ago, despite the toxic loan stockpile reducing in the June quarter.
The bank does not want to take any chances on asset quality and, hence, holds a provision of  ₹2,358 crore in excess of providing against bad loans triggered by business as usual. The additional provision covers risks that may arise out of the non-fund-based exposure of bad borrowers and even the new stress that has emerged from non-bank lenders and select corporate groups.
Even so, the Axis Bank stock hasn’t seen good days, having underperformed the broad market index. The over 7% fall in the stock price in the last three months indicates that investors are still not sure about the extent of stress.
For the June quarter, slippages have increased, albeit marginally, and more than half of them are not from the known stressed corporate book.
Obviously, fresh stress has emerged from non-corporate loans, which the bank explained as originating primarily from agriculture. Corporate slippages were only 43% of the total slippages during the June quarter. The spike in write-offs also doesn’t bode well for the lender, especially as the recoveries have remained subdued. Considering the delays in resolution of key insolvency cases, the bank is unlikely to witness sharp recoveries going ahead.
Perhaps Axis Bank is aware of this, which explains it ramping up provisions and lending to only top-rated borrowers to ward off future stress. The lender’s efforts have paid off in the past year, given that the stress pool is contained at 4.2% of total loans, despite new additions.
The private sector bank has dealt with old stress quite well under its new boss Amitabh Chaudhry. But new stress cannot be wished away.
The jury is still out on Axis Bank’s asset quality and analysts are cautious on the outlook. After the over 2% fall on Tuesday, the stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, cheaper than most comparable peers."

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the government plans to take policy measures “fairly quickly"" to address the challenges plaguing the industry. She said also that the government is open to hearing out the grievances of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The minister was speaking to reporters after meeting chief executives of private and state-run banks as she kicked off a series of meetings planned with various industry heads. She met the heads of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank among others. The meeting also discussed the credit requirements of non-bank lenders, automobile industry and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and the transmission of interest rate cuts to the economy.
“Behind the series of meetings is to hear them out and fairly quickly after that come out with something that will help those sectors...We are getting inputs from various sectors and trying to respond so that the confidence of those sectors is being restored,"" Sitharaman said.
Over the next few days, the minister will meet representatives from several sectors —FPIs, automakers, industry associations, financial markets, MSMEs, industry associations and real estate to listen to their challenges. This is the first time the finance minister is meeting top executives in the second term of the National Democratic Alliance government, in a way acknowledging the ongoing economic slowdown and the government’s willingness to take inputs from businesses.
Sitharaman said the economic affairs secretary will soon hold talks with FPIs on their problems. There has been a massive outflow of overseas funds following the Union budget announcement to impose higher surcharge on some of these investors.
Bankers who attended the meeting sought the government’s intervention on tax notices asking lenders to pay service tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) on minimum balance accounts. Banks will soon respond to the notices, Sitharaman said, adding Jan Dhan accounts and basic deposit and savings accounts do not attract any charges.
On the decision to borrow overseas in foreign currency, Sitharaman said she will not speculate on the number of tranches and the finance ministry has done nothing in this regard, besides the announcement in the budget, owing to commitments in the ongoing Parliament session.
During the March quarter, India’s economy grew at 5.8%, the slowest in five years. Growth in 2018-19 was 6.8%, down from 7.2% a year ago. Besides the slowdown in fresh private investments, subdued demand and stress at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are affecting growth.
In signs of a persistent slowdown, India’s automobile makers are finding it hard to sell vehicles, and NBFCs and MSMEs are struggling to access credit.
Overall credit growth continues to be at 12%, which is marginally lower than 13.3% at the end of March, the finance ministry said in a statement after the meeting.

Mumbai: Private sector lender Axis Bank, which reported close to doubling of its June quarter net profit, has also chosen to ramp up its provisions to cover future risk from stressed loans. This marks a material change in the bank’s approach to the risk-reward matrix. In keeping with this new-found caution, Axis Bank has decided to take a conservative approach and has drawn red lines around certain kinds of exposures, or even certain kinds of assets. Amitabh Chaudhry, its new managing director and chief executive appointed in January, says the bank is ready to sacrifice growth in certain segments to pursue sustainability. Edited excerpts:
You have been at the helm of Axis Bank since January this year. What are the things that the bank has achieved in this period?
We have achieved some things in the last six months and some things necessarily will take more time. Firstly, what is happening in the economy is not helping because some of the signs are quite negative. At the same time, the response from the market, the people in the bank, my colleagues and even people looking at Axis Bank as a career opportunity has been quite positive. We knew it was a long haul.
Given the lacklustre credit environment, how do you plan to grow your loan book at the current pace?
We are trying to pivot ourselves to higher-quality and higher-rated assets. We also announced pretty significant restructurings effective 3 April. Despite that, we have been able to deliver on credit growth.
I do believe very strongly that as we pivot to higher-rated credits, given the long-standing relationship Axis Bank has with most key corporates in India, our ability to reach them and grow our asset pool is quite large. While the economy is slowing down and there are signs where some of the sectors are under stress, the economy is still growing and so our opportunities will continue to be there.
How would you balance risk and growth in assets?
We will not grow at any cost and we have to get the sustainability part of the franchise right. Axis Bank has stopped giving negative surprises to the market in terms of our risk profile—credit, market and compliance risk. We need to become more conservative on how we run our business, including provisions. In that process of change and transition, if it means that we have to sacrifice growth or not do certain transactions, it is fine. This transition is key to creating a different kind of long-term institution.
Have you imposed certain conditions on financing of auto dealers?
Our auto portfolio comprises giving money to consumers to buy vehicles. Axis Bank also has a pretty large supply chain portfolio and a decent part of that is coming from auto dealers. We have looked at that to make sure that the inventory is being turned over. In some cases, we are continuing to expand our franchise with them and, in others, we are also tightening our standards. We are continuously monitoring our portfolio for the last couple of quarters…there is an increased line of stress there, but I don’t think it is alarming and is under control at this stage.
Are there any particular sectors that you will avoid?
We will not take certain kinds of exposures and there are red lines around what kind of project finance we will do, what kind of structures and securities will be acceptable to us. When we look at our portfolio, we try to see the concentration and so we will not focus there but on areas where we are under-penetrated. As part of the restructuring exercise, we announced a separate group for multinational companies, a mid-corporate group or loans between  ₹250-700 crore. The mid-corporate group tends to be riskier than some of the others.
However, we believe there is a part of the mid-corporate group where we can put on some very good quality assets.
So, it is about making these portfolio choices as to who you will deal with and what kind of financing you will do. We have already pulled credit underwriting out of our business and it is a separate stream. The chief credit officer of the bank reports to me and so his responsibilities are around ensuring that the credit quality remains intact.
You have reported 16% corporate credit growth in the June quarter. Where is this demand coming from?
Most of the loan growth is coming from refinance and working capital as new investments have definitely slowed down. We are also doing some financing from resolutions under the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) process. I do not see these changing in a hurry and there are no signs that would indicate that investments are going to come roaring back. The number of NCLT transactions have also slowed down and hopefully, the new amendment will lead to faster movement and therefore, more resolutions are expected. This could lead to more financing opportunities.
How long do you think the non-banking financial company (NBFC) sector will take to come out of the woods?
Somewhere around the last quarter, I had said it would take 18 months and I will stick to that even now. Lot of the promoters whose NBFCs are in trouble do not have cash balances or their own money lying unutilised which they can pump into their NBFCs. In many cases, even if they were to find external investors, these investors have enough opportunities before them if they want to enter the NBFC space in India right now. Some of the NBFCs have been able to raise money and some of them have been struggling. The difference between these two sets of non-banks exists because people assessing the credit quality are seeing a stark difference between the NBFCs. Some NBFCs will go down, some will be in a situation where no further disbursement will happen and valuation goes for a toss. In some cases, as they get desperate about financing, they sell good parts of the portfolio and what is left is of poorer quality and over a period of time, it could implode.
You have got shareholder approval to raise  ₹18,000 crore of capital. Through what instruments do you plan to raise this capital?
Axis Bank did a preferential allotment of shares last time when LIC and Bain Capital invested. Now, there are certain restrictions on what price one can do a preferred allotment and qualified institutional placement (QIP) allows you more flexibility. Our decision will also depend on the timing and the price of the fund raise. We are not in a hurry and will not do it just for the sake of doing it. It has to be done at the right time and price. We have enough capital.
How different are the new set of stressed loans compared to the previous cycle of loans?
This time, there are no sectoral non-performing asset (NPA) issues, if you forget real estate and NBFCs for a moment. Otherwise, it is just business groups that are either leveraged at the operating company level, or promoter level, which seem to be falling into troubled times. And then the economy is not helping. Please understand almost everything of these downgrades we made in our portfolio is part of our historical book. Lot of these assets have been identified for exits sometime back but we cannot exit them because the promoters or the operating companies don’t have the money to repay.
What is your strategy around current account and savings account (CASA) deposits?
If you look at all the other banks which have declared their results, CASA has been a struggle for everyone, except for the banks which are offering very high rate for savings. Our CASA is not comparable to the smaller banks. Both on the retail and corporate side of current accounts, we are putting a lot of emphasis. These things take time and there is no money in the system. I feel CASA is something that will require a real long haul. It will require us pushing gradually. At the same time, our retail term deposits are doing pretty well. The more the current accounts and the savings accounts you get, the better it is for your net interest margins. Axis Bank’s CASA used to be much higher and it has partly come down because our retail term deposits have gone up.
You have people retiring from your board this year. What are the replacement plans?
We had 15 members in the board and three are going to retire this year. Samir Barua and Sanjiv Misra have already retired and we have taken a conscious call that we do not need more than 12 members and therefore, will not replace some of the board members. We will have a 12-member board from now. Meanwhile, Som Mittal is also going to retire in October according to the schedule.
Thirty percent of shareholders voted against the reappointment of Usha Sangwan in your annual general meeting last month. What could be the possible causes?
Axis Bank had more than 115 meetings of the board and its committees last year. Since Usha Sangwan has been doing a full-time job, sometimes attendance gets impacted. Moreover, she has been appointed for a shorter period because she cannot remain a member beyond October. The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is also not fully-staffed now and it was only fair that Sangwan serves her full term. So, I think LIC does not have enough number of managing directors (MD) to get appointed here. Given the combination of all those factors, we sought her appointment only till October and these two reasons could have been drivers of that kind of voting. LIC has the right to appoint someone and I think and they will take a call closer to October."

NEW DELHI :
Axis Bank has settled a case related to alleged violation of debenture trustee norms with Sebi, after paying  ₹2.43 crore towards settlement charges.
According to the private sector lender's website, ""Axis Bank is a Sebi-registered debenture trustee.""
The adjudication proceedings against Axis Bank were initiated after the regulator sent a show cause notice in June 2018 on observing violations of debenture trustee regulations.
It was alleged that the bank had ""lent to issuer companies to which it also extended debenture trustee services"" and also failed to obtain quarterly reports from the issuer companies.
Besides, non-incorporation of mandatory clauses in trust deed and lack of due diligence to ensure compliance of listing agreement by the issuer company were among the allegations.
Also, the lender was alleged to have falsely reported that corrective steps had been taken since previous inspection.
However, while the case proceedings were pending, Axis Bank filed a settlement application with Sebi ""without admitting the findings of fact and conclusions of law"".
In May 2019, the lender in its meeting with the internal committee of Sebi proposed terms to settle the alleged defaults.
The amount of  ₹2.43 crore after approval of a panel comprising Sebi's whole-time members was remitted by Axis Bank on July 19, 2019, for the settlement.
Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said proceedings for the defaults have been disposed of."

63,2019-08-19,Axis Bank,"The comments come at a time when pushing up the sagging economic growth has become the biggest focus for the policymakersThe third-largest private sector lender's executive director for corporate lending Rajiv Anand blamed liquidity issues prevented banks cutting the lending rates

MUMBAI :
Even as RBI governor Shaktikanta Das pitched for a system-wide adoption of repo-linked pricing of loans and deposits, private sector lender Axis Bank on Monday said it is not the only measure for better transmission of central bank's policy moves.
The third-largest private sector lender's executive director for corporate lending Rajiv Anand blamed liquidity issues prevented banks cutting the lending rates till June and that with better liquidity conditions since then, banks have been passing on the benefits of the RBI rate cuts.
With the further easing in liquidity conditions as seen in the recent days through the excess availability of  ₹2 trillion per day, banks will do more rate cuts, Anand said.
""It's not necessary to use only external benchmarks, there are multiple avenues to meet the requirement that the RBI wants us to do... What RBI is essentially looking at is that the rates are being cut and there should be better transmission,"" he said.
Anand was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual industry conference Fibac, hours after Das made the suggestion that the time has come to formalise the external benchmark or repo-linked system for new loans, which will ensure faster transmission of rates.
The comments come at a time when pushing up the sagging economic growth has become the biggest focus for the policymakers, which has ensured rate cuts of 110 bps by the RBI in four simultaneous rate cuts.
Anand also flagged the risks of such a move of linking interest rate to the repo rate set by RBI for the customers.
""Remember that repo rates typically will be more volatile than MCLR for example,"" he said, speaking in support of the present marginal cost of funding based lending rate being followed at present.
""Generally, we've seen that retail customers, when the rates are falling, they want to see faster transmission but remember that faster transmission will happen on the way up as well,"" he said.
Anand said the retail customers do not wish for volatilities in their loan pricing and hence, such linkage will be more useful for the corporate borrowers.
""As long as banks are able to meet the requirement as to transmit faster, I think there are multiple roads to achieve that,"" he said.
It can be noted that market leader SBI has been the first to move by linking its loan pricing to newer borrowers to the repo rate, while its closest rival Bank of Baroda has also followed suit.
State-run PNB managing director Sunil Mehta told reporters that the lender will also be making a shift in the next seven days and added that there is adequate liquidity in the system.
Declining to spell out whether his bank is planning to offer repo linked loans, Anand said Axis Bank's asset liability committee will take a call on the same.
To a question about the fate of existing borrowers, and if they also get to enjoy the benefits of lower repo rates, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said all of it will depend on how soon the banks are able to reprice its old liabilities, but declined to give a timeline for the same.
It can be noted that till the last rate cut of 0.35%, the banks have passed out only 0.29% of the 0.75% in rate cuts initiated by the RBI to the final borrowers. However, RBI's last cut delivered earlier this month has led to a rash of rate cuts by the lenders by up to 0.10%."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

MUMBAI :
Even as the Reserve Bank is yet to take a call on Indiabulls Housing Finance's plans to merge with Lakshmi Vilas Bank, the mid-sized private sector lender on Wednesday announced the resignation of its chief executive Parthasarathi Mukherjee.
Mukherjee quit citing personal reasons, the bank informed the bourses late in the evening.
Mukherjee, who had served the larger rival Axis Bank before joining the Tamil Nadu based bank in 2015, was given a two-year extension this January.
LVB had April announced a merger with the city- headquartered mortgage major, in a deal which is very keenly watched for the outcome.
Indiabulls' association with the realty sector is the reason why the deal is being keenly watched, given the RBI's aversion to allow entities having exposure to the sector into the universal banking space.
The Indiabulls promoters have initiated efforts to completely exit the realty space and also promised to bring down their personal holdings in the merged entity down to regulator-mandated levels.
The deal has received all the necessary approvals, but is stuck with RBI. All along, Indiabulls executives have been sounding confident of getting the go-ahead. PTI AA BEN BEN"

57,2019-09-08,Axis Bank,"Interest-rate swaps are signaling the central bank will eventually cut its repurchase rate to as low as 4.75% or 5%Concern potential stimulus would worsen the fiscal deficit caused benchmark yields to jump the most in 16 months in August

Mumbai: The slide in Indian bonds last month on concern about potential monetary stimulus has one bond veteran smelling an opportunity.
The government’s scope to deliver a big package to revive the economy is limited despite the $24 billion windfall from the central bank, while the prospect of additional interest-rate cuts will drive yields lower, Neeraj Gambhir, president and head of treasury and markets at Axis Bank Ltd., said in an interview.
Concern potential stimulus would worsen the fiscal deficit caused benchmark yields to jump the most in 16 months in August. While Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has resisted calls to offer fiscal support, traders fear last month’s economic data showing growth slumped to a six-year low may convince the administration to capitulate.
“We will see some more rate cuts happen, we will see liquidity continue to be good and that should steadily drive down yields,"" said Gambhir, who has more than 20 years experience in the nation’s bond market, including being managing director and head of fixed income at Nomura Fixed Income Securities India. The government may opt for “targeted intervention"" to boost demand rather than unveil a large revival package, he said.
Gambhir said the premium of 10-year yields over the central bank’s policy rate signals that bonds are attractive. The gap is currently about 120 basis points after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut rates four times this year in Asia’s most aggressive monetary easing.
“At this stage of the cycle, the spread flattens out quite a lot,"" he said. “From that perspective, duration in government bonds is a good play.""
Interest-rate swaps are signaling the central bank will eventually cut its repurchase rate to as low as 4.75% or 5%, from the current 5.4%. Assuming the terminal rate will be 5%, that means the 10-year bond yield may decline to 6%, factoring in a “fairly wide"" 100 basis-point spread, Gambhir said.
The nation’s 10-year yield closed 3 basis points higher Friday at 6.60%.
The central bank has been emboldened to keep cutting rates as inflation has stayed below its 4% target for 12 straight months. Data for August is due this Thursday.
There’s also room for spreads between highly-rated corporate issuers and sovereign notes to shrink, Gambhir said.
“As liquidity in the system persists and interest rates settle at a lower level, spreads would tighten, especially for high-quality borrowers,"" he said. “But that yield-chase cycle hasn’t begun.""

52,2019-09-19,Axis Bank,"Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank have the largest direct exposure to commercial real estateOther banks like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also have significant exposure to the sector

Mumbai: Rating agency Moody's on Thursday said real estate financier Altico Capital India Ltd's default is credit negative for banks with significant exposure to real estate sector. The default signals increasing tight liquidity among property developers, said the agency.
Moody's also said banks such as Yes bank and Indusind Bank which have the largest direct exposure to commercial real estate would be susceptible to asset quality difficulties if the real estate sector continues to slow. Other banks like ICICI Bank and Axis bank also have significant exposure to the sector.
Banks have indirect exposure to real estate sector through their lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs), which also lend to real estate developers. While the overall exposure of NBFCs and HFCs to the real estate sector is only about 6% of their total assets, some NBFCs and HFCs are more exposed than others, making them vulnerable to a slowdown in the sector.
In response to the tightening liquidity in the real estate sector, the Indian government on 13 September announced that it would create an investment fund to provide soft loans to residential real estate developers to complete partially constructed affordable housing projects.
The government will contribute  ₹10,000 crore to the fund and expects a similar-size contribution from entities including the Life Insurance Corporation of India, Indian banks and development institutions.
According to Moody's, the creation of the investment fund is credit positive for the real estate sector, but its timeline and modalities are not yet known, and is unclear if it will help address the sector's immediate liquidity constraints. In addition, it will not address the broader solvency constraints of real estate developers given its narrow remit of targeting only certain residential real estate projects."
50,2019-09-22,Axis Bank,"The fundraise makes Axis the third bank to raise funds via a QIP this yearAxis Bank sells shares in the QIP at  ₹628-629 per share

MUMBAI :
Private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd has raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest qualified institutional placement (QIP) from large foreign and local investors, said two people aware of the development.
In 2017, government-controlled State Bank of India had raised  ₹15,000 crore in the nation’s largest QIP.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) that participated in the share sale include funds managed by Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC and American investors T Rowe Price and BlackRock, said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.
“The book was subscribed almost equally by foreign and domestic investors such as mutual funds. Most of the existing investors took part in the QIP,"" he added.
A QIP is a capital-raising tool through which listed companies can sell shares, fully and partly convertible debentures, or any securities other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
Axis Bank launched the institutional share sale on 19 September, setting a floor price of  ₹661.50 per share.
According to the second person cited above, the lender has sold shares in the QIP at  ₹628-629 per share. He too declined to be identified.
Securities and Exchange Board of India rules allow companies to sell at as much as 5% discount to the QIP floor price. A board committee will meet on 25 September to consider and approve the price of the shares to be issued through the QIP, the lender said in a stock exchange filing.
T Rowe Price declined to comment. Emails sent on Friday to GIC, BlackRock and Axis Bank did not elicit a response.
“The bank intends to use the net proceeds to enhance its capital adequacy, in accordance with regulatory requirements, its growth strategy and for general corporate purposes, in accordance with applicable law,"" it said in a regulatory filing on Thursday.
In 2017, Axis Bank raised up to  ₹11,625.8 crore through a private placement of shares to a clutch of investors led by private equity fund Bain Capital.
The latest fundraise makes Axis Bank the third bank to raise funds through a QIP this year, at a time when markets have largely been volatile due to domestic growth concerns and external factors such as US-China trade war and crude prices.
In August, troubled private lender Yes Bank Ltd raised  ₹1,930 crore through a QIP offering, while in March, Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd raised  ₹459.5 crore through a sale of shares to institutional investors.
Several other lenders, including non-banks are expected to tap the public markets to raise capital in the coming months.
Mint reported on 5 September that Bajaj Finance Ltd has hired investment banks to raise as much as $1 billion through a QIP."

48,2019-09-25,Axis Bank,"State Bank of India declined following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan StanleyOther banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each

Banking and financial stocks were under severe selling pressure on Wednesday. The BSE Bankex has declined 1.7% so far today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put curbs on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. The central bank’s restrictions include limits on cash withdrawals amid a probe into accounting lapses, sparking speculation that the regulator may force a management change at the cooperative bank through a merger, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) fell 4% on news report that the RBI’s action on the PMC Bank was the result of a loan of  ₹2,500 crore to the now bankrupt real estate firm.
Among banking stocks, shares of State Bank of India fell the most--down over 4%--following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan Stanley. Other banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each.
India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."
47,2019-09-25,Axis Bank,"Axis Bank has exposure to a handful of stressed companies that have off late shown deeper troublesThe bank also has exposure to real estate developers that were downgraded by rating agencies due to stress

Axis Bank raised a massive Rs12,500 crore though a qualified institutional placement (QIP), without breaking a sweat, and investors who made that happen deserve good news.
To make investors happy, the third largest private lender will have to show an improvement in asset quality and convince the market that its balance sheet growth will trump that of rivals.
Improving asset quality won’t be easy and that could make balance sheet growth a challenge too.
“The QIP is a positive for the bank and the funds would be obviously used for more provisioning and even growth,"" Suresh Ganapathy, analyst at Macquarie Capital Securities. “But asset quality is still unresolved and fresh stress has emerged,"" he added.
Moreover since they are de-risking their portfolio, margins are going to be under pressure. So there isn't much earnings upside for the stock to price in.
Axis Bank has exposure to a handful of stressed companies that have off late shown deeper troubles. Some of these are companies belonging to Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Essel Group. Reliance Capital was downgraded to D recently and lenders are still haggling with Essel Group over payment.
Axis Bank also has exposure to real estate developers that were downgraded by rating agencies due to stress. Its exposure to small and medium enterprises (SME) stands at 12% and the increased stress on small businesses due to slowdown has added to the risk of this portfolio. Analysts at Macquarie have flagged this as a key risk to asset quality.
To be sure, the bank showed improvement in asset quality in the June quarter, reporting a 10% year-on-year drop in its bad loan stock. That said, the bank also reported an increase in fresh slippages which made investors uncomfortable.
Analysts believe that some of the newer stressed exposures are not included in the watchlist and so could throw a negative surprise for the lender.
To be fair, the bank’s new chief Amitabh Choudhury has made it clear that the lender will have enough insurance against fresh risk. It beefed up provisions and is likely to continue doing in the coming quarters as well.
That brings us back to the fact that if more money is set aside for provisions, there is less available for growth.
But the fact that the QIP money will increase its Tier-I capital by over 2 percentage points should bring some cheer to investors.
Also, much of the negatives seem to be priced into the stock, given that it is down 3.4% over the past two months despite the 10% rise post the corporate tax cut announcement by government on Friday.
“Our analysis shows the potential stress at Axis Bank is only marginally higher on corporate assets than at ICICI Bank, and given its underperformance, we believe it presents a good buying opportunity,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd wrote in a note.
Since the stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, analysts believe it is a good buy in comparison to its more expensive peers such as HDFC Bank and even ICICI Bank."

42,2019-10-04,Axis Bank,"Bank stocks came under pressure in the past 10 days owing to renewed concerns over asset qualityMarket cap of HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra now tops that of other 10 banks in Nifty Bank by 10%

Indian banks have faced rough weather in the past two weeks and investors are rediscovering stocks that act as lifeboats in choppy waters.
HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have emerged as these lifeboats over the last 10 days. Ergo, while the Nifty Bank index lost over 6% since 23 September, these stocks have weathered the selling pressure.
As the adjoining chart shows, the market capitalization of the two private sector lenders now exceeds that of the other 10 banks in the Nifty banking sector index by about 10%. Just three months ago, the combined value of the two banks was about 10% lower than the other 10 lenders, which include State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and seven of the remaining largest lenders in the country.
So what transpired in the last 10 days to drive investors away from other banks and towards HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank?
The collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd, which had an absurdly high exposure to real estate developers, brought to the fore the vulnerabilities of Indian banks in general.
Investors realized that Indian banks have an uncomfortable exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFC) that finance real estate developers (HFCs). “Negative news flow around HFCs/NBFCs and banks has overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The result was a massive fall in stock prices, and banks such as Yes Bank Ltd and RBL Bank Ltd saw their valuation erode sharply. According to Jefferies India, Yes Bank has an exposure of more than  ₹10,000 crore to troubled companies it terms as “high risk"".
Even the more stronger and larger balance sheets such as SBI and ICICI Bank weren’t spared by investors.
In addition to the resurgence of stress, concerns that the current slowdown would affect the loan growth of banks also weighed in. Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said banks are not likely to grow their loans as most companies would use savings from tax cuts to boost profits.
Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in note, “We expect overall system credit to see 10-12% growth, but near-term growth trajectory depends on pick-up in consumer sentiment in this festive season.""
Investors flocked to HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank as they showed a track record of pristine asset quality. Moreover, both lenders have negligible exposure to troubled NBFCs. Lower stressed assets would mean lower provisioning for the two lenders and, therefore, the banks would have more free capital to lend. Ergo, their loan growth is likely to be superior to others.
Even so, the consumption slowdown is likely to affect all lenders. Investors know this. While HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may have been spared in the recent rout in bank shares, investors await the quarterly performance for clarity."

IndusInd Bank Ltd., which saw a fifth of its market value wiped out over the past week on concern about its creditors, says the crisis of confidence engulfing India’s financial system is fading away.
Outstanding loans to overstretched borrowers dipped at the Mumbai-based bank last quarter, lenders including IndusInd are working to resolve defaults at Dewan Housing Finance Ltd., and Indian authorities are taking steps to contain future delinquencies at shadow banks, IndusInd’s Chief Executive Officer Romesh Sobti said in an interview in Mumbai on Friday.
“All we need now to turn the tide of caution completely is a resolution of a large delinquent account,"" Sobti said. “Banks are already beginning to look more positively at lending to non-bank financiers and the real estate segment as the worst is behind us.""
IndusInd joins Axis Bank Ltd. and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. in predicting that the Indian financial sector’s woes will ease soon. Most banks have been beaten down for more than a year since the collapse of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. and defaults by other shadow lenders including Dewan and Altico Capital India Ltd.
Shares of IndusInd have fallen about 20% over the past week amid speculation that it was owed money by Indiabulls. As of Sept. 29, gross exposure to the housing finance company concerned, its units and associate finance companies stands at about 0.35% of the loan book and is backed by adequate collateral, IndusInd said in a Sept. 30 filing without naming any firm.
The bank’s gross bad loan ratio stands at about 2.2% as of June end, compared with more than 9% for the nation’s banking system. IndusInd’s return on assets rose to 2.1% in June from 1.9% in the year-ago period, filings show.
IL&FS group is seeking to resolve most of its debt obligations by March, chief operating officer of the company said this month. Meanwhile, Dewan, the largest mortgage lender to default so far, has prepared a plan to resolve stress on its books. IndusInd, which has exposures to Dewan, IL&FS and Indiabulls, has seen repayments from some embattled borrowers in the September quarter, Sobti said, without providing further details.
“The elephant has passed through, though the tail is still wagging,"" Sobti said. “As far as most of the big risks to the system are concerned, whether from non-bank financing companies or real estate, we have turned the corner."""

MUMBAI :
Blackstone Group and Indian developer K Raheja Group have selected more banks for an initial public offering of their joint commercial property portfolio, according to people familiar with the matter.
Citigroup Inc., Kotak Mahindra Capital Co. and Axis Capital Ltd. were picked to join Morgan Stanley to arrange the listing of the assets as real estate investment trust in Mumbai, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions are private.
While the private equity firm and K Raheja are still working on the property composition for the REIT, they aim to finish the share sale by as soon as March, the people said.
A successful debut would mark India’s second REIT after the listing of Embassy Office Parks REIT in April. The country’s cash-starved developers have been seeking ways to monetize their assets as the industry is struggling with sluggish sales and price declines that followed a 2016 crackdown on cash and a lingering crisis in shadow lenders.
A media report last month said Morgan Stanley was roped in for the planned REIT listing, while more banks will be hired soon.
Deliberations are ongoing and more banks can be added to the lineup, the people said. Details of the offering could also be changed, they said. Representatives for Blackstone, Citi and Morgan Stanley declined to comment, while representatives for Axis Capital, Kotak Mahindra and K Raheja Group didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment."

MUMBAI :
Kerala-based private sector lender CSB Bank, formerly The Catholic Syrian Bank, is planning to launch its initial public offering (IPO) in November, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
Last year, Canadian billionaire Prem Watsa’s Fairfax India Holdings Corp. had acquired a 51% stake in CSB Bank for around $168 million. In a first-of-its-kind approval to help turn around a lender, the Reserve Bank of India had allowed a foreign investment firm to invest in a homegrown bank.
“The bank will start its marketing efforts and investor roadshows from next week. They are planning to launch the IPO in November. Work on the draft red herring prospectus is going on. The specific timelines for the November launch will be decided after factoring in the response received during the roadshows,"" said the first person. CSB is trying to mop up  ₹500 crore through the initial share sale, he added. The bank received market regulator Sebi’s approval for its IPO on Monday.
An email sent to CSB Bank on Wednesday remained unanswered. The bank, according to its draft prospectus, is looking to raise  ₹30 crore via fresh issue of shares to increase its tier-1 capital base and to meet future capital requirements, while its existing shareholders will sell 1.97 crore share through the offer-for-sale route. ICICI Lombard General Insurance, HDFC Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Federal Bank and Bridge India Fund are expected to sell their stakes, partially or fully, during the IPO.
Investment banks Axis Capital and IIFL Securities are managing the CSB Bank IPO. This is the second attempt at a public listing by the bank. In March 2015, it had filed a draft prospectus to raise  ₹400 crore. However, the bank never went ahead with its public offering. The 98-year old bank is one of the oldest private lenders in India with a strong base in Kerala, and significant presence in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka. Its customer base is 1.3 million as on 31 March. It primarily lends to small and medium enterprises, retail, and non-resident Indians."

MUMBAI :
Axis Bank Ltd incurred a loss of  ₹112 crore for the quarter ended 30 September, due to a one-time hit of  ₹2,138 crore as the value of future relief through deferred tax assets (DTA) will fall because of the corporate tax rate cut. Adjusted for this extraordinary item, net profit would have surged 156% to  ₹2,026 crore from  ₹789.61 crore a year earlier.
Axis Bank said it has been fully adjusted through Q2FY20 financials, which has impacted the earnings significantly.
“The hit that we have taken is because of restatement of DTA. With tax rates reduced, the entire DTA has to be restated at 25% instead of 35%,"" said Jairam Sridharan, group executive and chief financial officer, Axis Bank.
Asset quality improved as the bank wrote off  ₹3,104 crore in the second quarter of FY20. Gross non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets stood at 5.03% in the September quarter compared with 5.25% in the June quarter. The bank added fresh bad loans worth  ₹4,983 crore in the second quarter compared to  ₹4,798 crore in the previous quarter. Corporate slippages stood at  ₹2,862 crore—97% of this came from previously disclosed clients with ratings of BB and below.
In a post-earnings press meet, Axis Bank’s managing director and chief executive officer Amitabh Chaudhry said while momentum is picking up in car and vehicle loans, the bank is “cautious"" in chasing growth opportunities in the small and medium enterprises (SMEs) segment.
“Some of the assets in our stock of BB and below rating have been there for a long period of time. In a deteriorating economic environment, you will see some of this stock go into slippages. So, yes, our slippages will remain at elevated levels if economic conditions don’t improve,"" he added.
Sridharan said cash flows of SMEs were being stretched because of delayed payments from large companies. He also said the bank is seeing stress in its agricultural loan portfolio.
Operationally, the bank’s performance improved with net interest income growing 17% year-on-year to  ₹6,102 crore. Net interest margins stood at 3.51% at the end of September quarter. Its loan book saw a growth of 19% with the retail loan book growing at 23% year-on-year. Growth in retail was led by strong growth in the unsecured portfolio, auto and small business banking, while SME witnessed a marginal blip in growth.
The corporate segment witnessed single-digit growth on a year-on-year basis, primarily led by degrowth in the international book. Net interest margin improved by 11 basis points, sequentially, due to a rise in spread and interest reversal.
Axis Bank opened 190 branches in the quarter, the highest in 24 quarters with a focus on improving the current and savings account (CASA) ratio. It had 4,284 domestic branches as on 30 September.
Separately, RBL Bank reported 73% year-on-year decline in net profit because of a sharp increase in provisions and bad loans. Profit during the quarter plunged to  ₹54.31 crore from  ₹204.54 crore a year earlier.
In the June quarter, the bank’s management had cautioned about the stress in its corporate loan book, given the difficult corporate-credit environment. Asset quality deteriorated sharply in the September quarter with gross non-performing assets as a percentage of gross advances rising sequentially from 1.385% to 2.6% in the three months ended 30 September, and net non-performing assets climbing from 0.56% to 1.56% during the period under consideration."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Wednesday.
Infosys: Shares of the IT-services major may extend Tuesday’s losses and trade in the red because of concerns over accounting malpractices at the top executive level.

According to an IANS report, the IAF had issued a single vendor tender to HAL in December 2017 for procuring 83 aircraft.

Indian markets wobbled in early trade with Sensex down about 40 points while Nifty was near 11,575. Banking stocks supported the market with Axis Bank shares up 2%. Infosys shares fell 3% in early trade, extending their Tuesday's 16% loss.
Private lender Axis Bank on Tuesday reported a healthy second quarter performance. Though the bank reported a net loss of  ₹112 crore for the quarter ended September 30, it was driven by a one-time tax impact of  ₹2,138 crore due to changes in corporate tax rate. Adjusted for this extraordinary item, net profit of Axis Bank would have been  ₹2,026 crore, up 157% year on year. Profit before tax for Q2 grew 109% year-on-year to  ₹2,433 crore from  ₹1,167 crores in Q2 FY19.
""Technically, Nifty has established a higher bottom - higher top series and strategy should be to buy into strong companies if market corrects to major supports like 11550 and 11500. On the higher side, 11720 would be the ultimate resistance and if that hurdle is crossed, Nifty would start trending downwards to 12000,"" says Shrikant Chouhan, Senior Vice-President, Equity Technical Research, Kotak Securities.

30,2019-10-24,Axis Bank,"The bank’s balance sheet is far superior to what it was six quarters agoAxis Bank’s slippages have increased, which means fresh stress is piling up

Exactly six quarters ago, Axis Bank Ltd reported a massive quarterly loss owing to a bad loan-battered balance sheet.
This time’s loss for the September quarter is due to a one-time tax adjustment, as the lender moved to a lower tax bracket after the government’s corporate tax cut announcement. In fact, this one-time loss should be seen as prudent, as benefits from the lower tax rate will now be enjoyed by the bank for a long time. Ergo, investors were willing to forgive the lender for it.
But this does not mean Axis Bank should be let off the hook by investors. For one, its slippages have increased, which means fresh stress is piling up.
For the September quarter, slippages were at  ₹4,983 crore, a 79% jump from a year ago. Its list of stressed loans, also called watchlist, declined by 16% from the previous quarter, which is a good sign. But the list still adds up to  ₹6,291 crore, and most of it would slip into non-performing assets, according to the management. The management has warned that stress is increasing in small business loans.
Another reason to keep a watch on the bank is that its loan write-offs are still steep. Simply put, Axis Bank’s bad loans are not reducing because borrowers have begun paying. They have dropped because the lender no longer believes it can get repaid and so it has written off the loans. Of course, most of its peers are writing off loans to bring down the bad loan stock, so singling out Axis Bank would be unfair.
To be sure, the bank’s balance sheet is far superior to what it was six quarters ago when it reported that massive loss. Its gross bad loans have come down and slippages are a shadow of what they were. The lender has also beefed up provisioning since then, with the coverage ratio being at an impressive 79%.
But a tough question is whether Axis Bank’s valuations are justified. At over twice its estimated book value for FY21, the stock seems reasonably priced compared with other expensive peers. For valuations to improve, slippages have to meaningfully come down.
And here, the outlook is not clear yet, as much of the recoveries depend on how quick insolvency cases are resolved. “While we have lifted core PPOP marginally across the years, we have also taken credit costs a little higher as near-term asset quality visibility is challenging and dependent on IBC resolutions, where we have no view,"" wrote analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. PPOP is pre-provision operating profit and IBC is Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
No wonder the Axis Bank stock didn’t see any gain on Wednesday. That said, investors seem to appreciate the progress of the lender on asset quality over the last one year, visible in the 26% gain during that period."

The basic idea is that lenders if they continue lending they should have first charge over the asset itself and they are not required to classify it as NPA,"" Chaudhry said while speaking at the India Mortgage Leadership Conclave.
Chaudhry also said there is need to improve the resolution infrastructure to deal with stressed real estate projects. Currently, lenders are unwilling to lend to projects which are held up in National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for fear of bad loan classification.
""We need resolution infrastructure for real estate projects to improve dramatically. We are in the midst of a crisis where economic growth isn't as high as we would like it to be. Developers who are unable to continue with construction of their projects are becoming defaulters to banks and lenders. We will need the infrastructure to deal with such cases,"" he added.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had on Tuesday said the government was working with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to address issues faced by the real estate sector. The focus on real estate is part of the government’s broader plan to kick-start economic growth, which has slowed to a six-year low of 5% in the quarter ended 30 June.
On the transmission of policy rates, while banks have moved to linking floating rate loans to external benchmark rates, Chaudhry warned that customers could face payment shocks in an increasing interest rate cycle.
""We welcome RBI’s move to link floating rate loans to external benchmark for customers. While the move shall result in customers getting faster transmission of loans in case of falling benchmark rates, this shall also result in faster increase in loan tenures/EMIs in case of increasing benchmark rates which could result in payment shocks to the borrowers. There have been periods in the last decade where key external benchmark rates have moved up by 200 bps,"" he said."

MUMBAI :
Indian equity market ended higher on Thursday led by gains in financial services and IT sectors.

The government released CPI inflation data after market hours on Wednesday. Retail Inflation jumped to 4.62% in October from 3.99% in September due to a surge in food inflation.
Contrary to the rise in CPI inflation, wholesale prices based inflation, or WPI, eased further to 0.16% in October from 0.33% in September due to subdued prices of non-food articles and fall in prices of manufactured items, according to the government data released today.
BSE Sensex gained 170.42 points or 0.42% to close at 40,286.48, while the Nifty 50 index climbed up 31.65 points or 0.27% ending at 11,872.10 in today’s trade.

SpiceJet Ltd tumbled 5.94% and closed at  ₹106.95 after the company reported a consolidated net loss of  ₹461.2 crore for the quarter-ended September due to rise in total expenditure. The company had posted a loss of  ₹382.7 crore a year ago. Total expenditure jumped 55% year-on-year to  ₹3,537.5 crore in the September quarter compared with  ₹2,286.7 crore a year ago.
Muthoot Finance Ltd soared 9.54% to close at  ₹707.5 after the company reported a rise of 41% year-on-year growth in profit before tax at  ₹1,047 crore for the September quarter on the back of strong operational income. The stock was the biggest gainer in the BSE's 'A' group.
Shares of Aurobindo Pharma Ltd hit a five-year low today after the drug maker said it received 14 observations from the US Food and Drug Administration for its manufacturing facility at Hyderabad—a move that may disrupt supplies and delay future approvals. The stock ended down 8.73% at  ₹395.55.

20,2019-11-20,Axis Bank,"Vehicles crossing toll plazas without FASTags will be charged double the toll feesYou can buy FASTags online and through branches of several banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank

NEW DELHI :
From December 1, expect less traffic at toll plazas across highways in India but also get ready to pay double the toll tax if FASTag is missing from your vehicle. To promote seamless movement of vehicles and minimise traffic congestion at toll plazas, the ministry of road transport and highways has made it mandatory for all vehicles to have FASTags.
What is FASTag
Based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, FASTag is affixed on windscreen of vehicles. FASTag-affixed vehicles do not have to stop at toll gates as charges are deducted from the prepaid or bank account when the vehicle is moving. Drivers do not have to stop their vehicle to make transactions as the toll collection will be done electronically under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme.
The new FASTag rule
From December 1, all lanes in all toll fee plazas on national highways across the country will turn into dedicated FASTag lanes. According to the National Highways Fee (Determination of Rates and Collection) Rules, 2008, a FASTag lane in a toll plaza is reserved exclusively for the movement of FASTag users. If you are passing without FASTag, you will be charged double the fee.
One lane has been kept as hybrid where FASTags as well as other modes of payment will be accepted.
How to buy FASTags and recharge it
Besides select bank branches and point-of-sale at toll plazas of national highways, selected bank branches, FASTags can be bought online through e-commerce portal Amazon. After you buy it, you need to activate it by entering details in My FASTag mobile app. After that, you need to link the tag to an existing bank account for deduction of toll tax.
You can recharge your FASTag account using debit card, credit card, netbanking, etc. Otherwise, you can also link it directly to your bank account and thus
A cashback of 2.5% is being offered for 2019-20 in order to incentivise road users for FASTag use. According to the highways ministry, more than 6 million FASTags were issued till September, with overall cumulative ETC collection of over  ₹12,850 crore since inception."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

If you travel by road frequently or are plannng a road trip, you now need to have FASTag with you. With effect from 1 December, there shall be no collection of cash at Toll Plazas, instead FasTag will be used for the collection of the toll fee. FASTag is an electronic toll connection device attached to the windscreen of vehicle to enable drivers to drive through toll plazas without having to stop. FASTag uses radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to enable direct toll payments from a moving vehicle. The toll fare is directly deducted from the bank account linked to FASTag. It will not only encourage cashless payments at toll plaza, but also decongest national highways.
FASTag may be purchased from over 28,500 Point-of-Sale (PoS) terminals. It may be purchased online on Amazon and by visiting websites of different member banks such as SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis bank, Paytm Payment Banks, HDFC Bank, IDFC First Bank.

17,2019-11-25,Axis Bank,"The tribunal has fixed the next date of hearing on 16 December and asked Amitabh Chaudhry and Zarin Daruwala to be presentThe case relates to these banks allowing ex-head of ILFS Financial Services Ramesh Chandra Bawa and his family withdraw money from their accounts

MUMBAI :
The Mumbai NCLT on Monday ordered the CEOs of Axis Bank and StanChart Bank to be personally present at the next hearing on December 16 in a case relating to the IL&FS fraud, failing which it threatened to get nonbailable warrants issued against them.
An NCLT bench headed by Bhaskara Pantula Mohan issued the ultimatum while hearing a contempt petition against Amitabh Chaudhry and Zarin Daruwala of Axis Bank and StanChart India, respectively, for not being personally attending the hearings so far.
However, bank sources said they have never been directed by the tribunal to be present for the hearing and hinted at moving a review petition against the personal appearance of their CEOs.
An Axis Bank spokesperson denied that that the bank is in contempt of the tribunal order as it has not recieved any such notice so far.
""The matter pertains to operations of accounts (held by IL&FS Financial Services' ex-MD Ramesh Bawa and his family) with our branch. The bank has high respect for all court/ tribunal orders. Bank denies the allegations and on receipt of the NCLT order, we will take appropriate steps,"" Axis Bank said in a statement to PTI.
Similarly, Standard Chartered India spokesperson also said, ""we are yet to receive the copy of the NCLT order. Upon review of the contents of the tribunal order, we will decide the way forward.""
The tribunal has fixed the next date of hearing on December 16 and asked Chaudhry and Daruwala to be present and noted that both these bankers never presented themselves before the bench since the issue surfaced last December.
The case relates to these banks allowing ex-head of ILFS Financial Services Ramesh Chandra Bawa and his family withdrawing money from their accounts with these banks and also accessing the lockers even after these accounts were frozen by the tribunal.
But the banks had submitted that the particular transactions took place before they got the copy of the tribunal order freezing these accounts.
The tribunal froze these accounts on December 3, 2018. Following this, the contempt notices were issued these three after the corporate affairs ministry had alleged that the banks facilitated Bawa to withdraw/transfer money from their accounts to his wife Ashakiran and daughter Akansha, apart from letting him access the lockers.
On April 26, 2019, the NCLT issued contempt notices to Chaudhry and Daruwala. Later it also issued a similar contempt notice Bawa for not following its directions.
The ministry also informed the tribunal that Bawa withdrew/ transferred  ₹1 crore and  ₹14 lakh from Axis Bank accounts in two instances violating the December 3, 2018 NCLT order freezing the accounts.
The ministry counsel had also said Bawa accessed his lockers with these bank four times since December 3.
While freezing the accounts, the NCLT on December 3 had also restrained former directors of IL&FS Group from disposing of or creating any third-party rights on their properties."

According to market traders, domestic indices followed their global peers which were enthused by reports that a preliminary trade deal between the US and China may be signed by the end of this year.
""The prolonged trade war between the US and China was weighing heavily on Indian indices. Positive statements made by officials (from both the countries) last week indicating that a trade pact is likely by the end of December 2019 are being welcomed,"" Sandeep Nayak, executive director and chief executive officer of Centrum Broking, said.
He added that foreign institutional investors are preferring emerging markets such as India as the recent easy monetary stance of US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has improved liquidity in world markets.
""Whereas, India's economy is seeing a demand revival especially in the sectors of auto and consumer durables. The government providing relief to telecom companies over spectrum related dues and impending price increase planned by players has also revived interest in the sector,"" Nayak said.

14,2019-12-01,Axis Bank,"The bank is maintaining a standard asset provisioning of 1 percentage point for bad loans in such sectors, as against the regulatory provision of 0.4%The bank's executive director Rajiv Anand declined to specify the sectors which the bank has identified as stressed

Mumbai: Third largest private sector lender Axis Bank is setting aside more capital, more than twice over the regulatory requirements, for loans in sectors it has identified as ""stressed"", a senior official has said.
The bank is maintaining a standard asset provisioning of 1 percentage point for bad loans in such sectors, as against the regulatory provision of 0.40 per cent, its executive director Rajiv Anand told PTI.
The move, which is being followed at least since April, comes amid continuing concerns on high quantum of non-performing assets in its book. The high level of NPAs and the ensuing provisioning have impacted the profits of a majority of lenders, including Axis Bank, over the past four years.
""In sectors identified as high risk, we have increased the standard provisioning to 100 bps as against the mandated 40 bps to take care of any concerns,"" Anand said.
In April 2019, the bank had first disclosed that it had started to provide extra capital, but had not given out the exact levels of the additional provisioning or spelled out the sectors.
When asked if the troubled sectors like real estate or non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) are included on the list, Anand declined to specify the sectors which the bank has identified as stressed.
""We have not closed lending to any sector because of the difficulties that it may be going through. In each sector, there are always strong names which is better rated and has a resilient business model,"" Anand made it clear.
Concerns on higher capital burn due to policies like these can be placated by ensuring that the lending to a particular sector is not very high, which is decided by an internal team.
Anand said the bank has overhauled its risk assessment framework, wherein loan origination is separated from underwriting, and has a chief credit officer reporting directly to the chief executive.
Amid reports of its larger rival ICICI Bank shuttering its project finance, Anand hinted that Axis Bank is also following a similar strategy.
""We generally avoid project finance and our focus is now much more towards cash flow generating businesses and look at the relationship in a manner where we can deliver the full capabilities of our group to the customer,"" he said.
Anand avoided a direct reply when asked if there is demand from greenfield projects but said it will not be apt to classify the loans merely as refinance, adding it is witnessing working capital demand as well.
The bank is targeting to grow its overall book 5-8 per cent above the system average, and that private sector banks have been garnering a higher percentage of market share in both loans and deposits lately whereas state-owned banks still are starved of growth capital.
In the comments that come amid difficulties on asset quality or mergers plaguing public sector banks, Anand said over half of the incremental liabilities are coming to the private sector banks, while in loans, the share is at a much higher 75 per cent.
On the macro economic prospects, Anand pins hopes on more monetary easing and growth-enhancing measures put forth by the government, but concedes that the second half will also be difficult.
The pick-up will be visible from the first half of FY21, he said, on the back of growth slipping to an over six-year low of 4.5 per cent for the September quarter.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

In a volatile trading session, the Indian benchmark indices swung both ways before closing flat at 11,937 levels. Sensex rose 42.28 points to close at 40,487.43 while Nifty settled above 11,930.
""The broader markets ended on a mixed note with BSE Midcap closing marginally higher and smallcap ending lower by 0.4%. The sectoral indices exhibited mixed trend.

Going forward, market participants would keep a close watch on CPI, IIP and WPI numbers scheduled to release this week. On the global front, trade deal developments between US-China would be a key determinant in deciding the direction for Indian as well as global markets.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said the market was range bound as investors are closely watching the upcoming economic macros like CPI inflation and IIP data for any signs of progress in government's effort to revive the economy. ""FIIs are likely to turn risk averse in domestic market as strong US job data, progress in trade talks & expectation of status quo policy from US FED will add impetus to global market,"" he said.

FASTag came into force from Sunday across the national highways. The government has mandated FASTag for toll payments from December 15 onwards.
At a toll plaza, 75% lanes will be accepting FASTag whereas 25% 'hybrid lanes' will continue operating till the government enforces mandatory usage of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based FASTag for all.
However, at every toll plaza pan India one hybrid lane will remain operative for the vehicles from both directions.
At Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza on National Highway 48, Sunil Agarwal, a commuter, said: ""Non-stop passing of cars at the toll plazas is helping us in saving our time and fuel. People should accept it positively.""
However, before plastic money comes into full force without exemption, the commuters queueing up in the cash lanes expressed concerns.
""We are facing trouble. The government has extended the deadline for another month. However, toll plazas are not opening enough gates for cash payment. Earlier we used to get daily passes but now money will be deducted each time we cross the toll. It's a trouble,"" said Rakesh Kashyap, a businessman who is yet to buy FASTag.
Hybrid lanes, which are yet to go cashless after the latest extended relaxation of FASTag for a month, are experiencing long queues resulting in a massive traffic jam at the Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza.
In addition, the government is offering incentives of 2.5 per cent cashback in FASTags till March 2020. However, cars without FASTag will be charged double the amount.
Standing in queues where people are buying FASTags, Rishab, 25, while waiting for his turn, said: ""It will take time for the people to accept and adjust to the usage of plastic money at toll plazas. It is hugely beneficial if the system works properly.""

3,2019-12-17,Axis Bank,"'I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,' SBI chairman saidIn the past, both Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank

Mumbai: Two of India's top bankers on Tuesday opined that Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) is best suited to acquire smaller and capital-starved rival Yes Bank.
Yes Bank's capital buffers have dipped on accelerated non-performing assets recognition under new chief executive Ravneet Gill earlier this year.
The private sector lender's capital raising plan is also passing through uncertainties and there are speculations on whether Yes Bank is an acquisition target, which has been denied by its management.
""I think Uday (Kotak) is the best candidate to acquire Yes Bank. You need deep pockets, Uday has that,"" SBI Chairman Rajnish Kumar said at Times Network's India Economic Conclave here.
When the same question was posed to third-largest lender Axis Bank's Managing Director and CEO Amitabh Chaudhry, it was answered with the same suggestion.
""We (Axis Bank) are a smaller bank. We are trying to ensure that we grow big so that at some stage we can acquire others. So, yes Mr Kotak, they are best suited rather than us,"" he said.
When contacted, Kotak Mahindra Group Chief Communication Officer Rohit Rao said, ""these are comments made by other bankers and reflect their views, and not ours"".
In the past, both Axis Bank and KMB have been discussed as potential suitors for Yes Bank.
According to some watchers, acquiring a bank can help Uday Kotak reduce the promoter stake in KMB, and help him get closer to the levels mandated by the RBI.
The regulator has been dragged to the court by KMB for not accepting an earlier attempt at stake dilution and the same petition is slated to be heard early next year.
Meanwhile, speaking at the same event, Kotak said there is a need to resist a ""colonialisation"" of Indian finance, hinting at share sales to foreign investors.
""I'm looking forward to best in class quality but strong Indian-owned and controlled financial sector and while we must attract foreign capital, we must ensure that there is no colonialisation of Indian finance,"" Kotak said.
Yes Bank had to cut its book size by 7 per cent in the September quarter because of the capital constraints and has been looking to finish the capital raising exercise at the earliest.
The lender had first announced it has interest from investors of USD 3 billion, and a few days later disclosed offers of USD 2 billion. It wanted to finalise the same at the last board meet on December 10 but was not able to take a decision.
Yes Bank's share price plummeted to  ₹32 apiece in October as against a high of  ₹400 just a year ago and has been one of the most volatile scrips on the bourses

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."
