Mumbai: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd and Max Financial Services Ltd are the top bets in the listed insurance space, making a case for private firms and strong prospects for the life insurance industry. 
Mumbai: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd and Max Financial Services Ltd are the top bets in the listed insurance space, making a case for private firms and strong prospects for the life insurance industry.
ICICI Prudential Life, which is tracked by 16 analysts, had 14 of them rating it a buy or outperform, while two gave it hold ratings, data from Bloomberg showed.
“There are not too many attractive options in general insurance space. Underpenetration in the life insurance sector is higher than general insurance, indicating that there are stronger prospects of growth in the former,"" said Vishal Rampuria, research analyst at HDFC Securities Ltd.
“India’s Life Insurance sector is poised for strong growth, driven in part by the financialisation of savings post demonetisation,"" he added.
The tide seems to be in favour of private life insurers, data showed.
In a note on 12 December, JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd pointed out that private insurers’ average premium equivalent (APE) market share increased to 51.2% in November driven by strong APE growth of 30% over a year ago, compared with industry growth of 24%. 
This has come in addition to the higher base in November 2016 on account of demonetisation.
IIFL initiated coverage on ICICI Prudential Life with a buy rating on 21 September, with a 12-month target price of Rs480.
ICICI Prudential Life stock has delivered relatively moderate gains since its listing in September 2016. It saw a weak listing, adding 14.67% from the offer price.
“IPru Life is well positioned to capture growth opportunities arising from the buoyant equity markets, given its predominant positioning as seller of unit-linked products (Ulips),"" IIFL said in the note.
“A well-established franchise, upbeat growth outlook, improving profitability metrics, and a strong capital position place IPru Life favourably among private sector life insurers,"" IIFL had said in September.
Also, Max Financial Services, the holding company of Max Life Insurance Co. Ltd, has 11 buy or outperform ratings, and one hold rating. 
In a note on 28 December, HDFC Securities initiated coverage on Max Financial with a buy rating, saying it has a well-balanced product mix with a focus on longer duration products, and it benefits from exclusive bancassurance tie-ups with Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd. 
On the other hand, all the seven analysts tracking SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and all the four brokerages tracking HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd have a buy or outperform rating on the respective stocks.
Axis Securities initiated coverage on SBI Life with a buy rating on 7 December, citing the company had an unparalleled distribution network, leadership in new business premium (NBP) among private insurers, strong management team and top quartile service ratios.
On 20 December, Morgan Stanley started coverage on HDFC Standard Life with an “outperform"" rating, despite high valuations.
“While near-term upside appears limited following strong share price performance since HDFC Life’s listing on Nov 17, 2017 ( around 13% upside relative to our Rs425 price target), our positive rating is driven by HDFC Life’s superior franchise and high focus on protection,"" Morgan Stanley analysts added.
HDFC Standard Life shares debuted at a 18.71% premium—the most among listed insurers, and are currently 34.41% higher than the issue price, at Rs389.80 a share."

New Delhi: ICICI Bank on Tuesday moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Essar Power Jharkhand Ltd for recovery of a default amount of over Rs3,068 crore as of 15 December 2017.  
New Delhi: ICICI Bank on Tuesday moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) against Essar Power Jharkhand Ltd for recovery of a default amount of over Rs3,068 crore as of 15 December 2017. 
The bank had dispersed a principal amount of Rs3,033 crore as loan to Essar Power Jharkhand and a notice for recovery was served on 1 August 2016. A bench comprising Chief Justice M.M. Kumar and justice S.K. Mohapatra issued a notice to Essar Power Jharkhand in the matter. 
“Essar Power Jharkhand Ltd is the only incomplete project in Essar Power Ltd’s portfolio, and was setting up a 1,200 MW thermal power project in Jharkhand state. The Company has achieved 43% completion of the project. The entire equity committed by the promoters has been brought in. The project has not progressed thereafter since the Honourable Supreme Court cancelled the two coal blocks linked to the project in September 2014, and the Lenders stopped all debt disbursement because of this development,"" an Essar spokesperson said. 
In another proceeding, SBI filed an insolvency application against Shakti Bhog Foods Ltd for recovery of a default amount of Rs2,045 crore. Shakti Bhog features in the Reserve Bank of India’s second defaulter list of August 2017. 
Both the matters are listed for hearing on 16 January."
665,2018-01-12,ICICI,"The admission comes days after Quickheal had warned lenders of the presence of a malware in the mobile banking apps running on the popular operating system, Android

Mumbai: Days after a cyber security firm warned of a malware breaching into mobile applications, ICICI Bank on Friday said there is no “significant"" threat from it to its customers.  
Mumbai: Days after a cyber security firm warned of a malware breaching into mobile applications, ICICI Bank on Friday said there is no “significant"" threat from it to its customers. 
“Whatever we have seen, the malware seems to be not very significant,"" bank’s chief technology and digital officer B. Madhivanan told reporters over a conference call. Quickheal, a Pune-based cyber security firm, had warned lenders of the presence of a malware in the mobile banking apps running on the popular operating system, Android.
“Anyone who wants to sell their anti-malware kind of products, they have the right to continuously test and bring it in,"" Madhivanan said, retorting to the warning from the anti-virus maker last week. According to media reports, Quickheal had spotted a malware that imitates over 200 apps, including some offered by some of the domestic banks.
The malware is distributed through a fake flash player app and can ultimately trick the user into sharing his/her login details and password for any of the 232 applications, if they are present on the device. The cyber security firm asked users not to download any apps from third-party stores or links provided in SMSes/emails to keep their credentials safe, according to media reports. 
“There is always somebody or the other who is trying to attack, and that’s how this entire world of cyber criminals works. But given the multilevel securities that we have put in place, we believe we are extremely capable of defending it within our entire financial structure,"" Madhivanan said. 
He asserted that in its ten-year history, the bank’s mobile banking, which was the first such application to be launched by any bank, has not “had even one single incident of a technical breach"" which harmed customers. The incidents which have been faced are due to “social re-engineering"", rather than “technical"" faults, he claimed. 
“Our bigger worry has never been on the technical security part. It’s always been on social engineering fraud, where customers are giving away some of this data where they are cheated by someone masquerading as an Aadhaar person or a telecom person,"" he said. 
To check and avoid any mishaps, the bank has a strong security architecture which consists of a chief security officer, two network operation centres and a security operation centre, he said. The bank has 8 million customers using its mobile app, which is growing fast, he said, adding mobile transactions now account for half of its overall digital transactions and will soon be overtaking Internet banking.
“Growth of mobile transactions is much faster than the incremental transactions through the Internet. We expect mobile transactions to overtake it and become the new standard when it comes to banking transaction,"" he said. In FY17, it handled Rs2.4 trillion worth of transactions through mobile banking, which hit Rs3.1 trillion by October 2017, he said."
667,2018-01-12,ICICI,"IRDA should have applied the principles of proportionality before resorting to such extreme measures of transfer, merger or winding up of an insurance business altogether

Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday set aside an order by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) asking Sahara Life Insurance to transfer its life insurance business to ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd. 
Mumbai: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Thursday set aside an order by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) asking Sahara Life Insurance to transfer its life insurance business to ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
The appellate court has asked the insurance regulator to hear the matter afresh and pass orders within three months. However, it upheld the appointment of an external administrator for Sahara Life. 
As per the IRDA Act, the regulator can appoint an administrator if it feels policyholders’ interests may be compromised. The administrator looks at the day-to-day affairs of the insurer and suggests a revival plan. 
In a first of its kind order on 28 July, IRDA had directed the transfer of Sahara’s insurance business. Following this, Sahara had filed an appeal in SAT saying that “the unilateral and drastic action (of) IRDA(is) in gross violation of the principles of natural justice and the various provisions of the Insurance Act"". 
According to the tribunal, the insurance regulator should have applied the principles of proportionality before resorting to such extreme measures of transfer, merger or winding up of an insurance business altogether. “The action must commensurate with the nature of the violation in a given case,"" SAT said in its order.
SAT also directed that the regulator place the administrator’s recommendations before Sahara and IRDA give the firm an opportunity to examine and respond to the proposals. In the order, SAT held that the appointment of an administrator is more in the nature of an administrative order.
“Appointment of an administrator is purely a temporary measure by the IRDA, primarily to bring the affairs of the insurer back on the right track and thereby protect the interests of the policyholders,"" said SAT. 
In an emailed statement, Sahara said, “Sahara Life Insurance got a major respite and its stand was vindicated by SAT, when it remanded and restored the whole matter to the file of the IRDA with a direction to proceed from the stage of seeking a representation/response from Sahara Life."" 
Somasekhar Sundaresan, the lawyer representing IRDA, said that regulator was examining the order.
 “We are studying the order and will decide the next course of action. The Tribunal has upheld the control over the business in the hands of the administrator but has said we must give another hearing. A view will be taken on larger policy issues since for IRDA, this is not just a situation in one case but a stand that will have implications in all future cases,"" said Sundaresan."

New Delhi:ICICI Lombard General Insurance on Monday reported a 5.20% increase in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs231.76 crore for the quarter ended 31 December 2017.  
New Delhi:ICICI Lombard General Insurance on Monday reported a 5.20% increase in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs231.76 crore for the quarter ended 31 December 2017. 
A subsidiary of ICICI Bank, the general insurance firm had earned a PAT of Rs220.30 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. Total income rose to Rs2,019.77 crore from Rs1,842.93 crore in the year-ago period, ICICI Lombard said in a BSE filing. This is the second quarterly result of the company after going public in September last year. 
During the quarter, the company reported provision of tax of Rs90.59 crore as against Rs5.44 crore in the year-ago period. The results for third quarter and nine-month period ended December 2016 were impacted due to effect of excess tax provision written back of earlier years. 
During the quarter, the company’s gross premium written rose to Rs3,001.53 crore as compared to Rs2,542.32 crore in the year-ago period. Also, the solvency ratio improved to 2.21 times as against 2.01 times in December, 2016. The regulatory requirement is 1.50 times.

663,2018-01-17,ICICI,"ICICI Lombard reported a modest 5% rise in its net profit to Rs231.76 crore for the quarter to December but the key highlight was the sharp drop in expense ratios

Investors of insurance company stocks love falling expenses as that is the only way an insurer will make quick profits given its long-term nature.  
Investors of insurance company stocks love falling expenses as that is the only way an insurer will make quick profits given its long-term nature. 
ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd delivered just that in the third quarter (Q3) results and a 3.8% gain in the stock on Tuesday should occasion no surprise.
The company reported a modest 5% rise in its net profit to Rs231.76 crore for the quarter ended December but the key highlight was the sharp drop in expense ratios. Management expenses as a percentage of gross direct premium income fell to 23.5% from 25.9% because the insurer managed to keep a lid on its commissions to agents as well as other operating expenses. Total expenses, however, rose marginally by 7% for the nine-month period ended December 2017. 
The result was an improvement in the combined ratio—a gauge of incurred losses and expenses as a percentage of premiums earned—to 96% from 106.6% a year ago. For the entire nine months ended December, the combined ratio improved to 100.4% from 106.2%.
This means that ICICI Lombard made an operating profit in Q3 through its underwriting business. The company’s loss ratio also improved to 76.3% from 79.8%.
The big question is whether this would sustain going forward. The insurer’s management is also not confident of maintaining the current ratios, although chief financial officer Gopal Balachandran did say that the endeavour would be to not let the ratios deteriorate from here.
Interestingly, brokerage firm Macquarie just a week ago had flagged concerns and rated the stock an “underperform."" Macquarie is worried that there is too much lag between expenses incurred on insurance business and premiums collected, which indicates that the general insurer will struggle to keep its operating profit intact. Further, the grossly under-penetrated general insurance market is too enticing to ignore and the competition is heating up.
The brokerage firm’s concerns are certainly not misplaced. ICICI Lombard’s gross direct premium income grew 17% in the nine months ended December and this would increase if the insurer is serious about expanding its market share, currently about 8%. Growth in business will bring losses upfront to the company. That means the underwriting profit or operating profit would likely peter out.
The ICICI Lombard stock trades at a rich premium of 6.4 times its estimated book value for fiscal year 2020. Considering the headwinds of competition and possible rise in expenses, the valuation looks unsustainable."

Davos: The Indian economy is seeing broad-based improvement across all sectors and should clock 7% growth in the second half of the current fiscal, top banker Chanda Kochhar said on Monday.
In Davos to participate in the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) annual meeting, to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other world leaders, the ICICI Bank chief said the full fiscal GDP growth for 2017-18 should also be in excess of 6.5%. 
Asked about her message to the world at Davos, Kochhar told PTI in an interview that things are turning around very clearly and there are broad improvements across several sectors. Brushing aside any concerns about slowing growth rate, she said the CSO has estimated 6.5% GDP growth and 6.1% gross value add (GVA) growth in the current financial year ending 31 March.
“Given that GDP growth in the first half was 6 per cent, this estimate already indicates a robust positive momentum in growth to 7 per cent in the second half of the (financial) year. High frequency indicators are already showing signs of improvement,"" she said. “For consumption related areas, a favourable trend is visible in IIP data on consumer non-durables, personal loan growth, domestic passenger traffic, automobile sales and two wheeler sales,"" she added. 
On the industrial front, manufacturing PMI, credit to industry and manufacturing sector IIP have shown marked improvement in recent months, Kochhar said. On the external front, trade growth is higher compared to last year and India’s forex reserves build-up now provides a robust import cover for over 12 months, she said. “We are even more optimistic and expect growth to be higher than 6.5 per cent in 2017-18. This will be supported by renewed build-up of supply chains, improved consumption demand and better export performance. We expect growth on GVA basis to be at 6.4 per cent which is higher than what the CSO currently expects,"" she said. 
On India’s message to Davos leaders, Kochhar said, “We can confidently say that growth is expected to pick up from here on"". The eminent banker also said that in the last four years, India has taken a comprehensive approach and worked on multiple fronts, including economic, social and institutional reforms that will yield dividends in the long run and ensure a sustainable high growth path.
Further, reforms have accelerated the process of formalisation of the economy and India is transforming and is in a strong position to become the fastest growing large economy in the world, she added. PTI"
661,2018-01-25,ICICI,"ICICI Lombard and Practo have collaborated to launch IL Take Care healthcare app that lets users book medical appointments, view reports and manage personal health data

New Delhi: ICICI Lombard General Insurance on Wednesday announced a partnership with healthcare platform Practo to offer out-patient insurance products. 
New Delhi: ICICI Lombard General Insurance on Wednesday announced a partnership with healthcare platform Practo to offer out-patient insurance products.
The two have collaborated to launch a healthcare app, IL Take Care, that lets users book medical appointments, order medicines, view reports and manage personal health data.
The app leverages Practo’s network of doctors, profiles of its hundreds of thousands of users and an infrastructure created by Practo to manage exchange of information like prescriptions and bills. 
Using that to power its app, ICICI Lombard plans to offer a slew of out-patient health insurances products to users.
“This one-of-its-kind solution covers outpatient (OPD) expenses of all its customers,"" the two companies said in a joint statement.
Out-patient insurance, also called OPD insurance, where insurers pay claims for doctor appointments and medicines—essentially “out-of-hospital"" claims—is fairly popular in developed countries but is offered, with limited scope, by only a handful of Indian insurance companies. 
The key hurdle is the lack of authentic digital records of patients, their health history and a digitized infrastructure for prescriptions and medical bills. 
“The app meets key customer requirements with respect to their primary healthcare needs. This includes hassle-free, real-time claim authentication of expenses such as doctor consultation, medical tests, pharmacy spends etc. It also empowers the user to access a cashless network comprising of specialized doctors. The app thus addresses a key problem of customers wherein they were hitherto required to pay for OPD expenses from their own pocket,"" the statement said. 
Patients insured under relevant policies from ICICI Lombard taking the service from a doctor or a medical establishment empanelled with the platform will be able to make use of this solution.
Practo, which started out as a medical appointment booking app in 2008, has thousands of doctors and clinics who use its software and patients who use the consumer-facing app. 
The Bengaluru-based company has built a platform on top of that infrastructure, calling it Practo Trinity, and is pitching it to insurance companies."

New Delhi: The country’s largest fund house ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. will soon wind up two small-cap schemes run by its portfolio management division as “too much money is chasing very few quality"" stocks.
The money invested in these schemes will be returned to investors, according to the company. The portfolio management services (PMS) division manages money of high networth individuals. “We are currently in the process of winding up ICICI Prudential’s PMS schemes—PIPE and Smallcap Portfolio Series I,"" Nimesh Shah, who is the managing director and chief executive of the fund house said in a statement.
“We are in a situation where the valuations are very rich and too much money is chasing very few quality small cap companies,"" he added.
Currently, ICICI Prudential PMS manages investors’ funds to the tune of Rs4,000 crore, while overall the fund house has an assets under management of over Rs2.93 trillion. “Keeping the client interest in mind, we would be returning entire capital and profits to investors,"" he added.
Alternately, the fund house has recommended investors to invest in ICICI Prudential’s Wellness PMS which is a play on healthcare and allied sectors as a theme. Besides, it said that flexi cap could be another option given the investments will be spread across market capitalisation.
“Our decision of returning money to investors is in line with ICICI Prudential AMC’s philosophy that ‘return of capital is also important along with return on capital’,"" he said.
This is not the first time wherein the AMC has taken this kind of step. “Infact, this is the third product after ICICI Prudential PMS Wellness Portfolio (launched in March 2013) and ICICI Prudential PMS Exports Portfolio (launched in June 2013) where we have booked profits and distributed capital with profits,"" Shah said."

Since September, as many as five insurance firms have been listed, namely SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company Ltd, New India Assurance Company Ltd and General Insurance Corporation of India, along with Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, a mutual fund. 
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd was listed in 2016.
“So, options are more for asset managers in the financial space,"" Jain said.
Mutual funds stocked up on ICICI Bank shares to the tune of Rs9,928 crore. Mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corp. was a new entrant to the top 10 holdings list of mutual funds as the second most-bought stock. Mutual funds collectively bought Rs8,889 crore worth of the company’s stock.
“ICICI Bank was available at good value early in 2017. HDFC was preferred heavily in 2017 due to the government’s low-cost housing push,"" Belapurkar said.
Surprisingly, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd was the most sold stock by asset managers as they dumped Rs2,410 crore of the stock that slipped two positions to become the eighth-most held stock by domestic MFs. 
“Fund managers locked in gains in Maruti after the sharp rally,"" Belapurkar added."

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd on Wednesday reported a 32.42% fall in fiscal third-quarter profit as the bank set aside more money to cover the risk of default on bad loans.

Provisions and contingencies rose 31.59% to  ₹ ,569.56 crore from  ₹ ,712.70 crore a year ago. On a quarter-on-quarter, they fell 20.73% from  ₹ 4,502.93 crore.
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose 20.88% to Rs46,038.70 crore at the end of the December quarter from Rs38.084.97 crore in the same quarter last year.
As on 31 December, ICICI Bank had outstanding loans of Rs10,060.75 crore to 18 account holders against which insolvency proceedings have been initiated; of that, 98.6% amounting to Rs9,915.06 crore has been advanced to accounts classified as NPA.

656,2018-02-01,ICICI,"ICICI Bank's management has guided that provisioning costs are unlikely to come down in the following quarters too as clarity on IBC-referred loans will emerge only beyond April

Following two brutal years that wreaked havoc on its loan portfolio, ICICI Bank Ltd is finally turning the corner on asset quality. The largest private sector lender saw its fresh slippages fall for the second straight quarter and its bad loan ratios improve. 
Following two brutal years that wreaked havoc on its loan portfolio, ICICI Bank Ltd is finally turning the corner on asset quality. The largest private sector lender saw its fresh slippages fall for the second straight quarter and its bad loan ratios improve.
For the December quarter, the bank reported an accretion of Rs4,368 crore to its bad loan stock, the lowest addition in nine quarters. What is encouraging is that its stock of total stressed assets, which includes loans internally rated below investment grade and restructured loans under various schemes, has fallen by about 30%. Clearly, stress is reducing. But it would be hazardous to ignore the fact that a large chunk of corporate loans (about Rs10,000 crore) are tied to court proceedings because of being referred under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). To be fair to the lender, ICICI Bank has made the required 50% provisioning to the first set of 12 accounts under IBC but it still has to make 14% more with regards to the second set of 18 accounts. 
The management has guided that provisioning costs are unlikely to come down in the following quarters too as clarity on the IBC referred loans will emerge only after April.
But before we rejoice, the lender and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have looked differently on a set of loans to be labelled bad. This divergence highlighted by RBI in its inspection of the lender’s FY17 accounts is under 15% of its reported gross non-performing assets for the year. Therefore, by regulation, ICICI Bank is not obligated to disclose. This means that the divergence is below Rs6,000 crore. Given that it is no small figure, the lender would gain investor trust by disclosing the divergence figure rather than just following the letter of the law. 
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank is back to doing what it did best before the bad loan blowout— lend to the retail customer. Its retail loans galloped at 22% while its corporate loan book grew just 4.2%. However, recall that in the December quarter of FY17, loan growth was anaemic due to demonetization. So growth percentages for the third quarter this time should be discounted. 
Furthermore, a look at the core income growth begins to cause some concern. ICICI Bank’s net interest income growth continues to languish in single digits and its operating profit fell by over 8%. The current fiscal year hasn’t been good in terms of operating metrics. The fall in operating profit is due to the absence of any gain from its treasury and overseas operations. It is unlikely that these two factors would begin to contribute to operating profit any time soon. 
The ICICI Bank stock has risen 17%, outperforming the benchmark Sensex in the last three months. Perhaps it is time to temper expectations in the light of operating performance."

New Delhi: ICICI Securities, a subsidiary of private sector lender ICICI Bank, has received markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (Sebi) go-ahead to raise an estimated Rs3,000- 4,000 crore through an initial public offering (IPO).
The company had filed its draft papers with Sebi in December and received ‘observations’ from the regulator on 2 February, as per the latest update with the markets watchdog. The ‘observations’ are very important to any company for launching public issues like IPO, follow-on public offer (FPO) and rights issue. 
Going by the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP), the public issue comprises sale of 64,428,280 equity shares, amounting to 20% stake, by ICICI Bank. The offer includes a reservation of up to 32.21 lakh shares for individual as well as Hindu Undivided Family (HUF) shareholders of ICICI Bank. According to merchant banking people in the know, the IPO is expected to garner Rs3,000-4,000 crore.
“The objects of the offer for the company are to achieve the benefit of listing the equity shares on the stock exchanges. Further, the company expects that the listing of equity shares will enhance its visibility and brand image and provide liquidity to its existing shareholders,"" the preliminary papers noted.

New Delhi: The IPO lane seems to get busier as over two dozen companies have lined up initial share sale plans worth Rs25,000 crore in the coming months, largely to fund their expansion projects and working capital requirements.
Hindustan Aeronautics, ICICI Securities, Barbeque Nation Hospitality and Flemingo Travel Retail are among the names that plan to launch their initial public offerings (IPOs) in the coming months.
Most of these companies plan to utilise IPO proceeds for business expansion as well as working capital requirements, as per the draft papers filed with Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the country’s capital markets regulator.
Besides, some of the firms believe the listing of equity shares on bourses will enhance their brand name and provide liquidity to existing shareholders.
Barbeque Nation Hospitality, ICICI Securities, Bharat Dynamics and Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency have secured Sebi’s go-ahead this year to float their IPOs.
In addition, 20 companies including RITES, Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd, Bandhan Bank, IndoStar Capital Finance, Nazara Technologies and Route Mobile are awaiting the regulator’s approval to float IPOs. 
Together, these companies are expected to raise nearly Rs25,000 crore, merchant banking officials said.
Moreover, five companies, including Newgen Software Technologies and Amber Enterprises India, have already hit the capital markets 
According to experts, the IPO market will continue to see hectic activity as over a dozen firms are awaiting Sebi’s nod to launch their public issues. 
Besides, higher valuation of secondary market would attract investors towards IPOs. The year 2017 saw 36 companies collectively raising over Rs67,000 crore trough their respective IPOs, making it the best year. The previous high being in 2010 when Rs37,535 crore was garnered, almost half the amount. 
Experts said that proactive regulatory environment coupled with uplifted investor sentiment has helped the IPO market."
651,2018-02-28,ICICI,"ICICI Prudential Real Estate Investments has sold four of its five commercial office assets, and with a fifth expected later this year, it will exit all its investments

Bengaluru: ICICI Prudential Real Estate Investments, a division of ICICI Prudential AMC Ltd, has sold four of its five commercial office investments to ultra-rich individual investors and family offices, a top company executive said. 
Bengaluru: ICICI Prudential Real Estate Investments, a division of ICICI Prudential AMC Ltd, has sold four of its five commercial office investments to ultra-rich individual investors and family offices, a top company executive said.
Among them are one individual building, and several standalone office units.
With the fifth exit, expected later this year, it would have exited all its office investments, made during 2012-14 under its portfolio management scheme, Rahul Rai, head of real estate business at ICICI Prudential AMC said. 
ICICI Prudential Real Estate Investments had invested around Rs450 crore across five transactions in Mumbai, Pune and Noida for a 550,000 sq. ft portfolio, which was leased to large international tenants. These exits resulted in an internal rate of return (IRR) of 10-21% on the investments, Rai said.
ICICI Prudential AMC is also currently raising its first commercial office real estate alternative investment fund (AIF) to make fresh investments in pre-leased and finished office assets. 
“There is decent appetite for office investments from HNI (high net-worth individual) investors, given that expectations from the residential sector have been muted. Unlike residential, investments in completed office projects involve less risk,"" Rai added. 
Sanjay Puri, managing director of real estate consultancy Sure Shot Suggestions said there is a lot of demand for ‘strata sale’ in offices, which is basically sale of office units. The consultancy advised on a couple of these exit transactions in The Capital building in Mumbai’s office hub Bandra-Kurla Complex. 
In 2017, ICICI Prudential Real Estate Investments launched its first commercial office AIF—the Rs750 crore ICICI Prudential Office Yield Optimiser Fund, which included a Rs250 crore green-shoe option. A green-shoe option allows a fund to raise additional money from interested investors.
Rai said the first close of the fund has been achieved but did not disclose the amount raised. 
“We look forward to deploy the capital raised and will subsequently consider raising the remaining capital. Over a period of time, we expect the commercial office investment business to grow stronger. For investors, it provides an opportunity to diversify across 5-10 assets,"" Rai said. 
ICICI Prudential Real Estate Investments has around Rs3,700 crore of real estate assets under management, and has thus far made 63 investments and 23 exits. 
Over the last few years, individual investors have largely stayed away from making fresh investments in residential projects while struggling to sell off and exit earlier investments, amid stagnant prices and tepid buyer interest. 
During the same period, the commercial office segment as an asset class has fared much better, with high demand for such space and huge institutional investor interest. 
“With residential investment not generating that kind of yield, there is a lot of interest among individual, smaller investors to buy office space. Because there is no access yet to REITs (real estate investment trusts), where will an individual park his money in real estate,"" asked Juggy Marwaha, executive managing director at property advisory JLL India."
652,2018-02-28,ICICI,"Hindustan Aeronautics, Bandhan Bank, ICICI Securities together are looking to raise more than Rs12,000 crore via IPOs

Mumbai: After a dull start to the year, activity in the initial public offering (IPO) market in India is expected to pick up pace with companies expected to raise more than Rs12,000 crore in the month of March. 
Mumbai: After a dull start to the year, activity in the initial public offering (IPO) market in India is expected to pick up pace with companies expected to raise more than Rs12,000 crore in the month of March.
The first two months of this year witnessed a total IPO fund-raising of Rs3,559 crore from six offerings, with February accounting for just two, data from primary market tracker Prime Database shows.
The IPO activity in March is expected to be led by companies such as state-owned fighter jet maker Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), Bandhan Bank Ltd and ICICI Securities Ltd, according to at least four people aware of the developments.
These three companies together are looking to raise more than Rs12,000 crore, the people cited above said. Several other smaller IPOs are also expected to tap the primary market in March, they added.
Emails sent to HAL, Bandhan Bank and ICICI Securities did not elicit any response.
“February was a volatile month with several factors such as re-introduction of Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) tax, the crash in the US market affecting stock market sentiment globally and thus there were hardly any trades. However, last few sessions have been positive for the market and if the markets are supportive then we could easily see at least 6-7 IPOs in March,"" said one of the persons cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.
India’s benchmark Sensex, which rose 6.37% in January, shed 1,460 points or 4.3% since the start of February to close at 34,436.29 on Tuesday.
Bandhan Bank, one of the two entities to receive a universal banking licence in 2015 and the only microfinance institution to do so, will raise over Rs4,000 crore through its IPO, said one of the persons cited above. 
The IPO will see a dilution of around 10% stake, valuing the company at around at least Rs40,000 crore.
Apart from a fresh issue of up to 97.6 million shares, the Bandhan Bank IPO also consists of an offer for sale of up to 14.05 million shares by International Finance Corp. (IFC) and up to 7.56 million equity shares by IFC FIG Investment Co. IFC and IFC FIG collectively own 4.94% stake in the bank.
The initial share sale of Hindustan Aeronautics, which makes fighter planes such as MiG 21 and MiG-27, Jaguar, Su-30 MkI, among other aircraft, is a pure secondary offering that will see the Indian government dilute a 10% stake in the company.
HAL is engaged in the design, development, manufacture, repair, overhaul, upgrade and servicing of aircraft, helicopters, aero-engines, avionics, accessories and aerospace structures. As of 31 July, the order book of the company stood at Rs63,333 crore.
The IPO of ICICI Securities is also a pure secondary offering, which will see parent ICICI Bank Ltd sell a total of 64.42 million shares for around Rs4,500 crore, said two people cited above. The company offers financial services such as brokerage, financial product distribution, investment banking, merchant banking and advisory.
ICICI Securities will be the third company from the ICICI group to go public. 
Last year, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs5,700 crore in an IPO, the first public offering by an Indian general insurance company. 
In 2016, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs6,000 crore in an initial share sale, the first public offering by an Indian life insurance company."
650,2018-03-02,ICICI,"SBI, PNB and ICICI Bank increased their MCLR by 10-20 basis points on Thursday, a day after SBI raised its FD interest rates

Mumbai: Home and auto loans are set to get costlier as banks increase their benchmark lending rates. State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and ICICI Bank Ltd all increased their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10-20 basis points on Thursday. 
Mumbai: Home and auto loans are set to get costlier as banks increase their benchmark lending rates. State Bank of India (SBI), Punjab National Bank (PNB) and ICICI Bank Ltd all increased their marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10-20 basis points on Thursday.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
After the MCLR system came into effect in April 2016, this is the first time banks have increased the benchmark lending rate, signalling a turn in the interest rate cycle.
SBI increased the one-year MCLR by 20bps to 8.15% from 7.95%, whereas ICICI Bank, the largest private sector bank, raised one-year MCLR by 10bps from 8.20% to 8.30%.
Most banks link lending rates for retail customers in categories such as home loans,personal loans, and auto loans to the one-year MCLR. However, some banks, including ICICI Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, have linked home loans to six-month MCLR. ICICI Bank has also increased it six-month MCLR by 10bps from 8.15% to 8.25%.
The increase in rates comes a day after SBI raised interest rates on term deposits by 10-75bps, which bankers and analysts attributed to tight banking system liquidity conditions. Banking system liquidity is consistently in deficit now compared to a surplus a few months ago. In the past three months, SBI has raised rates on bulk deposits twice. However, this is the first time after demonetization that it has raised term deposit rates on amounts below Rs1 crore.
“This is an impact of increase in cost of funds. Banks have increased the cost of deposit, hence, they will definitely pass on the cost in MCLR. The cost of funds increased because system liquidity has tightened to a great extent in the last few months. You have seen that the bond rates have also gone up quite sharply. The movement is not transitory and likely to remain so for at least six months considering the GDP and inflation numbers,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, a banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.
Existing borrowers on MCLR-linked loans will not see an impact as per their reset clause. For instance, for a home loans taken on November 2017 linked to one-year MCLR, new rates would only kick in a year later in November 2018. For new borrowers, loans will now get immediately expensive. Most banks have a spread, basically a mark-up, on home loans and other consumer loans."

Rs36.8 crore 
Rs36.8 crore
What is it? The net loss of Fortis Healthcare in the October-December quarter of 2017-18, compared to a net profit of Rs442 crore in the same period a year ago.
Why is it important? After allegations of taking Rs500 crore from Fortis surfaced, its former promoters Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivinder Mohan Singh resigned from the board. The latest quarterly results were awaited to see the auditor’s note on accounts. Deloitte Haskins & Sells LLP has said that it cannot give a conclusion on the company’s statement of unaudited financial results, citing insufficient appropriate evidence to form a conclusion.
Tell me more: Fortis’s statutory auditor has raised three main concerns, including ongoing investigations, unsecured advances to vendors and inter-corporate loans, with respect to its earnings in the quarter and nine months ended December 2017. Besides, Fortis has also appointed an external legal firm to probe a few issues, including inter-corporate deposits given by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the parent company.

What is it? The number of banks, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank, that announced an increase in lending rates on Thursday.
Why is it important? This is the first time since April 2016 when the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) regime came into effect that banks have increased lending rates. And, this has happened without the central bank increasing its policy rates. The rate hike will increase the borrowing costs for new loans, and for existing customers, the new rates will come into effect when the interest rates are reset.
Tell me more: Other banks are likely to follow suit. This is because of two key reasons: one, banks’ profitability has been hit due to the high levels of soured loans and two, increase in bond yields of the government, which the lenders have to bear.
50
What is it? The approximate number of countries that have moved away from self-regulatory professional accountant bodies and created independent audit regulators.
Why is it important? India has now joined that list as the cabinet on Thursday approved the draft rules to set up a body called the National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) to monitor auditing and accounting standards in India. NFRA will also have powers to investigate misconduct on part of chartered accountant or CA firms, debar them for up a period of up to 10 years and impose penalty. ICAI, which trains and certifies CAs, gives them licence to practise and regulate them, will continue to exercise these powers on small firms.
Tell me more: The cabinet also approved the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill 2018 to seize the assets of loan defaulters and financial offenders who escape from the country to evade criminal prosecution in cases involving claims of Rs100 crore or more.
3.26
What is it? The minimum National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) score needed by an educational institution to admit more foreign students. 
Why is it important? This will help better ranked institutions like Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management to improve their global rankings, as student diversity will increase. Qualified institutions are also free to fix the fee structure for foreign students. 
Tell me more: NAAC, which accredits higher educational institutions, gives score on a rating scale of 1 to 4. A score between 3.26 and 3.50 is given a letter grade of ‘A+’. And a score above 3.5 to 4 would secure a ‘A++’ grade. 
200-300
What is it? The number of species of ornamental fishes that are being imported by India. 
Why is it important? This number is far higher than 92 species of ornamental fishes permitted to be imported. The unscrupulous import has resulted in higher number of invasive alien species (IAS) that is threatening the aquatic biodiversity. Lack of quarantine facilities at the airports is cited as a reason for higher than allowed import of ornamental fishes. 
Tell me more: IAS are species which are introduced outside their natural habitat, and their introduction threatens biological diversity in the new place.

ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co., one of the country’s largest private insurers, sees things very differently. With yields recently nearing 8%, Manish Kumar, chief investment officer at the firm, says it’s time to go long.
“A yield of 7.7% to 7.8% is a good yield to invest into,"" Kumar, who oversees the equivalent of $22 billion of assets, said in an interview in Mumbai. “While the concerns around the fiscal deficit are genuine, they are also priced in to a good extent.""
Bulls like Kumar are hard to find in a market where a shortage of buyers is contributing to a downward spiral in bond prices. State lenders have been selling  ₹ 530 crore of government debt on average every day this year, hurt by losses on their books, data from the Clearing Corp. of India show.
Yields on the benchmark 10-year debt climbed to a two-year high of 7.82% last month amid concerns the fiscal deficit may widen after the government laid out an ambitious public-spending plan in the 1 February budget. Fears that the central bank may tighten policy this year as economic growth strengthens have fuelled the selloff.
“The best case is no rate hike and the worst is a hike sometime in the fiscal year starting April 1, depending on the inflation trajectory,"" said Kumar. “One rate hike is factored in.""
ICICI Prudential will decide whether to increase the duration of its holdings after assessing the progress of the monsoon, a key barometer that determines food inflation in India. The insurer cut the duration to 3.5-to-four years over the past six months, down from last year’s average of 6.5-to-seven years, Kumar said. Bloomberg"
646,2018-03-16,ICICI,"ICICI Securities, an arm of ICICI Bank, has fixed a narrow price band at Rs519-520 per share for its IPO to raise little over Rs4,000 crore

Mumbai: ICICI Securities Ltd, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank Ltd, on Thursday said it will launch its Rs4,017 crore initial public offering (IPO) on 22 March. 
Mumbai: ICICI Securities Ltd, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank Ltd, on Thursday said it will launch its Rs4,017 crore initial public offering (IPO) on 22 March.
ICICI Securities has set a price band of Rs519-520 per share for the IPO. At the upper end of the price band, the share sale values the company at Rs16,751 crore. The latest valuation is lower than the initially targeted valuation of Rs25,000 crore at the time of filling its draft red herring prospectus (DRHP). The offer will close on 26 March.
The share sale is a pure secondary offering that will see the parent ICICI Bank sell a total of 77.24 million shares. The secondary offering will include a reservation of 3.86 million shares for ICICI Bank’s shareholders.
Incorporated in 1995, ICICI Securities offers financial services such as retail and institutional broking, financial product distribution, investment banking, merchant banking and advisory services to financial institutions, corporates, retail investors and high net-worth individuals.
According to Chanda Kochhar, chairperson of ICICI Securities, the company has been the largest equity broking firm since 2014. “We will continue to grow on the back of technological innovation and our growing network,"" said Kochhar.
With the launch of ICICIdirect in 2000, the company started offering brokerage services online.
According to Shilpa Kumar, MD and CEO of ICICI Securities, approximately 95% of its brokerage transactions are done online.
“90% of our total brokerage revenues comes from the retail,"" said Kumar, adding that “40% of our total revenues come from non-broking business.""
According to Kumar, ICICI Securities will capitalize on Indian financial savings environment that is undergoing a fundamental transformation with the initiative of government such as demonetization, Aadhaar, financial inclusion and direct benefit transfer, and also on digital transformation trend.
“We will continue to invest in technology and innovation, strategically expand our financial product distribution business through cross-selling and diversify revenue streams,"" added Kumar.
In 2016-17, ICICI Securities reported total revenue of Rs1,403 crore, up 25% from the previous fiscal. The company’s profit rose by 43% to Rs337.61 crore in 2016-17 from a year earlier.
DSP Merrill Lynch Ltd, Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt. Ltd, CLSA India Pvt. Ltd, Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd, IIFL Holdings Ltd and SBI Capital Markets Ltd are managing the ICICI Securities IPO.
ICICI Securities will be the third company from the ICICI group to go public.
Last year, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs5,700 crore in an IPO, the first public offering by an Indian general insurance company.
In 2016, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs6,000 crore in an initial share sale, the first public offering by an Indian life insurance company.
In 2017, 33 companies raised Rs65,923 crore through IPOs, a record for the Indian primary market, according to data from primary market tracker Prime Database. In 2016, 26 companies had raised Rs26,493.8 crore from the IPO market."

Trading website icicidirect.com claims to bring investment to your fingertips. The platform is the front of brokerage firm ICICI Securities, which gets more than half its revenue from retail brokerage alone. Now it will add another investment to your fingertips—its own shares. 
Trading website icicidirect.com claims to bring investment to your fingertips. The platform is the front of brokerage firm ICICI Securities, which gets more than half its revenue from retail brokerage alone. Now it will add another investment to your fingertips—its own shares.
In doing so, ICICI Securities hopes that its existing customers (3.8 million of them) and others will be willing to bet on the profitability it derives by charging them brokerage and subscribe to the approximately 77 million shares it would sell through an initial public offering (IPO).
So what will investors get into if they buy the stock? The company is betting on getting a lift off from the shift in household savings to financial assets from physical assets in the aftermath of demonetization. Besides this, the strong performance of the capital markets in the last fiscal year has emboldened retail investors to open over 30 million demat accounts so far in 2017-18. That is a testament to the fact that the average Indian is picking stocks, bonds and mutual funds instead of real estate and gold and firms like ICICI Securities have the edge to capitalize on this. Add the strong pedigree of ICICI Securities and also good growth metrics, the IPO is sure to attract investors.
Being the largest brokerage firm in terms of active customers and brokerage revenue, the compounded annual growth rate of 19% in revenues during FY13-17 should not be taken lightly. But brokerage income is subject to the vicissitudes of capital markets. To counter this, ICICI Securities has been growing its non-brokerage income rapidly too, the share of which is now in excess of 30% of its total revenue.
Nevertheless, much of the response to the IPO depends on how the company stands vis-à-vis its peers in terms of valuation. ICICI Securities is valued at Rs16,750 crore at the upper end of the IPO price band of Rs519-520 which works out to about 30 times its estimated earnings per share for fiscal year 2017-18. The closest comparable firm, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, currently trades at a multiple of 29 times its earnings per share for fiscal 2017-18.
Unfortunately, the odds are stacked against the markets in the coming months with the dividends of a low interest rate regime and high liquidity coming to an end globally as well as locally. Maintaining the run rate of its revenue and income growth would be a challenge for the firm. To really win the heart of investors, ICICI Securities will have to show that it has risen above the vagaries of the market. Getting bids for the IPO may not be tough but getting them from the market after listing through icicidirect.com would be."

New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd on Tuesday said it has raised Rs4,000 crore from bonds to fund growth. 
New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd on Tuesday said it has raised Rs4,000 crore from bonds to fund growth.
“The Committee of Executive Directors of the bank at its meeting held on Tuesday has approved the allotment of 40,000 Basel III compliant unsecured subordinated perpetual Additional Tier 1 bonds in the nature of debentures aggregating Rs4000 crore on private placement basis,"" ICICI Bank said in a regulatory filing to stock exchanges.
“The notes carry a coupon of 9.15% payable annually and were issued at par,"" it said.
The bonds would be listed on the Wholesale Debt Market segment of BSE or National Stock Exchange of India, it said.
Under the Basel-III norms, AT-1 bonds come with loss absorbency features, meaning that in case of stress, banks can write off such investments or convert them into common equity if approved by the RBI.
AT-1 bonds, which qualify as core or equity capital, are one of the means of raising capital by public sector banks that require Rs2.40 trillion, by March 2019 to meet global norms on capital adequacy (Basel III)."

Mumbai: As the initial public offering (IPO) of ICICI Securities Ltd opens for subscription on Thursday, analysts are divided on the valuations of the issue. With a price band of Rs519-520 per share, the securities firm arm of ICICI Bank Ltd is aiming to raise Rs4,017 crore.  
Mumbai: As the initial public offering (IPO) of ICICI Securities Ltd opens for subscription on Thursday, analysts are divided on the valuations of the issue. With a price band of Rs519-520 per share, the securities firm arm of ICICI Bank Ltd is aiming to raise Rs4,017 crore. 
According to Kotak Securities Ltd, at the higher end of the issue price of Rs520 per share, the stock is being offered at 31.5 times nine months FY18 annualized earnings. “Activities in the capital markets business will remain a direct beneficiary of an improving macro environment, shift from physical assets to financial assets and stable government and its policies. Given ICICI Securities’ presence across the different segments and its customer base helps the company to explore new opportunities,"" it said in a note on 20 March. 
The company’s business relies heavily on retail customers. Retail brokerage revenue contributed around 90.5% in the total brokerage revenue in FY17. Its average daily turnover for cash equity and equity derivatives traded by their customers increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61.4% to the six months ended 30 September 2017 from fiscal 2013. Its non-brokerage revenue share increased to 36.4% in nine months of FY18 from 29.7% in FY13. 
However, its high dependency on brokerage income is risky, feels Canara Bank Securities Ltd. “Brokerage income depends on general economic conditions, macroeconomic and monetary policies, market conditions and fluctuations in interest rates, all of which are beyond company control. High level of competition and new technologies may adversely affect the present brokerage revenues,"" it said in a note on 21 March. 
According to Canara Bank Securities, ICICI Securities Ltd has an earnings per share (EPS) of 10.51 and book value of 14.99 for FY17 earnings and at the upper end of the price band, the company would trade at price to earnings (PE) of 49.47 times and price to book value of 34.69. 
An analyst who did not want to be identified said valuations are high. “However, the issue is expected to sail through on expectations of listing gains. The markets are likely to rise in first half of April as selling spree to avoid long term capital gains tax (LTCG) will ebb off and the issue will be beneficiary of these positive factors driving the markets rally,"" the analyst added.
ICICI Bank’s other arms ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd are currently trading 10-14% above their offer price. ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd was listed in 2017 and saw a gain of 3.11% on listing day while ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd listed in 2016 tanked 10.88% on stock markets debut.
ICICI Securities offers a wide range of financial Services including investment banking, institutional broking, retail broking, private wealth management, and financial product distribution. By brokerage revenue, ICICI Securities has been the largest equity broker in India since fiscal 2014."

Mumbai: A growing number of private banks and financial services firms are taking advantage of a vibrant primary market in India to unlock value of their diversified subsidiaries. 
Mumbai: A growing number of private banks and financial services firms are taking advantage of a vibrant primary market in India to unlock value of their diversified subsidiaries.
HDFC’s asset management unit, HDFC Asset Management Co. (AMC), is the latest such firm to announce a new share sale.
The HDFC AMC initial public offer (IPO) will offer up to 25.4 million equity shares through an offer for sale of 8.59 million shares by Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC), and up to 16.8 million shares by Standard Life Investments Ltd.
Similarly, ICICI Securities Ltd, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank Ltd, is launching its Rs4,017 crore IPO on Thursday.
“The financial services space has tremendous opportunity for growth. If the offering is coming in from an established house, the investor confidence is high, and it makes sense to tap the market when appetite is strong,"" said Debasis Panigrahi, executive director at Nomura’s India investment banking unit.
ICICI Securities will be the third company from the ICICI group to go public. 
In September 2017, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs5,700 crore in the first public offering by an Indian general insurance firm.
In September 2016, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd raised Rs6,000 crore in the first public offering by an Indian life insurance firm.
HDFC AMC is also the second asset management company to go public after Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Co. Ltd, which raised Rs1,542 crore last October.
It follows the listing of HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, which raised Rs8,695 crore. 
“From an investment banker’s perspective, BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) gives you the size advantage. The overall deal size is much larger and easy to market to tier-1 accounts and is very attractive to investors,"" added Panigrahi.
BFSI companies contribute 28.70% and 21.37%, respectively, of the market capitalization of Sensex and BSE500 companies.
“The appetite is good for quality issues even at comparatively expensive valuations. This trend of value unlocking in BFSI is here to stay,"" he added.
“The common theme is value unlocking from their subsidiaries as for many of these, the subsidiaries have done better than the parent, too,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, director of financial services research at Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
“ For e.g., ICICI Prudential Life, ICICI Lombard, and ICICI Securities, have fared better than ICICI Bank. Clearly, there is a lot of value. Markets have been strong for the last couple of years. So, they are banking on the robust demand,"" said Ganapathy.
Ganapathy also pointed out that some banks such as ICICI Bank are also using funds from such listings to provide for provisioning for stressed assets.
Public sector banks, following the government push, have also been offloading non-core assets in a bid to shore up capital levels. 
 “I don’t see any reason why public sector banks cannot do it. I guess they will try, too, in the buoyant market,""said Amar Ambani, partner and head of research at IIFL Wealth Management. 
“However, management of PSU banks are focusing on NPAs (non-performing assets) and ongoing frauds for few of them,"" said Ambani.

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to intervene in the bankruptcy proceedings of Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd to include its claim of around $75 million (Rs486 crore).
The bank claimed that the interim resolution professional (IRP) had not included its claim, which was actually a corporate guarantee given by Monnet Ispat in favour of a subsidiary.
Monnet Ispat is part of the first lot of 12 large non-performing loans referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for early resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) last year.
“We had given a loan to Monnet Power Co. Ltd where the parent company, Monnet Ispat, was corporate guarantor. However, the company defaulted on the payment. The corporate guarantee was invoked after the filing of the bankruptcy and, hence, the resolution professional is not including this claim under the category of financial creditor,"" said Gaurav Joshi, senior counsel representing the bank in the dispute.
After hearing arguments, the division bench of B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravi Kumar Duraisamy directed the IRP to explain why the claim of ICICI Bank had not been included in the list of claims, and also directed the creditors’ panel not to meet until further notice.
The tribunal has posted the hearing for 3 April.
The bank further argued that as the statutory time limit of 270 days was coming to an end on 13 April for the company, its claim needed to be included.
An email to ICICI Bank remained unanswered till the time of filing the story.
Monnet Ispat owes lenders Rs10,000 crore and the committee of creditors (CoC) has agreed to take a haircut of around 72% to settle the loan.
So far, a consortium of AION Capital Partners Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd has made a binding offer for Monnet Ispat and is considered to be the front runner to acquire the asset. 
AION Capital holds a 70% stake in the consortium while JSW Steel holds the rest."

The initial public offerings (IPOs) of ICICI Securities Ltd and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) failed to get enough bids to meet their targeted issue size, and experts have squarely blamed the rich valuations these companies were demanding. 
The ICICI Securities issue fared the worst this month, receiving bids for only 88% of the total shares on offer. The pricing was steep, and failed to provide a buffer for investors in case markets fell during the book-building process, pointed out a merchant banker. As it turned out, markets fell late last week owing to heightened fears of a trade war between the US and China, and unsurprisingly, bids for Indian IPOs started to dry up.
Another expert on the primary markets said the brokerage business is cyclical and that it was foolhardy to price the issue at 30-times earnings just when the cycle had begun to turn south. He says that the euphoria in the primary markets isn’t limited to large companies, but is also visible in SME (small and medium enterprise) IPOs. These companies are demanding valuations of 20-25 times earnings, despite the bigger fall in small-cap stocks in the secondary markets. While the BSE 500 index has fallen 9% from its peak in January, the BSE SmallCap index has fallen 14.4%. 
A similar trend has been evident in issuances by government-owned firms, where participation by investors has been the weakest. HAL, for instance, was a long-awaited IPO. But after the issue was priced far higher than what the company’s growth rates warranted, it got barely any bids other than from domestic financial institutions led by Life Insurance Corporation of India. Domestic institutional investors or DIIs (excluding domestic mutual funds) accounted for four-fifths of the total bids received, which helped the issue scrape through with a 99% overall subscription. For the two other public sector issuances this month, DIIs accounted for 54% of total bids received cumulatively.
A look at the table alongside shows that participation by high networth and retail investors has been dismal. While the recent correction in the secondary markets has hit sentiment, another reason is that the so-called listing pop has been missing in a significant number of IPOs lately.
In late 2017, when the government divested its stake in two general insurance companies, investors who bid found that they would have been far better off waiting until listing. The shares listed at a huge discount and continue to trade at a large discount to their issue price. From the looks of it, retail investors have taken home the lesson that it’s best to wait until listing before buying shares of public sector units.
A clear outlier in all this is the Bandhan Bank issue, which received a large amount of bids in each investor category. Analysts say its IPO was an outlier simply because its financial metrics also make it an outlier, with high spreads and low non-performing assets. The bank’s shares listed at a 25% premium to its issue price, despite demanding a stiff valuation in the IPO itself.
The success of the Bandhan issue may tempt bankers and issuing companies to continue to demand high valuations even going forward. But hopefully, the under-subscription in the ICICI Securities and HAL IPOs should act as a wake-up call. As it is, FY18—a record year for IPOs—is ending with a bitter aftertaste."

Mumbai: The board of private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd on Wednesday expressed faith in its managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar, and refuted rumours of wrongdoing in granting loans to the Videocon Group. 
Mumbai: The board of private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd on Wednesday expressed faith in its managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar, and refuted rumours of wrongdoing in granting loans to the Videocon Group.
In a notice to exchanges, the bank said that it has “full faith and confidence"" in Kochhar, and added that the internal processes of the bank are robust. 
“The board has come to the conclusion that there is no question of any quid pro quo/nepotism/conflict of interest as is being alleged in various rumours,"" the bank said, terming them as “malicious and unfounded"".
The bank also provided details of loan disbursement to the Videocon Group.
According to the filing, ICICI Bank was part of a consortium of 20 lenders that in April 2012 sanctioned loans aggregating Rs40,000 crore to Videocon Group for its debt consolidation as well as its oil and gas capital expenditure programme.
ICICI Bank’s share in the loan facility was approximately Rs3,250 crore, which is less than 10% of the total consortium loan, the lender said. The credit committee of ICICI Bank sanctioned its share of the loan facility under the syndicated arrangement.
This was done after the preparation of information memorandum and the initial due diligence for financing of the programme by the lead bank and sanction of the facility by the lead banker. 
ICICI Bank clarified that it was not the lead banker in the consortium.
“This committee was chaired by the chairman of ICICI Bank and it included independent and working directors of the bank. It is important to note that Ms Chanda Kochhar was not the chairperson of this committee. The terms and conditions offered for these loans are similar to those offered by other banks in the consortium, ruling out the possibility of any special benefit to the borrower by ICICI Bank,"" it said. 
ICICI Bank also clarified that none of the investors of NuPower Renewables is a borrower.
The bank insisted that it has a well-structured and standardized credit approval process, which involves multiple departments conducting processes ranging from loan appraisal to monitoring.
“Given this architecture, no individual employee, whatever may be his or her position, has the ability to influence the credit decision at the bank,"" ICICI Bank said."

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs58.9 crore on ICICI Bank Ltd, the country’s largest private sector lender, for failing to adhere to its directives regarding the sale of securities from the held-to-maturity, or HTM, portfolio.  
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs58.9 crore on ICICI Bank Ltd, the country’s largest private sector lender, for failing to adhere to its directives regarding the sale of securities from the held-to-maturity, or HTM, portfolio. 
“The Reserve Bank of India has imposed through an order dated March 26, 2018, a monetary penalty of Rs589 million (or Rs58.9 crore) on ICICI Bank Ltd (the bank) for non-compliance with directions issued by RBI on direct sale of securities from its held-to-maturity portfolio and specified disclosure in this regard,"" the central bank said in a statement released on Thursday.
“This action is based on the deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers,"" the central bank’s statement added.
Banks hold debt securities in three categories, including held-to-maturity, available-for-sale (AFS) and held-for-trading (HFT). 
Securities acquired with the intention of being held till maturity are classified under HTM. 
If the value of sales of securities from HTM category exceeds 5% of the HTM investments, banks are required to disclose in the audited annual financial statements the market value of the HTM investments and indicate the excess of book value over market value. 
“RBI has imposed a penalty on the bank for continued sale of government securities classified as HTM. ICICI Bank had continued with the sales from HTM category for a few weeks during the quarter ended March 31, 2017, due to a genuine misunderstanding on the timing of the applicability of RBI’s direction in this matter,"" ICICI Bank clarified.
Under the existing RBI regulations, banks may shift investments to/from HTM with the approval of the board of directors once a year, and such shifting will normally be allowed at the beginning of the accounting year."

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd stepped up its defence of chief executive officer and managing director Chanda Kochhar, with board chairman M.K. Sharma saying that she did not need to recuse herself from the credit committee that sanctioned loans to the Videocon group as it was not an investor in NuPower Renewables. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd stepped up its defence of chief executive officer and managing director Chanda Kochhar, with board chairman M.K. Sharma saying that she did not need to recuse herself from the credit committee that sanctioned loans to the Videocon group as it was not an investor in NuPower Renewables.
Sharma was delivering a televised statement on Thursday, a day after the bank released a statement saying that the board reposed faith in Kochhar.
News reports have raised questions about ICICI Bank sanctioning loans to Videocon because its chairman Venugopal Dhoot supposedly had dealings with NuPower, founded by Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar. Mint couldn’t independently ascertain the veracity of these allegations. 
“The board does not see a conflict of interest in any manner since Videocon group is not an investor in NuPower Renewables,"" said Sharma. “Hence, there was no need to recuse herself from this committee. As mentioned earlier, this committee had many independent directors and the committee was not chaired by her. Moreover, it was part of a consortium arrangement where the terms and conditions had already been agreed upon by the consortium.""
“When ICICI Bank sanctioned loan, Videocon group did not possess any shares of NuPower,"" said Dhoot in a text message.
Sharma also clarified that Kochhar “has been making all her disclosures in accordance with the regulatory guidelines under the Companies Act and the Banking Act"".
ICICI Bank did not reply to an email seeking comments. 
Proxy advisory firms are divided in their views on whether these allegations raise ethical and governance questions, with some calling for an independent review.
“Quid pro quo transactions, if they have occurred, violate the fundamentals of ethical business practices. Having said so, these are currently just allegations being made. That the board has taken a position and provided stakeholders with their point of view is good practice. If the stakeholders are not yet convinced, then the board must consider getting an independent review or investigation done,"" said Hetal Dalal, chief operating officer, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS). ICICI group through ICICI Prudential Life Insurance owns equity in IiAS.
“These are allegations. Does it mean that if someone is at a high-ranking position at a bank then their spouse or relative should not have a business of their own? And if they have a business, then all banking transactions should be examined bearing that in mind? Having said that, the board of the bank has verified these allegations—how independent is the examination one can speculate. The board has independent members, so we should assume it was a fair examination,"" said J.N. Gupta, co-founder and managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services, a proxy advisory firm.
But not everyone agrees. Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director at InGovern Research, said a board verification is not enough. “If the allegations are true, then the lack of disclosures of related party transactions is a big corporate governance lapse. In such cases, all the board members become yes men. There is a need for an independent third-party verification and also for ICICI Bank to come clean on disclosures,"" he said. 
In his statement, Sharma said that ICICI Bank has replied to the questions of regulators “satisfactorily"", but declined to share any specifics.
“This is privileged information between the regulator and the bank and it would be totally inappropriate for me to go public with them,"" said Sharma."

New Delhi: With ICICI Bank embroiled in a controversy over alleged conflict of interest involving its CEO Chanda Kochhar, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has begun looking into the matter for any possible disclosure and corporate governance-related lapses. 
New Delhi: With ICICI Bank embroiled in a controversy over alleged conflict of interest involving its CEO Chanda Kochhar, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has begun looking into the matter for any possible disclosure and corporate governance-related lapses.
Besides, Videocon Industries Ltd and its promoters have come under the regulator’s scanner as the matter relates to alleged “quid pro quo"" involving loans to the company by a group of lenders, including ICICI Bank and some public sector banks.
The markets regulator has begun a preliminary enquiry into various disclosures made by ICICI Bank over the last few years while the stock exchanges may seek additional clarifications regarding recent reports in this regard that relate to dealings that took place way back in 2012, a senior official said.
ICICI Bank is India’s fourth most valued bank with a market capitalisation of about Rs1.8 trillion and its shares are listed on BSE Sensex.
ICICI Bank’s board, meanwhile, has reposed full faith in Kochhar, while people close to them said that regulatory queries were satisfactorily answered in 2016 as no conflict of interest was found at that time about the loans given to Videocon, that too as part of a consortium.
“I would like to clearly state that we always satisfactorily reply to questions of regulators,"" ICICI Bank chairman M.K. Sharma said on Thursday but did not specifically name any regulator.
“The board has come to the conclusion that there is no question of any quid pro quo/ nepotism/ conflict of interest as is being alleged in various rumours. The board has full confidence and reposes full faith in the bank’s MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar,"" Sharma said on Thursday. He had also said that it was not the lead bank for this consortium and the bank only sanctioned its share of facilities aggregating approximately Rs3,250 crore which was less than 10% of the total consortium facility in April 2012.
The people quoted above, however, said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), sought clarification from the bank in 2016 on the issue to which the bank had given its response at that time.
Earlier this week, some media reports mentioned about alleged involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on quid pro quo basis. Concerns were also raised about transactions of Videocon group and NuPower Renewables, a company operated by her husband Deepak Kochhar."

Mumbai/New Delhi: Under the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) lens for alleged quid pro quo in receiving a loan from ICICI Bank, Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot has said he knew all the 12 members of the panel that had cleared the loan amount and asserted that personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts.  
Mumbai/New Delhi: Under the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) lens for alleged quid pro quo in receiving a loan from ICICI Bank, Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot has said he knew all the 12 members of the panel that had cleared the loan amount and asserted that personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts. 
Reports have alleged quid pro quo between Videocon Group and the bank’s chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar as well as her family members with respect to extending a loan worth Rs3,250 crore, an issue that has snowballed into a controversy even as the lender has come out in defence of Kochhar. 
It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar. To a specific question on Chanda Kochhar’s conduct, Dhoot said there was “nothing illegal"".
She was only one of the 12 members of the committee which cleared the loan (of Rs3,250 crore) to Videocon Group, he said, claiming that he knew all 12 members, and former bank chairman K.V. Kamath, the head of the committee, used to have lunch with him. 
Personal ties between two people do not always result in criminal acts, Dhoot said in an interview aired on Marathi television channel ABP Majha. Asked about the preliminary enquiry started by the CBI in this matter, Dhoot said the agency probes every allegation submitted to it, including “bogus complaints"". 
The CBI has questioned a few officials of ICICI Bank as part of the preliminary enquiry (PE) to find out if any quid pro quo was involved in the bank giving Rs3,250 crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012. The PE has named Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unknown persons, according to CBI officials. 
Separately, Dhoot told PTI that loans sanctioned by ICICI Bank were based on the merit of projects in the oil and gas sector. “There was no quid pro quo from ICICI Bank to Videocon as ICICI Bank has under the consortium arrangement (with other lenders and leader bank being SBI) and which is less than 10 per cent loan to Videocon Group... the sanction by the ICICI Bank has been done on the merit of the projects and therefore, there is no question of any quid pro quo,"" he said. 
When NuPower Renewables started, Dhoot said he had invested around Rs2.5 lakh in the company but immediately sold the entire investment. He also denied reports that his group had invested Rs64 crore in NuPower Renewables. 
“This is not correct and we deny as we have not invested Rs64 crore in FCD (fully convertible debentures) of NuPower Renewables,"" he said and also denied allegations of transferring around Rs325 crore from Mauritius route to Deepak Kochhar’s company. In his interview to the channel, Dhoot said he had agreed to invest Rs2.5 lakh in Nupower Renewables as Deepak Kochhar was an “old acquaintance"". 
ICICI Bank was headed by K.V. Kamath at that time, Dhoot said, claiming that he did not know if Chanda Kochhar was associated with the bank then. According to Dhoot, he got to know Deepak Kochhar through his friend and IAS officer, former Maharashtra chief secretary Sharad Upasani. 
He had no contact with either Deepak Kochhar or Chanda Kochhar after the return of the stake, he said. ICICI Bank had loaned $100 million through its Canadian subsidiary to Videocon, which was repaid in full with interest, Dhoot said, adding that there were enquiries by the Enforcement Directorate in the matter, but it did not find any wrongdoing under the foreign exchange management laws. 
“It is a circle of time where people face a difficult time. It is like the agni-pariksha (litmus test) gone through by Sita and I am sure I will pass it this time,"" said Dhoot, who is known to have a keen interest in mythology."

An Indian Express report published 29 March had alleged conflict of interest in a Rs3,250 crore loan grant to Videocon group by ICICI Bank. The amount was granted as part of Rs40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012. Dhoot allegedly gave Rs64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. It is alleged that he transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for Rs9 lakh six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank.
ICICI Bank’s board, however, expressed faith in Chanda Kochhar and also the bank’s credit sanctioning system with regard to its dealing with the Videocon Group. Dhoot also denied any dealings with Deepak Kochhar beyond investing Rs2.5 lakh in the latter’s renewable energy business.

ICICI Bank has been hit by three successive pieces of bad news this past month. They started with an allegation about the bank sanctioning Rs3,250 crore of loans to Videocon Group because its chairman Venugopal Dhoot supposedly had dealings with NuPower Renewables Ltd, founded by ICICI Bank’s MD & CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
“The board has come to the conclusion that there is no question of any quid pro quo/nepotism/conflict of interest as is being alleged in various rumours,"" the bank said told to the exchanges on 29 March, terming these reports as “malicious and unfounded"".
This was followed by a penalty imposed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on ICICI Bank for violating regulations around selling securities from the held to maturity portfolio of the bank’s treasury book. In the same month, the bank saw the size of ICICI Securities IPO being lowered due to under-subscription. The ICICI Bank subsidiary had initially planned to sell shares worth Rs4,017 crore through its IPO and had set a price band of Rs519-520 per share. The share sale opened on 22 March. ICICI Bank was targeting to sell a 24% stake in the brokerage firm through the IPO. However it could manage only 78% subscription, raising Rs3,500 crore from the market.
Analysts believe that these events may have little implication on their view on the stock or the bank’s performance as fundamentally nothing has changed. However they concur that it would be negative if Kochhar is implicated in the case.
But some also believe that a management reorganization has been long called for.
“Despite the board of ICICI Bank giving Chanda Kochhar a clean chit, there are too many unresolved issues and with the CBI, Sebi, RBI and even the income tax department examining this issue of her husband’s involvement with Videocon and ICICI Bank’s lending to Videocon, Chanda Kochhar should step down to restore confidence in the bank,"" said Hemindra Hazari, an independent banking analyst.
According to a 31 March The Times of India report, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a preliminary enquiry into the alleged nexus between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot.
“One cannot judge by the quantum of penalty imposed on ICICI Bank by the RBI. Going by the nature of the alleged offence , the Bank’s violation on selling securities is not very different from other banks. In the case of Videocon, we need to see whether Chanda (Kochhar) will be get implicated. That will be negative for the bank,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, director of financial services research at Macquarie Capital Securities India Pvt. Ltd. Ganpathy, one of the brokerages cited above, has an outperform rating on ICICI Bank.
The bank’s board, however, has expressed faith in CEO Chanda Kochhar and also the bank’s credit sanctioning system with regard to its dealing with the Videocon Group. According to the board, ICICI Bank was part of a consortium of 20 lenders that in April 2012 sanctioned loans aggregating Rs40,000 crore to Videocon Group for its debt consolidation as well as its oil and gas capital expenditure programme.
“The board has not clarified anything about the specific charges, nor even stated that it sought information on them and was satisfied or did the board seek clarifications about the nature of the dealings between NuPower and Videocon. The board also needs to inform the public whether they were informed of the entire business interests of Deepak Kochhar and the measures adopted to ensure it was ring fenced from the bank,"" said Hazari in a note.
“Giving an elaborate defence of the loan sanction system and complimenting the CEO and her team for the hard work and dedication cannot allay the fears of the market,"" he added.
Analysts believe that ICICI Bank’s problems started three years ago when RBI directed banks to clean up their balance sheet under the Asset Quality Review (AQR). The bank’s non performing assets (NPAs) shot up to 7.82% at the end of December 2017 from 3.78% at the end of March 2015. The bank’s provisions coverage ratio also fell to the lowest level of 55.2% during the same period, only to improve to 60.9% at the end of December 2018. The bank’s shares have fallen 3.8% compared to Bank Nifty which rose 32.14% over the last two years. The bank’s net profit stood at Rs1,652 crore at the end of December 2017 compared to Rs2,922 at the end of March 2015. 
While ICICI Bank seems to be turning the corner on the NPA front (fresh slippages fell for the second consecutive quarter as of 31 December), the management conceded that provisioning costs are unlikely to come down in the following quarters too as clarity on the IBC referred loans will emerge only after April."

Mumbai: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon group to verify the Rs40,000 crore loan to the company, said a senior CBI official, requesting anonymity.  
Mumbai: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against Deepak Kochhar, husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon group to verify the Rs40,000 crore loan to the company, said a senior CBI official, requesting anonymity. 
“The PE was registered about a month back. So far the agency has collected documents pertaining to the Rs40,000 loan granted to Videocon group in 2012 and documents pertaining to setting of NuPower . The PE also names bank officials of public sector banks,"" said the official.
CBI is examining the documents collected to verify whether the PE should be converted into an FIR or not, he added. CBI takes about a month to decide whether a PE has enough merit for further investigation.
An Indian Express report published 29 March had alleged conflict of interest in a Rs3,250 crore loan grant to Videocon group by ICICI Bank. The amount was granted as part of Rs40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012. Dhoot allegedly gave Rs64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. It is alleged that he transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for Rs9 lakh six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank.
To be sure, the PE does not name Chanda Kochhar even as questions have been raised on the financial dealings, as she was a part of the credit committee that granted the loan to Videocon group.
ICICI bank board chairman M.K. Sharma, in a televised statement on 29 March, defended Chanda Kochhar saying that she did not need to recuse herself from the credit committee that sanctioned loans to the Videocon group as it was not an investor in NuPower Renewables.
“The board does not see a conflict of interest in any manner since Videocon group is not an investor in NuPower Renewables,"" said Sharma. “Hence, there was no need to recuse herself from this committee. As mentioned earlier, this committee had many independent directors and the committee was not chaired by her. Moreover, it was part of a consortium arrangement where the terms and conditions had already been agreed upon by the consortium.""
Queries sent to email address on NuPower’s website was not answered.
Dhoot did not reply to a text message regarding the same, but he had earlier told Mint via a text message that “When ICICI Bank sanctioned loan, Videocon group did not possess any shares of NuPower""."

622,2018-04-03,ICICI,"Being a corporate lender, a questioning of the process of loan disbursement against one corporate group is bound to kindle doubts on the integrity of its sanctioning process

On 28 March, the board of the country’s second-largest lender ICICI Bank Ltd issued a statement reposing its confidence in the corporate governance of the lender and the integrity of its head Chanda Kochhar. 
On 28 March, the board of the country’s second-largest lender ICICI Bank Ltd issued a statement reposing its confidence in the corporate governance of the lender and the integrity of its head Chanda Kochhar.
The statement was a reaction to allegations that ICICI Bank disbursed loans to the Videocon group without following strict governance rules that would have otherwise avoided conflict of interest of Kochhar. Investigative agencies were said to be looking at the series of transactions including loans disbursed to Videocon group by ICICI Bank.
The bank’s stock dropped 6% on Monday as these allegations against its top official hurt sentiment. It seems that investors are far from satisfied with the assurance of an independent board that all was kosher with the Videocon loans. The group has a debt pile of more than Rs40,000 crore as of March 2016 and was labelled a non-performing asset in 2017 by all banks that had exposure to it.
In that sense, ICICI Bank has already provided for these loans. Any further hit through the Videocon group would only come by way of haircuts as two of its subsidiaries are already awaiting resolution through tribunals under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Indeed, the lender’s balance sheet has taken a huge hit over the last two years as it saw its bad loans rise to 7.8% of its loan book as of December 2017. Its slippages haven’t abated and the management has indicated that credit costs and provisions are unlikely to come down in the coming quarters. To that extent, the stock’s underperformance has reflected the weakness in the balance sheet.
The stock has fallen a huge 15% over the last three months but it has not been alone. Other private sector lenders that have a large corporate book have also taken a big hit. Axis Bank Ltd shares have dropped 11% while Yes Bank Ltd fell a modest 2% during the same period. In contrast, other banks such as HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have gained, being lenders to mainly retail and small businesses.
For ICICI Bank, the troubles have deepened now simply because of the aspersions cast on its top official and by extension its own processes. Being a corporate lender, a questioning of the process of loan disbursement against one corporate group is bound to kindle doubts on the integrity of its sanctioning process.
The timing of the allegations couldn’t have been more wrong for ICICI Bank. The banking sector is facing a loss of trust given the series of frauds at various public sector lenders that came close to the heels of a colossal pile of bad loans. ICICI Bank’s stock has already lost value and trades at the lowest multiple compared with other private sector lenders. According to analysts, the standalone banking business is valued at a discount to its estimated book value for 2018-19.
The ICICI Bank board has stressed that upon scrutiny it found nothing wrong with the process as well as the checks and balances at the lender. Analysts still have a buy rating on the stock. But the tension is palpable and the board’s attempts to soothe frayed investor nerves haven’t worked so far."

Mumbai: Less than a week after ICICI Bank Ltd mounted a defence of Chanda Kochhar against allegations of financial impropriety, its chief executive officer found herself in the eye of the storm again, with senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy calling for a probe into the dealings of financial services firm Avista Advisory Group with ICICI Bank. 
Mumbai: Less than a week after ICICI Bank Ltd mounted a defence of Chanda Kochhar against allegations of financial impropriety, its chief executive officer found herself in the eye of the storm again, with senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Subramanian Swamy calling for a probe into the dealings of financial services firm Avista Advisory Group with ICICI Bank.
In a post on Twitter, the member of Parliament (MP) raised questions about Avista’s business links with ICICI Bank. An email seeking comment from ICICI Bank remained unanswered until press time.
CBI should probe in ICICI loan scam Avista Advisory which got 5% on every big loan for certification. AVista is owned by a relative of....
Avista was founded by Rajiv Kochhar, brother of Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
In an interview on Monday, Rajiv Kochhar said that he or his firm does not have any business arrangements with the Chanda Kochhar-run bank.
“The only rule that we follow is not to have any syndication with Indian banks at all. This is some guy who is just trying to create something. There is nothing in it. There is zero record or link between us. We are a professionally managed firm having our offices in Indonesia and Dubai, and we have dealings all over the world. India is only one part of the story,"" Rajiv Kochhar said.
Kochhar was reacting to reports in social media that have alleged potential conflict of interest in transactions involving his firm with ICICI Bank in several syndicated loan transactions. “Almost all our clients are foreign and these reports linking Avista with ICICI Bank are completely baseless and malicious,"" he said. 
Kochhar maintained that while Avista was involved in a few transactions with Videocon Industries where it was retained as an adviser, the transactions were only related to the foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) of the company and had no bearing on Videocon’s existing or future loans from any Indian lender, including ICICI Bank.
“Avista is an 18-year-old company with partners who are based out of India and most of our business activity involves foreign investors,"" he said.
“The allegations have caused serious damage to our reputation but our clients have told us to not pay attention to these. Let this just pass and you do not even need to respond to such a thing. Our clients know us, they are not concerned about it at all,"" he added. 
Over the years Avista has evolved into a full-service investment bank offering a gamut of financial services ranging from merger and acquisitions, debt restructuring, debt and structured financing, banking and project financing, illiquid assets and portfolio buyouts, and valuation of assets and brands. 
Some of its notable deals are Suzlon’s fund raising of $577 million through Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs), Jindal stainless Ltd’s asset monetization programme of up to $250 million. 
Avista was also involved in two transactions with Videocon Industries, which has been at the centre of the controversy surrounding Chanda Kochhar and her husband. 
First, when the group opted for reorganization and refinancing of FCCBs of $194 million in 2015 and later again in 2016 when the Venugopal Dhoot-promoted company once again hired Avista for restructuring of FCCBs worth $97 million. 
Avista has also had business interests with companies such as Noida-based Jaypee Group and telecom infrastructure GTL Infra. In May 2016, Avista was appointed as a restructuring adviser for $550 million of foreign currency loans of Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) by a group of foreign banks. The entire debt was successfully restructured by the lenders subsequently.
ICICI Bank chairman M.K. Sharma had earlier defended Chanda Kochhar saying that she did not need to recuse herself from the credit committee that sanctioned loans to the Videocon group as the group was not an investor in Deepak Kochhar’s solar energy venture NuPower Renewables when the loan was sanctioned.

New Delhi: NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd founded by Deepak Kochhar is in the news for all the wrong reasons. 
New Delhi: NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd founded by Deepak Kochhar is in the news for all the wrong reasons.
News reports have raised questions about ICICI Bank Ltd sanctioning loans to Videocon group.
Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot allegedly had dealings with NuPower Renewables, founded by Deepak Kochhar, who is ICICI Bank chief executive officer and managing director Chanda Kochhar’s husband.
Mint couldn’t independently ascertain the veracity of these allegations.
“For a firm that has set up 180MW (megawatts) wind capacity, they have been pretty low key,"" said a Gurugram-based chief executive of a clean energy firm, requesting anonymity.
According to information available on NuPower website, it has around 700MW of clean energy portfolio. Of this, the firm has an operational wind power capacity of around 177.85MW.
The firm has also manufactured 2.05MW wind turbines with German technology from Wind to Energy (W2E) GmbH.
Analysts say NuPower lacks scale.
“NuPower is a relatively small-scale developer with about 150MW of wind power capacity spread in Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. Most of this capacity was set up several years ago. The company also got into turbine manufacturing, but has been relatively dormant since 2013. They have not participated in any new tenders or projects of late,"" said Vinay Rustagi, managing director at consulting firm Bridge to India.
The firm, which got incorporated on 24 December 2008, has wind farms in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Rajasthan. According to rating agency CARE, its subsidiaries include Echanda Urja Pvt. Ltd (EUPL) and NuPower Wind Farm Ltd (NWFL).
“NuPower Renewables is promoted by Mr. Deepak Kochhar and Associates. Further, there has been investments by a private equity fund, namely Accion Diversified Strategies Fund, SPC, Singapore through its SPV DH Renewables Holding Ltd (DHRH). DHRH has a total investment of Rs397.71 crore in NuPower Renewables as on 31 March 2017,"" CARE Ratings, which has a ‘BBB+’ rating on NuPower, said in a 28 February statement.
The Central Bureau of Investigation has registered a preliminary enquiry against Deepak Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot to verify the loan to the company.
“I am a stakeholder. I keep watching the corporate affairs and I keep seeing what is happening: the usual, unusual and the economic affairs. And if such a big group Videocon forms a joint venture with some company, then obviously one would like to keep it on radar and would watch,"" said investor Arvind Gupta, who had filed the complaint alleging dubious loans to Videocon group of companies.
When contacted on Friday, Deepak Kochhar asked Mint to email him the queries. Queries emailed on Friday remained unanswered.
“I deny it (the allegations),"" said Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon group, over the phone on Friday. He asked Mint to send him detailed questions over WhatsApp, but no response was received till the time of filing this story.
Deepak Kochhar was a financial services entrepreneur before he founded NuPower in late 2008. Kochhar, who has a Master’s degree in finance from the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai University, has ambitious plans for his company as reported by Mint on 14 January 2016.
Deepak Kochhar, who is chief executive officer of NuPower Group, had then said the firm plans to develop 1 gigawatt (GW) of capacity over next six years.
“There are so many businesses that may give a higher return; but here, there is some sense of passion. Here, you are contributing to energy security for the nation, to global climate change, and there is huge savings in foreign exchange for the country on account of (increased) coal import substitution and improved technology,"" Mint had quoted Kochhar as stating in the January 2016 story. This statement came in the backdrop of the largest global green energy expansion programme unfolding in India. The National Democratic Alliance government has set an ambitious clean energy target of 175GW by 2022, of which 100GW is to come from solar projects and 60GW from wind power.
According to CARE, NuPower “is engaged in generation of power through wind with an aggregate operational capacity of 134.75MW located in Tamil Nadu, 10.2MW in Karnataka and 4.2MW in Rajasthan. Further, the firm commissioned additional capacity of 28.70MW (2.05 MW yet to be commissioned) in October 2015 totaling 177.85MW""."

Mumbai: Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is in final stages of discussions with private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd to acquire the ICICI Tower in Hyderabad, two people aware of the development said.
Brookfield is on the verge of signing the deal for the property situated in Gachibowli financial district, said one of the two persons on the condition of anonymity.
“Brookfield has completed the due diligence and some of the transfer procedures are pending. The deal may be signed in a couple of weeks’ time,"" said the second person. The 1.2 million sq. ft building is valued at around Rs1,000-1,200 crore, according to the second person.
Brookfield, which owns $250 billion of assets worldwide, has been on an expansion spree in India with multiple buyouts in the recent past. 
In January, it agreed to acquire the 1.25 million sq. ft Equinox Business Park at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) in Mumbai from Essar Group for about Rs2,400 crore. In 2016, it had signed one of India’s largest commercial real estate deals by acquiring the office and retail assets of Hiranandani Developers Pvt. Ltd for close to $1 billion.
Mails sent to spokespersons at ICICI Bank and Brookfield went unanswered.
Hyderabad turns out to be a much sought-after office space for several global multinational companies after Bengaluru and Chennai.
Apple Inc. had entered Hyderabad in 2016 by leasing 2.5 lakh sq. ft, while others like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. have leased large office spaces in the city. 
According to data compiled by property advisor JLL India, Hyderabad, which saw a rental growth of 6.8% in 2017, is likely to touch the 2008 peak in the coming quarters.
“Hyderabad today is one of the fastest growing markets and is in a catch-up mode on the pace of both construction as well as leasing, for the last few quarters after the political stability achieved from the split (in two states),"" said Shashank Jain, partner and leader (real estate deals) at PwC India. 
While there have been some headwinds for the IT/ITES sector in the recent times, it has not yet adversely impacted the demand for office space in India, he added.
Grade A supply in Hyderabad office space totaling around 5.8 million sq. ft was recorded during 2017, an increase of 47.0% compared to 2016, according to the Cushman & Wakefield December 2017 report.
“Owing to the limited availability of Grade A space expected in the first half of 2018, rentals are anticipated to rise steadily in the Madhapur and Gachibowli submarkets. We expect that strong demand and tight vacancy rates will tilt the market in favour of landlords for the next few quarters,"" it added.
Several investors are set to exit from their investments in Hyderabad against the backdrop of increasing demand.
Another Hyderabad-based office property WaveRock, spread over 2.5 million sq. ft in the Gachibowli financial district, has been put on the block by its investors Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd and New York-based developer Tishman Speyer, Mint reported in January.
In 2017, the office sector witnessed a massive jump in investments to Rs13,200 crore from Rs4,000 crore in 2016, according to a Cushman and Wakefield January 2018 report. The jump in inflows came on the back of a three-fold rise in investment in office segment, signalling heightened interest of institutional investors in pre-leased office assets."

Deepak Kochhar is Chanda’s husband.
The authorities, meanwhile, have intensified their investigation into the matter even as Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot and Avista Advisory founder Rajiv Kochhar have denied any wrongdoing. 
On Tuesday, the income tax department issued a notice to Deepak Kochhar in connection with a tax evasion probe in the Videocon loan case, PTI reported, citing unnamed officials from the department. The department will probe the finances of the company and those associated with it.
With regard to the Videocon loans, the ICICI Bank board had said that the bank’s current exposure is part of a syndicated consortium arrangement. “ICICI Bank was not the lead bank for this consortium and the bank only sanctioned its share of facilities aggregating to approximately Rs3,250 crore, which was less than 10% of the total consortium facility in April 2012,"" it added.

Mumbai: Ruling out any action against chief executive officer and managing director Chanda Kochhar, ICICI Bank Ltd’s non-executive chairman M.K. Sharma said that the lender’s board is unlikely to discuss the allegations of impropriety against Kochhar at its board meeting on 27 April to consider annual earnings.
The bank’s board will not act unless the findings of the preliminary probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) suggest any wrongdoing, Sharma said in an interview on Wednesday.
In response to a question on whether Kochhar has expressed a desire to step down from her responsibilities at India’s second largest private sector bank in the wake of the CBI investigation, Sharma said, “She has not offered (to do so) and neither has the board obliquely asked her (to do) that. In the first meeting of independent directors, the issue was discussed and she chose to recuse.""
“Nothing can be worse for a CEO to be leaving in such a scenario. I don’t think people recognize that these issues should be dealt on facts and not through speculation,"" Sharma said.
Stating that the matter was first brought to the board’s notice in 2016 and all the regulators had prior information about it, Sharma said “I don’t know if it is about diverting attention from other things such as Nirav Modi and Gitanjali Gems issues. All the regulators had this information in 2016. I do not see any reason for having a fresh look again and revive interest in the issue.""
“You need to understand that this transaction (the loan to Videocon group) happened in 2012. Dhoot (Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot) invested in the company in 2008 and there is a clear gap of four years,"" Sharma added.
Sharma’s statements come amid allegations that ICICI Bank under Kochhar disbursed loans to the Videocon group without following strict governance rules.
CBI has registered a preliminary enquiry to probe an alleged nexus between Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak and Videocon.
On 28 March, the lender’s board had issued a statement reposing its confidence in the corporate governance practices of the company and the integrity of Kochhar, which have come under scrutiny following the Videocon controversy.
“All the complaints have been looked at. The Central Bureau of Investigation is looking at some of the matter. We are cooperating with them. They are at a better position to look at it from several angles. We will only be able to look at it from our perspective,"" Sharma said.
ICICI Bank had said on 28 March in a filing to the stock exchanges that it had given the loan to Videocon group as part of a consortium of lenders and was not even the lead bank of this group.
“They can look at Mr Kochhar, Videocon and then they can take a call. We will provide best of assistance and support,"" he added.
“Our exposure is less than 8.5% with common interest rate, common tenure. So, I cannot fathom a quid pro quo,"" Sharma said.

612,2018-04-05,ICICI,"Over the past three decades, Chanda Kochhar has seen ICICI Bank through many a crisis, but none as personal as the Videocon loan case involving her husband, Deepak Kochhar

Mumbai: Over the past three decades, Chanda Kochhar has seen the country’s second largest private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd through many a crisis, but none as personal as the recent allegations involving her husband, Deepak Kochhar, and the Videocon Group. 
Mumbai: Over the past three decades, Chanda Kochhar has seen the country’s second largest private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd through many a crisis, but none as personal as the recent allegations involving her husband, Deepak Kochhar, and the Videocon Group.
The bank stepped up its defence of Kochhar, with the board expressing full faith in her. That is hardly a surprise, given her long association with the ICICI Group.
Kochhar’s association with ICICI dates back to 1984, when she joined as a management trainee at Industrial Credit and Investment Corp. of India Ltd, or ICICI—which was to later become ICICI Bank Ltd. She was instrumental in setting up ICICI Bank in the 1990s and after getting the approval of the central bank, Kochhar played a key role in a range of matters—from selecting core software to finalizing the design of the bank cheques. One of her biggest achievements was to oversee the establishment of the bank’s retail franchise. She also led the efforts to expand the bank’s footprint to overseas geographies.
In 2000, Kochhar’s predecessor K.V. Kamath asked her to build the bank’s retail business from scratch. At that time, she was overseeing the corporate business that accounted for about 50% of the institution’s balance sheet and even more of its total profits. Between then and her taking over as chief executive officer (CEO) in May 2009, the share of retail loans in the book grew to nearly 49%. The share currently stands at over 54%. The story is the same on the deposit side with ICICI Bank being one of the top banks to have a large pool of low-cost deposits.
Kocchar, who won the Padma Bhushan award in 2011, is also known for leading other initiatives such as adopting 100 villages (later raised to 600) and providing them a digital ecosystem. She is also known for speaking about gender issues and talked about how ICICI has fostered a culture of gender equality.
A graduate of the Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, where she met her husband, Kochhar took the corner office in wake of the collapse of iconic US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. which triggered the global financial crisis in 2008-09. It was not an easy task to fill in the big shoes of Kamath but Kochhar did that quite effortlessly and showed maturing by deciding to shrink the bank’s balance sheet. At that juncture, her focus was on consolidation as opposed to expansion. She had to face challenges on the human resource front, too, as many of her peers in management exited. She was quite unfazed though and diligently took the business forward.
Through these years, Kochhar waded through range of issues but the problem of bad loans stuck. Analysts view the problem in the context of the bank’s reliance on corporate credit, which was a legacy for ICICI Bank. While many believe it was a legacy issue, there are others who feel Kochhar misread the economy; she bet big on some of the projects which did not take off and the bank found itself saddled with a pile of bad loans. At the initial stage, she showed smartness in handling the situation. For instance, ICICI Bank sold off its Rs430 crore exposure in Kingfisher Airlines Ltd to Srei Finance in Kolkata, but there were not too many such cases.
Since Kochhar took over as CEO, bad loans have jumped from Rs9,416 crore in the June 2009 quarter to Rs46,039 crore in the December 2017 quarter. As a percentage of loans, gross NPA ratio was at 4.63% in June 2009 quarter which has risen to 7.82% in December 2017 quarter.Like most other banks, RBI’s asset quality review in late 2015 led to a rather sharp rise in bad loans for ICICI Bank. 
At the time of rising bad loans in the Indian banking system, Kochhar ensured the conclusion of the sale process of the cement business of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Jaypee Cement Corp. Ltd to UltraTech Cement Ltd. For banks with higher exposure to the JP Group, this brought relief on the NPA front.
For shareholders, though, the rising NPAs had already taken some shine off ICICI Bank.
Since Kocchar took over, total returns (inclusive of re-invested dividends) for ICICI Bank are 255% compared to 427.9% for the Bankex. The gap has been accentuated by the recent controversy. After the controversy broke out, ICICI Bank shares have shed 5% in the past two weeks compared to a flat Bankex."
614,2018-04-05,ICICI,"ICICI Securities shares closed at Rs441.50 per share, down 15.09% from its issue price of Rs520 after a tepid response to its IPO

Mumbai: Barring the stellar success of Bandhan Bank Ltd, it’s been a series of dismal stock exchange debuts in the past few weeks. 
Mumbai: Barring the stellar success of Bandhan Bank Ltd, it’s been a series of dismal stock exchange debuts in the past few weeks.
ICICI Securities Ltd, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank Ltd, is the latest to join the list of disappointing debutantes, logging a double-digit decline in its share price on listing, after being forced to cut down its issue size amid tepid response to its initial public offering (IPO).
ICICI Securities shares closed at Rs445.05, down 14.4% from the issue price of Rs520 Wednesday, while state-run speciality alloy maker Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd ended flat at its issue price of Rs90 after listing at a 3.3% discount.
To be sure, the overall market sentiment on Wednesday was also weak, with the BSE Sensex shedding 1.05%, or 351.56 points, to close at 33,019.07 points.
Going ahead, primary market enthusiasts might have to rethink their pricing strategy, and maybe even the timing. The issues hit the market at a time when the broader market is choppy.
“Investors lost appetite for the ICICI Securities issue due to costly valuations and high pricing. This is also the case with most PSUs (public sector undertakings) which got both valuation and pricing wrong,"" said Manish Bhatt, vice-president and head of IPOs and primary markets at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd.
“You can sell any issue with whatever valuations and pricing when markets are at a peak. However, when markets are correcting, investors look for better-valued stock,"" Bhatt added.
The 30-share Sensex is down 3.05% so far in 2018, after logging 27.91% gains in 2017.
The only exception in recent times has been private lender Bandhan Bank. It listed at a 27% premium on 27 March, in the process becoming the eighth most valued bank in the country, overtaking the likes of Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank, after its Rs4,470 crore IPO, the largest ever by a bank, was subscribed 14.63 times.
Bankers do not believe that valuations are as much of a concern as the rush to raise funds, which weighs on demand.
“I don’t think it is so much to do with valuation. It just seems the timing went wrong and everyone decided to hit the market at the same time, leading to oversupply and investor fatigue,"" a senior official at a foreign investment bank said on condition of anonymity.
It was surely an overcrowded market, with as many as eight companies raising more than Rs13,000 crore in the primary market in March, the highest since November.
ICICI Securities had to cut down the size of its IPO to around Rs3,520 crore after it witnessed low subscription during the share sale on 22-26 March, compared to an earlier target of Rs4,017 crore.
Earlier, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd saw its issue subscribed by 99%. Prabhat Dairy Ltd’s IPO witnessed only 76% offtake even after it cut its issue price and extended the sale.
“The global geopolitical scenario, and Indian political developments with state elections are all collectively bothering the market. On the domestic front, people are worried what the 2019 elections could throw up,"" the official at the investment bank said.
“The negativity surrounding the Indian banking sector is hurting the secondary as well as primary market,"" he added.
A few believe it may not be a rosy picture for companies that have lined up to raise funds in the primary market in the near term.
“The IPO market may see a dull period now as equity markets are underperforming. After the dismal performance of most issues in March, there is a lesson learnt that valuations and pricing need to be attractive,"" Bhatt said."
611,2018-04-05,ICICI,"NCLT's Mumbai bench wants claims of ICICI Bank, IFCI Ltd and Standard Chartered Bank to be included in Monnet Ispat's bankruptcy proceedings

Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed the resolution professional (RP) of Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd to include the claims of ICICI Bank, IFCI Ltd and Standard Chartered Bank in the steel maker’s bankruptcy proceedings. 
Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed the resolution professional (RP) of Monnet Ispat and Energy Ltd to include the claims of ICICI Bank, IFCI Ltd and Standard Chartered Bank in the steel maker’s bankruptcy proceedings.
The three lenders had approached the tribunal in separate petitions seeking its intervention, alleging that the resolution professional had not included their claims.
A division bench of B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravi Kumar Duraisamy allowed all applications and also vacated its earlier order which had directed the creditors’ panel not to meet.
Earlier in the day, senior counsel Gaurav Joshi appearing for ICICI Bank, argued that the bank had lent $75 million (about Rs486 crore) to Monnet Power Ltd, a subsidiary of Monnet Ispat in external commercial borrowing (ECB) where the parent company was a guarantor. The company had raised that money to build a power plant in Odisha. 
“All we are saying is include us with the other financial creditors,"" argued Joshi. 
“The corporate guarantee was invoked after the filing of the bankruptcy and, hence, the resolution professional is not including this claim under the category of financial creditor,"" Joshi said. 
Similarly, IFCI had lent Rs158 crore to Monnet Power Co. where parent Monnet Ispat was corporate guarantor. 
Standard Chartered Bank said the resolution professional had accepted a claim for just Rs58 crore out of its total claim of Rs147 crore.
“What ICICI Bank is claiming is damage and not debt because they had neither invoked the bank guarantee nor come to the RP at the time of initiation of the process,"" argued Zal Andhyarujina, a counsel representing the resolution professional in the case. “Monnet Power is also under insolvency and the bank could have claimed this there as well."" 
Monnet Ispat is part of the first lot of 12 large non-performing loans referred by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for early resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) last year. 
It owes lenders Rs10,000 crore and the committee of creditors has agreed to take a haircut of around 72% to settle the loan.  So far, a consortium of AION Capital Partners Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd has made a binding offer for Monnet Ispat and is considered to be the front runner to acquire the asset. AION Capital holds a 70% stake in the consortium while JSW Steel holds the rest."

1. ICICI Bank in the spotlight for loan practices, trading fine 
1. ICICI Bank in the spotlight for loan practices, trading fine
It wasn’t a good week for ICICI Bank. First, ICICI Securities, its stock broking arm, had to pare its IPO size after a tepid investor response. Next, a report by The Indian Express pointed to a possible conflict of interest for Chanda Kochhar in her position as ICICI Bank CEO, though the bank board exonerated her. Then, the central bank penalized ICICI Bank Rs58.9 crore for non-compliance of its directions on direct sale of securities. The bank’s stock, which has been range-bound the past year, will be watched when the markets reopen on Monday.
2. Indian economy lost jobs between 2014 and 2016
Employment in India fell 0.1% in 2015-16 and 0.2% in 2014-15. This follows a 3% increase in 2013-14, according to the latest KLEMS India database, a research project supported by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to analyze productivity of the Indian economy. Employment fell in several sectors in both 2014-15 and 2015-16, including agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, food products, textiles, paper, leather products, transport equipment and trade.
Government plans to sell 76% stake in Air India
The ministry of civil aviation has invited bids to sell a 76% stake in Air India, which includes transfer of management control. Of Air India’s total debt of Rs48,700 crore, Rs33,390 crore will remain with the carrier and would have to be taken on by the buyer. In addition, the government will sell its entire stake in Air India’s budget arm, Air India Express, and 50% in its ground handling unit, Air India SATS Airport Services. The state-owned carrier posted a net loss of Rs5,765 crore in 2016-17. It is surviving on a 2012 turnaround plan, which involved equity support from the government of Rs30,231 crore over a 10-year period. So far, Air India has received Rs26,545 crore.
4. Darren Lehmann to step down as Australian coach
Although he was exonerated in the ball-tampering fiasco, Australian cricket coach Darren Lehmann has decided to step down following the conclusion of the test series against South Africa. The burly Lehmann was appointed coach in 2013, and the team received a drubbing in England in his first series. Subsequently, the team improved. Under Lehmann, Australia won nine test series, while losing six and drawing one (the latest series is not included). In tests, it won 30 tests, lost 19 and drew eight.
5. Vettel wins 2018 opener for 100th podium
Riding his luck from an opportunistic pit stop and a rare mistake from his biggest rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel beat Mercedes’ Lewis Hamilton to win the 2018 season-opening Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. It was Vettel’s 48th win in his 200th grand prix. It was also his 100th podium, making him only the fourth driver in the history of the sport to achieve this milestone. Among active drivers, Hamilton is ahead of Vettel, and Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen are close behind him.
6. Uber sells Southeast Asia business to Grab
Uber Technologies Inc. has sold its Southeast Asian ride-hailing business and food-delivery business to larger regional rival GrabTaxi. As part of the deal with Grab, Uber will receive a 27.5% stake in the Singapore-based firm and its CEO Dara Khosrowshahi will join Grab’s board. This is Uber’s third retreat from a major market, after China and Russia. Still, Uber retains the mantle of the world’s most valuable start-up, last being valued at $68 billion. Among ride-hailing firms, CB Insights puts Grab’s valuation at $6 billion, about one-eleventh that of Uber.
7. Bandhan Bank eighth most-valuable listed bank
Bandhan Bank, the newest bank on the Indian firmament, made its stock market debut last week, and closed the first day 27% above its issue price. That gave it a market capitalization of Rs56,920 crore, making it the eighth most-valuable listed bank on the BSE. Of the nine banks that feature in BSE’s top 100 stocks by market cap, State Bank of India and Bank of Baroda are the only public sector banks.
8. US and EU trade diplomat firings with Russia
It was tit for tat. It was reminiscent of the Cold War years. After the UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats for the latter’s alleged role in the nerve agent attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter in the UK, the US ordered the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats. Some European countries and non-EU nations such as Ukraine and Canada also took similar action. Russia retaliated by booting out 60 US diplomats, as well as an unspecified number of envoys from other countries and closing down the American consulate in St. Petersburg.
9. BJP strengthens lead in Rajya Sabha
BJP won 28 of 59 seats in the latest round of Rajya Sabha elections. It, thus, increased its strength in the Rajya Sabha from 58 to 69, and consolidated its position as the largest party in the house. The Congress, which won 10 seats in the latest round, saw its tally reduce by four seats to 50. The BJP and its allies now hold 36% of seats in the Rajya Sabha, compared to 27% in May 2014, when this BJP government came to power at the centre.
10. Telecom leaders improve share in January
The top five Indian telecom firms by subscribers all improved their market share in mobile telephony in January 2018, compared to the previous month. Their gains in share happened at the expense of smaller operators. This growth in share happened even as the total wireless subscribers declined 1.33% to 1.15 billion. The highest gain was recorded by Reliance Jio (0.9 percentage points), followed by market leader Bharti Airtel (0.5 percentage points).

Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter. 
Mumbai: India’s banking regulator is delaying year-end bonuses to the heads of top private banks as it questions the size of the payouts citing the lenders’ performance issues, said people familiar with the matter.
Chief executive officers at HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. —the nation’s largest private lenders by assets — are among bankers yet to receive bonuses for the financial year ended 31 March 2017, as the Reserve Bank of India hasn’t signed off on the proposed payments, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. They declined to give further details. Business Standard newspaper had previously reported the delays.
ICICI’s board had approved a bonus of Rs2.2 crore ($340,000) for CEO Chanda Kochhar while Axis Bank’s Shikha Sharma was set to receive Rs1.35 crore and HDFC Bank’s Aditya Puri about Rs2.9 crore, exchange filings show. A spokesman for Axis Bank declined to comment. Spokesmen for HDFC Bank and ICICI didn’t reply to emails and phone calls. An email to the RBI wasn’t immediately answered.
Long considered healthier than their government-run peers, India’s private banks have had a tough time over the past year, plagued by revelations of hidden bad loans and alleged lapses in corporate governance. Rising defaults have enraged the public, piling pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to act against the perpetrators and reinforce his anti-graft image before elections next year.
Going by historical evidence, the RBI should have approved the bonuses well before 31 March 2018, said Asutosh Kumar Mishra, a Mumbai-based banking analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. “We have never noticed such delay in approving the payouts, but then we haven’t seen a year in which so many skeletons were brought out of the closet — from under-reporting of bad loans to serious governance issues.""
In the year ended March 2017 — for which the bonuses are under contention — an RBI audit showed Axis hadn’t disclosed bad loans worth about Rs5,600 crore. HDFC Bank also reported a divergence and ICICI said it isn’t required to make disclosures on the topic even as provisions for bad loans climbed.
Axis Bank shares rose about 10% and ICICI 17% in Mumbai trading during the year ended March 2017, while the 10-member Bankex Index added 33%. HDFC Bank shares jumped had 35% during the period.
“Private banks will likely report sharp rise in slippages, led by ICICI Bank and Axis Bank,"" said analysts led by M.B. Mahesh at Kotak Institutional Equities, referring to higher delinquent loans. They predict January-March 2018 results would confirm a quarter of “pain"" for Indian lenders. Bloomberg"

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday questioned Rajiv Kochhar, ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law, for the second day in connection with Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012, officials said. 
New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday questioned Rajiv Kochhar, ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law, for the second day in connection with Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012, officials said.
Rajiv Kochhar, who was asked to appear at the CBI office in Mumbai, was examined about the loan and his links with Venugopal Dhoot, the promoter of the Videocon Group, and Videocon, they said.
He was detained at the Mumbai airport on Thursday, as he was trying to board a flight for a South East Asian country, on the basis of a look out circular issued by the CBI, they said. He was questioned by the CBI yesterday as well after his detention at the airport.
The agency has registered a preliminary probe naming Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot, Deepak Kochhar and unidentified others in connection with the loan, they said.
A preliminary inquiry is the first step by the CBI to gather information about the allegations. If the agency is convinced there exists prima facie material in the matter, it may register a regular case against the accused.
The deal recently made news after reports questioned the loan and linked it to a possible quid pro quo that Dhoot allegedly had with NuPower Renewables, a company founded by Deepak Kochchar, Chanda Kochar’s husband and Rajiv Kochar’s brother. 
Last week, the ICICI Bank board came out in support of Chanda Kochhar, saying it had full faith and confidence in her. It described reports against her regarding credit disbursement to Videocon Group as “malicious and unfounded rumours"".
The board also reviewed the bank’s internal processes for credit approval and found them robust, the private sector lender had said in a statement. With regard to loans to Videocon Group, it said the bank’s current exposure was part of a syndicated consortium arrangement.
“ICICI Bank was not the lead bank for this consortium and the bank only sanctioned its share of facilities aggregating approximately Rs3,250 crore which was less than 10% of the total consortium facility in April 2012,"" it added.
The bank had clarified that none of the investors of NuPower Renewables were borrowers of ICICI Bank."

Mumbai: Large shareholders of ICICI Bank Ltd have sought clarifications from the lender’s management about the alleged governance failures in India’s second largest private sector bank, said three people aware of the matter.  
Mumbai: Large shareholders of ICICI Bank Ltd have sought clarifications from the lender’s management about the alleged governance failures in India’s second largest private sector bank, said three people aware of the matter. 
Separately, Fitch Ratings said that ICICI Bank’s reluctance to announce an independent probe relating to allegations of potential conflicts of interest in grant of loans to Videocon Group has created doubts over the strength of its corporate governance practices.
“We have had some meetings with the bank on concerns whether there was any conflict of interest in granting these loans, whether the board was aware of these conflicts and if they were, what (then) did the board do. We have also raised concerns on the possibility that the current CEO may step down. So far the bank has assured us that there was no conflict of interest and the CEO has the backing of the board,"" said a fund manager on condition of anonymity. 
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a preliminary enquiry to probe an alleged nexus between Videocon and ICICI Bank chief executive and managing director Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar. In a 28 March stock exchange filing, the bank reposed its faith in Chanda Kochhar and said there was no question of a “quid pro quo"".
A top official with an India-based large institutional investor also said it is engaged in discussions with ICICI Bank officials on this issue. “It was a completely informal one-on-one meeting with a top official. During their discussion, we asked him about the recent controversy. The official said that it was a March 2016 issue, the bank’s board had reviewed it and it found no wrongdoing in the matter. He didn’t comment on the bank’s future action,"" this person said, on condition of anonymity.
ICICI Bank did not reply to emails seeking comment.
“ICICI being a private bank, the decisions about handling allegations of wrongdoing will be handled by the board of directors, which plays a supervisory role, RBI as the regulator and investigating agencies. If any criminality is found, the investigating agencies will deal with it. The government has only a minority stake in the bank. The question of demands for forensic audit too will be decided by the bank,"" a top finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity.
Since 23 March, ICICI Bank shares have risen 1.69%, lagging Bankex’s 6.01% gain. On Monday, ICICI Bank shares closed at Rs280.45, little changed from the previous day.
To be sure, out of 54 equity analysts who track ICICI Bank, only one has a sell rating on the stock. On Monday, Fitch Ratings, however, said that the current issue poses a “reputational risk"" for the bank. “The presence of the bank’s CEO on this credit committee (which sanctioned the Videocon loan)—and the bank’s reluctance to support an independent probe—have, in our opinion, created doubts over the strength of its corporate governance practices,"" Fitch said.
It added that governance at private banks such as ICICI Bank is generally stronger.
However, “these assumptions could come under question if the investigations expose misconduct at ICICI. The investigation could also undermine investor confidence in the bank, with potential implications for funding costs and liquidity in an extreme scenario, although its status as a systemically important bank implies it will benefit from some form of state support. Meanwhile, there is a potential risk of financial penalties, as well as legal action, if the investigation comes up with findings against the bank,"" Fitch said.
While the agency said that it would take appropriate rating action if risks to the bank’s reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably, it also said that the rating of the bank is underpinned by relatively strong capitalisation and profitability.
“Losses on the loan in question would be unlikely to significantly undermine ICICI’s financial profile—in particular, its core capitalization would remain strong even if the loan were completely written off,"" it said.

Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months. 
Mumbai: Shares of Axis Bank Ltd on Tuesday gained 5.4%, the most in more than five months, on speculation that India’s third largest private lender could be a potential acquisition target after its board accepted managing director Shikha Sharma’s plea to cut her fourth three-year term to seven months.
Sharma, who joined Axis Bank in 2009, will now step down on 31 December. Her fourth term as managing director and chief executive was originally set to end in June 2021.
“Our assessment suggests that Axis Bank will have to look for an external CEO. We believe this presents a great opportunity for Kotak Bank to acquire one of the largest liability/retail asset franchises,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Shares of Axis Bank touched a 16-month high of Rs627.50 on 23 January, but have eroded 13% since then.
In an interview to Bloomberg in November, Kotak Mahindra Bank managing director Uday Kotak had said the bank was open to acquisitions.
“We are pretty open to acquisitions as long as they make strategic sense, are value-accretive and are a good cultural fit,"" Kotak said.
According to Nomura, at current prices, the deal would be more than 40% accretive to the EPS/BPS (earnings per share/book value per share) of Kotak Bank.
“This should make it possible for Kotak Bank to offer some premium to Axis Bank shareholders to make the deal attractive to Axis Bank minority shareholders,"" Nomura analysts said, adding that the deal would be more than 25% accretive for Kotak Bank even after paying a 10-30% premium for Axis Bank.
A Kotak Mahindra Bank spokesperson said the bank does not comment on rumours and speculation. An Axis Bank spokesperson did not respond to an email seeking comment.
Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said it continues to prefer Axis Bank to ICICI Bank Ltd.
“We recommend a positive outlook for the stock. The stock has corrected 11% in the last three months vs ~3% correction for the broader market index,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note on Monday.
“We believe this captures a fair amount of bad news in the Mar ’18 quarter. If indeed the bank undertakes a clean-up exercise, we believe the H2FY19 outlook and beyond should improve dramatically,"" Jefferies added.
Larger rival ICICI Bank also saw its shares rise 3% on Tuesday, taking respite from rating agency Fitch Ratings’ comments on Monday that the bank’s rating is underpinned by relatively strong capitalization and profitability, and its core capitalisation would remain strong even if the Videocon loan in question were completely written off. 
The ratings agency, however, said the allegations did pose “reputational risks"" to the bank. 
The allegation relates to a loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the husband of ICICI Bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing."
601,2018-04-11,ICICI,"According to M. Damodaran, there are far too many things at ICICI Bank that are 'uncomfortable' and it is suffering from a huge reputation risk

Mumbai: There is concern over the governance premium in India in the wake of developments at private sector banks Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, M. Damodaran, a former chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said in an interview to CNBC TV 18 on Tuesday. 
Mumbai: There is concern over the governance premium in India in the wake of developments at private sector banks Axis Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, M. Damodaran, a former chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), said in an interview to CNBC TV 18 on Tuesday.
According to Damodaran, there are far too many things at ICICI Bank that are “uncomfortable"" and it is suffering from a huge reputation risk. “It is disquieting to use a very-very mild word and board should have appointed an independent inquiry authority, not do its own inquiry because there are stakeholders, there is reputation management. This can be done only by conducting an impartial inquiry, and that is what everyone does whether in India or outside,"" Damodaran said in the interview.
“The mitigation for reputational risk resides at the level of the board and nowhere else,"" he added.
News reports have raised questions about ICICI Bank sanctioning loans to Videocon because its chairman Venugopal Dhoot allegedly had dealings with NuPower, founded by Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar. Mint could not independently ascertain the veracity of these allegations.
According to the former bureaucrat, ICICI Bank being a systemically important bank, stakeholders have reasonably higher expectations from it. 
“What the board has done is to put it in telegraphic form, they seem to have jumped the gun,"" Damodaran said.
Typically, when someone joins a firm at a senior management post he/she is required to give a list of firms one is associated with to the board companies you are associated with, Damodaran said. 
“If a firm was set up subsequently, you are becoming a director of board. The minute it was set up and you perceive there was a conflict, which clearly there was, you were obliged to bring it to the notice of the board,"" he said. 
On Axis, where its chief executive and managing director Shikha Sharma decided to reduce her tenure on Monday and will now step down on 31 December, Damodaran said the board should have approached succession planning better. Sharma’s term was slated to end in June 2021.
If there were valid reasons to look at a fourth term of three years and the board decided collectively, when the regulator denied it there should have been a reason on why the board thinks Sharma should continue, said Damodaran. 
“The way the decision is taken is that when the term is about to expire, you ask yourself two questions. Who is best to lead the bank in next three-five years? You don’t ask the question, should we give her another extension? That is not the way to approach succession issue,"" said Damodaran."
600,2018-04-11,ICICI,"The Videocon loan case at ICICI Bank involving its CEO Chanda Kochhar raise the issue of conflict and its resolution, sufficiency of probe by the board

For a change, rather than public sector banks, the focus is on the governance of two private sector banks. There are many unanswered questions on role of their chief executive officers (CEOs) and boards. Indeed, these are tough times for directors of these banks. While issues at ICICI Bank relate to alleged conflict of interest of its CEO, at Axis Bank, the issue relates to alleged non-performance of its CEO. Unfortunately, in both cases, stakeholders only have half-baked information, not complete facts, and hence cannot make any conclusion.  
For a change, rather than public sector banks, the focus is on the governance of two private sector banks. There are many unanswered questions on role of their chief executive officers (CEOs) and boards. Indeed, these are tough times for directors of these banks. While issues at ICICI Bank relate to alleged conflict of interest of its CEO, at Axis Bank, the issue relates to alleged non-performance of its CEO. Unfortunately, in both cases, stakeholders only have half-baked information, not complete facts, and hence cannot make any conclusion. 
The events at ICICI Bank raise the issue of conflict and its resolution, sufficiency of probe by the board, and its issuing a clean chit versus the demand for independent probe and the continuation of the CEO. For critics, in case of conflict, recusal is the remedy. 
The CEO not chairing the credit committee that sanctioned the Videocon loan is eyewash. A recusal at best is a cosmetic solution. If the board is weak, it will still toe the line of the powerful, notwithstanding the recusal, and if it is strong, it will care a damn if the conflicted person was present.
The call for an independent probe when the board had given a clean chit is another prickly point. This demand reflects how little one believes in the board’s independence. Can we believe independent agencies? Their track record isn’t glorious either. Satyam got Maytas valued from an independent agency. Do we rely on balance sheets certified by so-called independent auditors? N.R. Narayana Murthy doubted not one but multiple independent probes in case of Infosys’s acquisition of Panaya and high severance package to top employees.
Why is there so much doubt? Is it because the finding does not conform to expectation or it does not reflect the truth? At least, in the ICICI case, the jury is not yet out.
Should the CEO continue or not is a personal choice. Yet, for an upright person, being shunted out is a matter of reputation. 
However, these are the risks you carry when in high office. Caesar’s wife must be above suspicion, but does that mean that the spouse of a successful CEO cannot pursue his/her profession? Is the board secretive? Adequate transparency is somewhere between secrecy and nakedness and one doesn’t know the right point. Whether the board is transparent or secretive will be known only after the truth is out. 
The Axis Bank issue raises questions on the board’s competence, independence and evaluation, and the role of the Reserve Bank of India. These events force one to conclude that all prescriptions of good governance are a farce. Otherwise, how can an independent board, having all performance details of its CEO, evaluate her and recommend reappointment, and then succumb when RBI finds otherwise? 
While at least in theory, a graceful compromise has been arrived at by the CEO asking that her term be curtailed, in practice, no one will buy this argument. It very clearly reflects that the board is either succumbing to the pressure of RBI or convinced that their decision was wrong. Both reflect poorly on the board. 
Did the board believe earlier that the current CEO was the best despite negative performance? If yes, why has it accepted the CEO’s request now? 
Or did RBI open its mind, activate its thinking machinery and members realized that the CEO needs to be changed? Why should the board accept RBI’s diktat if it believed in its CEO choice? Can the board not confront RBI? Is there two-way communication between regulator and regulated, or is it in the form of diktats only, or is it a way to put an end to uncomfortable questions?
Lawmakers thought that the answer to all ills was independence. However, most often, it is found that board members are mesmerized by the aura of the CEO or owe their existence to someone’s benevolence. Evaluation is an exercise for mutual maximization of brownie points, making it an exercise in futility. Things will change only when independence is not just a label but a trait of one’s character. Good governance will have to wait till then.

596,2018-04-12,ICICI,"ICICI Bank is preparing a plan that includes more public disclosures related to conflict-of-interest allegations against CEO Chanda Kochhar in the Videocon loan case

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd’s board is preparing a plan that includes more public disclosures related to conflict-of-interest allegations against its chief executive Chanda Kochhar with the objective of allaying the growing concerns of its shareholders and restoring their confidence in the bank. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd’s board is preparing a plan that includes more public disclosures related to conflict-of-interest allegations against its chief executive Chanda Kochhar with the objective of allaying the growing concerns of its shareholders and restoring their confidence in the bank.
The board plans to look afresh at disclosures that the bank has already made after its initial statement failed to assuage shareholders’ concerns, a person directly aware of the development said, without giving more details.
The plan appears to be an attempt to respond to shareholders who are demanding that the board, led by chairman M.K. Sharma, explain why it has given Kochhar a clean chit without first ordering an independent probe.
On 28 March, the ICICI Bank board issued a statement reposing its confidence in the corporate governance of the lender and the integrity of Kochhar. 
ICICI’s board was aware of a 2016 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) probe on this issue and considered that information before giving Kocchar a clean chit, added this person, speaking on condition of anonymity. RBI had initiated the probe after a whistle-blower alleged conflict of interest, said this person.
The board’s efforts come at a time when markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has begun a preliminary enquiry into the alleged corporate governance lapses at the bank.
Sebi is looking at three angles: whether there were any disclosure lapses on the bank’s part; the board’s role in decisions regarding loans given to the Videocon group; and independent directors’ view on the alleged conflict of interest, said another person aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.
Kochhar has been in the eye of a storm over the granting of a Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon group companies because her husband had business dealings with the Venugopal Dhoot-led conglomerate.
Sebi has so far sent routine queries to the bank and no specific queries have been sent on the above mentioned lines, said a third person familiar with the matter, also on condition of anonymity.
An email sent to a Sebi spokesperson was not answered till press time.
“Clarifications have been provided to Sebi with regard to the reports that have appeared in media,"" said an ICICI Bank spokesperson.
He added that Sebi has not asked the bank about the specific details mentioned in Mint’s queries.
“Sebi can examine the issue in terms of whether the bank has been making adequate disclosures in consonance with the listing agreement,"" said J.N. Gupta, co-founder and managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services.
Even so, the market regulator’s probe will be hobbled by the fact that the said transactions happened in 2012, when neither the Companies Act nor Sebi norms defined Related Party Transactions (RPT).
“One of the allegations against the bank is restructuring Videocon loans through a firm which appears to be a related party. But in 2012, RPT was not defined. But there was a concept of person of interest (to the company management),"" said the third person cited above.
The Economic Times reported on Thursday that in 2016, RBI had found no evidence of reciprocal benefit, stating the allegation “could not be conclusively established"". The newspaper, however, reported that RBI had raised some “red flags"" such as some NuPower Renewables investments coming from a Mauritius-based entity and ICICI Bank not declaring three firms that had dealings with NuPower as related parties.
“The RBI probe did not reveal any such flow of money from the bank to NuPower (the company owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar) which could indicate any mala fide transaction by any employee of the bank. The RBI report said disclosures were followed. The board was aware of it and after considering the information, the board supported the bank’s head and its management. The facts in the report of RBI were stated so clearly that the board never felt the need to do any additional independent inquiry after that,"" added the first person cited earlier.
“She (Chanda Kochhar) made all the disclosures about her relations, so all the things coming in the media reports now were already known to the board and after seeing all the disclosures, the board was not required to conduct any further inquiry,"" added this person.
The board is scheduled to meet on 7 May to consider its annual financial results.
“If Chanda Kochhar quits at this moment amid the ongoing market sentiment, it can be destabilizing for the bank and the stock, making people feel that she is guilty of something, when the fact is that she is not guilty or hiding anything. Let the authorities like CBI and RBI carry out their duties and when such authorities are conducting their studies, we don’t think any additional independent inquiry by any agency is required,"" added this person."

Mumbai: S&P Global Ratings on Thursday said Indian banks need to improve their risk management, and maintain strong governance processes, practices, and systems. 
The commentary comes at a time when two of India’s leading private sector lenders, ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd, are in the spotlight for over the role of their leaders—Chanda Kochhar and Shikha Sharma, respectively.
“As a number of banks in India confront serious governance and risk issues, the ‘tone at the top’ is crucial. Leadership groups in Indian banks need to ensure that they enhance the risk culture, reputation, and financial strength of banks,"" S&P credit analyst Michael Puli said in a note.
S&P said that while rating banks, management's ability and expertise to grow the business sustainably is assessed. “We view governance and transparency in Indian banking as a negative factor. This is similar to many other emerging markets."" 
At Axis Bank, the board has accepted current CEO Sharma’s request to cut short her fourth term of three years that begins on 1 June to seven months. On 2 April, The Economic Times reported that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has written to the Axis Bank board to review the extension, citing poor performance and worsening asset quality at the bank. 
S&P said that in its view smooth transition and continuity in management will be important for the bank. 
The rating agency noted efforts made by Axis Bank to resolve asset quality issues, improve provisioning levels, and restructuring of its operating controls to make it central point rather than the relevant business heads. 
“On 21 December 2017, we revised down our assessment of Axis Bank's stand-alone creditworthiness to reflect higher risks associated with asset quality and under-reporting of non-performing loans. While the effect of our assessment is the same as ICICI Bank, we assess Axis's risk management as weaker than that of private sector peer HDFC Bank Ltd,"" the rating agency said. 
At ICICI Bank, CEO Kochhar faces allegations of conflict of interest over grant of loans to a corporate group. On ICICI, S&P said that while the bank’s board has offered full support to the leadership team, in case the allegations against the management prove to be true, they could hit the bank's reputation and expose it to legal and financial risk."

A ballooning pile of bad loans, precarious capital positions and massive frauds are but only a slice of their problems. Little wonder that there has been a cacophony of voices clamouring for privatization of the state-run banks.

Little wonder that there has been a cacophony of voices clamouring for privatization of the state-run banks.
But in the past two weeks, an unprecedented set of events has turned that argument on its head. The developments have highlighted issues related to corporate governance at ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s second largest private bank, and performance issues at Axis Bank Ltd, the country’s third largest, exposing, as some say, the darker underbelly of the private banking business in India.

For Axis Bank’s managing director Shikha Sharma, matters came to a head when the banking regulator, Reserve Bank of India (RBI), asked the lender’s board to re-consider the decision to give Shikha Sharma a fourth term, citing concerns over rising NPAs under her watch.
Sharma has since sought an early termination of her fourth tenure that starts on 1 June. The request, which Axis Bank’s board has granted, will cut short her fourth three-year term by two-and-a-half years. 
The allegations against Chanda Kochhar, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of ICICI Bank, are of a more serious nature.
These relate to the controversy surrounding loans made by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group, whose controlling shareholders have business links with Chanda Kochhar’s husband. Later, allegations also surfaced that Kochhar’s brother-in-law was involved in restructuring foreign currency debt given by this bank.

The ICICI Bank board headed by chairman M.K. Sharma has so far backed its CEO, expressing full faith and confidence in her and denying any quid pro quo, nepotism or conflict of interest in her dealings as head of the bank. The board also reviewed the bank’s internal processes for credit approval and found them robust. N. Vaghul, a former chairman of the group, has also backed Kochhar, although he has said an independent enquiry to clear her name could have been undertaken. That enquiry has so far not been announced.
“I am puzzled by the board’s reluctance to order an independent enquiry into the matter without the managing director’s presence. Perhaps, long tenure distorts the balance of power between outside directors and the management in favour of the management,"" said R. Narayanaswamy, professor of finance and control at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore.

To compound Kochhar’s problems, federal agency Central Bureau of Investigation has started a preliminary enquiry into the alleged nexus between Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot and Kochhar’s husband, Deepak.
To be sure, some have alleged that the raising of the issue of the loan to Videocon group now points to a concerted campaign against Chanda Kochhar.
The issue was first brought to the board’s notice in 2016 and all the regulators had prior information about it, ICICI Bank chairman Sharma said.
“I don’t know if it is about diverting attention from other things such as Nirav Modi and Gitanjali Gems issues. All the regulators had this information in 2016. I do not see any reason for having a fresh look again and revive interest in the issue,"" he said in an interview to Mint.
Videocon loan case: Can Chanda Kochhar see off her biggest crisis yet?
While the developments have rightly shone the light on the nation’s private banks, it has given some respite to the beleaguered state-run banks, at least from the daily headline cycle. The focus on Kochhar has relegated developments about the $2 billion fraud at Punjab National Bank and the alleged mastermind, fugitive billionaire Nirav Modi, off the front pages of newspapers for a while. Modi and his jeweller uncle, Mehul Choksi, the controlling shareholder of Gitanjali Gems Ltd, allegedly in collusion with bank officials, obtained buyer’s credit for cheaper foreign-currency loans, without posting any collateral. When the loans matured, they took out even bigger ones to pay them off, somewhat like a Ponzi scheme. Investigating agencies say Modi is in Hong Kong while Choksi is in the US. The nephew-uncle duo left the country before the fraud was uncovered.

The controversy surrounding Kochhar has already led to problems for the bank. The initial public offering (IPO) of ICICI Securities Ltd, the investment banking unit of the lender, received a poor response from investors in the wake of the corporate governance issues. The weak response forced the company to cut its IPO size to Rs3,500 crore from Rs4,017-crore.
Large shareholders of ICICI Bank are already seeking answers from the lender’s board about the alleged governance failures and the steps the lender is taking to address them. In the coming days, this will determine the fate of Kochhar.  “We have had some meetings with the bank on concerns, whether there was any conflict of interest in granting these loans, whether the board was aware of these conflicts, and if they were, what (then) did the board do. We have also raised concerns on the possibility that the current CEO may step down. So far, the bank has assured us there was no conflict of interest and the CEO has the backing of the board,"" a fund manager told Mint on condition of anonymity.

Fitch Ratings said the current controversy poses a “reputational risk"" for the bank, and it would take appropriate rating action if risks to the bank’s reputation and financial profile were to rise considerably.
“The presence of the bank’s CEO on this credit committee (which sanctioned the Videocon loan)—and the bank’s reluctance to support an independent probe—have, in our opinion, created doubts over the strength of its corporate governance practices,"" Fitch said."
593,2018-04-13,ICICI,"Questions are being raised on corporate governance at ICICI Bank after its board gave a clean chit to CEO Chanda Kochhar in the Videocon loan case

In the last one month, the ICICI Bank Ltd stock has had a hard time. The erosion was triggered by allegations of misconduct against its chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar, accusing her of nepotism and misuse of her position in the bank. 
In the last one month, the ICICI Bank Ltd stock has had a hard time. The erosion was triggered by allegations of misconduct against its chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar, accusing her of nepotism and misuse of her position in the bank.
The allegations are by now well known. The developments since the allegations came to light have not been in favour of the bank. Kochhar’s relatives are being questioned by the Central Board of Investigation, and other agencies have also jumped into the fray.
In question is her presence in the credit committee that decided on loans to the Videocon group given the potential conflict of interest. Also in question is whether the board was aware of it.
The board led by chairman M.K Sharma gave a clean chit to Kochhar and put its weight behind her without any reservations. It was intended to demonstrate that the CEO enjoys the full faith of the group of people that appointed her. But it was also too hasty a decision.
A board of a company is expected to be independent of the stakeholders and the management. By giving Kochhar a clean chit without giving clarity or full disclosure on the allegations, the board has made itself look weak.
What the ICICI Bank board has done is undermine its own independence in the eyes of stakeholders. It hasn’t given clear reasons for its unwavering support to Ms Kochhar. and the potential conflict of interest involved in the Videocon-Kochhar relationship. There are scores of unanswered questions and investors have had to rely on third- party resources to get clarity. All this adds to the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the bank’s corporate governance practices, a cloud the board must dispel.
Transparency and detailed disclosures should have been the priority of the board and it owes them to the investors. “In view of the controversy surrounding potential conflicts of interest, the ICICI Bank board must take concrete steps to dispel the doubts in the minds of investors,"" said Jayant Thakur, an independent consultant.
At stake is the bank’s reputation. The board of ICICI Bank must now make amends by instituting an independent enquiry to repair the damage done to the reputation of the bank.
For the future, a rule that all directors and top officials of banks must disclose their dealings and their relatives’ dealings with firms financed by the bank in the annual report would be a step forward."
594,2018-04-13,ICICI,"ICICI Bank CEO Chanda  Kochhar showed a lack of judgment in not recusing herself from the committee that cleared a $500 million loan to Videocon

Chanda Kochhar is one of India’s top bankers. But does that mean that her employer, ICICI Bank Ltd, owes its chief executive officer a job no matter what? 
Chanda Kochhar is one of India’s top bankers. But does that mean that her employer, ICICI Bank Ltd, owes its chief executive officer a job no matter what?
The CEO’s husband, Deepak Kochhar, is being investigated for windfall gains from his association with businessman Venugopal Dhoot, whose struggling Videocon group is a large debtor to ICICI. Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved a $500 million loan to Videocon.
No deposit-taking institution, especially one with a history of prior bank runs, can afford a leader who’s in the news for all the wrong reasons. The state’s inquiry into the CEO’s spouse is still preliminary, and it may not result in charges. But the scandal could drag on, and that’s not exactly fair to shareholders.
Kochhar showed a lack of judgment in not recusing herself from the committee that cleared the loan. The possible conflict of interest extends to her husband’s brother, Singapore-based Rajiv Kochhar, who has performed debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon. While the work wasn’t commissioned by the bank, the fact that government investigators stopped Rajiv Kochhar from leaving India and have questioned him multiple times doesn’t inspire confidence in the board. (The bank has argued that Kochhar had no obligation to disclose her brother-in-law’s involvement because he isn’t defined as a relative under the law.)
In these circumstances, for the stewards of ICICI to hunker down and express “full faith and confidence"" in the CEO, as they did on 28 March, is remarkable. It also may be premature because, as Fitch Ratings says, there’s a “potential risk of financial penalties, as well as legal action,"" if the government’s investigation comes up with findings against the bank.
ICICI directors can’t possibly have enough information to determine whether Dhoot gave a quid pro quo to the CEO’s husband. Dhoot and Deepak Kochhar have denied any wrongdoing, but for the board to dismiss the possibility based on a simple review of the bank’s decision-making process may have been ill-advised.
The board is now divided, with some members having second thoughts about the early vote of confidence, George Smith Alexander and Anto Antony of Bloomberg News reported on Monday. That’s understandable. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, embarrassed by a recent $2 billion scandal at state-run Punjab National Bank, can’t afford another dent to its assertion of being tough on corporate malfeasance.
If a change of regime is inevitable, would that be unfair to Kochhar, whose current term expires in March next year? What if this is all a ploy by powerful enemies to bring her down?
That isn’t an unrealistic hypothesis at a time when India’s banking system is clogged with more than $200 billion in stressed loans, most of them taken out by large business groups. For the first time, a new bankruptcy law is making business families fear losing prized trophies for non-payment of debt; so far, bankers have targeted only small businesses with no real power to strike back.
Bear in mind also that there are two camps lobbying for alternative policies. One calls for sweeping privatization, holding up the pathetic Punjab National-style risk management at state-owned banks to buttress its argument. The rival faction favours the status quo and could use a scandal at ICICI, the second-largest private bank. State-owned lenders control 70% of banking assets, so privatization could completely alter the pecking order.
These wider questions aren’t for the ICICI board to consider. As the agents of shareholders—of a bank listed in both India and New York—they have a fiduciary responsibility. Chairman Mahendra Kumar Sharma, a former legal eagle at Unilever NV’s Indian operations, should at least initiate a debate on the merits of retaining a CEO who has underperformed peers by share-price returns since the start of her reign in May 2009. The buildup of bad loans during her tenure is sufficient cause to try out a new leader.
Vikram Pandit got his marching orders after he steered a floundering Citigroup Inc. out of the squalls of the 2008 crisis. Uber Technologies Inc.’s Travis Kalanick was forced out of the company he created. Even the late Steve Jobs, father of the Macintosh computer, was once fired from what was then Apple Computer Inc.
Unless Kochhar’s departure would somehow cause the demise of double-entry accounting or fractional-reserve banking, the ICICI board will find it increasingly tough to justify keeping her in the job. As for potential conflicts of interest, the time for the board to order an external inquiry was when the current allegations surfaced in a whistle-blower complaint in 2016. Now, with the Central Bureau of Investigation starting a preliminary probe, that chance is lost. 
The ICICI board must adore its CEO to have backed her so far without seemingly asking for much in return, but things have become cozy even by India’s poor corporate governance standards. From here on, limitless love may only wear down shareholders’ patience. Bloomberg Gadfly"

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had two years back conducted a detailed scrutiny to probe allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to Videocon Group but found no proof of any “quid pro quo"" or reciprocal benefits, according to RBI documents. 
Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had two years back conducted a detailed scrutiny to probe allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to Videocon Group but found no proof of any “quid pro quo"" or reciprocal benefits, according to RBI documents.
The RBI had undertaken a scrutiny in mid-2016 after the prime minister’s office referred to it allegations of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband, Deepak reaping windfall gains from his association with businessman Venugopal Dhoot, whose Videocon Group is a large debtor to ICICI. 
The RBI, which is the regulator for the banking sector, in its first response, sometime in mid-July of 2016, stated that ICICI Bank had sanctioned a loan of Rs1,730 crore to the Videocon Group in 2012 as part of a debt consolidation programme undertaken through a consortium of banks led by the State Bank of India, according to the documents and officials with direct knowledge of the matter. 
It went on to state that it was difficult to establish any conflict of interest in the sanctioning of the loan but flagged that it was not able to determine the sources of funding in some of the transactions involving Deepak Kochhar’s renewable energy venture NuPower. The source of funding was critical for ascertaining the legitimacy of NuPower transactions, the RBI had said, adding that it was for investigative agencies to ascertain that. 
Later in December that year, RBI gave a detailed response to allegations of “quid pro quo"" in loan sanctioned to the Videocon Group in 2007-08 and 2012, saying ICICI Bank was a part of the debt recast programme of Rs20,195 crore by a consortium of banks led by SBI, where ICICI Bank’s share was Rs1,750 crore. 
RBI stated that ‘quid pro quo’ could not be established as ICICI Bank had to take a share like other banks in the consortium, they said. 
The central bank said the transfer of ownership of NuPower Renewables Ltd, which Deepak had set up with Dhoot family in December 2008, by Videocon was an unrelated event outside the banking domain. Such a transfer can only be examined by Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) or ministry for corporate affairs (MCA). 
On the investment in NuPower coming from Mauritius, the RBI had stated that the funds had come under the automatic route and reported to the central bank and no violation was reported.
According to the RBI papers, the central bank had left it to the department of financial services in the ministry of finance to investigate if there was a non-disclosure of related party transaction or if there were FEMA (Foreign Exchange Management Act) violations. 
The RBI, however, raised questions over the ownership of the Mauritius-based entity, First Land Holding, which had invested Rs325 crore in NuPower. Also, there was no clarity over the alleged Rs64 crore loan (unsecured fully convertible debentures) given to NuPower by Supreme Energy, which was 99.99% owned by Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot at that time. 
While Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved the loan to Videocon, there are allegations of conflict of interest in her husband’s brother, Singapore-based Rajiv Kochhar, performing debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon. The restructuring wasn’t commissioned by the bank but by the borrowers. 
Last month, the board of ICICI Bank expressed full faith in Chanda Kochhar, whose current tenure as CEO is set to end on 31 March, 2019. It had reviewed credit approval processes and found them to be robust, according to a 28 March filing by the Bank."

The next time you are hiring an Ola cab, you may be able to insure your ride for as low as Re1. Cab aggregator Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd) recently announced a tie-up with Acko General Insurance Ltd and ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd to provide in-trip insurance to its customers.  
The next time you are hiring an Ola cab, you may be able to insure your ride for as low as Re1. Cab aggregator Ola (ANI Technologies Pvt. Ltd) recently announced a tie-up with Acko General Insurance Ltd and ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd to provide in-trip insurance to its customers. 
The Acko offering is live in all the 110 cities in which Ola provides services, an Ola spokesperson said. Ola’s partnership with ICICI Lombard will also go live in the coming months, said the company. Here’s what the present Acko travel cover is offering to Ola riders. 
What’s the cost?
The premiums are different for the three categories of rides that Ola lets you book. 
For intra-city cabs—Ola share, mini, prime and auto—the premium is Re1 per ride. For rental cabs, which can be booked for fixed distances and durations, the premium is  ₹ 0 per ride. For outstation cabs, it is  ₹ 15 per ride. A round-trip booking on an outstation cab will be considered one ride, said Varun Dua, chief executive officer, Acko General Insurance. 
You will find a ride insurance option in the ‘My Profile’ section of your Ola app, and can enable or disable the insurance option through the app interface.
What’s covered?
All three types of rides have the accidental medical expense (with a cover of Rs1 lakh) that pays for hospitalization due to an accident while you were in the cab, hospital daily allowance (Rs500 per day for up to 7 days), ambulance transportation (Rs10,000), accidental death benefit (Rs5 lakh) and permanent total or partial disability covers (Rs5 lakh). 
In case of accidental medical expense, the claims can be made cashless if the insurance company is intimated before hospitalization. “However, most accidents result in emergency hospitalization and hence the claims have to be made at a later stage. Claims can be made through our app by submitting the required documents,"" Dua said. 
Other covers under the policy include insurance against a missed domestic flight (Rs5,000), loss of baggage or laptop (Rs20,000), emergency hotel requirement (Rs10,000) and home insurance (Rs1 lakh). However, all these four covers are not applicable to all rides (see: www.acko.com/ola/tc). The missed flight insurance is not available to rental cabs and the other three covers are only applicable to outstation cabs.
You can make a missed flight claim only if your cab’s estimated time of arrival at the airport is 90 minutes before the scheduled departure. For Ola share and outstation rides, this limit is 120 minutes. This claim can be made only if the destination is specified as airport at the time of booking. If the destination is changed during the ride, the claim won’t be admissible.
What isn’t?
The cover will be available only if a cab is booked through the Ola app. Under the electronic equipment cover as part of the loss of baggage cover, only laptops are included, but not mobile phones. Similarly, it does not cover loss of valuables like cash or jewellery under both loss of baggage as well as home insurance (including for theft, fire and allied perils). The claims can be made only after an FIR is lodged and it confirms the specific loss of baggage. Similarly, in case of a home insurance claim, an FIR confirming that the loss happened when you were on an outstation trip will be needed. 
Claims under this category (this is true for all claims under the policy) won’t be entertained if the number of passengers (including driver) is more than the vehicle’s seating capacity.
Should you buy?
“It is a good concept, but the customer should get the policy certificate, and the claim process and time-frame should be well-defined,"" said Prakash Praharaj, founder, Max Secure Financial Planners. 
While the premiums are really low, especially for intra-city rides, you will have to decide if you need it depending upon the covers you already have."
589,2018-04-16,ICICI,"The latest developments at ICICI Bank and Axis Bank warrants a look at what the Banking Regulation Act has to say about corporate governance at banks

The latest developments at two large private banks in India spotlight the role of the board of banks, the chief executive officer (CEO), corporate governance and the so-called conflict of interest. 
The latest developments at two large private banks in India spotlight the role of the board of banks, the chief executive officer (CEO), corporate governance and the so-called conflict of interest.
Eliminating conflict of interest is at the heart of provisions in the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, which governs the banking companies in India. Bimal Jalan was the first Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor to make a formal policy announcement on corporate governance in the mid-term review of the monetary and credit policy on 21 October 2001. A consultative group was set up the following month under the chairmanship of A.S. Ganguly, an industry expert and former chairman of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. Before that, in March 2001, an advisory group on corporate governance, headed by R.H. Patil—founder of NSE Ltd—had examined the relevant issues in the Indian banking industry and made recommendations to raise the governance standards. Yet another advisory group on banking supervision, chaired by former chairman of State Bank of India M.S. Verma, submitted its report in January 2003.
The mid-term review of the monetary and credit policy in November 2003 introduced the concept of “fit and proper"" criteria for directors of banks, following the recommendations of the Ganguly Committee. The exercise dealt with the process of collecting information, doing due diligence and the constitution of a nomination committee of the board to scrutinize the declarations made by the bank directors.
An RBI circular, dated 24 June 2004, lays down norms for selection of directors on boards of private banks, based on their qualification, expertise, track record and integrity. At least 51% of the directors need to have special knowledge or practical experience in areas such as accountancy, agriculture and rural economy, banking, cooperation, economics, finance, law and small-scale industry. This requirement arises out of Section 10A(2)(a) of the Banking Regulation Act.
Where the buck stops
Indeed, the board plays a critical role in running a bank, but the buck stops at the managing director and CEO. Section 10B of the Banking Regulation Act makes it abundantly clear that the management of the affairs of a private bank is “entrusted"" to a managing director, who exercises his powers, “subject to the superintendence, control and direction of the board of directors"".
For governance, the various committees of a bank board oversee different aspects of business, but I am not sure whether each of them is as effective as they are meant to be. For instance, the credit committee of a large private bank at this point has three members—its chairman, who is a legal expert; its managing director and CEO; and another independent director, who is a public policy specialist with expertise in water management. Apart from the managing director and CEO of the bank, do the other people have expertise to clear high-value loans? Are they there to challenge and question the decisions of the managing director and CEO, or endorse them? How many credit proposals get rejected by such a panel?
Section 36ACA of the Banking Regulation Act empowers RBI to supersede the board of directors of banks—“in public interest or for preventing the affairs of any banking company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors""—but for a period not exceeding six months. The supersession of the board can be extended but not beyond 12 months. During this period, an administrator with experience in law, finance, banking, economics or accountancy needs to be appointed, but the person cannot be an officer of the central or any state government. RBI can constitute a committee of at least three people to help the administrator run the bank.
The punishment
Under Section 46 of the Act, if any bank official furnishes a false statement or suppresses facts in “any return, balance-sheet or other document"", the punishment can be imprisonment up to three years or a penalty of Rs1 crore or both. Depending on the nature of the offence, the penalty varies, and there is a provision of imposing a fine of Rs50,000 for every day during which the offence/default continues.
In all these cases, there is a legal process involved; but for certain offences, the courts have no role to play. Section 47A of the Act which defines RBI’s power to impose penalty says the central bank needs to issue a show cause notice to a bank before imposing penalty for certain offences and must offer a “reasonable opportunity of being heard"" and “no complaint can be filed against any bank in any court of law in respect of any contravention or default in respect of which any penalty has been imposed"". A bank needs to pay the penalty within two weeks of receiving the RBI notice.
CEO’s appointment
Under the Banking Regulation Act, RBI’s “prior"" approval is a must for appointment and reappointment of the CEO; the central bank could seek the CEO’s removal also. . Apart from solvency, it does not specify what qualities a CEO should possess, but points out what the person should not. An individual being appointed as CEO should be solvent, should not have suspended payment to creditors or settled for payment of a lesser amount and must not be convicted by a criminal court of an offence involving moral turpitude.
In the application form for RBI approval of a CEO’s appointment/reappointment, a private bank needs to explain whether the person to be appointed as CEO is subject to any of the disqualifications mentioned in Section 10B(4) of the Banking Regulation Act.
This particular section deals with the “substantial interest"" that a prospective CEO should not have in any other company or a partnership firm.
What is substantial interest? It is “direct"" or “beneficial interest"" held by the individual or spouse of such an individual, or minor child of such an individual, whether singly or taken together, in the shares of a company which exceeds Rs5 lakh or 10% of the paid up capital of the company—whichever is less. “Substantial interest"" in partnership firms does not specify any value, but says the holding should not be more than 10% of the total capital subscribed by all the partners.
Who is a relative?
Against the backdrop of recent developments, at the centre stage is the definition of “relative"". Going by the provision of the Companies Act, 1956, a person is a relative of another if they are members of a Hindu undivided family—or, they are husband and wife.
Besides, Schedule 1A of the Act lists 22 relations. They are: father, mother (including step mother), son (step son), son’s wife, daughter (step daughter), father’s father, father’s mother, mother’s father, mother’s mother, son’s son, son’s wife’s son, son’s daughter, son’s daughter’s husband, daughter’s husband, daughter’s son, daughter’s son’s wife, daughter’s daughter, daughter’s daughter’s husband, bothers (step brothers), brother’s wife, sister (step sister) and sister’s husband.
Companies Act, 2013, which replaced the old Act, compressed the list; now, only eight relations feature there. They are: father (including step father), mother (step mother), son, son’s wife, daughter, daughter’s husband, brother (step brother) and sister (step sister).
The new Act got the assent of the President of India on 29 August 2013 and was notified on 30 August. Various provisions of the Act were enforced on different dates. The definition of relative was enforced on 12 September 2013. This means, till then, the old definition as outlined in the earlier Act continued.
Section 184(1) of the new Companies Act says every director at the first meeting of the board in which he participates and, subsequently, at the first board meeting in every financial year, or whenever there is any change in the disclosures already made and at the first board meeting held after such change, should disclose his interest in any company. If a director violates this provision, the punishment is imprisonment for up to one year or Rs50,000-Rs1 lakh penalty or both.
Also, the rules that define the meetings of a board and its powers dictate that the companies that are required to set up an audit committee (banks fall in this category) must ensure that if any of the members of the committee has a conflict of interest in a given case, the person should recuse himself from attending the relevant meeting. Also, every director must disclose interest in any company by giving a notice.
Finally, even where the director himself has no personal interest in any contract or arrangement but any of his relatives has, the director is deemed to be indirectly interested.
Anomalies and absurdities
Indeed, all provisions of the law as well as definitions need to be seen in the context of developments; if we take them literally, there will be many anomalies and absurdities. For instance, in 1949, when the Banking Regulation Act was framed, the value of Rs5 lakh was enormous. (I am not sure whether this amount has remained unchanged since inception of the Act)
Over time, many parts of the law have become archaic. Sections 5 and 6 of the Act list the businesses that a bank can undertake but the list does not include many contemporary business opportunities. For instance, insurance, mutual funds, management of pension funds, hire purchase, among many other businesses, do not feature in the list. The banks could get into these after the government allowed them through special notifications.
Still, all of us are curious whether the bank CEOs make all the disclosures they need to do. Most CEOs in private banks have long innings and, often, they are home-bred, rising from the ranks. This means they join the board as a director even before becoming the boss. Do they make the disclosures through their career? After all, perception about governance is as important as governance itself.
There are many ways to restore the perceived erosion of standards about governance in Indian banks—both private and public. One of them could be appointment of governance officers. Their task is very different from that of ethics officers, which some of the Indian companies, including banks, have started appointing. But then, the company secretary of a bank, to a large extent, is the governance officer in a bank. Are they doing their jobs properly?

ICICI Securities, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank Ltd, posted a net profit growth of nearly 91% in the March quarter from to a year ago. But profit has hardly moved compared to the preceding quarter. For the December quarter, net profit was Rs153 crore and that inched up to Rs158.6 crore in the March quarter. 
“January was a very good month for brokers what with the markets being on a strong wicket,"" says Digant Haria, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd. That should have helped ICICI Securities report a much better March quarter although February and March were subdued months, he added.
On a year-on-year basis, overall operating costs (including employee costs, operating and other expenses) have grown at a much slower pace relatively at 5%. Revenue growth, on the other hand, was robust at 35% (for fiscal 2018, revenue was 32% up).
While that looks good, “if at all revenues decline, operating deleveraging will start to play considering most of the costs are fixed in nature,"" reckons Haria.
Within revenues, income from services (which is essentially its non-broking business and comprises of revenue from distribution and investment banking) grew slightly faster at about 38%. This should bring cheer, albeit not much. Broking revenues account for a big chunk of total revenue at 63% and that’s a risk.
The road ahead is not easy. Ironically, ICICI Securities faces competition from its parent i.e. ICICI Bank in the distribution and investment banking business, pointed out analysts from Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt Ltd in a report on 21 March. “We believe its peers have created a better niche for themselves in these areas thus making it difficult for ICICI Securities to have a sharp profitable growth,"" added the brokerage.
What of the stock?
Despite the 3% increase in ICICI Securities’ share price on Friday, the stock is nearly 19% lower than its issue price of Rs520 per share. Blame two things for the lacklustre debut: One, its valuations were rich to begin with. And the recent correction still doesn’t make it too cheap. The stock trades at 24 times fiscal 2018 earnings.
Secondly, the allegations of impropriety against ICICI Bank’s chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar have weighed on sentiment for the stock. Analysts expect this overhang to continue for some more time, which means the underperformance in the stock is unlikely to reverse soon."

New Delhi: The government is reviewing the appointment of Pradeep Kumar to the Banks Board Bureau (BBB), amid concerns about his links to Avista Advisory group, an official familiar with the development said. 
Avista was founded by Rajiv Kochhar, brother-in-law of ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar. 
The company is under the scanner of investigative agencies in a case involving alleged conflict of interest in loans given by ICICI Bank to the Videocon Group. 
According to an Indian Express report, Kumar, a former managing director of State Bank of India, was an adviser to Avista, and quit only last week. 
“The government is looking into the appointment of P. Pradeep Kumar as BBB member,"" the official cited above said on the condition of anonymity.
Last week, the government had announced the reconstitution of the Banks Board Bureau under retired bureaucrat Bhanu Pratap Sharma and tasked it with the appointment of senior-level appointments at state-run banks as well as to address the human resource challenges at the lenders. 
When contacted, Kumar said the government has not reached out to him and he is not aware of any such development. 
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had registered a preliminary inquiry last month against Deepak Kochhar, Chanda Kochhar’s husband, as well as Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot, for a loan made to the company in 2012 by a consortium of banks. 
ICICI Bank’s exposure to the 20-bank consortium loan is Rs3,250 crore. 
So far, the CBI has collected documents pertaining to the Rs40,000 crore loan granted to Videocon group by a consortium of lenders and documents pertaining to the setting up of NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd, which was founded by Deepak Kochhar, in 2008. 
Rajiv Kochhar has also been questioned by the CBI."

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday questioned Sunil Bhuta, chief financial officer of NuPower, as part of a preliminary enquiry against the company controlled by the husband of ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive Chanda Kochhar and Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot. 
New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday questioned Sunil Bhuta, chief financial officer of NuPower, as part of a preliminary enquiry against the company controlled by the husband of ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive Chanda Kochhar and Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot.
The investigative agency stated that Bhuta was being questioned in Delhi. 
The move comes two weeks after CBI questioned Chanda Kochhar’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar, founder of financial services firm Avista Advisory Group. 
A preliminary enquiry registered by the CBI early in March against her husband Deepak Kochhar, and Dhoot sought to verify an alleged conflict of interest in a Rs3,250 crore loan made by ICICI Bank to Videocon group. 
ICICI Bank’s contribution was part of a Rs40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012. 
Dhoot allegedly gave Rs64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd, a firm that he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. 
It was alleged that Dhoot transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for Rs9 lakh, six months after receiving the loan from ICICI Bank—an allegation that he denied to Mint, stating that “Videocon did not possess shares of NuPower when ICICI sanctioned the loan."""

Mumbai: Kolkata-based non-banking finance company (NBFC) Magma Fincorp Ltd on Wednesday said it has raised Rs500 crore from institutional investors through a so-called qualified institutional placement (QIP).
Magma provides products such as commercial finance, agri finance, small and medium enterprises (SME) finance and mortgage finance through Magma Housing Finance.
Shares were issued to institutional investors at Rs155 each.
The offering saw participation from investors such as Amansa Holdings Pvt. Ltd, Goldman Sachs India Ltd, HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd and DB International Asia Ltd.
With this, the shareholding of promoters in Magma Fincorp has come down to 24.5% from 27% earlier.

Existing investors in Magma include Indian private equity (PE) firms True North and ChrysCapital, World Bank arm International Finance Corp. (IFC), global private equity major KKR and Co. LP and LeapFrog Investments, which specializes in investments in financial services in Africa and Asia.
According to Baheti, proceeds from the QIP issue will be used by the company for business growth and to enhance capital adequacy ratio.

581,2018-04-22,ICICI,"Sebi is considering to get a forensic test done on financial statements and disclosures made by ICICI Bank amid a row over alleged conflict of interest involving the lender's CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband

New Delhi:Markets watchdog the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is mulling getting a forensic examination done on financial statements and disclosures made by ICICI Bank in last few years amid a controversy over alleged conflict of interest involving the lender’s CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband.  
New Delhi:Markets watchdog the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is mulling getting a forensic examination done on financial statements and disclosures made by ICICI Bank in last few years amid a controversy over alleged conflict of interest involving the lender’s CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband. 
According to top officials, the capital markets regulator will also consult the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on the matter to avoid any intra-regulatory jurisdiction issues. 
The forensic examination will focus on various disclosures made by the top private sector bank over the last few years, vis-a-vis the clarifications submitted by ICICI Bank to the stock exchanges in reply to queries made in the backdrop of a controversy regarding certain loans extended as part of a consortium to Videocon. 
Officials said the examination will also cover the disclosures made at the time of Kochhar being appointed as CEO and managing director of the bank for the first time in 2009. 
If required, Sebi will also seek details from the bank regarding various business dealings involving its top officials including Kochhar to look into alleged conflict of interest. 
Sebi has been looking into the matter for any possible disclosure and corporate governance-related lapses at ICICI Bank, but has not come across any concrete proof so far, the officials said. 
A probe by RBI in 2016 also did not find any ‘quid pro quo’ vis-a-vis ICICI Bank with regard to the loan extended to Videocon by the consortium which had the private sector lender as ‘a small member’, they added. 
ICICI Bank landed in the controversy following allegations about a Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group, whose chairman Venugopal Dhoot has been accused of having business dealings with NuPower Renewables, operated by Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar. 
Besides, questions have been raised about Avista Advisory, run by Chanda’s brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar, having advised some clients of ICICI Bank. 
The bank however has denied all these allegations and its board has strongly defended the chief executive saying it has full faith and confidence in Kochhar. 
Since RBI had already looked into the matter in 2016 and found no wrongdoing, the bank and its board members have been exuding confidence that the company would get out of the controversy unscathed.
Kochhar has been known as one of the biggest driving forces behind the phenomenal growth of ICICI Bank, especially of its retail banking operations which got redefined following the entry of this private sector lender in the Indian banking space. 
Subsequently, she has played a key role in expanding the bank’s business in other areas and its diversification, including the digital push in recent years."
580,2018-04-23,ICICI,"ICICI Securities is advising Federal Bank on the Fedfina stake sale, and the transaction is likely to conclude within a few weeks

Private equity (PE) fund True North Capital is in advanced talks to buy a 26% stake in Fedbank Financial Services (Fedfina) for Rs400 crore, two people in the know said. Fedfina, a non-banking finance company (NBFC) fully owned by Federal Bank Ltd, offers mostly home loans, auto loans and gold loans. 
Private equity (PE) fund True North Capital is in advanced talks to buy a 26% stake in Fedbank Financial Services (Fedfina) for Rs400 crore, two people in the know said. Fedfina, a non-banking finance company (NBFC) fully owned by Federal Bank Ltd, offers mostly home loans, auto loans and gold loans.
The transaction is expected to conclude within a few weeks, said the first person, on condition of anonymity. ICICI Securities is advising Federal Bank on the transaction, he added.
Fedfina’s loan portfolio as on 31 March 2017 was Rs962 crore against Rs611 crore as on 31 March 2016. Profit after tax for the year ended 31 March 2017 increased to Rs22.53 crore from Rs12.25 crore in the previous year.
According to the Federal Bank annual report, Fedfina posted Rs134.6 crore revenue in 2016-17 against Rs89.4 crore the previous year. Calls and text messages made to Shyam Srinivasan, managing director and chief executive officer at Federal Bank went unanswered while spokespersons at True North and ICICI Securities declined to comment. 
True North Managers Llp, previously known as India Value Fund Advisors, is an active investor in NBFCs. It bought a majority stake in Mumbai-based Home First Finance Co. India Pvt. Ltd for about $100 million (Rs667 crore) last year.
The housing finance company was co-founded in 2010 by former MphasiS Ltd chairman Jaithirth Rao and former Citibank consumer banking head P.S. Jayakumar. It provides loans of Rs1-30 lakh, mostly to first-time homebuyers. True North has a strong presence in the financial services space through investments in other NBFCs—Magma Fincorp Ltd and small finance bank Fincare Ltd. True North, which has launched five investment funds with a combined corpus of $2 billion, is currently investing out of Fund V which has a corpus of $700 million.
At a time when banks have started reducing their loan disbursements in the backdrop of rising bad loans, NBFCs see a high growth opportunity in India.
“Financial services have been and will continue to be an area of focus for PE investments,"" said Kaushal Shah, executive director and head—financial services, Kotak Investment Banking. However, with significant PE investments in NBFCs, investors are looking for niche and differentiated stories where their investment can make a difference, he added.
Early this month, ChrysCapital Advisors Llp acquired a significant minority stake in Thirumeni Finance Pvt. Ltd, a Bengaluru-based NBFC that operates under the name Varthana and specializes in providing debt financing to affordable private schools, for Rs350 crore.
“Changing demographics and low credit penetration have made NBFCs attractive... Higher margins and falling interest rates have boosted consumption and therefore borrowings. This makes NBFCs an attractive investment target for PE firms as they ride the credit-fuelled consumption boom,"" said an August 2017 PwC-Assocham report.
Last week, Special situations investor SSG Capital Management bought nearly 47% stake in Shapoorji Pallonji Finance Pvt. Ltd (SPFPL), an NBFC which is part of the Shapoorji Pallonji group. Global PE firm Lone Star will jointly invest Rs2,600 crore with RattanIndia Group to launch a non-banking financial company (NBFC) RattanIndia Finance, it said last week. 
Coupled with lower cost, a focused approach on limited credit products and strong underlying risk management capabilities help NBFCs to not only underwrite credit to a targeted set of customers but also to control bad debts, making them one of the attractive sectors for PE funding, according to the PwC report Fuelling NBFCs through Private Capital."

Mumbai: The stock market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sought details of a large investment made by ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund in the flop IPO of affiliate ICICI Securities Ltd, two people aware of the matter said.
ICICI Securities had to cut its IPO size to Rs3,520 crore from the original target of Rs4,017 crore because of poor investor interest. Of this, a large chunk was bought by ICICI MF. 
“Queries have been sent to exchanges, merchant bankers and Registrar and Transfer Agents. This is based on the concern that a related party, ICICI MF, has taken a massive exposure to ICICI Securities during its IPO,"" said one of the two people cited above. Both declined to be identified.
The queries were sent last week, said the second person, adding that “exchanges are compiling the data and would be responding to the regulator’s queries this week"". 
Cogencis first reported on 13 April that ICICI Prudential was the largest buyer in the ICICI Securities share sale. 
ICICI Securities and a spokesperson for BSE declined to comment. Emails sent to Sebi and NSE were not answered till press time. 
To be sure, ICICI MF’s investment in ICICI Securities is in line with Sebi regulations and the asset management company’s investment mandate. However, Sebi can initiate an investigation to ascertain if the fund house is in violation of the model code of conduct prescribed in Sebi’s norms for mutual funds. 
In an emailed response, an ICICI MF spokesperson said, “All our investments are carried out in line with the regulatory guidelines and established processes. The quantum of our investments that has been made in the IPO is in line with investments made in other primary issues where we have invested.""
ICICI MF is ICICI Securities’ largest public shareholder with 3.82% stake, according to the company’s shareholding pattern on BSE. Other major public shareholders are HDFC Mutual Fund at 1.2% and Reliance Mutual Fund at 1.04%. 
High valuations were seen as the reason for investors’ indifference to ICICI Securities, the brokerage and investment banking arm of ICICI Bank. The IPO had opened amid allegations of impropriety against the bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar. 
On the day of listing, the stock crashed 14.4% from the issue price of 520 to close at Rs445.05. On Monday, it closed at Rs423.35 on the BSE, 18.6% below the issue price.
“ICICI MF has put in more than Rs600 crore in the IPO. More than half of QIB (qualified institutional buyer) quota was subscribed by the AMC,"" the second person said. 
“If ICICI AMC knew that the issue was undersubscribed, then they are wholly responsible for the decision. But in case the bankers did not go back and ask ICICI AMC whether they want to reduce their bid amount given the issue is undersubscribed, then the bankers need to answer why they did not keep the investors informed,"" said Amit Tandon, managing director at proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services. 
“Ethically, it can be questioned that this seems like a bailout of a sister company. However, the fund house can justify this by saying that they have a long-term view on the company,"" said J.N. Gupta, co-founder and managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services, a proxy advisory firm. 
According to a person familiar with the development, ICICI MF’s investment in ICICI Securities is based on a long-term view on the company. “Digital space is attractive and by that logic, ICICI Securities and ICICI Direct. ICICI Securities also looks good in terms of long-term investment,"" this person said on condition of anonymity."

Mumbai: ICICI Home Finance Company (HFC) Ltd has set itself an ambitious target of growing its loan book to Rs30,000 crore in next three to four years, riding on the wave of low-cost housing segment, according to a top official of the lender.  
Mumbai: ICICI Home Finance Company (HFC) Ltd has set itself an ambitious target of growing its loan book to Rs30,000 crore in next three to four years, riding on the wave of low-cost housing segment, according to a top official of the lender. 
Currently, the loan book stands at Rs10,000 crore. 
In an interview, Anup Bagchi, chairman of ICICI HFC, said that leaving behind the chatter around a potential sale of the company, the lender has charted a growth path of increasing its network and loan book with focus on customers from lower and middle income groups. 
In November 2017, Mint had reported that Everstone Capital-backed IndoStar Capital Finance Ltd had called off a deal to acquire ICICI Home Finance Co. owing to synergy issues.
According to Bagchi, starting fiscal 2019, there will be divergence in the focus area of the housing company and ICICI Bank. So far, the product offerings of both entities were similar. 
“Now, it (HFC) will primarily focus on assessed income mortgage,"" he said, adding it will target borrowers with ticket size of Rs15 lakh and below. The target is also to have the share of these loans in the total book to be at least 75% in three to four years.
Bagchi explained that assessing this category of borrowers, based on income, security and saleability of security, requires a skill set, which is best suited in the HFC format.
To achieve its aim in 18 months, ICICI HFC plans to increase its reach to 1,000 locations from current 400. The lender is adequately capitalised, Bagchi said. 
He said the government’s thrust on ‘Housing for all by 2022’ had opened big opportunities for the housing sector. This initiative also incentivises borrowers, with subsidy payment under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, developers as well as lenders. 
Bagchi also said that the growth of housing sector in its targeted semi-urban and rural areas is growing faster than metros. 
Separately, ICICI HFC will also roll out a consumer durable financing product this financial year. 
He said there is good headroom for such type of financing for the HFC and the rollout will be in tie-up with retail brands in chain format."
576,2018-04-25,ICICI,"The bumper growth of 93% in value of new business reported for FY18 came as a surprise and drove ICICI Prudential Life's stock up over 8% on Tuesday

Fiscal year 2017-18 was not expected to be a great one for ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. The now second-largest insurer, after SBI Life beat it on market share, was facing slowing business growth. That was why its stock was languishing. Adding to its woes were the troubles its parent ICICI Bank is mired in. 
Fiscal year 2017-18 was not expected to be a great one for ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. The now second-largest insurer, after SBI Life beat it on market share, was facing slowing business growth. That was why its stock was languishing. Adding to its woes were the troubles its parent ICICI Bank is mired in.
But good days are here for this stock. The bumper growth of 93% in value of new business reported for FY18 came as a surprise and drove the stock up over 8% on Tuesday. Though the insurer reported a slower new business premium growth of 17.6% compared with 28% in 2016-17, even this growth is not to be sneezed at. What stole the show was an impressive 93% jump in value of new business (VNB) or in other words, the extent of profitability of new customers for the insurer.
While the management conceded that such a big growth in value for new business cannot be on a sustained basis, there are enough impulses for the insurer to avoid a sharp decline in growth, the company said.
That explains why the stock was bought like hot cakes during the day. But even if we dig deeper, there aren’t any nasty surprises.
What should please investors is that the products the insurer underwrote will bring more profits than before on a consistent basis. ICICI Prudential Life has rightly focused more on protection products which have a woefully low share in the overall product mix. Its customers are turning more profitable and they are sticking to their insurer too. 
The company saw improvement in the persistency ratios across all periods during FY18 compared with the previous year. Profitability has increased not by merely generating more revenue but also through cost reduction. 
ICICI Prudential Life’s cost ratios improved even though its commission surged. The management said that its new products have a higher commission rate explaining the surge in commissions but the company expects to maintain its cost ratios going forward. 
Does this mean that the stock now needs a re-rating? 
Granted that protection products are growing at a scorching pace of 70% but the company has rightly said that such growth rates are not sustainable for a long period. Also, the protection product share is still just 5.7% of total portfolio, unlike other insurers which have a higher share.
Until there is a meaningful rise in the margin-friendly protection business, the stock already reflects most of the positives of the insurer. 
At the current level, the stock trades at around three times its FY18 embedded value, lower than HDFC Standard Life and almost on par with its close rival SBI Life."

Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD, InGovern Research Services
If the allegations that there were phone calls made to ICICI (Prudential) mutual fund to bail out the ICICI Securities IPO (initial public offering) were true, it would be gross misconduct on the part of the fund house. (The IPO started on 22 March.)
While the percentage holding and the exposure may be within the stipulated norms, as data shows, ICICI Prudential mutual fund is the largest fund house holder of ICICI Securities. The conflict of interest is apparent, if the issue was subscribed based on phone calls to bail out the issue, rather than an independent decision. 
The fund management company should act in the interest of the unit-holders, and it risks its reputation if it has acted otherwise. 
Srikanth Bhagavat, MD, Hexagon Capital Advisors 
When taking such a call, the institution or fund manager should take extra caution. If possible, such takes should be avoided, because people are bound to make conclusions which may not be good. But it’s a fund manager’s call where to invest and how much, and if the fund manager has a conviction on a particular investment and she believes that it could be profitable for investors, I don’t think there should be any issue. I have not studied the ICICI Securities IPO, so I won’t comment on its investment worthiness.
Shyam Sekhar, founder, ithought 
This is not a corporate governance issue because legally there is no provision that prohibits an asset management company from investing in the IPO of its sister concern. 
In fact, ICICI Prudential AMC also invested in the IPO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co., which listed marginally above the issue price. 
The issue is more about fair pricing and most IPOs are overpriced. This is because they are able to manage the ecosystem by a limited IPO of 10%. This should be done away with and all companies that want to list need to list at the maximum threshold decided by Sebi. As far as the ICICI Pru AMC buying into the IPO of ICICI Securities is concerned, I think we are rushing to a judgment. The jury is still out on this."

New Delhi: The Income Tax Department has issued a fresh notice to Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, in connection with its tax evasion probe with links to the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, officials said. 
New Delhi: The Income Tax Department has issued a fresh notice to Deepak Kochhar, the husband of ICICI Bank MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, in connection with its tax evasion probe with links to the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, officials said.
They said the fresh notice to Deepak Kochhar had been issued in his individual capacity and it sought details of his personal finances and transactions. He has been asked to furnish the documents within 10 days, they said. The department had sought details from him in his capacity as the managing director of NuPower Renewables, the firm under the department’s scanner, twice earlier.
The tax department is specifically looking into the flow of about Rs325 crore from two Mauritius-based firms to NuPower Renewables Private Ltd. The two foreign-based firms have been identified as First Land Holding Limited and DH Renewables Holding Limited.
The department had also sought the share valuation report for investment in NuPower Renewables, apart from copies of balance sheets and profits.
The taxman is now studying the nature of activities of NuPower Renewables between 2010-11 and 2015-16.
The earlier notices were issued to Deepak Kochhar under Section 131 (power regarding discovery, production of evidence) of the I-T Act. The department has also sought the names and addresses, nationality of the promoters, directors and beneficial shareholders of these firms as part of the earlier two notices, the officials had said.
The department had also sent a detailed questionnaire, seeking details of the firm’s operations, to be answered by Deepak Kochhar as it is probing the investments made by the two Mauritius-based firms in his company with suspected links to the Videocon-ICICI Bank loan case.
The CBI is already conducting a preliminary enquiry in this loan case and has named Kochhar in it. The CBI probe is to find out if there was any quid pro quo involved in the bank issuing a Rs3,250-crore loan to the Videocon Group in 2012.
The loan deal had recently made news after reports questioned it and linked it to a possible quid pro quo that Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot allegedly had with NuPower Renewables, a company founded by Deepak Kochhar."
572,2018-04-26,ICICI,"ICICI Lombard's profitability metrics should cheer, but it needs to maintain the growth rates to justify the valuation

Since listing in September 2017, the ICICI Lombard General Insurance stock has run up 17% in sharp contrast to the state-owned New India Assurance stock, which has lost 6% since it got listed last November. 
Since listing in September 2017, the ICICI Lombard General Insurance stock has run up 17% in sharp contrast to the state-owned New India Assurance stock, which has lost 6% since it got listed last November.
Although some analysts say that ICICI Lombard is priced to perfection, many still have a buy rating on it.
The earnings of the private general insurer for 2017-18 provide some justification to the valuation. ICICI Lombard reported a 22.8% growth in profit after tax but its gross direct premium income grew at a slower 15.2% compared with a stellar 32.6% in FY17. Obviously, the growth is slower due to the base effect. Furthermore, general insurers had a bonanza year in FY17 owing to the government’s push for crop insurance.
For FY18, ICICI Lombard’s profitability yardsticks have improved. Its combined ratio—a gauge of incurred losses and expenses as a percentage of premiums earned—slipped to 100.2% from 103.9% in FY17. Hence, the insurer made an operating profit through its underwriting business during the year. Its operating profit growth for the fourth quarter was 15.5%, a shadow of the 42.8% in the previous quarter.
However, this was expected and the management had warned that such high growth in operating profits is unsustainable especially in the growing stage of the company. Insurance companies have to take the entire cost of underwriting upfront while income and profits would be staggered. Nevertheless, the company’s operating profit growth for FY18 at 31.4% should please investors as it is higher than the previous year.
Its loss ratio, which is the difference between claims paid and premium earned, also improved for the third straight year to 76.9% from 81.5% in FY16. That means that the general insurance business is able to keep its expenses under check despite pushing for growth. This is reflected in its expense ratios as well.
Are there any misgivings that investors should worry about?
The company’s loss ratio for its crop insurance portfolio surged to 135% due to underwriting losses of around Rs700 crore. Given that crop insurance forms 19% of the total, a hit once more could upset the insurer’s profitability. The management expects healthy growth in FY19 although it did not put a number to it.
The stock trades at a rich multiple of 6.8 times its estimated book value for FY19. While profitability metrics should cheer, it needs to maintain the growth rates to justify the valuation."

New Delhi: ICICI Bank Ltd’s shareholders expect its board to clarify on conflict-of-interest allegations raised against its chief executive Chanda Kochhar at its Monday meeting to approve the lender’s March quarter earnings, executives from three top asset management companies said. 
New Delhi: ICICI Bank Ltd’s shareholders expect its board to clarify on conflict-of-interest allegations raised against its chief executive Chanda Kochhar at its Monday meeting to approve the lender’s March quarter earnings, executives from three top asset management companies said.
“We want clarity on the issue of conflict of interest and a succession plan from the board,"" said a head of a mutual fund house, one of the three cited above. The person dec­lined to be named given the sensitivity of the issue.
“We want clarity on the kind of disclosures made by the bank CEO,"" said the second of the three people, also requesting anonymity.
In early March, the Central Bur­eau of Investigation registered a preliminary enquiry against Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak and businessman Venugopal Dhoot to verify alleged conflict of interest in a Rs3,250 crore loan made by ICICI Bank to Dhoot’s Videocon group. ICICI Bank had extended the loan as part of a Rs40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012. Separately, the Securities and Exchange Board of India has also asked ICICI Bank to clarify on reports of this alleged corporate governance breach. The tax department had in April issued notices to Deepak Kochhar to look into the flow of about Rs325 crore from two Mauritius-based firms to NuPower Renewables, which he once co-owned with Dhoot.
“The bank’s board meeting on 7 May will consider the approval of the audited annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 March 2018 and discuss other routine matters,"" a spokesperson for ICICI Bank said, adding that the allegations are not part of the agenda and are baseless and speculative in nature.
The bank has consistently denied the allegations and its board has defended its CEO. On 28 March, the board issued a statement reposing confidence in the corporate governance of the lender and the integrity of Chanda Kochhar.
On 12 April, Mint reported that the bank’s board is planning to address concerns of its shareholders.
With the central bank on 12 February withdrawing a host of restructuring schemes and setting a 180-day deadline for bad loan resolution, the bank may see a reversal in the trend of falling loan slippages, analysts said. 
Analysts expect a rise in bad loans and provisioning for accounts referred under the bankruptcy code. According to a poll of 18 analysts by Bloomberg, the bank is exp­ected to post a Rs1,060 crore profit for the March quarter, roughly half of that a year ago.

At the bank’s meeting to approve the March quarter earnings on Monday, shareholders expect its board to clarify on conflict-of-interest allegations raised against Kochhar, Mint reported on Monday.
Profitability
ICICI Bank is seen reporting a drop in its fiscal fourth-quarter profitability because of higher provisioning for bad loans. According to a poll of 18 analysts by Bloomberg, the bank is expected to post a Rs1,060 crore profit for the March quarter, roughly half of that a year ago. In the December quarter, the bank had reported a net profit of Rs1,650 crore. Rise in bad loans along with provisioning for accounts referred under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is expected to keep credit cost higher, analysts said. However, the bank’s pre-provisioning operation profit for the fourth quarter is seen supported by a rise in non-interest income, which is likely to gain from ICICI Bank’s stake sale in ICICI Securities.
Asset quality
ICIC Bank is likely to see reversal in the trend of declining loan slippages seen in the previous three quarters, according to analysts. The rise in slippages is attributed to the Reserve Bank of India’s 12 February circular, where it withdrew host of restructuring schemes and has set a 180-day timeline for resolution. The circular has forced lenders to accelerate bad loan recognition in their some account, especially those which are part of the restructured books, said analysts. “The bank has 4.2% of its loans under its drill-down list. Thus, under the recent RBI circular we foresee both—slippages and credit cost to remain elevated,"" said Centrum Broking Ltd in a pre-earnings report dated 10 April. ICICI Bank’s drilldown list, which includes loans internally classified as below investment grade, over Rs19,000 crore. The bank’s gross bad loan ratio was at 7.82% as at the end of December.
Loan growth
Analysts expect ICICI Bank continue with its double digit growth in domestic loans aided by heathy performance in its retail and small-and-medium enterprise credit portfolio. Lack of demand for big-ticket investments is expected to keep corporate loan growth moderate. However, it is expected to be better than most lenders. Meanwhile, the bank may continue to report a decline in its overseas book. ICICI Bank has not been growing overseas book over the last 12-18 months, it told analysts in January. As on 31 December, total loans of the bank stood at Rs5.05 trillion, a year-on-year growth of 10.5%.

ICICI Bank conducts a conference call with media on its financial results. The call is attended by the key members of the management including CEO Chanda Kochhar. This will be Kochhar’s first interaction since the controversy, alleging her of conflict of interest in extending loan to a corporate group, broke.

Even as the board, sans government nominee director Lok Ranjan who skipped the meeting, approved the results on Monday, it stayed mum on the controversy surrounding its chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar on allegations of conflict of interest with respect to loans made to Videocon Group. 
In a post-earnings conference call, Kochhar said that, “Today, there was no discussion at all on this issue…Board has made its stance very clear and we do not have anything more to add"".
The board will meet again on Tuesday, although little is expected to be discussed on the controversy with Kochhar saying that it was a routine meeting, conducted every year after the announcement of annual results, to finalize planning and budget. 
The bank reported a net profit of Rs1,020 crore for the three months ended 31 March, compared with Rs2,024.64 crore in the year-ago period. Profit was in line with the Rs1,060.8 crore estimated by a Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts. 
Loan slippages in the March quarter rose to Rs15,737 crore from Rs4,380 crore in the last quarter. Of these, Rs9,968 crore was from loans under various restructuring schemes of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and were standard as at the end of December. 
The bank’s total gross non-performing loans stood at Rs54,063 crore at the end of March compared with Rs46,039 a quarter ago. 
Gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, were at 8.84% in the March quarter compared with 7.82% in the December quarter and 7.89% in the year-ago quarter. 
Provisions during the March quarter surged 129% to Rs6,625.75 crore from Rs2,898.22 crore in the year-ago quarter. 
The bank also disclosed that it has made a full provision of nearly Rs795 crore, partly through profit and loss account and debiting reserves and surplus, in the fourth quarter towards three accounts from the gems and jewellery sector, which are classified as fraud and NPA. 
Kochhar said that the impact of RBI’s February circular on stressed assets was taken into account in the March quarter itself. 
“We believe that since a lot of the stress is already recognized, going forward, our focus will be on recovery and resolution. And while there would be some additions to NPAs with the focus on recovery we will work to bring down the net NPA ratio to 1.5% in two years’ time,"" she said. 
Currently, net NPA stands at 4.77%."

“Today, there was no discussion at all on this issue. The board has already clarified its stance,"" Kochhar said, when asked whether the controversial lending to the Videocon Group was discussed at the board meeting.
Asked about the silence maintained by her as well as the bank as more details get reported about the alleged misdoings, Kochhar referred to the 28 March statement from the board which stood firmly behind her.
“The board has made its stance very clear and we do not have anything more to add,"" Kochhar, who was speaking after the announcement of the bank’s full-year results, said. 
“(We are) talking of Q4 results now and we should focus on that. And I think the board has already clarified,"" she added.
The bank today reported a 50% plunge in standalone net at Rs1,020 crore for the march quarter as provisions jumped threefold.
It can be noted that the ICICI Bank board had come out with a statement supporting Kochhar on the eve of the news getting out in the media. This was followed by a slew of reports of more alleged wrongdoings and also of there being a division within the board as well.
Kochhar today confirmed that government nominee Lok Ranjan, a joint secretary in the department of financial services, was not able to attend the board meeting.
She also termed the board meeting scheduled for tomorrow as a “routine"" affair, where the top decision-making body will decide on its strategy and targets for the fiscal. When asked about the dent to the brand and changes in workings after the controversy, Kochhar pointed out to the growth in deposits, which rose 14% in FY18.
“As you see, deposits speak for itself. I think we have a very strong deposit franchise, technology franchise and that continues to remain strong,"" she said.
 There are series of allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to some companies and enjoying reciprocal benefits. It is alleged that family members Kochhar, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, got financial favours from the borrowers against the loans sanctioned by the bank.
The issue is being investigated by multiple agencies including a filing of a preliminary enquiry by the CBI, and probes by the Income Tax Department and the ED. 
Former Sebi chief M Damodaran had said one option for Kochhar was to step down till the investigation was over. The issue of compromising corporate governance practices came to the fore when investor and whistle-blower Arvind Gupta raked up the issue in March. 
He also alleged quid pro quo between Videocon Group and Kochhar as well as her family members with respect to extending a loan worth Rs3,250 crore, which for the past many years have been NPA. It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, the husband of Chanda. 
There are also allegations that NuPower got Rs325 crore investment from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, the son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia.
The investments from Ruia’s son-in-law’s firm into NuPower started in December 2010.
Incidentally, the same month ICICI Bank was the lead banker in a consortium of domestic banks that extended a $530 million to Essar Steel Minnesota on 29 December 2010. This loan too was later classified as bad loans. 
The Reserve Bank in its 2016 investigation in the matter had raised questions over the ownership of the Mauritius-based entity, First Land Holding, which had invested Rs325 crore in NuPower.
Also, there was no clarity over the alleged Rs64 crore loan (unsecured fully convertible debentures) given to NuPower by Supreme Energy, which was 99.99% owned by Videocon group chief Venugopal Dhoot at that time.
While Chanda Kochhar sat on the credit committee that approved the loan to Videocon, there are allegations of conflicts of interest in her husband’s Singapore-based brother Rajiv Kochhar, performing debt-restructuring work on errant corporate borrowers from ICICI, including Videocon.
The restructuring wasn’t commissioned by the bank but by the borrowers. Interestingly, the bank board expressed full faith in Kochhar, whose current tenure as CEO is ending 31 March 2019. It had reviewed credit approval processes and found them to be robust, according to a 28 March filing by the bank."

New Delhi: The government’s nominee director on the board of ICICI Bank is unlikely to attend board meetings till agencies come out with their findings on conflict of interest allegations involving the lender’s chief Chanda Kochhar, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Lok Ranjan, the nominee director and joint secretary in the finance ministry, has skipped the bank’s board meetings on Monday and Tuesday. 
“If government nominee attends the board meet, then it would be like endorsing board’s view. (The) government thinks that its view can be overruled (by other members of the board) as it (government) is a minority shareholder,"" the person cited above said. 
The official was responding to a query on why Ranjan skipped crucial board meetings of ICICI Bank. On Monday, the board meeting was mainly to approve the bank’s latest quarterly and annual financial results. 
Tuesday’s board meet was to discuss strategy, budget and planning for 2018-19. Another person said that it would be prudent for the nominee director to attend board meeting only after the government receives reports from various agencies that are looking into the allegations. 
About the government’s stance on the allegations involving ICICI Bank and its CEO Chanda Kochhar and her family members with regard to certain loans, the sources said the government’s view would be clear only after going through reports from regulatory and investigative agencies. There are series of allegations of impropriety at ICICI Bank with respect to extending loans to some companies and enjoying reciprocal benefits."

564,2018-05-08,ICICI,"Repeated questions to Chanda Kochhar on the allegations of conflict of interest involving her and Videocon Industries netted no answers. It seems that the ICICI Bank board has put the episode behind it

ICICI Bank Ltd’s earnings conference calls with reporters and analysts are a routine affair, where the management details its numbers and takes questions.  
ICICI Bank Ltd’s earnings conference calls with reporters and analysts are a routine affair, where the management details its numbers and takes questions. 
But the call following the lender’s fourth-quarter results was slightly off the beaten track as the management gave clear guidance for the next two years on various parameters.
What it didn’t give is any more comment on the controversy surrounding managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar. Perhaps the extended guidance was meant to reassure investors that all would be well.
Repeated questions to Kochhar on the allegations of conflict of interest involving her and Videocon Industries Ltd netted no answers. It seems that the board has put the episode behind it as the issue was not even discussed at the meeting on Monday.
What Kochhar did give were clear metrics that the lender is targeting by March 2020. ICICI Bank wants to achieve a 60% share of retail loans in its overall book, and a net bad loan ratio of 1.5%. The bank would also focus towards a 25% growth in loans to small businesses.
The lender is sanguine that the cases referred under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) will fetch a reasonable value, especially those of steel firms. The guidance should cheer investors as they can expect where the energies would be focused on and what results to expect. 
The guidance was also meant to soften the blow given by the bank’s March quarter numbers, which were frankly horrible.
Core income languished and the boost to other income was from one-time factors such as stake sale in subsidiaries. The loan growth of 15% was a small succour, unsurprisingly driven by retail.
The key yardstick was obviously asset quality and here, the numbers did look bad, as expected. Gross bad loans rose to form 8.84% of the total loan book. On a net basis, bad loans formed 5.03% of the book.
The ugliest number was the quantum of slippages, which came in at a massive Rs15,737 crore. Analysts had expected large slippages, but the reported number was even worse. 
Out of this, more than 60% came because of the Reserve Bank of India putting an end to the various dispensation schemes that aided banks in classifying restructured loans as standard. Some of these were also part of ICICI Bank’s watch list and hence, the list itself shrivelled to just Rs4,000 crore from around Rs19,000 crore.
So, is the pain over? 
The answer is yes, if the management is to be believed. The management is optimistic that its exposure of about Rs19,000 crore to the accounts referred under IBC will fetch value. The slippages are a one-time hit. 
Nevertheless, the bank’s provisions rose 129% and the coverage ratio was around 60%. It has 50% coverage for the cases referred under the insolvency code.
The ICICI Bank stock trades at a modest multiple of 1.7 times its estimated book value for FY19, but enjoys a “buy"" call from analysts. Has the market put the controversy surrounding Kochhar behind it, just like the board?"

“While credit cost is likely to stay elevated in the near term (NPL (non-performing loans) ageing + requirement toward the second list), we expect it to moderate from 2HFY19, enabling ICICIBC (ICICI Bank) to deliver ~14% RoE (return on equity) by FY20,"" Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. said in a note while reiterating buy with a revised target price of Rs380, from Rs370 earlier.
Jefferies India Pvt Ltd. pointed that fresh NPLs came mostly from known stressed assets and there were a few large recoveries which held up NIMs (net interest margins) and lowered gross stressed assets. 
“From hereon, revenue and Core PPOP (pre-provision operating profit) trajectory is key, though a 15% consol RoE (return on equity) guidance seems a tad soft,"" Jefferies said while retaining its buy rating on the stock."

560,2018-05-15,ICICI,"Mounting bad loans, corporate governance issues at bigger lenders, such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank are putting off investors

Mumbai: With state-run banks facing the brunt of mounting bad loans and frauds in some cases, and a few leading private banks grabbing headlines for the wrong reasons, small finance banks and select non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have been grabbing investors’ eyeballs more than before. 
Mumbai: With state-run banks facing the brunt of mounting bad loans and frauds in some cases, and a few leading private banks grabbing headlines for the wrong reasons, small finance banks and select non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) have been grabbing investors’ eyeballs more than before.
The top losing financial stock is fraud-hit Punjab National Bank, which has eroded 48% in value year-to-date. Competitors Bank of India and Union Bank of India followed next, with declines of 41% and 39%, respectively. Clearly, state-run lenders have largely been off the radar of many investors.
However, in recent times, private banks such as ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd have also been at the forefront of debates and investor angst, and have been bothered by alleged corporate governance and performance issues in their respective cases.
Year to date, while BSE’s Sensex and Bankex index have risen 4.40% and 3.06%, respectively, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank shares have shed 1.29% and 1.80%, respectively.
Their peers, HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd, have gained 7.88% and 25.75%, respectively, since the start of 2018 and have been the favourites of investors for a while.
However, the problems of mounting bad loans and the alleged issues of corporate governance and performance, coupled with the cases of fraud that have hit state-run banks and some private banks have given other private financial services providers an opportunity to shine. And it looks like they are doing exactly that.
“Small finance banks are getting a lot of attention. Selective NBFCs are regaining interest. They are doing well. The performance has been good. There has been incremental interest in select private banks, which have been in favour for a while now,"" said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd.
Further, there seems to be consensus that public sector banks (PSBs) are likely to stay out of favour despite the efforts to recapitalize them as, apart from the usual problems, they may also end up bearing the brunt of populism in the light of the upcoming general election.
“The BJP’s manifesto for Karnataka, released prior to the forthcoming election, includes the now-all-too-familiar agriculture loan waiver. The waiver would apply to loans of up to Rs1 lakh from nationalized banks and co-operatives,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 6 May note.
“If the BJP does win, it would be a while before the details of any waivers are released or put into effect; meanwhile, the temptation to default is likely to be high. Public sector banks and MFIs (micro-finance institutions) are likely to bear the brunt of this impact,"" Kotak added.
Concerned about this, Kotak analysts have downgraded the Karnataka-focused Ujjivan Financial Services Ltd from add to reduce, adding that they see negligible upside in the stock.
Amid all this, the recently-listed Bandhan Bank is gaining huge investor interest despite lofty valuations.
“Bandhan’s profitability ratios are the best amongst Indian banks and we expect them to remain so over the medium term,"" JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, said in a 7 May report while initiating coverage with a buy rating on the stock.
In the note, JM analysts argued that while the recent large capital raise has driven a dip from historical high levels of 26-28% return on equities (RoEs), it also implies a high cushion in case of any systemic shocks.
The increasing interest is translating into higher market share for some of them.
“Well capitalized mid-sized private sector banks such as IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank are gaining market share at the expense of some PSBs that are not performing well. NBFCs have seen decent growth in the vehicle financing segment. In this quarter, disbursals of companies such as Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd have been strong, which is an indication that they are gaining market share,"" said Siddharth Purohit, an analyst at SMC Institutional Equities. 
On a year-to-date basis, Cholamandalam Investment and Finance Co. Ltd is up nearly 22%.
Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd concurred. In its March quarter interim earnings review for fiscal year 2018, it pointed out that value migration is accelerating in favour of private financials."

Mumbai: Even when the market rose 6.65% in April, mutual funds’ top stock sales in the month in the large-cap space included software exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), private lender ICICI Bank Ltd. and supermarket chain Avenue Supermarts Ltd. 
Mutual funds invested a net of Rs9,435.64 crore in Indian equities in April, data from Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed. 
This was in light of slowing down of gross inflows into equities schemes. However, redemption also came down from a month before, leaving the net inflows more or less in line with that in March.
TCS was the most sold stock as fund houses locked in gains after it rallied nearly 24% in the month of April, and joined the league of $100 billion market capitalization. Fund managers collectively, sold Rs1,750,27 crore worth of TCS stock in April, data from Value Research India Pvt. Ltd. showed.
On 19 April, TCS posted stellar March quarter results that beat analyst estimates both on revenue and profitability. The strong growth for the quarter came on the back of thirteen straight quarters of underperformance.
“Most fund managers are under pressure, and are wary of market valuation in general,"" said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive of Value Research, a mutual fund analytics firm.

The once-broken pieces are now falling in place,"" said Dipen Sheth, head of institutional research at HDFC Securities, adding that the depreciating rupee is the last booster for the otherwise recovering industry."" 
“Infosys is much cheaper than TCS and so the churn seems to have taken place in its favour, given the big changes in the company at the top level,"" added Sheth.
Infosys Ltd., the country’s second-largest software exporter was the most bought stock by mutual funds as they stocked up Rs1,404.94 crore worth of stocks. 
For ICICI Bank, the alleged corporate governance issues have deterred fund managers, who sold Rs843.08 crore worth of the bank’s shares. The allegation relates to a loan to Videocon Group, whose controlling shareholder co-founded a separate company with the husband of ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar. A significant portion of the loan has since become non-performing.
“The noise around the falling standards of governance, and issues with leadership, led to an erosion of faith on the part of investors,"" said Sheth of HDFC Securities.
Avenue Supermarts, the top performing debutante in recent times, also witnessed profit-booking by fund managers, after the stellar run. Fund managers trimmed some of the positions and sold Rs316.97 crore of the stock in the month.
“Avenue Supermarts, also had run up a lot and stretched valuations seem to have been a driver that prompted mutual funds cut some holdings,"" said Kumar of Value Research.
The parent of supermarket chain D-mart, has seen its stock jump 400% since its debut on 21 March 2017."

555,2018-05-25,ICICI,"Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot and NuPower Renewables run by Chanda Kochhar's husband Deepak Kochhar are involved in the Videocon loan case

Mumbai: Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has started proceedings against ICICI Bank Ltd for non-disclosure of information in the matter of alleged conflict of interest in the grant of loans to the Videocon group.  
Mumbai: Markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has started proceedings against ICICI Bank Ltd for non-disclosure of information in the matter of alleged conflict of interest in the grant of loans to the Videocon group. 
The company told NSE on Friday that Sebi has sent the bank and Chanda Kochhar, its MD and CEO, a notice alleging violation of Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) and for not making adequate disclosures. 
Mint reported on 12 April that Sebi was probing alleged corporate governance and disclosure lapses at the bank.
“The notice has been issued based on information furnished by the bank/its MD and CEO to diverse queries made by Sebi concerning dealings between the bank and Videocon Group and certain dealings allegedly between Videocon Group and Nupower, an entity in which Deepak Kochhar, spouse of MD and CEO (Chanda Kochhar), has economic interests,"" said ICICI Bank in a disclosure to NSE.
Sebi had sent a notice to the bank on Thursday seeking its response and the bank said that it will submit its response soon.
The case pertains to alleged conflict of interest in a Rs3,250 crore loan ICICI Bank gave Videocon group. The amount was part of a Rs40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012. 
Videocon group promoter Venugopal Dhoot allegedly gave Rs64 crore in 2010 through a fully-owned entity to NuPower Renewables, which he set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his kin. It is alleged that he transferred proprietorship of the firm to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for Rs9 lakh six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank.
 However, M.K. Sharma, chairman of ICICI Bank, said on 29 March that there is “no conflict of interest as Videocon group is not an investor in NuPower Renewables"".
J.N. Gupta, co-founder and managing director of Stakeholders Empowerment Services, said the market regulator can seek information if the disclosure is not adequate. 
“The moot question is whether the alleged disclosure lapses happened in 2012 when the provisions of LODR 2015 were not notified or do they pertain to some lapses today,"" said Gupta.
One of the allegations against the bank is that it restructured Videocon loans through a firm that appears to be a related party. In 2012, Related Party Transactions were not defined either by the Companies Act or Sebi norms, but there was a concept of person of interest (to the company management)."

Mumbai: Facebook Inc. is set to launch its WhatsApp payment services to the whole of India as early as next week in an attempt to win market share from rivals Paytm and Google Tez, even though its partners aren’t all ready, said people familiar with the matter.
WhatsApp Pay will partner HDFC Bank Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. to process the transfers, and State Bank of India (SBI) will join once it has the necessary systems in place, the people said. Facebook was aiming for a full rollout with four partners but decided to go ahead with just three as its rivals were racing ahead, the people said, asking not to be named as the information isn’t public.
The entry of WhatsApp into India’s payments space has been likened to WeChat, which reshaped payments in China when it expanded beyond messaging. The pilot version of WhatsApp Pay—started with 1 million users in February—received rave reviews, threatening the market share of incumbents Google Tez and Alibaba-backed Paytm, which lack the benefits of a social network.
“WhatsApp has a great starting point: a monopoly in chat,"" said Vivek Belgavi, leader for financial technology at PwC India. “High engagement makes it a credible competition.""
More than 200 million Indians already use WhatsApp messaging, equivalent to 60% of the US population and a daily active usage that Forrester Inc. estimates to be about 20 times higher than Paytm’s.
Emails to representatives of WhatsApp, State Bank of India, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Axis Bank weren’t immediately answered."

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd on Wednesday said it will institute a fresh enquiry into an alleged nexus between the husband of chief executive Chanda Kochhar and Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot over a loan extended by the bank to the conglomerate. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd on Wednesday said it will institute a fresh enquiry into an alleged nexus between the husband of chief executive Chanda Kochhar and Videocon Group chairman Venugopal Dhoot over a loan extended by the bank to the conglomerate.
The bank’s board, following a meeting on 29 May, decided that the probe will be headed by an independent and credible person and will verify the charges made by an anonymous whistle-blower that came to light after the bank’s 7 May board meeting. 
The investigation will verify charges of impropriety, if any, in the lending decisions of the bank and Kochhar as alleged by the whistle-blower. ICICI Bank’s decision to institute a fresh enquiry comes after the board met some investors on Tuesday to allay their concerns. 
The probe will specifically look at allegations that Kochhar breached the bank’s “code of conduct"", violated regulations on “conflict of interest"" and favoured certain borrowers, the bank said in an exchange filing.
On Tuesday, at a conference on financial services in Mumbai, the bank’s board met investors including APG Asset Management, Marshall Wace Asia Ltd, Geosphere Capital Management, Amansa Capital, Fidelity International Investment Management and Morgan Stanley Asset Management to address their concerns.
On 12 April, Mint first reported that ICICI Bank’s board was preparing a plan that includes more public disclosures related to conflict-of-interest allegations against Kochhar to restore shareholders’ confidence in the bank.
On Wednesday, the bank said the scope of the fresh enquiry will include all relevant matters arising out of the whistle-blower’s allegations. During the course of the examination, the bank will help the enquiry team with forensics/email reviews and records of statements of relevant personnel and so on, if required.
“The enquiry would also cover all connected matters in the course of the investigation to bring the matter to a final close,"" the bank said in the exchange filing.
On 28 March, ICICI Bank’s board had issued a statement reposing its confidence in the corporate governance of the lender and the integrity of Kochhar.
The board said it was aware of a 2016 Reserve Bank of India (RBI) probe on this issue and considered that information before giving Kochhar a clean chit. 
RBI had initiated the probe after another whistle-blower alleged conflict of interest, said a person directly aware of the bank’s board decisions.
Kochhar has been in the eye of a storm over granting a Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon group companies in 2012 as part of a consortium, as her husband had business dealings with the Dhoot-led conglomerate.
In its probe, RBI had found no evidence of reciprocal benefit, stating the allegation “could not be conclusively established"".
“In keeping with the whistle-blower policy, board has mandated its audit committee to take all further actions in the matter to operationalize this decision—including in particular, appointment of an independent and credible person as head of the enquiry, determining the terms of reference of the enquiry, the period which will be covered by the enquiry etc.,"" the bank told exchanges."

550,2018-05-31,ICICI,"Parallels are being drawnto a 2001casewhen UTI Bank's P.J. Nayak went on leave afterinquirypanel said he stood to gainfrom afailedmerger

Mumbai: With the board of ICICI Bank deciding on an inquiry into the allegations raised by a new whistleblower against its CEO Chanda Kochhar, calls for her exit have resurfaced.  
Mumbai: With the board of ICICI Bank deciding on an inquiry into the allegations raised by a new whistleblower against its CEO Chanda Kochhar, calls for her exit have resurfaced. 
Bankers and analysts drew parallels to a 2001 case when P.J. Nayak, who was chairman of UTI Bank, went on leave after a draft report of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) said he stood to gain from his bank’s failed merger with Global Trust Bank (GTB). The committee was set up following the surfacing of scam that involved Ketan Parekh who was charged for rigging the share price of GTB ahead of the merger. Nayak had asked the board to allow him to go on leave while the board conducted an independent inquiry into the matter. He was later reinstated after the inquiry revealed no evidence of wrongdoing. The final report of the JPC also had no mention of Nayak’s involvement in the scam. 
Proxy shareholders believe following Nayak’s example could help Chanda set a high standard of corporate governance. However, it could also set a wrong precedent for other corporates.
“Like similar previous instances in cases of other banks, if Kochhar goes on a leave until the inquiry is completed, it may send out a positive signal to the stakeholders as it will be seen as a sacrifice by her to preserve her reputation. But on the flip side, such a leave or resignation by a bank’s chief after an anonymous complaint may often create a damaging situation for the bank because if the probe finds any guilt, people may see the bank’s overall policy itself to be flawed. However, it is an individual decision and the board should use its wisdom carefully in such cases,"" said J.N. Gupta, managing director and co-founder of Stakeholder Empowerment Services (SES), a proxy advisory firm.
According to M. Damodaran, chairman, Excellence Enablers, a corporate governance advisory firm, the preferred course will be for the Kocchar to proceed on leave for the duration of the inquiry. “The board and she can take a call once the findings of the inquiry are known. To the best of my knowledge, this is without precedent in the banking sector, since conflict of interest on the part of the senior-most executive has been alleged,"" he added. 
Kochhar has been in the eye of the storm over the granting of a Rs3,250 crore consortium loan to Videocon group companies given that her husband had business dealings with the Venugopal Dhoot-led conglomerate. On 29 March, M.K. Sharma, chairman of ICICI Bank, said there is “no conflict of interest as Videocon group is not an investor in NuPower Renewables."" However, markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has sent notices to the bank and Kochhar for non-disclosure of information in the matter.
The bank’s Wednesday decision to conduct an independent inquiry comes after a second complaint was raised by a whistleblower in addition to the 2016 letter by investor Arvind Gupta, who had alleged that loans to Videocon Group pointed to Kochhar’s conflict of interest.
Some proxy shareholders, however, believe the bank should give more information about the allegation to the public before a decision is taken.
“The bank has to make it clear whether the complaint is old or new. If it’s an old issue, then I don’t see any point in Chanda stepping aside now. If it’s a new complaint, more information should be made available to the public. And since the board has taken a call on the inquiry, they are in the best position to take a call on whether the CEO needs to step down,"" said Amit Tandon, managing director of IiAS, a proxy advisory firm. ICICI Prudential Life is one of the shareholders in IiAS."
549,2018-05-31,ICICI,"The land, which belongs to Jaypee Infratech, was mortgaged to a consortium of banks led by ICICI Bank by Jaiprakash Associates for a loan

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday admitted an appeal by Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) challenging an order passed by National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) Allahabad bench directing it to return 759 acres of land to its subsidiary Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL). 
New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday admitted an appeal by Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) challenging an order passed by National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) Allahabad bench directing it to return 759 acres of land to its subsidiary Jaypee Infratech Ltd (JIL).
Last week, the appellate tribunal had admitted an appeal by Jaiprakash Associates’ lenders ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Standard Chartered Bank and State Bank of India challenging the same order.
The land, which belongs to Jaypee Infratech, was mortgaged to a consortium of banks led by ICICI Bank by Jaiprakash Associates for a loan.
A two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay issued notice to the resolution professional for Jaypee Infratech, which is currently undergoing insolvency resolution.
While admitting the lenders’ appeal last week, the appellate tribunal, without passing a formal order to the effect, had observed that prima facie NCLT had exceeded its jurisdiction by adjudicating upon the legality of a legal instrument.
Earlier this month, the Allahabad bench of NCLT had declared the transfer of ownership of 858 acres of Jaypee Infratech’s land by JAL to its own lenders, in the form of collateral for loans, as “fraudulent, preferential and undervalued"" and asked Jaiprakash Associates to return 759 acres of it.
The NCLT order was passed on a plea referred by the resolution professional for Jaypee Infratech, Anuj Jain, which alleged that the company did not receive any consideration from Jaiprakash Associates for these transactions.
Jaypee Infratech is among the 12 companies against whom the Reserve Bank of India, through its directive, asked banks to file insolvency petitions. The NCLT’s Allahabad bench admitted a plea moved by IDBI Bank seeking the initiation of a corporate insolvency resolution process against the real estate firm in August 2017.
On 16 May, the apex court directed Jaiprakash Associates to deposit Rs1,000 crore with its registry by 15 June to avert the liquidation of Jaypee Infratech."

547,2018-06-01,ICICI,"If one draws a parallel with ICICI Bank's peer Axis Bank, it can safely be said a change of leadership would have infused life into the stock

ICICI Bank Ltd is back in the eye of the storm after its board issued a statement on Wednesday that it would begin an independent enquiry against the lender’s top executive Chanda Kochhar. 
ICICI Bank Ltd is back in the eye of the storm after its board issued a statement on Wednesday that it would begin an independent enquiry against the lender’s top executive Chanda Kochhar.
This has come in the wake of an anonymous whistleblower accusing Kochhar of impropriety in dealing with certain borrowers. The reference is to allegations made in 2016 by another whistleblower that ICICI Bank disbursed loans to the Videocon group, violating regulations on conflict of interest.
The largest private sector lender’s stock slipped 1.97% intraday on Thursday in response to the board’s statement (it ended up 0.79%). The stock’s reaction looks rather muted because the board, the only unflinching support Kochhar has had amid the accusations of wrongdoing, has now taken a step away to establish its own credibility.
READ: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar asked to be on leave till probe is over
Recall that the board had issued a strong statement exonerating Kochhar in response to the allegations when they first appeared over two months ago. But investors felt a probe would have been a better idea and hence the board’s support has been looked at with a sceptical eye. Kochhar’s stoic silence has also worsened the situation. Ergo, the stock has been just meandering along, underperforming the broad market over the last two months with no breakthrough in sight.
To be sure, a large part of the stock’s underperformance is also due to the weakening asset quality metrics the bank reported for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018. However, the stock has underperformed its peer Axis Bank Ltd, which had reported a large quarterly loss due to rising bad loans. This goes to show that investors still have fears over what would come out of multiple enquiries by regulators and even the Central Bureau of Investigation.
What would have made the stock get back its mojo?
If one draws a parallel with ICICI Bank’s peer Axis Bank, it can safely be said a change of leadership would have infused life into the stock. Indeed, the exit of Kochhar, even temporarily until the conclusion of enquiries, would have been given a thumbs up by the market. To be sure, it is unfair to accuse Kochhar of wrongdoing and oust her without the allegations being proved.
READ: Should Chanda Kochhar resign as ICICI Bank CEO?
But the market would have welcomed it, taking this as a sign of upholding the corporate governance of the bank.
In the absence of the above, the next relief for the stock will be visible only if the independent enquiry of the board finds Kochhar guilty, necessitating her exit. Markets are not necessarily fair and they would only lift the cloud over ICICI Bank if all the investigating agencies give a clean chit to Kochhar. Exoneration by the board-appointed investigators is unlikely to be enough."

New Delhi:Days ahead of RBI’s monetary policy review, India’s three major banks SBI, PNB and ICICI Bank on Friday increased their benchmark lending rates or MCLR by up to 0.1%, making loans costlier for consumers. The new rates are effective from Friday. 
India’s largest lender SBI has increased the lending rate by 10 basis points across all tenors up to three years. Now SBI’s overnight and one-month tenors’ Marginal Cost of Funds Based Lending Rate (MCLR) stands at 7.9% as against 7.8%, as per the SBI’s website. The MCLR for a three-year tenor increased to 8.45% from 8.35% earlier. 
The state-owned Punjab National (PNB), the country’s second largest lender, raised the MCLR for three-year and five-year tenors to 8.55% and 8.7%, respectively. 
Country’s second largest private bank ICICI Bank too said it has raised five-year tenor MCLR by 10 bps to 8.70%. It has also raised the MCLR by 10 bps in loans with tenor of one year and three years.
However, lending rate remains unchanged in case of loans up to three months. PNB has also increased the base rate to 9.25% from the earlier 9.15%. 
Private sector bank ICICI Bank too has raised one-year MCLR by 10 bps to 8.40% from Friday. 
Other banks, people privy of the development said, were also likely to follow suit. Most of home and auto loans are linked to MCLR. 
Meanwhile, mortage lender HDFC said that it has increased its retail prime lending rate (RPLR), on which its adjustable rate home loans (ARHL) are benchmarked, by 10 basis points, effective from Saturday.
Karnataka Bank has raised its interest rates on deposits. Interest on domestic and NRE rupee term deposits for a period of one year to two years stands revised to 7.25% from 7.10 (for deposits up to Rs10 crore) representing a hike of 15 basis points, it said in a regulatory filing.

Mumbai: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar has been asked to proceed on indefinite leave from the company she has helmed for almost a decade until an independent enquiry announced by the lender’s board to probe alleged cases of impropriety is concluded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the board’s decision. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar has been asked to proceed on indefinite leave from the company she has helmed for almost a decade until an independent enquiry announced by the lender’s board to probe alleged cases of impropriety is concluded, according to a person with direct knowledge of the board’s decision.
The decision to ask Kochhar to go on leave has been taken on the advice of a majority of the seven independent directors on the bank’s board, the person said. The enquiry, likely to be headed by a retired judge of the Supreme Court, will begin next week and will be completed in two months, he added.
“A new whistleblower complaint came 15-20 days back. It came to our notice as well. The bank’s board and top management first met and then the independent directors decided to meet separately. So the independent directors met on 29 May. The charges made against the bank and its CEO are quite harsh and the independent directors thought that such allegations cannot be dealt with internally,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.
An ICICI Bank spokesperson did not respond to emails sent on Thursday evening.
In an exchange filing on Friday, ICICI Bank said that the board has not asked Kochhar to go on leave. “She is on her annual leave which was planned in advance,"" the exchange filing said.
Kochhar’s leadership has come under a cloud following the resurfacing of allegations against her, including alleged conflict of interest over loans made to Videocon Group, whose chairman Venugopal Dhoot had business links with her husband Deepak Kochhar. The allegations first surfaced in 2016 but the bank’s board had given her a clean chit following an internal investigation.
“After the previous whistleblower complaint in 2015-16, the board had conducted an internal probe but we can see that it did not help much. Shareholders, depositors, employees and everyone associated are still in doubts and raising various questions despite that probe. Hence, this time the independent directors decided to tell the bank to conduct an independent enquiry,"" the person said.
Although there was pressure from some institutional shareholders, the bank did not order an independent enquiry so far because the board was divided on the issue, said the person. 
“But the latest whistleblower charges, which are somewhat similar to the charges made by a whistleblower in 2016, compelled the independent directors to look for an external independent probe. Additional independent directors have been brought in by the bank,"" added the person. 
Over the past two months, the bank has replaced two independent directors. It added a new one on Tuesday. 
The fresh probe will examine all the details since Kochhar’s appointment in May 2009, the person said, adding that the work of all committees in the bank, the top management, directors, their interactions with each other and customers through emails or phones will be scrutinized. 
The independent directors have also discussed with other board members a succession plan if Kochhar decides to quit prematurely or if any wrongdoing is discovered in the course of the independent enquiry, the person said.
“The bank, apparently, has told some of the shareholders and directors that an expert headhunter will be appointed for shortlisting a new CEO for the bank. The bank’s business is not bad, but the reputational risk is too high right now,"" added the person.
The new whistleblower complaint came soon after the bank’s board met on 7 May, said another person directly aware of the development.
On 28 March, the ICICI Bank board had issued a statement reposing its confidence in the corporate governance of the lender and the integrity of Kochhar. The board was aware of a 2016 Reserve Bank of India probe on this issue and considered that information before giving her a clean chit.

Mumbai:Indian lenders are raising interest rates even before any RBI action as the strongest loan demand in four years amid weak deposit growth pressures funding costs.
State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd and Punjab National Bank are among the nation’s biggest banks that increased their benchmark lending rates last week. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), on the other hand, is expected to keep its key rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting when it decides on policy Wednesday.
Higher borrowing costs risk slowing the recent recovery in demand for credit, which was led by retail and working capital loans, said Karthik Srinivasan, group head of financial sector ratings at ICRA Ltd, the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. Moody’s cut India’s 2018 economic growth forecast last week, citing tighter financial conditions as a reason.
RBI will hold its repo rate at 6% this week, according to 25 of 33 economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The rest see an increase to 6.25%. Accelerating inflation is forcing commercial banks to offer higher deposit rates and lure savers even though the central bank—wary of upsetting the economic recovery after a new tax was implemented—has chosen to hold off.
RBI is expected to tighten only next quarter, the time of year when Indian companies typically increase borrowing as the government wraps up the bulk of its debt target.

New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd has initiated the process of appointment of a non-executive chairman as the term of M.K. Sharma is coming to an end on 30 June.
The process has started and the ICICI Bank board has to take a call if the appointment has to be made from the existing pool of independent directors or by inviting an outsider to take up the position, said people close to the development.

Other independent directors are Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi, Neelam Dhawan, Radhakrishnan Nair, V.K. Sharma (LIC chairman), and Lok Ranjan (government nominee director).
ICICI Bank is facing heat over allegations made against its CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar for allegedly providing loans on quid pro quo basis to benefit family members.
The bank board had last week ordered an independent probe into allegations of “conflict of interest"" and “quid pro quo"" in Kochhar’s dealing with certain borrowers.
READ: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar asked to be on leave till probe is over
There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon group on a quid pro quo basis.
It was alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
In May, markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and NuPower.
The scope of enquiry would be comprehensive and include all relevant matters arising out of and in course of examination of the facts and wherever warranted, use of forensics/email reviews and record of statements of relevant personal, the statement had said.
The enquiry, the bank had said, will be conducted by an ‘independent and credible’ person. The whistle-blower had alleged that the bank’s MD and CEO had not adhered to provisions relating to code of conduct of the bank and legal and regulatory provisions relating to conflict of interest over a period of time and also alleged quid pro quo in the course of Kochhar’s work in dealing with certain customers/borrowers of the bank.
In April, the ICICI Bank board had expressed full confidence in Kochhar and ruled out any “quid pro quo"" as alleged with regard to certain loan given to Videocon group.
The regulator filing, which came on Monday after close of stock market, further said the enquiry will cover all “connected matters"" in the course of investigations to bring the matter to a final close."

Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has directed ICICI Bank to reverse the transactions carried out on Ruchi Soya’s current account after the commencement of the company’s insolvency moratorium and allowed the miscellaneous application filed by the company’s resolution professional (RP). 
The resolution professional of the Mumbai-based edible oil food maker Ruchi Soya had moved NCLT against ICICI Bank seeking its intervention to retrieve around Rs48 crore that the bank had paid towards a letter of credit (LoC) from Ruchi Soya’s current account.
On Tuesday, a division bench of NCLT presided by B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy, while allowing the application, directed the bank to reverse the transaction. 
“This will help the RP to increase the kitty further to distribute among the lenders of the company,"" said one of the lawyers involved in the case, requesting anonymity, since the matter is sub-judice. 
Earlier, senior counsel Navroz Seervai representing the resolution professional argued that the transactions took place during the moratorium period which is wrongful and the bank needs to reverse those transactions. While Zal Andhyarujina, who was arguing for the bank, said that at the time of the transaction, the bank had no knowledge of a moratorium period had come into effect.
The company is part of the so-called second list of 28 defaulters the RBI flagged for resolution under its schemes before December, failing which the cases would have had to be filed against these companies at the National Company Law Tribunal.

Mumbai: BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 rose for a second straight day on Thursday led by gains in financial stocks a day after the Reserve Bank of India hiked key interest rates.

New Delhi: The ministry of corporate affairs is looking into companies involved in the ICICI Bank controversy of alleged conflict of interest in CEO Chanda Kochhar’s dealings with certain borrowers, according to a senior official. 
New Delhi: The ministry of corporate affairs is looking into companies involved in the ICICI Bank controversy of alleged conflict of interest in CEO Chanda Kochhar’s dealings with certain borrowers, according to a senior official.
The affairs of ICICI Bank are not being looked into by the ministry as that is completely under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).
“The ministry is looking at allegations with respect to fraudulent, preferential or under-valued transactions...(related to) those companies which have come into controversy in the light of ICICI Bank issue,"" the official said on Wednesday. Specific details about the companies that are under the ministry’s scanner were not disclosed.
READ: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar asked to be on leave till probe is over
There are allegations of involvement of Kochhar and her family members in a loan provided to Videocon Group on a quid pro quo basis. It was also alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
Last month, ICICI Bank’s board ordered an independent probe into allegations of ‘conflict of interest’ and ‘quid pro quo’ in Chanda Kochhar’s dealing with certain borrowers.
The enquiry was ordered on a complaint by an anonymous whistle-blower against Kochhar.
“... the enquiry to be headed by an independent and credible person (will) examine and enquire into an additional anonymous whistle-blower complaint...,"" the bank had said in a regulatory filing.
Last month, markets regulator Sebi had served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower. The ministry, which is implementing the Companies Act, has powers to take stringent action against entities for violations."

Mumbai: Bengaluru-based auto-component maker Sansera Engineering Pvt. Ltd has appointed investment banks to start work on its initial public offering (IPO) which could be around  ₹ 1,400-1,500 crore in size, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: Bengaluru-based auto-component maker Sansera Engineering Pvt. Ltd has appointed investment banks to start work on its initial public offering (IPO) which could be around  ₹ 1,400-1,500 crore in size, two people aware of the development said.
The company is backed by US-based private investment group The Rohatyn Group (TRG). Last month, Mint reported that Sansera Engineering was exploring an initial share sale. 
“Sansera has appointed ICICI Securities, Nomura and Credit Suisse to start work on its IPO. The company plans to raise around  ₹ 1,400-1,500 crore through its IPO, which is expected to hit the market before the end of the year,"" said the first of the two persons cited above, requesting anonymity, as he is not authorized to speak with the media.
According to the second person, the IPO will largely be a secondary sale of shares by the company’s PE investor, TRG, as it is looking to offload a significant part of its stake. 
“TRG holds over 50% stake in the company and they want to bring that down substantially through the IPO. Hence, the IPO will largely be comprised of an offer for sale, though it will also have some primary component,"" he said. He too requested anonymity. 
TRG holds a 51% stake in Sansera Engineering. This stake was originally acquired by Citi Venture Capital International (CVCI), the emerging markets private equity arm of US bank Citigroup, for  ₹ 340 crore ($56 million) in July 2013. In December 2013, TRG acquired the CVCI business from Citigroup.
“As a matter of policy, we do not respond to media queries on our business,"" said a spokesperson for TRG in an email response to Mint’s queries. Emails sent to Sansera Engineering, ICICI Securities and Credit Suisse were not answered. Nomura declined to comment. 
For the financial year 2016-17, the auto parts maker reported a consolidated revenue of  ₹ 1,034.2 crore, a growth of 14.8% over the previous year’s  ₹ 901 crore, according to data from the company’s filings with the Registrar of Companies (RoC). 
The company’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) grew by 9.3% to Rs174.4 crore in fiscal 2016-17. However, the company’s consolidated profit grew just 2.4% to  ₹ 68.8 crore in 2016-17, data shows. 
Founded in 1987, Sansera’s product portfolio encompasses components such as crankshaft assemblies, rocker arms, gear shifter forks, common rail, connecting rods and others. 
Sansera has seven manufacturing facilities spread across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. 
Several auto component makers have used the buoyant primary market to raise funds and provide exits to their private equity investors. 
In the last three years, auto component makers Sandhar Technologies Ltd, Endurance Technologies Ltd, GNA Axles Ltd and Precision Camshafts Ltd have raised funds through IPOs.
In March, Varroc Engineering, another auto component maker, filed preliminary papers with markets regulator for an initial public offer.
Varroc is engaged in design, manufacture and supply of exterior lighting systems, plastic and polymer components and precision metallic components to passenger car, commercial vehicle, two-wheeler, three-wheeler and off-highway vehicle companies directly worldwide."

New Delhi: As multi-agency probe continues in India into alleged lapses involving ICICI Bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar and her family members, the matter has also come under the scanner of the US markets regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
New Delhi: As multi-agency probe continues in India into alleged lapses involving ICICI Bank’s CEO Chanda Kochhar and her family members, the matter has also come under the scanner of the US markets regulator Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Besides, the Indian regulators and investigative agencies are mulling seeking help from their overseas counterparts including in Mauritius as part of their own probes, officials said. 
When asked about its probe into matters related to ICICI Bank and Kochhar, a spokesperson for the SEC Office of Public Affairs declined to comment. The queries sent to ICICI Bank also remained unanswered. The bank has already instituted an independent enquiry into allegations of ‘conflict of interest’ and ‘quid pro quo’ in Kochhar’s dealing with certain borrowers. 
Earlier in March, when the reports first surfaced in this regard, the bank had said that its board has “full confidence and reposes full faith"" in Kochhar. 
Officials said the SEC is actively looking into the matter as ICICI Bank is listed in the US also and it may seek further details from its Indian counterpart the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which has already issued show-cause notices to ICICI Bank and Kochhar as part of its probe.
Officials said the Sebi has been approached for some clarificatory details which would be provided to the bank and its CEO, among others to whom notices have been served. Those looking into the matter also include the banking regulator Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the corporate affairs ministry, while the CBI had earlier registered a preliminary enquiry against Kochhar’s husband, among others, and extensively questioned her brother-in-law in April. 
The cases under scanner include the bank’s Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar family members in restructuring of the loan. 
Last week, interim finance minister Piyush Goyal said the law will take its own course in the alleged case of nepotism at ICICI Bank, even though it is a good bank with “very robust processes"" and there was no cause for concern for any of the stakeholders of ICICI Bank per se. There are allegations of impropriety in ICICI Bank extending loans to some companies and enjoying reciprocal benefits. 
It has been alleged that family members of the bank’s chief executive, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, got financial favours from the borrowers against the loans sanctioned by the bank. It was also alleged that Videocon Group pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar. 
Sebi has served a notice on Kochhar on dealings of the bank with Videocon Group and Nupower. There are also allegations that NuPower got investments of Rs325 crore from Mauritius-based Firstland Holdings, a company owned by Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group co-founder Ravi Ruia. 
An independent probe was ordered by ICICI Bank board after fresh allegations of quid pro quo were levelled by activist and whistle-blower Arvind Gupta, who also accused Ruia brothers of Essar Group of having got undue favours from the bank for “round-tripping"" investments into NuPower Group. The allegations have been dismissed as “motivated"" by the Essar Group, which maintains it has no business interest in Firstland Holdings. 
The ministry of corporate affairs is looking into companies involved in the ICICI Bank controversy of alleged conflict of interest in Chanda Kochhar’s dealings with certain borrowers, according to a senior official. 
The official also said the affairs of ICICI Bank are not being looked into by the ministry as that is completely under the purview of the Reserve Bank of India. “The ministry is looking at allegations with respect to fraudulent, preferential or under-valued transactions...

Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has powers to impose a penalty but not demand the resignation of ICICI Bank Ltd chief executive Chanda Kochhar if it finds she and the bank did not abide by fair disclosure norms in its ongoing probe. 
Mumbai: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has powers to impose a penalty but not demand the resignation of ICICI Bank Ltd chief executive Chanda Kochhar if it finds she and the bank did not abide by fair disclosure norms in its ongoing probe.
A maximum penalty of  ₹ 25 crore, or three times the ill-gotten gains, can be levied under Sebi rules, but in this case, the quantum of the penalty may be at the discretion of Sebi’s adjudicating officer, according to two executives familiar with the development. 
“Only a financial penalty can be levied as under the current notice, there is no provision for asking the CEO to step down,"" said the first of the two executives, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
On 24 May, Sebi sent a notice to ICICI Bank and Kochhar, seeking clarification with regard to disclosure of price-sensitive information from the bank and the CEO allegedly not abiding by the bank’s code of conduct. 
Emails sent to ICICI Bank and Sebi seeking comment on Friday went unanswered.
“The show cause to Chanda Kochhar alleges that she did not adhere to the bank’s code of conduct as far as making disclosures... Considering that the CEO’s husband (Deepak Kochhar) had a partnership with a firm owned by the promoter (Venugopal Dhoot) of Videocon group, and some of the group’s companies in turn secured loans from the bank, these disclosures should have been made as part of Sebi’s rules on LODR (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements),"" said the second executive.
READ: ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar asked to be on leave till probe is over
ICICI Bank managing director and CEO Kochhar can also ask for a settlement by paying a fine and without admitting to any wrongdoing, said the second executive.
“The bank can always file for consent or a settlement without admitting to any wrongdoing,"" this executive said. 
The Economic Times on 8 June reported that ICICI Bank is looking to file a consent plea with Sebi. 
Still, even a settlement with Sebi may not be enough for CEO Kochhar to complete her current five-year term, which ends in March 2019, as a reconstituted board, which has seen the entry of three new directors in the last two months, could still ask her to consider stepping down on moral grounds, according to a third executive familiar with the development.
“The onus is back on the board,"" said the third executive. 
The complexion of ICICI Bank’s board has changed since the issue surfaced in March. 
Chairman M.K. Sharma’s three-year term ends on 30 June, which means the bank will soon have a new chairman.
Sharma, who turned 71 last month, and who has been Kochhar’s most vocal supporter, cannot seek reappointment as the Reserve Bank of India bars an independent director who has turned 70 from doing so, according to the third executive cited above.
Sharma declined to offer a comment.
During the last two months, the ICICI Bank board saw the government replace its nominee, Amit Agarwal with Lok Ranjan. On 2 May, Radhakrishnan Nair was appointed an independent director for five years even as another independent director, Tushaar Shah, stepped down after eight years. On 29 May, former Bank of Baroda chairman M.D. Mallya joined the board as additional independent director.
Sebi is investigating if Kochhar had disclosed to the bank’s board about her husband, Deepak Kochhar’s partnership in a firm, NuPower. Venugopal Dhoot, the owner of Videocon group, was the second founding partner of NuPower. 
Some companies of Videocon group secured $500 million in loans from ICICI Bank, along with a group of 19 other banks in April 2012. 
This made some observers and whistleblower Arvind Gupta link the approval of the loans by ICICI Bank to companies of Videocon group to investments made by Dhoot in NuPower."

Mumbai: Private sector lender ICICI Bank Wednesday said it will sell up to 2% stake in its life insurance subsidiary ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd. The sale, likely in one or more tranches, will help the bank raise  ₹ 1,180 crore. 
“The board of directors of the bank today approved the sale of up to 28,711,100 shares, representing up to 2% of the issued and the paid-up equity share capital of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd,"" ICICI Bank informed stock exchanges. 
The bank said the stake sale can happen through any manner, including offer for sale through the stock exchange mechanism. 
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance is a joint venture of ICICI Bank and US-based Prudential Corp. Holdings Ltd.

ICICI Prudential became a publicly listed firm in September 2016, when it was valued at  ₹ 47,955 crore. 
Analysts believe the share sale will enable ICICI Bank to boost its provision coverage ratio (PCR), which is the lowest among large banks. PCR is the proportion of funds that a bank sets aside against bad loans. 
ICICI Bank’s PCR excluding technical write-offs stands at 48.4%, compared to Axis Bank’s 52.5% and SBI’s 50.4%. Among the large banks, Bank of Baroda has the highest PCR excluding write-offs at 59%."

Mumbai: Punj Lloyd Ltd was referred to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday by ICICI Bank Ltd to recover dues worth  ₹ 852 crore, sending the construction company’s stock tumbling by more than 11%.
A two-judge NCLT bench, headed by M.M. Kumar, issued a notice to Punj Lloyd, asking it to file a reply to ICICI Bank’s plea. 
The private sector bank’s plea was opposed by State Bank of India (SBI), the leader of the lenders’ forum for Punj Lloyd, on the ground that the six-month period granted to corporate debtors for resolution of debt outside the insolvency and bankruptcy code, as stated in the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) 12 February circular, has not ended. 
Punj Lloyd’s asset base covers only 5% of the company’s debt and the 20 ongoing projects are the only source of money for the company, SBI told the tribunal, adding that the initiation of insolvency proceedings will likely halt those projects. 
SBI further told the tribunal that more than 90% of the lenders were in favour of a resolution plan outside the insolvency and bankruptcy code and would oppose ICICI Bank’s plea. 
Punj Lloyd also said in a regulatory filing that it thinks the plea may not be admitted by NCLT as more than 90% of its lenders were in favour of restructuring the debts.
The matter will be next heard on 24 July.
Punj Lloyd belongs to the so-called second list of corporate defaulters named by RBI last year.
Shares of Punj Lloyd plunged 11.1% to  ₹ 14.85 on the BSE on Thursday, while the exchange’s benchmark Sensex shed 0.39% to close at 35,599.82 points. 
Punj Lloyd is a diversified engineering, procurement and construction company which executes projects in the energy, infrastructure and defence sectors. It reported a loss of  ₹ 72 crore in the year ended 31 March. Consolidated borrowings stood at  ₹ 7,114 crore as of March. The company has pending orders worth  ₹ 9,127 crore.

An ICICI Bank representative didn’t immediately reply to an email and phone call Monday.
The Mumbai-based lender’s board decided last month to set up a panel to examine the anonymous complaint that alleges quid pro quo in the course of Kochhar’s work in dealing with certain borrowers of the bank. The complaint also alleges the CEO violated regulatory provisions related to conflicts of interest over a period of time, according to the filing.
ICICI Bank has appointed B. N. Srikrishna, a retired judge from India’s top court, to investigate these allegations and the probe is expected to start this week, according to the people.

Bakhshi has been appointed for a period of five years. He will take charge as COO on Tuesday and report to the CEO; however, while Kochhar is on leave, he will report to the bank’s board, the ICICI Bank statement said.

“Mr. Bakhshi will be responsible for handling all the businesses and corporate centre functions at the Bank. All executive directors on the board of ICICI Bank and the executive management will report to him. Mr. Bakhshi will report to Ms. Chanda Kochhar, who will continue in her role as MD & CEO of ICICI Bank,"" the statement said.
Bakhshi will continue as non-executive director of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. The statement added that N.S. Kannan has been appointed as CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance for five years.
Mint had on 1 June reported that ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar has been asked to be on leave till probe into the Videocon loan case is over. ICICI Bank, however, had then said the board has not asked Kochhar to go on leave. “She is on her annual leave which was planned in advance,"" the bank said in an exchange filing.
The decision to name Bakhshi as COO comes after the board decided to set up a panel under justice B.N. Srikrishna to investigate allegations of conflict of interest and quid pro quo against Kochhar in the Videocon loan case. Separately, markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is investigating whether ICICI Bank and Kochhar failed to make adequate disclosures to the bank’s board about her husband Deepak Kochhar’s partnership in a firm, NuPower Renewables, when the bank sanctioned loans to companies controlled by Venugopal Dhoot, the owner of Videocon group. Dhoot was also a founding partner of NuPower.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is also separately conducting a preliminary enquiry into the alleged nexus between Videocon and Kochhar’s husband.
When the charges first surfaced, the ICICI Bank board in April dismissed all allegations, only to make a U-turn and set up an independent probe a month later. The latest move will test the resolve of the company’s shareholders and does not put the board in a good light, said one proxy advisory firm.
“According to the press release, Chanda Kochhar has decided to go on leave rather than board asking her to go on leave. This shows that the board is a weak board and could not take an independent decision. There was a chance before the board to redeem itself but sadly, it appears that the board is singing to the tune of CEO Kochhar,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of proxy firm InGovern Research. “Of course, the board has given a graceful exit to Kochhar since the probe is not a time-bound investigation and the CEO’s term ends in March next year,"" said Subramanian.
Since the allegations surfaced in late March, ICICI Bank’s shares have underperformed the Sensex. On Monday, shares of ICICI Bank gained 3.61% after The Economic Times reported that ICICI was planning to name Bakhshi as COO.
In the past three months, the ICICI Bank board has added two independent directors and a new government nominee, but is yet to name a new chairman. Current chairman M.K. Sharma will retire at the end of the month. 
The biggest challenge facing Bakhshi will be to allay the concerns of investors, shareholders and regulators around corporate governance. Investors believe that he will also be responsible for resolving the bad loan problem, which has been plaguing the bank for the last three fiscal years.
“The appointment of Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi as chief operating officer is the most practical middle ground that the board could have adopted. Mr. Bakhshi’s immediate priorities would be to get the executive leadership team to rally around; rebuild currency with stakeholders including the regulator, investors and shareholders; and install the support system that the probe committee needs in order to conduct its investigation in a fair and transparent manner,"" said A.S.V. Krishnan, a banking analyst with SBICap Securities.
Bakhshi returns to ICICI Bank after serving as managing director and CEO of ICICI Prudential for eight years. He will be the senior-most official at ICICI Bank after Kochhar. He has headed both retail and corporate businesses across the ICICI group. Before moving to the bank, he had served as MD & CEO of ICICI Lombard General Insurance."

Mumbai: The troubles for the ICICI Bank Ltd board go beyond appointing a successor to the incumbent chief executive Chanda Kochhar, with India’s second largest private bank struggling to retain the faith of foreign portfolio investors.
At least three foreign investors, including Baillie Gifford and Co., Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Noosa, and Commonwealth Bank of Australia, have cut their shareholdings in ICICI Bank, according to filings with the stock exchange, and two executives familiar with the development.

On 9 April, Baillie Gifford sold 29.4 million shares of ICICI Bank at  ₹ 280 apiece, while Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Noosa, sold 1.77 million shares, at  ₹ 289 per share on 4 June, according to the filings with the stock exchanges. 
In May, Commonwealth Bank of Australia sold its entire stake in ICICI Bank, said one of the executives cited above, requesting anonymity.
“Foreign investors are not happy with this uncertainty over allegations of corporate governance and questions raised on the CEO. The board has not helped in addressing these problems and, for this reason, FIIs are selling shares,"" the executive added.
Mint could not independently ascertain the remaining share holdings of Baillie Gifford and Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Noosa.
Email queries to Baillie Gifford and Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Noosa, seeking comments did not elicit any response. A spokesperson for Commonwealth Bank of Australia declined to comment. 
“We are not able to confirm any CBA (Commonwealth Bank of Australia) shareholding in ICICI Bank. CBA’s broader business includes a number of businesses in wealth management, superannuation and funds management. As such, it is possible the aggregate view of CBA’s shareholdings includes shareholdings of investment managers, who act and invest on behalf of their clients. We are unable to comment on their behalf,"" said a Commonwealth Bank of Australia spokesperson.
Although all three investors held less than 1% stake in ICICI Bank, the fact that FIIs are selling shares explains the underperformance of the company’s shares since the controversy around Kochhar first surfaced in the last week of March. Between 28 March and 18 June, ICICI Bank’s shares rose 5.06%, underperforming the Sensex and BSE Bankex, which gained 7.82% and 8.81%, respectively.
In the past three months, the ICICI Bank board has added two independent directors and a new government nominee, but is yet to name a new chairman. 
The incumbent chairman, M.K. Sharma’s term ends on 30 June. Sharma, 71, who has been Kochhar’s most vocal supporter, cannot seek reappointment as the Reserve Bank of India guidelines bar independent directors of 70 years, or more, from asking for an extension.
Kochhar’s nine-year stint has come under cloud following allegations of “conflict of interest"" over time and “quid pro quo"" in course of her work in dealing with the Videocon loan case.
Now, questions are being raised on whether the CEO disclosed to the bank’s board about her husband, Deepak Kochhar’s partnership in a firm, NuPower, when the bank sanctioned loans to companies controlled by Venugopal Dhoot, the owner of Videocon group. Dhoot was also a founding partner of NuPower. 
The Videocon group had secured $500 million in loans from a consortium of lenders led by ICICI Bank, and 19 other banks in April 2012. The whistle blower, Arvind Gupta, has alleged that the loans to Videocon group companies were approved by ICICI Bank after Dhoot had invested in NuPower."

On 1 June, reacting to a Mint report that the independent directors of ICICI Bank Ltd asked managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar to go on leave till a probe into her conduct by an independent agency is complete, the bank’s stock rose nearly 5%. The probe was announced following a whistleblower’s complaint on her alleged misconduct. After the bank denied the report and said she was on her planned annual leave, shares surrendered most of the gains. 
On 1 June, reacting to a Mint report that the independent directors of ICICI Bank Ltd asked managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Chanda Kochhar to go on leave till a probe into her conduct by an independent agency is complete, the bank’s stock rose nearly 5%. The probe was announced following a whistleblower’s complaint on her alleged misconduct. After the bank denied the report and said she was on her planned annual leave, shares surrendered most of the gains.
On Monday, amid speculation on Sandeep Bakhshi, managing director and CEO of group company ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd, taking over as interim boss of ICICI Bank, its stock rose by 4.07% even as the shares of its peers, Axis Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd all declined.
Nothing else could better illustrate how the market perceives the developments in ICICI Bank. A late evening release by the bank said it appointed Bakhshi as wholetime director and chief operating officer (a new position that has been created) of ICICI Bank for five years, effective Tuesday or later, if the regulatory approval is delayed. 
All business heads will report to Bakhshi, who, in turn, will report to Kochhar, who “has decided to go on leave till the completion of the enquiry"".
Indeed, Kochhar’s decision to go on leave is “in line with the highest levels of governance and corporate standards,"" as the bank’s release says, but why did she take so long to decide on this? By delaying it inordinately, both Kochhar and the bank’s board pushed themselves into a corner and finally were left with no choice but to remind the world that they care for corporate governance.
Except for a brief appearance at a public function in Mumbai, in the past few months since the controversy flared up, Kochhar has focused on her daily chores with meticulous care and confidence until the day she went on leave. In her interaction with analysts, after announcing March quarter earnings, she gave a two-year guidance; it has been business as usual for her and ICICI Bank.
Four senior executives of ICICI Bank who have been on the board are N.S. Kannan, Vijay Chandok, Vishakha Mulye and Anup Bagchi. However, the choice for the COO’s job fell on Bakhshi (and Kannan is being shifted to ICICI Prudential), probably because he is seen as a leader who doesn’t believe in factionalism and can take the team along. Credited with taking the first Indian insurance company public, Bakhshi, 57, had recently been re-appointed as ICICI Prudential CEO for two years. He is as “cool as a cucumber"" who cares for stability, says one of his colleagues.
Bakhshi cut his teeth in development banking with the erstwhile ICICI Ltd in 1986. He headed the group’s non-life insurance company ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd for two years between March 2007 and April 2009 and became a deputy managing director and head of retail in the bank before shifting to the life insurance company in August 2010. With varied experience in project financing, risk management and corporate banking beside retail, he is perceived to be an institution builder.
Kochhar’s current term ends in March 2019. Will she come back and complete her term? Will the ICICI Bank board consider giving her another term? All these issues are in the realm of speculation at this point; we need to wait till the probe by retired Supreme Court justice B.N. Srikrishna is completed.
Even though the banking regulator Reserve Bank of India in 2016 did not find anything wrong in the bank’s lending to a particular group with which Kochhar’s husband has a business relationship, a string of probes is being conducted by multiple agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), income tax department, and India’s capital market regulator. We need to wait till we hear from them.
One thing is for sure, if Kochhar does not continue beyond her current term, the bank will not look for an outsider to succeed her. Bakhshi fits the bill. If that happens, he will have at least one term as, typically, ICICI Bank bosses do not continue beyond the age of 62-63. Both N. Vaghul and K.V. Kamath, who had headed ICICI Bank before Kochhar, had stepped down in their early 60s.
By stepping aside and ensuring a truly independent probe, Kochhar has done the right thing. It would have been a great example of corporate governance had she done it much earlier. By doing it now, she gives the impression that it was not her choice—she has done it under pressure from the board which all along looked the other way. Anyway, better late than never.

He will report to Chanda Kochhar, but while she is on leave, he will report to the bank’s board.

Krishnan, a banking analyst with SBICap Securities.
ICICI Bank shares have underperformed its private sector peers for a long time over bad loan concerns, but some analysts have turned positive on ICICI Banks shares after his appointment. Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice president (markets and corporate affairs) at India Infoline, said his appointment soothes concerns over governance issues and corporate loan demand is also expected to pick up. The stock could be bought on declines, he said.
In the near term however, ICICI Bank shares could remain volatile, depending on the broader market, Bhasin said. On Tuesday, ICICI Bank shares were down 0.65% in early trade on BSE, as compared to a 0.40% fall in Sensex. The bank’s shares had jumped 3.7% on Monday before Bakhshi’s appointment."
525,2018-06-19,ICICI,"New ICICI Bank COO Sandeep Bakhshi should feel no compulsion to play along with the fiction that he's going to go back to being an obedient No. 2 once Chanda Kochhar returns

Chanda Kochhar, the chief executive officer of ICICI Bank, has left the building, and her new deputy should waste no time in letting stakeholders know who the real boss is: it’s him. 
Chanda Kochhar, the chief executive officer of ICICI Bank, has left the building, and her new deputy should waste no time in letting stakeholders know who the real boss is: it’s him.
Investors and commentators like me have been hoping since early April that ICICI Bank Ltd’s board would remove the CEO to save the lender’s reputation. Kochhar’s husband and brother-in-law received an alleged quid pro quo in return for loans made by ICICI.
Both have denied any wrongdoing, though the cloud of suspicion hasn’t lifted. Last month, the market regulator queried ICICI and Kochhar in connection with a loan to Videocon Group. The Indian conglomerate, whose main business is facing bankruptcy, had dealings with a renewable energy firm—NuPower Renewables—in which Kochhar’s husband has economic interests.
ICICI Bank board’s directors, however, had painted themselves into a corner by a premature defence of their CEO, who was feted just months ago as one of India’s top female bankers and a role model. The board didn’t see any conflict of interest in Kochhar not recusing herself from the credit committee that had cleared the Videocon loan. Their hand was forced when a retired judge compelled them to open an inquiry.
Also read: Finally, Chanda Kochhar did what she should have done earlier
So the board saved face on Monday when it said Kochhar would be going on leave pending the inquiry. A change of guard required to instil confidence in the fairness of the probe is also occurring. N.S. Kannan, the bank’s chief financial officer under Kochhar, is being airlifted to the group’s life-insurance venture whose CEO is being parachuted into the mothership to help steady it.
It’s a welcome swap.
Sandeep Bakhshi, the 57-year-old insurance boss who has been named chief operating officer of ICICI, is seen as a veteran insider who respects risk—a quality that has been found lacking in several of the company’s top bankers and alumni. The number of runs on the bank, otherwise an innovative and strong franchise, underscores an inherent shakiness that should have been fixable with good governance. Kochhar’s own stinking pile of corporate bad loans offers evidence that ICICI’s board has been a failure.
Now the problem has acquired political overtones. Aggressive consortium loans, often initiated by non-state-owned banks like ICICI and Standard Chartered Plc, have drawn undercapitalized state-run peers with poor underwriting standards into a $210 billion slaughterhouse of stressed debt. Indian taxpayers are naturally angry.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi already has to contend with a beer baron and a high-profile jeweller who have left the country with billions of dollars in unpaid dues. He can’t afford to let the ICICI crisis fester. By a quirk of history, the Indian government has an ICICI board seat. The opposition parties’ insinuation that Modi’s party is doing nothing to stop crony capitalists and pliant bankers won’t help win next year’s election.
Besides, guilty or not, which employee gets such a long runway from her employer after it becomes clear her exit will be a value-unlocking opportunity for shareholders?
The ideal outcome for investors would no doubt have been for Bakhshi to be named CEO. But then, the board has to think about its own interests. Removing Kochhar barely months after going out on a limb in her defence would make directors vulnerable to legal attacks from the bank’s American depositary receipt holders. The official version of events is that Kochhar has herself decided to go on leave. Whatever the truth, investors will be happy with the fact that in her absence, Bakhshi will be reporting to a board whose chairman is also retiring at the end of the month—not a day too soon.
It’s a fresh beginning at ICICI Bank. The new COO has been inducted into the board and should feel no compulsion to play along with the fiction that he’s going to go back to being an obedient No. 2 once Kochhar returns.
But why should she? Kochhar’s current term ends in March, and the directors can’t possibly be waiting for the judge to finish up fast so they can reward her with another stint.
Make no mistake. Kochhar’s gone, and the almost-5% gain in the bank’s ADRs after the announcement suggests that unlike Elvis, she won’t be missed."
524,2018-06-19,ICICI,"Rather than defending the interests of shareholders, the ICICI Bank board has rushed to exonerate CEO Chanda Kochhar. It has dragged its feet in ordering an inquiry

The reaction of the ICICI Bank Ltd’s stock doesn’t seem to reflect much confidence that the lender’s troubles are behind it, even after chief executive Chanda Kochhar goes on leave pending the inquiry against her. The stock hasn’t gone anywhere near its recent high of around  ₹ 310 seen in mid-May.

There’s no question that the new chief operating officer Sandeep Bakhshi is a good choice. For all practical purposes, Bakshi will run the show now. Transition will be smooth because he is an insider. Before going to the life insurance business, Bakhshi had put in nearly two decades into the bank at various verticals. Under him, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has gone from strength to strength. Even the general insurance business did well under Bakhshi. But that is all the good news there is.
The trouble is that confidence in the ICICI Bank board has been shaken. Its behaviour during the Chanda Kochhar controversy has been little short of craven. Rather than defending the interests of shareholders, it has rushed to exonerate the CEO. It has dragged its feet in ordering an inquiry.
Analysts and proxy advisory firms are already making light of the change of guard. Some foreign investors have already fled worrying about the governance, as a Mint story pointed out.
There are several uncertainties that continue to dog ICICI Bank. One, even if the inquiry exonerates Kochhar, the cloud will continue to hover over the bank till the investigative agencies arrive at a conclusion. Two, are the exposes that have come out so far all there is to the matter, or are their more skeletons in the cupboard? The question that is being asked is whether the bank’s lending practices are kosher. Three, the consequences of losing trust in the bank’s board can be far-reaching. The bank needs to think up strategies to restore the confidence of investors and frequent, transparent and timely communication of the measures it is taking to do so is essential.
As this column had pointed out earlier, investors seek closure, which remains elusive.
There is one other important question: what does the ICICI Bank events say about governance in Indian corporates? The fact that corporate governance standards at the board of the country’s third largest lender are so shoddy doesn’t look too good for other private corporations. While there has been much criticism of company promoters stuffing boards with their cronies, the ICICI Bank controversy lays bare the deficiencies in the boards of professionally managed companies.
In seven weeks, shareholders of ICICI Bank will get the chance to question about the sloppy way its board has handled the situation at the bank’s annual general meeting on 10 August. But they cannot vote for her ouster at the AGM. A vote against Kochhar’s reappointment or for her removal will need a requisition of extraordinary general meeting which only investors holding more than 10% in the bank can do.
Halftimes for the losing teams are a time to find their mojo back. But the dismal way in which the ICICI Bank board played in the first half doesn’t augur too well for the second half of this match."

Justice Srikrishna is likely to take the aid of lawyers and forensic auditors, said a person familiar with the developments, who did not wish to be named. Justice Srikrishna is also being assisted by Uday Chitale, an independent director on the board, to probe the allegations.
Bakhshi, who took charge on Tuesday, will report to the CEO. While Kochhar is on leave, he will report to the bank’s board.
A second fund manager said they require clarity on both governance and leadership for investment decisions. 
“Distancing Chanda Kochhar from the bank during the probe is a good governance step, but this is just one part of it,"" the fund manager said. “The leadership is still not clear. The appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi looks like an interim measure as no other internal or external candidate was looked at before choosing him.""
A third fund manager, who heads equities at a different fund house, holds a similar view. “What if the Srikrishna committee finds that nothing was wrong with Kochhar? It’s an allegation, which after all is hard to prove from a legal standpoint,"" the fund manager said. “If she gets a clean chit, Kochhar can be back and then who knows if Bakhshi will report to Kochhar. The present structure that is put in place could very well be temporary. Nobody knows for sure. Kochhar has not yet left the building."" 
However, another fund manager thinks Bakhshi’s appointment could be a permanent one. 
“This is a move forward. As the board has also moved N.S. Kannan to ICICI Life Insurance, Bakhshi’s appointment doesn’t seem interim. This is not a cosmetic change,"" the fund manager said. “We now need to see if Bakhshi accelerates the cleaning up of the bank’s loan book.""

It has also appointed Sandeep Bakhshi as chief operating officer. He will report directly to the board rather than to chief executive officer Kochhar.
Bakhshi comes from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and by choosing him rather than an insider, the board has perhaps indicated that a leadership transition has begun at ICICI Bank.

Kochhar should have stepped aside once the details of the case tumbled out—but the board should also have used its powers to ask her to do so when a voluntary response was not forthcoming. It instead chose to put out a hasty defence in its 28 March statement, in the wake of what were breezily dismissed as unfounded and malicious rumours: “The board has come to the conclusion that there is no question of any quid pro quo/ nepotism/ conflict of interest as is being alleged in various rumours. The board has full confidence and reposes full faith in the Bank’s MD and CEO Ms. Chanda Kochhar.""
The ICICI Bank board has clearly failed in its main fiduciary responsibility of protecting investor interest. That is basically what boards are appointed to do. It then claimed to have found no evidence of any wrongdoing. This was only a few weeks ago. It is no surprise that the reputation of the ICICI Bank board is now in tatters. It needs to be overhauled as well.
What now?"
519,2018-06-21,ICICI,"ICICI Bank has sought RBI's approval to name independent director M.D. Mallya as chairman after incumbent M.K. Sharma's term ends on 30 June

Mumbai/Bengaluru: ICICI Bank Ltd has sought the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) approval to name independent director M.D. Mallya as the next chairman of India’s second largest private bank, whose board has been criticized for letting a crisis at the bank fester. 
Mumbai/Bengaluru: ICICI Bank Ltd has sought the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) approval to name independent director M.D. Mallya as the next chairman of India’s second largest private bank, whose board has been criticized for letting a crisis at the bank fester.
Mallya, a former chairman of Bank of Baroda, joined the ICICI Bank board on 29 May, and the lender sent his name to RBI in the first week of June, an executive familiar with the development said, requesting anonymity. The term of current chairman M.K. Sharma ends on 30 June.
“I believe the proposal was sent to RBI after discussing with the board,"" said the executive. “The majority of the board is in favour of Mallya as the chairman. The RBI decision has to concur with board’s proposal in such matters. (Still) the bank is yet to hear from RBI.""
Mint could not independently ascertain the reason behind the delay in approval from the RBI.
It remains to be seen if the changes at ICICI Bank, which faces reputational risks on account of charges of impropriety against chief executive Chanda Kochhar, will be enough to soothe concerns as the bank battles to convince investors to keep faith in the stock.
From 1 January until 20 June, ICICI Bank’s shares have fallen 6.7%, underperforming the benchmark Sensex and BSE Bankex index, which gained 4.35% and 2.89%, respectively.
Emails sent to RBI and ICICI Bank seeking comment went unanswered.
On Monday, ICICI Bank named ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd CEO Sandeep Bakhshi as whole-time director and chief operating officer to steer all its business. Kochhar is on leave until a committee investigating allegations of impropriety completes its work.
If Bakhshi does succeed Kochhar, he will work with a reconstituted board that is markedly different from the one at the beginning of the year.

The current 13-member ICICI Bank board comprises seven independent directors, one government nominee and five executive directors, and is headed by Sharma. With his current three-year term ending in less than 10 days, about half of the board members in July will be people who were not with the bank at the start of the year. 
Since January, three independent directors—Homi Khusrokhan, Tushaar Shah and V. Sridar—have retired after completing their tenure of eight years as prescribed under the Banking Regulation Act. They were replaced by Uday Chitale, Radhakrishnan Nair and Mallya.
In April, the government replaced its nominee Amit Agarwal with Lok Ranjan without giving a reason.
ICICI Bank on Monday also appointed N.S. Kannan as the new CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, the reason Kannan is not on the board. 
Like Kochhar, whose current five-year terms ends in March next year, independent director and head of the nomination and remuneration panel Dileep Choksi’s term also ends in March. It is not clear if ICICI Bank will seek the re-appointment of Choksi, who turns 70 next year, as RBI bars an independent director who has turned 70 from being reappointed."

Besides the capital markets regulator, various other agencies, including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), are looking into alleged lapses involving Kochhar and her family members with respect to loans extended by the lender to certain entities, including the Videocon group.
“We are yet to receive reply from the ICICI Bank,"" Tyagi said while briefing reporters after Sebi board meeting in Mumbai. 
The cases under scanner include the bank’s Rs3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar family members in restructuring of the loan. 
Kochhar and her family members are facing allegations of quid pro quo and conflict of interest with respect to a loan extended to certain entities. 
On Monday, the ICICI Bank announced that Kochhar has decided to go on leave till the completion of an external enquiry into alleged conflict of interest in extending loans to some corporates like Videocon and named Sandeep Bakhshi as the chief operating officer."
517,2018-06-22,ICICI,"Taking stock of the circumstances leading to ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar's exit and Sandeep Bakhshi taking the helm in her absence

Mumbai: Finally, ICICI Bank Ltd’s boss Chanda Kochhar did what she should have done earlier. 
Mumbai: Finally, ICICI Bank Ltd’s boss Chanda Kochhar did what she should have done earlier.
On 1 June, reacting to a Mint report that the independent board members of ICICI Bank asked the bank’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) Kochhar to go on leave till a probe into her conduct by an independent agency is complete, the bank’s stock rose nearly 5%. The probe was announced following a whistleblower’s complaint on her alleged misconduct. After the bank denied the report and said she was on her planned annual leave, shares surrendered most of the gains.
On Monday, 18 June, amid speculation on Sandeep Bakhshi, managing director and CEO of group company ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd, taking over as interim boss of the nation’s second largest lender by assets, its stock rose 4.07% even as shares of its peers, Axis Bank Ltd, HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd all declined.
Nothing else could better illustrate how the market perceives the developments at ICICI Bank.
A late evening release by the bank on the same day said it has appointed Bakhshi as whole-time director and chief operating officer (a new position that has been created) of ICICI Bank for five years, with immediate effect, subject to regulatory approval.
All business heads will report to Bakhshi, who, in turn, will report to Kochhar, who “has decided to go on leave till the completion of the enquiry"".
Indeed, Kochhar’s decision to go on leave is “in line with the highest levels of governance and corporate standards"", as the bank’s release says, but why did she take so long to decide on this? By delaying it inordinately, both Kochhar and the bank’s board pushed themselves into a corner and finally were left with no choice but to demonstrate to the world that they care for corporate governance.
Except for a brief appearance at a public function in Mumbai, in the past few months since the controversy flared up, Kochhar had focused on her daily chores with meticulous care and confidence until the day she went on leave.
Even during her leave, she dropped by at the ICICI Bank headquarters at Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex on 13 June to attend a board meeting, which took the call on selling a 2% stake in the life insurance outfit to raise  ₹ 1,100 crore. In her interaction with analysts, after announcing the March quarter earnings, she gave a two-year guidance. Clearly, it was business as usual for her and the bank. Why did she take so long to step aside? Did she underestimate the gravity of the charges? Or, was she confident in her ability to tide it over? And, of course, she has had the conviction that she has not done anything which she should not have done.
We will never know the reasons but probably she felt the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in 2016 had found nothing wrong in the bank’s dealings and the bank’s board, too, had given her a clean chit. So, what’s the need for having an independent probe (and stepping aside while the probe is on), particularly when the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has been probing it? Let’s wait till CBI files its findings. It seems both the CEO and the bank’s board were on the same page.
For the record, the news of her husband’s alleged business nexus with a corporate house had done the first round in 2016 on social media, but the mainstream media did not pick that up. What has changed since then? Well, the difference in 2018 is that CBI decided to look into it. That gave credence to the speculation and media lapped up the story even as the board of the bank stood behind her.
Theories doing rounds
Since March, when it hit the headlines, there have been various theories doing rounds to establish that Kochhar is being framed.
Theory No 1: The canard was spread by some public sector bankers to shift people’s attention from the government-owned banks, mired in a series of frauds, perpetrated by fugitive diamantaires Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi and others. Had this been true, the state of affairs at public sector banks, which roughly have 70% market share of banking assets, would have been different. Those who run India’s government-owned banking industry are not that smart.
Theory No 2: A few corporate houses have been after Kochhar’s blood because she has stopped giving them fresh loans and, what more, has been hounding them to recover money already lent. Many are vouching for this; I am not qualified to comment on the veracity of this theory.
Theory No 3: Why would the particular corporate house do a favour to Kochhar’s husband as a quid pro quo to get money from the bank? After all, it has taken money from the entire banking industry and ICICI Bank’s share in the pie is not even 10%. So, if it had entered into a quid pro quo with Kochhar to get the money, it must have similar arrangements with other banks as well. If this is not the case, we must accept that it had got money from all banks, including ICICI Bank, without any conditions.
Those who trust her judgement and swear by her intelligence, integrity and articulation also say it’s unfair to drag her into such a controversy. They ask: can’t a successful woman professional have an equally successful husband?
As the events unfolded, her brother-in-law also got implicated and one more industrial house got dragged into it. Pressures started building up from different quarters, including investors, who have not been happy with the ICICI Bank stock performance. India’s capital market regulator also stepped into the scene.
The bench
Four senior executives of the bank who have been on the board are N.S. Kannan, Vijay Chandok, Vishakha Mulye and Anup Bagchi. However, the choice for the COO’s job fell on Bakhshi (Kannan is being shifted to ICICI Prudential) probably because he enjoys wide acceptability. He is also seen as a leader who doesn’t believe in factionalism and can take the team along.
Credited with taking the first Indian insurance company public, Bakhshi, 57, has recently been re-appointed as ICICI Prudential CEO for two years. This also shows the bank never planned this arrangement. He is as “cool as cucumber"" who cares for stability, says one of his colleagues.
A mechanical engineer from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh, and a post-graduate in management from Xavier Labour Relations Institute, Jamshedpur, Bakhshi cut his teeth in development banking with the erstwhile ICICI Ltd in 1986. He headed the group’s non-life insurance company, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd, for two years between March 2007 and April 2009, and became a deputy managing director and head of retail in the bank before shifting to the life insurance company in August 2010, when V. Vaidyanathan, founder and executive chairman of Capital First Ltd (now being merged with IDFC Bank Ltd), left.
With varied experience in project financing, risk management and corporate banking, beside retail, Bakhshi is perceived to be an institution builder within the group.
Kochhar’s current term ends in March 2019. Will she come back and complete her term? Will the board consider giving her another term? All these issues are in the realm of speculation at this point; we need to wait till the probe by retired Supreme Court justice B.N. Srikrishna is completed.
Although the banking regulator in 2016 did not find anything wrong in the bank’s lending to a particular group with which Kochhar’s husband had a business relationship, a string of probes is being conducted by multiple agencies, including CBI, the income tax department, and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). We need to wait till we hear from them.
One thing is for sure: if Kochhar does not continue beyond her current term, the bank will not look for an outsider to succeed her. Bakhshi fits the bill. If that happens, he will have at least one term, as typically ICICI Bank bosses do not continue beyond the age of 62-63. Both N. Vaghul and K.V. Kamath, who had headed ICICI Bank before Kochhar, had stepped down in their early 60s.
Also, historically, ICICI group never looked outside to fill in the top slot. Indeed, Kamath came from the Bakeri Group in Indonesia to lead ICICI in 1996, but that was a homecoming for him as he started his career in the development financial institution like Kochhar and Bakhshi.
And, each ICICI Bank boss stepped in to firefight crisis. When Kamath took over in 1996 (he took over as MD and CEO of the development financial institution which later got merged with the bank), ICICI was facing an acute liquidity crisis. Kochhar’s move to the corner room was in 2008, post the collapse of iconic US investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. that affected the bank. The context of Bakhshi being bestowed with the responsibility is different—more to do with internal issues that external developments—but nonetheless it’s not a happy time to be at the helm.
By stepping aside and ensuring a truly independent probe, Kochhar has done the right thing. It would have been a great example of corporate governance had she done it earlier. By doing it at the end, she gives the impression that it was not her choice—she has done it under pressure from the board, which all along looked the other way. For the board, too, it has been a desperate act for redemption.

516,2018-06-22,ICICI,"ICICI Bank said it had received complaints about 31 loan accounts from a whistleblower on which an enquiry was made and interim report was submitted to the regulator

New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Friday said it had received complaints about 31 loan accounts from an anonymous complainant, on which an enquiry was made and interim report was submitted to the regulator. 
New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank on Friday said it had received complaints about 31 loan accounts from an anonymous complainant, on which an enquiry was made and interim report was submitted to the regulator.
“Further actions in this matter are being/ will be taken as directed by the Audit Committee,"" the bank said in a stock exchange filing.
ICICI Bank’s CEO and MD Chanda Kochhar, who is facing an independent enquiry in connections with loan given to Videocon Group, has decided go on leave till the completion of the inquiry.
The bank, in a stock exchange filing, said that in March 2018 it was “made aware"" on the complaint which alleged, among other things irregularities in the conduct of some borrower accounts, resulting in incorrect asset classification. The complaint cited 31 loan accounts.
“The complaint was treated as a whistle blower complaint and an enquiry was instituted as per the Whistle Blower Policy of the Bank under the supervision of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, without involvement of the senior management other than Internal Audit,"" ICICI Bank said.
The statutory auditors were provided periodic updates and their inputs were factored into the enquiry process. The interim report of the enquiry was reviewed in detail by the Audit Committee and statutory auditors, prior to finalisation of the accounts for the year ended 31 March 2018.
“The findings in the interim report had no material impact on the financial statements for FY2018. The interim report has also been submitted to the regulator,"" the private sector lender said.
It further said the loans outstanding were fully classified as non-performing, with provisions made as per applicable norms. These accounts were classified as non-performing between the year ended 31 March 2012 and the year ended 31 March, 2017, other than two accounts which were classified by 31 December 2017.
“Thus, all these loans had been classified as non- performing prior to the Bank becoming aware of the complaint,"" the filing said.
The aggregate loans (in the 31 cases) outstanding at 31 March 2018 were Rs6,082 crore ($898 million), about 1.1% of gross loans.
The provision coverage (including prudential/ technical write-offs) was 50%. 
Further, based on the procedures performed in the enquiry, the allegations relating to incorrect accounting of interest income and NPA recoveries as fees, and overvaluation of security for corporate loans, “were not borne out"".
Also, no disclosure on divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs was required to be made by the bank with respect to RBI’s annual supervisory process for 2016-17, it added."

Mumbai: American investors in ICICI Bank Ltd want its CEO Chanda Kochhar removed and the board completely overhauled, research firm Macquarie Research said in a report dated 20 June. The report was based on meetings with top shareholders of ICICI Bank across the US east coast, mid-west and west coast. 
Mumbai: American investors in ICICI Bank Ltd want its CEO Chanda Kochhar removed and the board completely overhauled, research firm Macquarie Research said in a report dated 20 June. The report was based on meetings with top shareholders of ICICI Bank across the US east coast, mid-west and west coast.
“They want the CEO to go. They were very disappointed with the board and the way the chairman has handled the entire issue,"" said the report.
On 18 June, the ICICI Bank board said that Kochhar, who is facing conflict-of-interest allegations, will go on leave until a committee investigating allegations of impropriety completes its work. In the interim, Sandeep Bakhshi—who has been appointed as the chief operating officer (COO)—will steer its businesses.
Macquarie said in the report that investors are sceptical about an internal candidate being appointed as the CEO.
“They are not very confident of an insider getting appointed as the CEO. They believe the culture and DNA of the organisation can be changed largely by an outsider. They will be more confident if an external candidate gets appointed as the CEO,"" said the report.
The decision to name Bakhshi as ICICI Bank COO came after the board decided to set up a panel under justice B.N. Srikrishna to investigate allegations of conflict of interest and quid pro quo against Kochhar in the Videocon loan case.
Questioning the board’s decision to appoint a COO, Macquarie likened it to a typical public sector or bureaucratic style of decision-making, where someone is temporarily suspended or asked to go. The report also questioned Bakhshi’s ability to change the culture of ICICI Bank, pointing out that he had spent the last 15 years in the insurance business.
According to the report, investors are worried about the stock losing its appeal due to the controversy surrounding the bank’s CEO. However, they are not questioning the fundamentals of the firm as they know the stock is cheap and the bank is well-capitalized and its deposit franchise excellent, said the report.
On Thursday, Goldman Sachs downgraded ICICI Bank from its ‘conviction buy list’ of stocks to ‘buy’. The action was attributed to uncertainty over the outcome of the independent inquiry as well as lack of visibility around succession planning for the CEO role.
Mint reported on 1 June that Kochhar has been asked to remain on leave until a probe is over. ICICI Bank, however, had then said the board has not asked Kochhar to go on leave. “She is on her annual leave which was planned in advance,"" the bank said in an exchange filing.
Separately, markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is investigating whether ICICI Bank and Kochhar failed to make adequate disclosures to the bank’s board about her husband Deepak Kochhar’s partnership in a firm, NuPower Renewables, when the bank sanctioned loans to companies controlled by Venugopal Dhoot, the owner of Videocon group.
Dhoot was also a founding partner of NuPower.

514,2018-06-25,ICICI,"The latest whistleblower complaint has alleged ICICI Bank inflated profits by at least $1.3 billion over eight years by delaying provisioning for NPAs

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has not satisfactorily answered two serious allegations made by a whistleblower—that the bank inflated profits by at least $1.3 billion over eight years by delaying provisioning for bad loans, and that top executives, including CEO Chanda Kochhar and executive director Vijay Chandok, wilfully breached rules to avoid classifying the loans as bad. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has not satisfactorily answered two serious allegations made by a whistleblower—that the bank inflated profits by at least $1.3 billion over eight years by delaying provisioning for bad loans, and that top executives, including CEO Chanda Kochhar and executive director Vijay Chandok, wilfully breached rules to avoid classifying the loans as bad.
On Friday, the bank failed to fully address these issues in response to a Mint query, although it denied charges of incorrect accounting of interest income in 31 loan accounts; misrepresenting recovery amounts in non-performing assets as fees; and overvaluing securities for corporate loans.
“In certain accounts, transactions were observed that may have delayed the classification of the account as non-performing under Indian GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) in earlier years… As mentioned earlier, all the above loans had been classified as non-performing and provided for as per applicable norms by 31 December 2017,"" ICICI Bank said in its response, a copy of which was sent to the exchanges. 
However, the complaint by the whistleblower, an ICICI Bank employee, made on 20 March and 22 March to the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), has alleged that the bank deliberately failed to set aside funds to cover 31 defaulting loan accounts between fiscal 2008 and March 2016, not fiscal 2017. The bank’s clarification does not answer the whistleblower’s charges as to why in a number of fiscal quarters between 2008 and 2016, the bank’s management deliberately delayed provisioning for 31 loans.
The bank has allegedly inflated profits, primarily by underreporting the quantum of bad loans made to 31 companies, in which impairment was delayed by a quarter to even up to five years, according to the complaint.
In its detailed rebuttal on Friday, ICICI Bank admitted there were some delays in underreporting the quantum of bad loans made to 31 companies. In response to a fresh query sent by Mint on Saturday, ICICI Bank declined to elaborate further, stating that “we have nothing further to add on this matter at this point of time"".
According to the whistleblower, the bank has managed to delay provisioning for NPAs arising out of loans worth at least $3 billion. Effectively, ICICI Bank would have reported losses in some quarters over the eight years, had the bank’s management not deferred impairment of loans, claimed the whistleblower.
It is not known if this points to a systemic failure at the bank and if the bank is also investigating executives responsible. It hasn’t clarified yet if it intimated Sebi about the internal probe as part of fair disclosure norms.
The whistleblower’s allegation of partiality by the bank’s top management in cases of certain loans is also quite serious.
“The bank’s top management has often openly discussed the methods to be used or have been used to avoid impairment of loans... there have been several meetings held at the bank by the senior management to discuss the modus operandi of trying to save certain loan assets in other countries by funding a group company in India. The bank’s discussions in such cases indicate the involvement of Chanda Kochhar in negotiations with the client,"" reads the whistleblower’s letter. It adds that the bank has on several instances modified the internal auditor’s observations to mask the fraud from the final audit report at the behest of the senior management.
ICICI Bank did not respond to this charge.
According to the whistleblower, at least three loans, including a $923 million loan made to Essar Global Ltd, a loan of similar amount made to Bhushan Steel Ltd and a $615.38 million loan to Essar Steel Ltd account for 84% of the $2.92 billion in loans made to 31 firms.
ICICI Bank, which is also listed on NYSE and governed by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, on Friday, dismissed this charge saying that its interim internal report found no “material impact"" on the bank’s financials, without clarifying the threshold amount that is defined as “material"" by the bank. Although GAAP and FASB (accounting methods) do not precisely stipulate a threshold to define materiality, according to auditors and courts in the US, on the income statement, any transaction constituting 5% or more of the company’s pre-tax profit, or 0.5% of sales revenue, is considered as material. 
On a balance sheet, any entry of more than 0.3-0.5% of total assets, or more than 1% of total equity, is considered to be material.
Attorneys and accountants at the SEC have been investigating the whistleblower’s allegations for months now. The 20 March complaint states that the bank had engaged in fraudulent activities between 2008 and 2016 to avoid reporting of impairment of loans.
ICICI Bank has not clarified whether the US SEC is conducting any probe based on the allegations made in the whistleblower emails.
SEC considers it an abuse of materiality judgement if it is done to keep stock prices artificially high, or inflate reported earnings or understate the actual value of the asset base.
ICICI Bank has said that further actions in the matter are being and will be taken as directed by the audit committee, without clarifying on whether this initiative is related to either an ongoing investigation and what the role of senior management was in this delay in classifying some of the loans as NPAs."

512,2018-06-26,ICICI,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is now looking into whistleblower allegations that ICICI Bank delayed for eight years provisioning for NPAs to show profits

Mumbai: India’s banking regulator initiated a second probe into the affairs of ICICI Bank Ltd for allegedly delaying provisioning for stressed loans and so-called loan evergreening, among other wrongdoings, within days of receiving a whistleblower’s complaints on 20 March and 22 March, a fact that the bank was informed of only in early May. 
Mumbai: India’s banking regulator initiated a second probe into the affairs of ICICI Bank Ltd for allegedly delaying provisioning for stressed loans and so-called loan evergreening, among other wrongdoings, within days of receiving a whistleblower’s complaints on 20 March and 22 March, a fact that the bank was informed of only in early May.
Reserve Bank of India (RBI) started the second probe on 25 March. The first one was initiated in 2016 after another whistleblower alleged conflict of interest in CEO Chanda Kochhar’s dealings. RBI had then said the allegation “could not be conclusively established"". The latest revelations raise serious questions about corporate governance practices, transparency and the leadership of ICICI Bank’s embattled CEO Kochhar, who is on indefinite leave from the company she has helmed for almost a decade until an independent enquiry announced by the lender’s board to probe alleged cases of impropriety is concluded.
RBI began its probe into at least 26 of the 31 loan accounts named in the whistleblower’s complaints initially, including Anil Printers Ltd, Karuturi. Overseas Ltd, Venkatesh Logistics Ltd and Orchid Hotels Pune Pvt. Ltd. However, following ICICI Bank’s response to its queries regarding the loan given to Anil Printers, RBI on 11 April decided to expand its probe to 55 of ICICI Bank’s borrowers.
This account is based on interviews with about five people, all of whom sought anonymity to speak candidly on the issue.
In an emailed response to queries In an emailed response to queries sent by Mint on Monday, ICICI Bank said, “RBI in the normal course of its supervisory activities seeks information from the Bank from time to time. The statements made in your email as to the same are not reliable.""
An email sent to RBI on Thursday remained unanswered till press time.
In the emails to RBI, the whistleblower alleged that in nine loan accounts, impairment was delayed for four or more years, in two accounts, it was delayed for three years, in 13 accounts it was delayed for two years, and in seven accounts, the acknowledgement of default by the borrower was delayed for less than a year.
In response to an RBI query, ICICI Bank on 29 March effectively admitted to have sanctioned additional loans worth  ₹ 3.75 crore to Anil Printers in June 2011 despite knowing that the company had defaulted on several borrowings, including a foreign currency loan and a term loan. 
ICICI Bank told RBI that it had sanctioned the additional loan to help the company tide over a liquidity crunch. 
More damningly, ICICI Bank said that out of the  ₹ 3.75 crore, an amount of  ₹ 3.5 crore was used to recover the bank’s dues—a practice known as evergreening that banks use to avoid acknowledging a default by a borrower.
This disclosure prompted RBI to expand the probe to include loans disbursed to 55 companies, including Essar Global Ltd, Essar Power Ltd, Assam Oil Co. Ltd, Bhushan Steel Ltd, Essar Steel India Ltd, Videocon Oil Ventures Ltd, Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd, ABG Shipyard Ltd, IVRCL Ltd, Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, Bhushan Energy Ltd and Gammon India Ltd.
RBI also asked ICICI Bank to provide details of their fund-based and non-fund based (such as bank guarantees) outstanding as on 11 April; the total exposure of these borrowers; account classification details; if they were non-performing assets (NPAs) or not; the date of the accounts becoming NPA; provisioning amounts spent by the bank after the accounts became NPAs and a number of other details.
The following day, RBI asked ICICI Bank if a forensic audit has been commissioned against any of the 55 borrowers and, if so, to share the reports with it.
A few days later, on 17 April, RBI directed the bank to share details of these accounts along with information about term loans, cash credit or any other loans or guarantees provided by the bank to the borrowers since April 2010.
“A cost of  ₹ 9,000 crore was hidden by not making the requisite provisions for NPAs and the balance  ₹ 4,000 crore was saved by unfairly booking incomes from interest on NPA accounts, which were misclassified to be standard. An average of at least 10% of the value of the loan is considered here as the interest income,"" said three of the five people, who have analysed the bank’s statement of accounts.
By delaying provisioning for the loans given to the 31 entities named in the complaint, ICICI Bank allegedly overstated profits by at least  ₹ 13,000 crore between 2011 and 2016, as per the whistleblower’s analysis sent to the central bank.
In a 22 June exchange filing, ICICI Bank denied allegations of inflating profits and reiterated some of the points it has previously made. 
“The figures of impact of the various allegations on profits of the Bank in earlier years appear to be without any basis and cannot be corroborated,"" an ICICI Bank spokesman said in an email. “No disclosure on divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs was required to be made by the Bank with respect to RBI’s annual supervisory process for FY2017.""
For the year ended March 2016, the bank reported a net profit of  ₹ 9,726 crore, which actually should have been 56% lower at  ₹ 4,264 crore had the bank set aside money to cover defaults by borrowers, according to the analysis by the officials.
Similarly, for the previous year, the bank reported a net profit of  ₹ 11,175 crore, which actually should have been 23% lower at  ₹ 8,586 crore had the bank classified its NPAs in time, the analysis showed.
For the year ended March 2014, the bank allegedly overstated its profit by 27% at  ₹ 9,810 crore, which actually should have been  ₹ 7,165 crore had the impairment of loans not been delayed and interest incomes not been shown by classifying bad loans as standard assets.
Mint has reviewed the copies of the letters exchanged between the bank and RBI with regards to the alleged fraudulent activities done by the bank, which resulted in whistleblower complaints."

Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon. 
Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon.
Of the top five most preferred stocks, three are financials, with ICICI Bank being the second-most preferred stock, and most preferred financial stock despite being in the news for all the wrong reasons, as brokerages welcomed cheaper valuations coupled with steps to investigate alleged wrongdoing.
The analysis includes stocks which have the highest percentage of buys/outperform/add ratings from the Sensex pack of the total ratings for the respective stocks.
According to data from Bloomberg, Mahindra is the most preferred stock with 42, or 97.67% of analysts tracking the stock rating it a buy or outperform, and only one analyst or 2.33% of the total analysts rating the stock a hold or a neutral. There were no sell ratings on the stock.
Mahindra shares that started rallying on 21 February have gained 26.8% since then. Year to date, they are up 19.6% at  ₹  898.30, outperforming BSE’s benchmark 30-share Sensex which rose 4.21% during the period.
“Rural demand outlook remains positive, on expectations of normal monsoons and government spending in rural segment,"" Nomura said in a note on 30 May, while maintaining its buy rating and raising its target price to  ₹  1,049 from  ₹  965 earlier.
Nomura analysts pointed that Mahindra maintained its 8-10% tractor growth forecast for fiscal year 2019, with scope for upside risk, and the brokerage estimates 10% growth in fiscal year 2019 and 8% in fiscal year 2020.
“Revival of rural growth and volume recovery in UVs (utility vehicles) should help the stock re-rate, in our view,"" Nomura analysts added.
In the case of ICICI Bank, 48 analysts or 92.3% analysts rated the stock a buy or outperform, while three or 5.77% analysts had a hold, or one or 1.92% of total analysts rated it a sell. 
“Beyond the remedial measures around the current negative news flow, we maintain our Buy on ICICI Bank given gradual improvement in the operating environment coupled with the arrest of fresh NPL (non-performing loans) formation, and cheaper valuations,"" Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note on 18 June. Year to date, ICICI Bank shares have shed 8.28%.
On 18 June, ICICI Bank’s board said that CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is facing conflict-of-interest allegations, will go on leave until a committee investigating allegations of impropriety completes its work. In the interim, Sandeep Bakhshi—who has been appointed as the chief operating officer (COO)—will steer its businesses.
The Videocon group had secured $500 million in loans from a consortium of lenders led by ICICI Bank and 19 other banks in April 2012.
The whistleblower, Arvind Gupta, has alleged that the loans to Videocon group companies were approved by ICICI Bank after the group owner Venugopal Dhoot had invested in NuPower, where Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar was a partner.
While mid-cap IT stocks are in vogue, the same is still not true for their biggest IT companies in the country. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd retained the least preferred stocks position, from a year before."

What are the latest allegations?
The whistleblower, an ICICI Bank employee, filed complaints on 20 and 22 March alleging the bank deliberately did not set aside funds to cover 31 defaulting loan accounts between fiscal 2008 and March 2016. The person said the bank inflated profits, mainly by underreporting the quantum of bad loans to these firms, delaying impairment for more than four years in some cases. The complaint also said top executives, including CEO Chanda Kochhar, breached rules to avoid classifying the loans as bad.

The findings of the report did not reveal any material impact on the financial statements for FY18, the bank said. A copy of the report was also submitted to the banking regulator. ICICI Bank said 29 loan accounts were classified as NPAs between the year ended 31 March 2012 and 31 March 2017, and the remaining two by 31 December 2017. The bank admitted to some delays in the classification of these accounts.

508,2018-06-28,ICICI,"The latest whistleblower complaint alleges that the Chanda Kochhar-led ICICI Bank aided related entities to pre-empt provisioning against NPAs

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd issued hundreds of letters of credit (LCs) to entities related to its troubled corporate borrowers to help them avoid loan default, a whistleblower complaint said, pre-empting the need to set aside money for non-performing assets (NPAs). 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd issued hundreds of letters of credit (LCs) to entities related to its troubled corporate borrowers to help them avoid loan default, a whistleblower complaint said, pre-empting the need to set aside money for non-performing assets (NPAs).
Banks often extend loans to debt-laden companies to help them repay previous loans, a practice known as evergreening. This buys time to run down bad loans slowly so the companies can earn their way out of trouble. A letter of credit is a guarantee that the bank provides to a seller that the bank will cover a payment if the buyer defaults.
While loan evergreening has been fairly rampant in India, the practice has been frowned upon by regulators and has contributed to the ballooning of bad loans in the Indian banking system. It also short-changes investors by giving an inaccurate picture of the state of the bank’s finances.
According to the complaint by an anonymous ICICI Bank employee who wrote to the bank and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 20 and 22 March, the private sector lender also sanctioned a large number of term loans to entities related to the 31 borrowers named in the complaint. These loans, the complainant said, were granted ignoring the warnings raised by internal auditors.
The complainant named Essar Global, Bhushan Steel, NCML Industries, Bhatia Global, Bhushan Energy, Essar Steel and Tecpro Systems among these 31 companies.
Apart from these, RBI is also probing how the bank disbursed and managed loans to Assam Oil Co. Ltd, Videocon Oil Ventures Ltd, Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd, ABG Shipyard Ltd, IVRCL Ltd, Gammon India Ltd and Punj Lloyd Ltd, among others. 
In response to Mint’s queries, an ICICI spokesperson said: “Banks are required to disclose the divergences in asset classification and provisioning consequent to RBI’s annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial statements, wherever either (a) the additional provisioning requirements assessed by RBI exceed 15% of the published net profits after tax for the reference period or (b) the additional Gross NPAs identified by RBI exceed 15% of the published incremental Gross NPAs for the reference period, or both. Based on the above, no disclosure on divergence in asset classification and provisioning for NPAs was required to be made by the Bank with respect to RBI’s annual supervisory process for FY2017."" 
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began an investigation into the whistleblower’s allegations on provisions being delayed in June 2016, while RBI started a fresh probe on 25 March this year on the bank’s processes while it sanctioned loans to 55 entities. 
Mint has seen copies of a number of loan account statements and details on which the whistleblower complaint is based, although it is not in a position to independently verify them.
The whistleblower alleged that ICICI Bank issued LCs against fictitious bills to service a number of loans. 
The charges, if proved, will be in violation of anti-money laundering norms since it implies round-tripping of money.
Since ICICI Bank is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the US SEC has noted the matter as one under “national priority"", wherein attorneys have been appointed to investigate ICICI Bank and its top management. 
According to two ICICI Bank officials who didn’t want to be identified, as well as the whistleblower’s complaint, the bank has waived penal interest of borrowers several times in the past to avert impairment.
“Whenever a loan account was overdue for over 60 or 90 days, a fresh loan was sanctioned. To disburse the fresh loan after sanction, the overdue was needed to be regularized. In one case, for an initial term loan of  ₹  100 crore, three loans aggregating to  ₹  90 crore were sanctioned to avert impairment over a five-year period,"" said the two bank officials, citing examples from account statements of NPA entities.
“When a borrower didn’t have enough balance available to make loan payments, temporary overdraft (TOD) was sanctioned to another borrower to pay to the first borrower whose account needed to be saved from being impaired. In one instance, TOD was sanctioned to a service provider of a large borrower. This service provider had no borrowing arrangements with the bank. Unfortunately, the money could not be returned to the service provider. That TOD became overdue and eventually an NPA,"" said the officials, who showed Mint the names of the borrowers, their account statements and the letters to the bank.
According to the officials, often, the bank allegedly helped a number of debtors by increasing their drawing power for cash credit by increasing their cover period; by changing cash credit to overdraft; allowing interchangeability between fund-based and non-fund-based working capital finance limits; providing fund-based sub-limits for non-fund-based limits and vice versa. Mint has seen supporting documents in this regard.
“The technology platform of the bank also has deliberate gaping holes. Bank’s term loans are accounted for in a software called SYMBOLS, which is, unlike real time core-banking system software such as FINACLE. This has been done deliberately to employ accounting activities which can be manipulated as the end-of-day (EOD) reports can be delayed or back-dated as desired,"" said the two bank officials.
The ICICI spokesperson refuted the charge and said: “The bank uses robust information technology systems to handle its various portfolios like term loans, working capital loans, retail loans, credit cards, deposits, transaction banking, treasury, fixed assets and so on. Systems are deployed because of their specialisation in handling specific portfolios. The use of separate systems for different portfolios is common across many banks in India. The financial reporting for the bank accumulates data from all the IT systems on an automated basis. Hence the allegation that the technology platform of the Bank has gaping holes is a mala fide and irresponsible statement to discredit the bank’s state-of-the-art IT systems with the intent to lower the image of the bank in the eyes of its stakeholders."""

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a preliminary enquiry against ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak and businessman Venugopal Dhoot to investigate alleged conflict of interest in a  ₹ 3,250 crore loan made by ICICI Bank to Dhoot’s Videocon group. ICICI Bank had extended the loan as part of a  ₹ 40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012.
Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has also asked ICICI Bank to clarify on reports of alleged corporate governance breach. 
The tax department in April issued notices to Deepak Kochhar to look into the flow of about  ₹ 325 crore from two Mauritius-based firms to NuPower Renewables, which he once co-owned with Dhoot.
Following this, in May, the ICICI Bank board instituted a fresh inquiry into the allegations and asked its CEO Kocchar to go on indefinite leave till probe is over. 
The bank announced retired supreme court judge B.N. Srikrishna would head the inquiry and appointed Sandeep Bakhshi as the chief operating officer for a five-year term.

“We view the recent development as an important step to address a key concern that has been a headwind to the stock in recent months.

Chaturvedi’s appointment also comes after a third whistleblower complaint, which alleged that ICICI Bank inflated profits to the tune of $1.8 billion in eight years by withholding provisioning against bad loans. In the past three months, the ICICI Bank board has added two independent directors and a new government nominee."
505,2018-06-29,ICICI,"The former bureaucrat's tasks include soothing investor concerns and dealing with probe findings

Mumbai/Bengaluru: ICICI Bank on Friday appointed former bureaucrat Girish Chandra Chaturvedi as non-executive part-time chairman of India’s second-largest private bank, whose board has been criticized for letting a crisis at the bank fester. 
Mumbai/Bengaluru: ICICI Bank on Friday appointed former bureaucrat Girish Chandra Chaturvedi as non-executive part-time chairman of India’s second-largest private bank, whose board has been criticized for letting a crisis at the bank fester.
The bank said Chaturvedi’s appointment will be effective 1 July, or the date of receipt of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) approval, whichever is later, as current chairman M.K. Sharma’s term ends on 30 June.
ICICI Bank initially wanted to appoint independent director M.D. Mallya as the next chairman and had even sought RBI’s approval. However, the approval from the banking regulator appears to have run into a hurdle as Mallya has been facing health issues over the last few weeks, according to an executive familiar with the development. 
Chaturvedi’s appointment comes less than two weeks after the bank entrusted a leader to oversee all of its business operations.
On 18 June, ICICI Bank appointed ICICI Prudential Life Insurance chief executive officer (CEO) Sandeep Bakhshi as whole-time director and chief operating officer. The move came in the wake of current CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is facing conflict-of-interest allegations, deciding to go on indefinite leave pending the report of a committee investigating allegations of impropriety.
Chaturvedi, who has been appointed for a three-year term, faces three main challenges.
First, ICICI Bank faces a reputational risk on account of charges of skulduggery against Kochhar, and the chairman needs to quickly address investor concerns as the bank battles to retain the faith of foreign portfolio investors.
Goldman Sachs has removed the stock from its conviction list on continued uncertainty around its CEO and the lack of clarity around the succession planning for the CEO role.
ICICI Bank’s shares have fallen 12.26% so far this year, underperforming the Sensex and BSE Bankex, which gained 4% and 1.36%, respectively.
ICICI Bank remains confident about its decision to have Chaturvedi helm the board.
“The board is extremely pleased with this development and believes that Mr. Chaturvedi will provide maturity and sagacity to the deliberations of the board. This would also ensure a seamless and smooth transition of leadership at the board and would address stakeholder concerns in this behalf,"" said ICICI Bank.
Second, the ICICI board has instituted an independent probe by retired Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, although for now, the board has not shared any details, including the terms of reference and the time period for the probe’s completion. The challenge for Chaturvedi will lie in how he deals with the findings of the committee, especially those related to alleged lapses in corporate governance, which is also being probed by market regulator Sebi. 
Finally, from 1 July, Chaturvedi will head a 12-member board that is markedly different than the one in January, as half of the board members were not with the bank at the start of the year. Since January, three independent directors, Homi Khusrokhan, Tushaar Shah and V. Sridar retired after completing their tenure of eight years, as prescribed under the Banking Regulation Act, and were replaced by Uday Chitale, Radhakrishnan Nair and Mallya. 
In April, the government replaced its nominee, Amit Agarwal, with Lok Ranjan without giving a reason for this change. Earlier this month, ICICI Bank appointed N.S. Kannan as the new CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, the reason he is not on the board.
Chaturvedi, who served as an IAS officer from the 1977 batch and retired as oil secretary in January 2013, will need to quickly get his act together and lead an already reconstituted board. He has the experience, having served as government nominee director on the boards of Canara Bank, Bank of Baroda, and IDBI Bank Ltd and also on the boards of insurance firms such as New India Assurance Co. Ltd and United India Insurance Co. Ltd."

New Delhi: Regulator Sebi is believed to have found ICICI Prudential MF in violation of rules during the last day bidding for IPO of the group firm ICICI Securities and has asked the fund house to pay back Rs240 crore, with 15% interest, to its five schemes from which the money was taken for the shares.  
New Delhi: Regulator Sebi is believed to have found ICICI Prudential MF in violation of rules during the last day bidding for IPO of the group firm ICICI Securities and has asked the fund house to pay back Rs240 crore, with 15% interest, to its five schemes from which the money was taken for the shares. 
Besides, the fund house has been asked to pay the investors, who have redeemed their units since allotment of shares in the initial public offer, after calculating the loss incurred by the respective schemes due to fall in the ICICI Securities share price, sources said. 
Investors will need to be given an interest of 15%, Sebi has said in a letter to ICICI Prudential AMC. 
When contacted, the fund house declined to comment. 
ALSO READ: Is ICICI Pru MF buying I-Sec IPO shares right?
Sources said Sebi has found that the act of ICICI Pru, its CEO and the respective fund managers was not in the interest of unit holders. It was also in violation of mutual fund rules related to code of conduct and due diligence in revising its bids and putting in more money to help save the IPO on the last day, they added. 
In March, ICICI Securities came out with its IPO for 77,249,508 shares, with a price band of Rs519- 520. It had reduced the size of the offer to a little over Rs3,500 crore after the sale elicited a sluggish response, especially from high net worth individuals. 
The share sale of the leading brokerage firm—which was to raise up to Rs4,016 crore—received around 88% subscription, including the anchor portion, on the last day of the bidding. 
ICICI Prudential MF under five of its schemes—ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund, ICICI Prudential Balanced Fund, ICICI Prudential Banking and Financial Services Fund, ICICI Prudential Focused Bluechip Equity Fund and ICICI Prudential Value Fund Series 19 —applied for and was allotted 123.08 lakh shares at a price of Rs520 apiece, totalling Rs640 crore in the QIB category. 
Out of the application for shares worth Rs640 crore, Rs400 crore was applied on the first day of bidding and Rs240 crore was applied on the last day. 
According to the letter, the decision to revise bids and make additional bids amounting to Rs240 crore on the last day is a clear indication of facilitating subscription in the QIB portion so that the issue does not fail. If the last day subscription by ICICI MF is not considered, the total qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) subscription would have been amounted to 70.11% of the offer size as against the required 75% for the issue to be successful in terms of Sebi’s regulation. 
Further, without the last day subscription by ICICI Prudential MF, ICICI Securities’ IPO would have failed and the fund house has thus facilitated its sponsor ICICI Bank to divest its stake in the brokerage house, the letter said."

501,2018-07-05,ICICI,"We don't have answers to a plethora of questions that arise, because Sebi, in its wisdom, has chosen to give ICICI Mutual Fund merely some 'advice'

Apparently, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has found that ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. (AMC) Ltd bailed out the ICICI Securities Ltd initial public offering (IPO), and short-changed its unitholders in the process.  
Apparently, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has found that ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. (AMC) Ltd bailed out the ICICI Securities Ltd initial public offering (IPO), and short-changed its unitholders in the process. 
The IPO would have devolved if the institutional portion of the IPO book wasn’t fully subscribed. And so, according to a leaked communiqué from Sebi, ICICI’s mutual fund arm put in a last-minute bid of  ₹ 240 crore. It had already bid  ₹ 400 crore on the first day of the book building process, which means its total bids amounted to over 55% of the size of the institutional book. Including the anchor book, the size of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund’s bid was about 22% of the total allotment to institutional investors.
Based on all this, some have concluded that Sebi has an open and shut case. But here is the big problem.
There is no way to confirm any of this because Sebi hasn’t communicated this through an order. It has merely written a letter to ICICI Mutual Fund directing it to return the amount it bid on the last day to the schemes from which the funds came, along with an interest of 15% from the date of allotment of shares. 
The letter, a so-called ‘advice to comply’, was leaked to a few journalists, and the above sequence of events is from news reports that rely on it.
Has ICICI Mutual Fund been given an opportunity to present its version or explain? Has it been told which regulations or rules it has violated? What lessons does the episode hold for other fund houses?
We don’t have answers to a plethora of questions that arise, because Sebi, in its wisdom, has chosen to give ICICI Mutual Fund merely some ‘advice’. 
Mario Puzo’s Godfather famously said, “I’m going to make him an offer he can’t refuse"". Sebi’s ‘advice to comply’ letter almost sounds like “I’m going to give you advice you can’t refuse"".
Mint reported in 2011 that two mutual fund companies were forced to compensate investors, through similar directives.
Thankfully, securities lawyers say ICICI Prudential AMC can make an appeal against the directive with the Securities Appellate Tribunal. Technically, then, it is advice it can refuse.
In fact, this would be the most logical thing to do. To not protest would amount to a tacit admission that it misused funds deposited by its unitholders to bail out a sister company’s IPO, and ultimately its parent company, which raised  ₹ 3,500 crore by selling shares in the IPO.
The day ICICI Prudential AMC received Sebi’s advice, news reports said another fund house, HDFC Mutual Fund, received directions from the regulator asking it to cancel the shares it allotted to certain distributors ahead of its proposed IPO. It wants the fund house to return the money raised from them and pay 12% interest for the period it has access to the funds.
A report by the Press Trust of India states, “According to industry participants, the distributors, who subscribed to the shares of the fund house, may give biased advice because of their equity stake in HDFC Asset Management Company. This has prompted Sebi to ask the fund house to scrap this pre-IPO placement.""
Should we even discuss the merits of this argument without knowing if this is what led to Sebi’s action? That would be naive, to say the least.
It is pitiful that the markets regulator can’t bring itself to provide formal guidance on matters that have implications for a number of market participants. It sends all sorts of worrying signals.
If it indeed found ICICI Mutual Fund to have violated any of its norms, does it not have the resources to go through with a formal investigation before issuing an order? Or does it believe an order would have been challenged, while ‘advice’ will be complied with?
Whatever the reason, it’s safe to say that this behaviour does not behove the premier regulatory body in the country. Also, note that it’s been over 30 years since Sebi came into being, and this column has repeatedly said that Sebi’s main role now is to ensure good enforcement of its various rules and regulations. In this backdrop, this new-found interest in giving advice, as opposed to issuing orders, is troubling."

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s second largest private lender in terms of assets, on Wednesday said it aims to grow the bank’s home loan book to at least  ₹  2 trillion by the end of 2019-20. ICICI Bank achieved a home loan portfolio of around  ₹  1.5 trillion for the first time, making it the largest mortgage lender among private sector banks.
“The total retail loan portfolio is about  ₹  3 trillion, of which home loan book constitutes around 52%,"" Anup Bagchi, executive director of the bank, said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday. “We will grow faster than the industry in this space."" ICICI Bank’s home loan book has been growing at 16-17% over the past year, he said. ICICI Bank is looking to grow faster on the back of increasing demand from customers due to lower interest rates (as compared to November 2016), favourable property prices and improving quality of housing, Bagchi added.
“The growth will mainly come from tier-II, tier-III and tier-IV locations. Today, ICICI Bank operates from 1,500 locations in the country in the home loan space. We will add at least 500 more locations in the coming year,"" he said.
In a bid to digitize the mortgage ecosystem, the bank said it has enabled developers to obtain approvals for their projects in a paperless manner.

500,2018-07-09,ICICI,"Too much familiarity breeds multiple evils, especially of the corporate governance type

Two recent events in the financial sector offer many corporate governance lessons. In one case, the government and its agencies were involved and left behind questionable precedents. In another private sector institution, a former government employee is involved though the manner of his involvement raises questions. These events are juxtaposed with larger societal questions related to saving institutions and jobs and ensuring financial stability. 
Two recent events in the financial sector offer many corporate governance lessons. In one case, the government and its agencies were involved and left behind questionable precedents. In another private sector institution, a former government employee is involved though the manner of his involvement raises questions. These events are juxtaposed with larger societal questions related to saving institutions and jobs and ensuring financial stability.
The first example relates to the government’s decision to sell its stake in IDBI Bank to the Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC). IDBI Bank’s non-performing assets (NPAs) have been mounting, as have been its losses. Its capital adequacy barely meets the regulatory benchmarks. In short, the bank is floundering without a visible lifeline. The government, as the largest shareholder, provided one tranche of capital infusion but clearly that was not enough.
Thereafter, the government was faced with three choices. One, to provide more capital. But the government’s kitty is limited and must deal with competing claims. Two, it could extinguish the legal entity by either merging it with a stronger public sector bank or shutting it down. The former option involves consciously infecting another public sector bank with IDBI’s bugs. Shutting it down, on the other hand, is a political risk in a pre-election year. Three, the government could sell it off, but no private sector bank would want to risk it. The next best solution: force-feed it to another public sector entity which cannot say no to the government.
Enter LIC, the government’s preferred sick bay for ailing public sector banks, especially those which the government does not want to (or cannot) recapitalize, downsize or shut down. The transaction raises multiple questions about acceptable corporate governance norms.
First, how did LIC get the money to pay the government for its stake in IDBI Bank? Any money it pays out has to be from policyholders’ funds, or the premium they pay to the insurance company every so often. Ideally, any excess money belongs to policyholders and must be returned to them after deducting expenses and provisions. This then raises ethical questions: are the funds invested in IDBI Bank sourced from the surplus which should have been returned to policyholders but has now been diverted? Also, theoretically, LIC’s investment in IDBI Bank breaches the investment mandate approved by government and regulator.
The other issue is the regulator’s discretionary powers. The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI) seems to have approved the IDBI-LIC deal in record time. In most other cases, IRDAI takes its time in assessing risks to policyholders and the impact any proposed deal is likely to have on the industry and its stability. The speed at which the IDBI-LIC deal was approved seems to indicate that an inherent hierarchical priority has been superimposed over the regulator’s approval process, which accords undue urgency to deals involving the government. This is a dangerous precedent.
It can be argued that saving the bank is part of the sovereign’s social and moral contract: It is duty-bound to ensure financial stability (which includes safety of depositors’ money), save jobs and make all efforts to ensure asset turnaround. And, the argument goes, the government can circumvent some of the rules for this purpose.
Focusing on asset turnaround is also the philosophical keystone for the current bankruptcy and resolution process. The Committee Report on Resolution of Stressed Assets, or Sashakt, also echoes similar values. If we consider IDBI Bank to be a stressed asset, then its resolution process contradicts some of the committee’s suggestions: transparent market-based solution, free from government intervention, paradigm shift in governance and risk process.
The second example where corporate governance questions arise relate to ICICI Bank and the raging debate over the board’s embarrassing flip-flops. The same board seems to have now waded into deeper, murkier waters in their attempts to ameliorate the early situation.
The board belatedly, and probably under pressure, has agreed to an independent probe into allegations of impropriety by chief executive Chanda Kochhar, who is on leave till the enquiry is complete. Thereafter, the board’s process for selecting a new chief operating officer (COO) designate in Sandeep Bakhshi seemed as arbitrary and opaque. Interestingly, the press release announcing the board’s decision to appoint Bakhshi as COO includes an intriguing statement: “Mr Bakhshi will report to Ms Chanda Kochhar, who will continue in her role as MD & CEO of ICICI Bank...During her period of leave, the COO will report to the Board."" If Bakhshi has to report to Kochhar for the next five years, assuming she gets a clean chit, how much discretion and independence will he exercise now?
That brings us to the new chairman. Former bureaucrat Girish Chaturvedi has been appointed as the new chairman though it is unclear how the selection was made. Was there any government intervention? The ICICI Bank board is yet to share the processes it adopted for selecting Chaturvedi. There are also news reports of Chaturvedi and Bakshi having interacted earlier—as insurance secretary and chief executive officer (CEO) of ICICI Lombard, respectively. While it is good for any company to have the CEO and chairman acting in harmony, it is also true that too much familiarity breeds multiple evils, especially of the corporate governance type.

499,2018-07-11,ICICI,"ICICI Securities estimates domestic apparel companies such as Arvind Ltd, Page Industries Ltd, and Rupa and Co. Ltd to register double-digit revenue growth in the June quarter over a year ago

The current market price of cotton is already higher than the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government. Therefore, the hike in MSP may not have much of an impact immediately for cotton farmers. But the government-determined rate can emerge as a floor price, if the MSP mechanism is implemented well. This may drive up costs of textile and apparel makers over a longer period. 
The current market price of cotton is already higher than the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government. Therefore, the hike in MSP may not have much of an impact immediately for cotton farmers. But the government-determined rate can emerge as a floor price, if the MSP mechanism is implemented well. This may drive up costs of textile and apparel makers over a longer period.
Ratings agency Icra Ltd warns that elevated cotton prices can drive up working capital requirements of textile companies and will “warrant a sustained calibration in pricing for end products"".
This can worsen the scenario for textile exporters, who are on the back foot due to rationalization of export incentives, slow tax refunds under the goods and services tax (GST), and churn in the US, a large market for home textile exporters.
Home textile companies have sufficient cotton inventory till October, providing a cushion from the price increase, points out JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. But high prices in the coming season can be a headwind given that US exports are already facing pricing and demand pressures. “Marketplace disruption (online vs. offline) and high cotton prices remain key concerns,"" JM Financial said in a note last month.
But everybody is not as precariously placed. Apparel companies in India are on the recovery path, thanks to stabilization of trade channels post- GST-related disruption, ICICI Securities Ltd said in a note. The companies also have high cotton inventories, which should aid profitability in the near term, added the brokerage firm. If the recovery in their business continues, then they will be in a better position to pass on higher costs once they begin to buy raw material at higher rates.
ICICI Securities estimates domestic apparel companies such as Arvind Ltd, Page Industries Ltd, and Rupa and Co. Ltd to register double-digit revenue growth in the June quarter over a year ago. A favourable base is expected to aid Rupa and Co., while Arvind is expected to benefit from healthy growth in brands and retail segment.
On this front, the situation is not very encouraging for home textile exporters. Data from JM Financial and ICICI Securities shows a softening of textile exports to the US in January-April this year. The June quarter results should reflect this. Analysts’ estimates of revenue growth for home textile companies are not yet available.
Of course, both businesses—domestic apparel and textile exporters—have different dynamics. The domestic apparel sector is returning to normalcy after GST disruption. Also, home textile exporters do have a silver lining in the depreciating rupee acting as a cushion against rising cost pressures.
Even so, in a rising raw material-cost environment, sustained demand recovery is crucial to pass on the costs. Companies with more exposure to the domestic market are better placed now. How strong or durable the recovery will be is the question. The June quarter results and management commentary should provide some clarity."

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd is preparing to submit details of at least 1,000 loan accounts that turned sour since April 2010 to an independent panel, as part of a board-instituted probe into alleged wrongdoings by the lender’s top executives, including its off-duty CEO Chanda Kochhar, two people aware of the development said. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd is preparing to submit details of at least 1,000 loan accounts that turned sour since April 2010 to an independent panel, as part of a board-instituted probe into alleged wrongdoings by the lender’s top executives, including its off-duty CEO Chanda Kochhar, two people aware of the development said.
The panel, headed by former Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna, has started investigating, among other issues, three of the most serious allegations made by a whistleblower—impropriety in lending decisions; conflict of interest in loans made to business groups; and that Kochhar favoured certain borrowers. 
“Since 26 June, ICICI Bank’s central risk management department has started gathering details of non-retail loan accounts that turned NPAs (non-performing assets) since fiscal 2010, which are suspected to involve potential breach of banking norms or code-of-conduct by the bank and its top management or key vertical heads,"" said one of the two people on condition of anonymity. 
Mint has also reviewed copies of the communication between the bank’s risk management department and loan departments, which indicate that the loan divisions have been asked to furnish details of loans that have turned bad since 2010. 
The findings of the Srikrishna panel will decide the fate of Kochhar, who is now on indefinite leave pending the completion of the investigation. Kochhar, who became the bank’s CEO on 1 May 2009, will have to resign if the panel finds that the whistleblower’s allegations are true. 
The bank allegedly delayed impairment in 31 loan accounts between fiscal 2008 and March 2016 to save on provisioning costs and inflate profits by a total of $1.3 billion in a span of eight years, Mint reported on 25 June, citing the whistleblower’s complaint. The bank also delayed provisioning by a quarter to as long as five years for 31 loan accounts worth at least $3 billion, according to the complaint.
ICICI Bank denied that the lender’s risk management department has sought details of the loan accounts. 
“The risk management department of the bank has not sought details of loan accounts, as mentioned in your e-mail. We would like to inform you that this does not fall under the scope of the Justice Srikrishna enquiry,"" said an ICICI Bank spokesperson.
ICICI Bank on 29 May decided to institute a probe by an independent panel to verify the charges made by the whistleblower. The Srikrishna panel’s investigation runs parallel to probes by government authorities into an alleged nexus between Videocon Group and Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
The whistleblower has also alleged that ICICI Bank’s top executives, including CEO Kochhar and executive director Vijay Chandok, wilfully breached rules to avoid classifying the loans as bad.
“The Srikrishna committee will verify the whistleblower charges by comparing the disclosures made by the bank, its board, audit committee, compliance division and so on,"" the second person said, also requesting anonymity.
In response to a query by Mint on 24 June, ICICI Bank admitted that in certain accounts, transactions were observed that may have delayed the classification of the account as non-performing under Indian GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) in earlier years.
The panel’s probe will also examine the whistleblower’s allegations that top executives wilfully breached rules.
“There have been several meetings held at the bank by the senior management to discuss the modus operandi of trying to save certain loan assets in other countries by funding a group company in India. The bank’s discussions in such cases indicate the involvement of Chanda Kochhar in negotiations with the client,"" reads the whistleblower’s letter.
Following the whistleblower’s complaint, RBI began a second probe into the dealings of the bank during Kochhar’s tenure, according to a 26 June Mint report. The RBI probe began on 25 March with a list of at least 26 of the 31 loan accounts named in the whistleblower’s complaints. However, following ICICI Bank’s response to its first set of queries on 11 April, the banking regulator decided to expand its probe to 55 of ICICI Bank’s borrowers. ICICI Bank said, “RBI in the normal course of its supervisory activities seeks information from the bank from time to time.""
The 55 loan accounts being probed by RBI include Essar Global Ltd, Essar Power Ltd, Assam Oil Co. Ltd, Bhushan Steel Ltd, Essar Steel India Ltd, Videocon Oil Ventures Ltd, Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd, ABG Shipyard Ltd, IVRCL Ltd, Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd, Bhushan Energy Ltd and Gammon India Ltd.

New Delhi: ICICI Bank, the lead financial creditor for Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to consider JAL and its subsidiary Jaypee Intratech Ltd (JIL) as two separate entities in the ongoing legal battle with homebuyers and creditor banks.  
New Delhi: ICICI Bank, the lead financial creditor for Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL), on Tuesday urged the Supreme Court to consider JAL and its subsidiary Jaypee Intratech Ltd (JIL) as two separate entities in the ongoing legal battle with homebuyers and creditor banks. 
If JAL is made to honour the debt of its subsidiary, there would be an adverse impact on the “complex contractual"" obligations of JAL, ICICI Bank said. It further said that restructuring was the best possible option for JAL to manage its debt.
“JAL and JIL ought to be treated as distinct entities. JAL has to honour its own debt and not JIL’s...Let the statutory authorities consider what they are meant to consider,"" said the counsel appearing for ICICI Bank.
JAL has submitted a master-restructuring agreement (MRA), which has been approved by more than 30 banks, before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Allahabad bench, and is awaiting the Supreme Court’s direction to the tribunal to consider the MRA. 
Meanwhile, the counsel appearing for one of the homebuyers told the Supreme Court on Tuesday that JAL had no “financial credibility"" or “financial capacity"" to honour the debt of JIL. He further sought reconstitution of the committee of creditors and invitation of fresh bids for JIL to revive the company and avoid liquidation.
Additional solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India, submitted that according to the new amendment to the insolvency code, homebuyers qualified as financial creditors and could be a part of the committee of creditors for evaluation of the submitted resolution plans. 
JIL features in the Reserve Bank of India’s first list of non-performing assets accounts and has debt exposure of over  ₹ 9,783 crore in September 2017. IDBI Bank’s insolvency plea against JIL was admitted by NCLT in August 2017. The corporate insolvency resolution period for JIL expired unsuccessfully in May this year. 
The parent company, JAL owes more than  ₹ 29,000 crore to various banks. 
The two debt-ridden companies are also embroiled in a litigation with several homebuyers over delay in completion of its housing projects. 
The Supreme Court on 16 May had directed JAL to deposit  ₹ 1,000 crore with its registry by 15 June to avert liquidation of JIL.
On an earlier occasion, the court directed JAL to deposit  ₹ 2,000 crore to protect the interest of homebuyers. Out of this, only  ₹ 750 crore has been deposited so far.
The matter would be next heard on Wednesday."
495,2018-07-17,ICICI,"The media reports say law firm Panag & Babu has been roped in by the  ICICI Bank audit committee to look into the bad loans

New Delhi: The independent audit committee investigating alleged irregularities in 31 bad loan accounts of ICICI Bank has hired a law firm to assist the panel.  
New Delhi: The independent audit committee investigating alleged irregularities in 31 bad loan accounts of ICICI Bank has hired a law firm to assist the panel. 
""An independent law firm has been appointed by the audit committee,"" a bank executive said today. He said as the audit committee comprises the bank's independent directors, the bank is not aware of the name of the law firm hired. 
According to reports, law firm Panag & Babu has been roped in by the audit committee. When contacted, the firm's spokesperson declined to comment. 
ICICI Bank said in June that it had received an anonymous complaint which alleged irregularities with respect to 31 borrower accounts, leading to incorrect asset classification. 
The audit committee of the board of directors of the bank has three members chaired by Uday Chitale, Dileep Choksi (alternate chairperson) and Radhakrishnan Nair. 
""Further actions in this matter are being/will be taken as directed by the Audit Committee,"" the bank had said in a stock exchange filing in June. 
All the 31 accounts were classified as non-performing between 2011-12 and 2016-17. ICICI Bank's aggregate loans outstanding on 31 March 2018 were  ₹ 6,082 crore ($898 million), about 1.1% of gross loans.

492,2018-07-18,ICICI,"Most analysts have a buy rating on ICICI Lombard's stock given the improving profitability metrics

If the first quarter metrics of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd are anything to go by, the general insurer could see another year of strengthening profitability, something that prompted investors to send the stock up over 3%. 
If the first quarter metrics of ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd are anything to go by, the general insurer could see another year of strengthening profitability, something that prompted investors to send the stock up over 3%.
The largest private sector general insurer reported a reduction in its combined ratio to 98.8% for the quarter ended June from 102.4% a year ago. What this means is that the insurer’s losses and expenses as a percentage of the premiums it earned have come down and it has begun creating value through its underwriting business.
Indeed, its expenses have shown a reduction as is reflected by the drop in management expenses to 18.9% from 22% a year back. The loss ratio, which is the difference between claims paid and premium earned, too has dropped to 76.9% from 78.1%.
The insurer has achieved this partly by avoiding underwriting risks that were not priced appropriately. A case in point is the 12% growth in crop insurance, which is a far cry from the industry growth of 73%. Recall that the insurer’s loss ratio for this segment had surged to 135% in the previous year due to an underwriting loss of  ₹ 700 crore.
Even motor insurance, which has a large share in the company’s portfolio, grew at a modest pace of 6.8% in terms of gross direct premium. The total gross direct premium income growth was therefore lower at 13.7% from 15% a year ago.
Interestingly, the insurer has seen lower growth in government-linked business too, specifically the mass health segment, apart from crop insurance. The share of mass health insurance in total gross direct premium income for the health insurance segment fell to just 2% from 3.6% a year ago.
Nevertheless, a slowdown in growth is expected as typically the first quarter is considered a lean season for general insurers. For the full year, the management expects a growth rate of 15-20%. 
Although the ICICI Lombard stock is down over 2% in the last three months, it trades at a multiple of 5.3 its estimated book value for fiscal year 2020. Most analysts have a buy rating on the stock given the improving profitability metrics."

488,2018-07-27,ICICI,"The shares of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance has underperformed in the last two months despite its strong profitability in FY18 as the parent's controversies cast a shadow

At first glance, the growth story of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd seems to show its first crack, because of a sharp fall in the annualized premium equivalent (APE) for the first quarter of 2018-19. 
At first glance, the growth story of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd seems to show its first crack, because of a sharp fall in the annualized premium equivalent (APE) for the first quarter of 2018-19.
The second largest private sector life insurer’s savings products had few takers in the first quarter, with APE falling 21.2% to  ₹ 1,282 crore. This dampened the growth in total premium to just 13%. Put this together with an increase in cost ratios and the picture doesn’t look good. Perhaps investors had anticipated that the insurer’s past rapid growth won’t be repeated, as the stock has dropped 12% over the last two months.
The retail weighted received premium, or the total premium collected through retail policies, fell 21.6%, which means that ICICI Prudential couldn’t sell its savings products to customers as fast as it used to in the past. Hence, it lost market share to competitors—its share eroded to 12.3% from 15.3% a year ago.
But this drop in business growth metric should not perturb investors at all. The fall in APE in the quarter is due to a base effect as in the corresponding quarter last year, the insurer had reported a stellar 68% growth. Not just ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, but most insurers had reported a sharp jump during that time as demonetization channelled huge investments into insurance products.
The management said the momentum in retail weighted received premium continues to be strong and it expects the growth rate to continue in the coming quarters. “To look at the momentum excluding the demonetization effect, we should look at the growth for three years and it works out to a CAGR of 17% growth for the first quarters,"" said N.S. Kannan, managing director and chief executive officer.
Another factor that would please investors is the sharp jump in its protection business. Protection products are margin-friendly and are the most profitable for an insurer. These products now form over 8% of ICICI Prudential’s portfolio, up from 5% a year ago. Value for new business grew at a healthy 34.1% and margins expanded to 17.5% because of the increase in the protection business.
The management stressed its focus on growing the protection business faster than that of savings and this augurs well for future profitability. Its improving persistency ratios across tenures should also give comfort.
Kotak Securities estimates the insurer’s embedded value for FY19 to be  ₹ 21,400 crore. Considering the stock trades at about 2.5 times of this estimate, it is cheaper than immediate rivals SBI Life Insurance Co Ltd and HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd."

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s largest private sector lender by assets, on Friday reported a net loss of  ₹ 120 crore on a stand-alone basis for the June quarter, on account of rising bad loans and treasury losses.  
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd, India’s largest private sector lender by assets, on Friday reported a net loss of  ₹ 120 crore on a stand-alone basis for the June quarter, on account of rising bad loans and treasury losses. 
The bank had reported a profit of  ₹ 2,049 crore in the year-ago period. This is the first time that the bank has reported losses from its India operations.
According to ICICI Bank, it had taken a mark-to-market hit of  ₹ 218 crore on its investments in government securities during the quarter, besides setting aside higher provisions against stressed accounts referred to the National Company Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings.
The bank provided an additional amount of  ₹ 706 crore against the secured portion of stressed accounts. Separately, it had taken a hit of  ₹ 247 crore on a few fraud accounts, which was earlier debited from the reserves. 
Its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) rose to  ₹ 53,464 crore as on 30 June, compared with  ₹ 43,147 crore in the year-ago quarter. Gross NPAs, as a percentage of total advances, were at 8.81% in the June quarter compared to 7.99% in corresponding period of last year. Fresh loan slippages stood at  ₹ 4,036 crore, the lowest in the last 11 quarters, compared with  ₹ 15,737 crore in the previous quarter. A Bloomberg poll of 17 analysts had expected the bank to post a profit of  ₹ 1,459 crore in the first quarter. In a call with analysts, the management said fresh slippages will continue to be lower this year. However, the bank expects a further hit on its profit and loss account due to higher provisions."
484,2018-07-28,ICICI,"Loss due to ICICI Bank's decision to jack up provisioning coverage ratio for its bad loans

Mumbai: India’s second largest private sector lender by assets ICICI Bank Ltd reported a historic loss for the June quarter, a period considered to be the cusp of a long recovery road. 
Mumbai: India’s second largest private sector lender by assets ICICI Bank Ltd reported a historic loss for the June quarter, a period considered to be the cusp of a long recovery road.
Investors should have seen this coming, especially after another private sector corporate lender Axis Bank Ltd slipped into the red just a quarter earlier. Corporate lenders irrespective of ownership have exposure to a similar set of large stressed firms and most of these are courting insolvency proceedings.
Instead, ICICI Bank’s stock surged nearly 10% this week anticipating results in line with expectations, if not better. Hopes were bolstered after public sector lender Canara Bank reported stellar recovery numbers.
What led to the historic loss was the lender’s decision to jack up its provisioning coverage ratio for its exposure to the bad loans under insolvency proceedings. The bank has a cumulative exposure of  ₹ 14,306 crore to the 40-odd accounts that were named by the Reserve Bank of India for insolvency proceedings in two lists. ICICI Bank had provided around 50% for these accounts as of March.
But in the June quarter, the lender set aside  ₹ 707 crore to increase this coverage to 88% for the first list of 12 accounts and 61% for the second list of 28. While this looks very prudent, it is also an ominous sign for expected recoveries. The big question is whether ICICI Bank expects huge haircuts and is hence insuring itself through provisioning. The delays in resolution due to litigation at the insolvency courts have made banks jittery in terms of prospective recoveries from bad loans. 
The provisioning pain on bad loans was expected as these were already recognized as bad karma for every bank, ICICI Bank not being an exception. Another set of bad karma, wherein lenders cannot be the sole accused, is fraudulent accounts unearthed recently. ICICI Bank had to provide a total  ₹ 241 crore for such accounts in the gems and jewellery sector. It also had to provide for fresh slippages totalling  ₹ 4,036 crore and another  ₹ 219 crore towards calls on bond portfolio gone wrong. Together, these provisions carved out  ₹ 5,971 crore from an already declining operating profit to result in the quarterly loss.
But there is a bigger worry, one that could niggle at investors more now. Juxtapose the sudden rise in provisioning with the management change at the bank amid a controversy surrounding the bank’s head Chanda Kochhar and it lends credence to the accusations of lax corporate governance. At last count, the bank was facing enquiries from multiple agencies including the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Even as the threat of a class action suit looks real, investors will need to ask tough questions on the lender’s valuation now. Its core performance is not holding up relative to peers and reasons to hold on to the buy rating are dwindling by the day even though the stock trades at a modest multiple of 1.55 times its estimated book value for FY20.

According to Mint, the six-member monetary policy committee voted to keep its policy stance neutral, thus keeping the door open for future rate hikes. RBI also raised the average inflation projection for the second half of the year to 4.8% from 4.7% in June. The central bank expects inflation to edge higher to 5% in the first quarter of next fiscal year.
The monetary policy statement also cited the MSP hike for kharif crops as the primary factor stoking inflation this year. The government has fixed the MSP at 150% of the cost of production of all kharif crops.
According to a Mint poll of economists, a rate hike was expected in the monetary policy today.
Earlier Suvodeep Rakshit, senior economist with Kotak Institutional Equities, said: “We pencil in a repo rate of 25 bps in the August policy. Even as we call for a rate hike, the RBI may pause mainly to wait-and-watch if MSP hikes start to percolate to food prices and how inflationary expectations have evolved over the last quarter.""
Crude oil prices have declined from $75.3 per barrel to $74.2 per barrel from the last monetary policy in June. An agreement between OPEC members to increase oil production, concerns over global demand amid worsening global trade relations and increased production in the US have led to a decline in oil prices.

New Delhi: ICICI Bank on Wednesday said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has approved the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as the chief operating officer (COO) with effect from 31 July 2018 for three years. 
“We wish to inform you that RBI vide its letter... dated 31 July 2018 has approved the appointment of Sandeep Bakhshi as wholetime director designated as chief operating officer (COO) of the bank effective 31 July 2018 till 30 July 2021. 
Earlier on 18 June, the bank had informed about the appointment of Bakhshi as wholetime director and COO with effect from 19 June 2018 or the date of receipt of RBI approval, whichever was later. “We affirm that Sandeep Bakhshi is not debarred from holding the office of director by virtue of any order of Sebi or any other such authority,"" ICICI Bank said in a regulatory filing. 
CEO Chanda Kochhar will be on leave till completion of the external enquiry against her in the Videocon loan matter and named Sandeep Bakhshi as chief operating officer, who would be handling all the businesses, ICICI Bank had said in June. 
Bakhshi, before this, was the MD and CEO of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. He reports to Kochhar, who is continuing in her role as MD and CEO of ICICI Bank and is on a leave pending probe into the alleged conflict of interest in giving loans to few corporate houses. 
In May, ICICI Bank had announced an independent enquiry into the allegations against Kochhar following a complaint from a whistle-blower."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of the current FD rates from some popular banks for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

Mumbai/Delhi: ICICI Bank Ltd is yet to reply to a notice by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) seeking clarifications on the disclosure of price-sensitive information, the bank said in a filing made to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday.
The markets regulator is investigating whether ICICI Bank and its chief executive officer, Chanda Kochhar, had failed to make adequate disclosures to the bank’s board about her husband Deepak Kochhar’s partnership in NuPower Renewables, when the bank had sanctioned loans to companies controlled by Venugopal Dhoot, the owner of Videocon group, and a founding partner of NuPower.
“SEBI issued a show-cause notice to Ms. Kochhar and to the bank in May 2018 related to the allegations. The bank is in the process of responding to the relevant allegations in the notice which pertain to the bank,"" it said in the filing to the US Sec. 
ICICI Bank also admitted for the first time that CBI had initiated a preliminary enquiry against various individuals and firms including officials of the bank, according to bank’s annual filing, the 20-F document, made to the US SEC. The bank, however, did not reveal the names of the executives or the charges levelled against them.
On 23 May, Sebi had sent a 12-page notice to the bank and Kochhar, alleging violation of listing obligation and disclosure requirements (LODR).
Kochhar decided to go on an indefinite leave on 19 June, with the bank appointing ICICI Prudential Life Insurance CEO Sandeep Bakhshi as whole-time director and chief operating officer (COO), creating a new top position and entrusting him to steer the bank’s business.
The bank made the changes at the top management after the board decided to set up a panel under justice B.N. Srikrishna to investigate alleged conflict of interest and quid pro quo against Kochhar in the Videocon loan case. The Srikrishna panel is being assisted by law firm Luthra and Luthra.
In a separate development, law firm Panag and Babu is looking into yet another whistleblower complaint alleging that the bank had inflated profits by at least $1.3 billion over eight years, by delaying provisioning for bad loans. The complainant also said that the top executives, including Kochhar and executive director Vijay Chandok, wilfully breached rules to avoid classifying the loans as bad.
In its notice to shareholders ahead of its annual general meeting on 12 September, ICICI Bank had said that Bakhshi’s monthly salary for the current financial year was  ₹ 4.81 crore, including supplementary allowances. In comparison, Kochhar’s monthly remuneration in FY18 was  ₹ 6.4 crore, while in the previous fiscal year it was  ₹  5.6 crore."

Earlier on 7 August, Mint reported that ICICI Bank management wrote off unsecured portions of doubtful corporate loans totalling  ₹ 5,000-5,600 crore for fiscal year 2016-17, according to a note Chanda Kochhar sent to the bank’s board in early April.
The change in accounting policy that enabled these “technical write-offs"" was cleared by the bank’s board only in the new financial year, and never communicated to shareholders, as required by banking and market regulators. Thanks, in part, to the changed policy, ICICI Bank managed to keep its 2016-17 bad loan ratios low, the Mint report added.
“The bank classifies loans as non-performing (sub-standard/ doubtful/ loss) and makes provisions for them as per RBI guidelines. Write-offs are generally made out of existing provisions against existing NPAs. The write-offs do not impact loan classification, additions to NPAs, the profit & loss account or the net NPA ratio of the Bank"", the bank said in a clarification to exchanges.
‘The Significant Accounting Policies, which are part of the audited financial statements in the Annual Report of the Bank, have always mentioned that ‘Loss assets and the unsecured portion of doubtful assets are provided/written-off as per the extant RBI guidelines’ (for fiscal 2016, the disclosure has been made on page 137 and for fiscal 2017, the disclosure has been made on page 146 of respective Annual Reports). Detailed disclosures on write-offs are made in the financial statements (for fiscal 2017, the disclosures have been made in Note 18 on pages 170-171 of the annual report). Further, the Bank has also made disclosures regarding write-off amounts in the Management’s Discussion & Analysis, investor presentation and analyst call. The Bank has also disclosed the provision coverage ratio both including and excluding prudential/ technical write-offs"", the clarification added.
ICICI Bank is facing series of probe after, the Central Bur­eau of Investigation registered a preliminary enquiry against Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak and businessman Venugopal Dhoot to verify alleged conflict of interest in a Rs3,250 crore loan made by ICICI Bank to Dhoot’s Videocon group. ICICI Bank had extended the loan as part of a Rs40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012.
Securities Exchange Board of India also asked ICICI Bank to clarify on reports of this alleged corporate governance breach. The tax department had in April issued notices to Deepak Kochhar to look into the flow of about  ₹ 325 crore from two Mauritius-based firms to NuPower Renewables, which he once co-owned with Dhoot.
Following which in May the board instituted a fresh inquiry into the allegations and asked its chief executive Chanda Kocchar to go on indefinite leave till probe is over. The bank announced retired supreme court judge BN Srikrishna would head the inquiry and appointed Sandeep Bakhshi as the chief operating officer for a five year term.
On 27 July, the lender reported loss for the first time ever to   ₹  120 crore from a profit of   ₹  2049 crore on account of rising bad loans and treasury losses.

Srikrishna to probe allegations against ICICI Bank managing director and chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar is expected to submit its report in the next two-and-a-half months, the bank’s non-executive chairman, G.C. Chaturvedi said on Thursday. 
Kochhar’s continuation at ICICI Bank depends on the findings of the panel.
A final decision on Kochhar’s fate will be taken after receiving the panel’s report and she continues to be the bank’s managing director and CEO, Chaturvedi said on the sidelines of the India Banking Conclave. 
ICICI Bank had appointed Srikrishna to investigate allegations of conflict of interest and quid pro quo against Kochhar in the Videocon loan case. 
Chaturvedi said the bank will reply to the Videocon notice by capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) only after receiving the panel’s report. 
Chaturvedi, a retired bureaucrat, took over as the chairman in June after M.K. Sharma’s tenure ended.
Sebi had initiated proceedings against ICICI Bank for non-disclosure of information in the alleged conflict of interest in the grant of loans to the Videocon Group. 
Sebi had sent the bank and Kochhar a notice alleging violation of Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirements (LODR) and for not making adequate disclosures. 
Kochhar had proceeded on leave till the completion of the investigation. The bank had appointed Sandeep Bakhshi, the head of its life insurance arm, as chief operating officer of the bank. Bakhshi will run the bank and report to the board while Kochhar remains on leave. 
The controversy pertains to the alleged conflict of interest in a  ₹ 3,250 crore loan given by ICICI Bank to Videocon Group. The money was part of a  ₹ 40,000 crore loan given by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012.
Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot allegedly gave  ₹ 64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables, which he set up with Kochhar’s husband, Deepak Kochhar, and two of his kin. Dhoot allegedly transferred proprietorship of the firm to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for  ₹ 9 lakh, six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank.
The Srikrishna panel, has started investigating, among other issues, three of the most serious allegations made by a whistleblower—impropriety in lending decisions, conflict of interest in loans made to business groups, and that Kochhar favoured certain borrowers.

Once users holding accounts with these banks accept the bank’s terms, the money will be transferred to their accounts.
“We have learnt that when we build for India, we build for the world, and we believe that many of the innovations and features we have pioneered with Tez will work globally,"" Caesar Sengupta said.
Google Tez, which was launched in September, will also expand services for merchants and retailers. About 15,000 retail stores in India will have Google Pay enabled by Diwali 2018, Caesar Sengupta said.
Google claims that over 1.2 million small businesses in India are already using Google Pay. In a bid to help their business grow further, Google is building a dedicated merchant experience where they will be discovered through Google Search and Maps, and communicate with their customers through messages and offers.
“We are testing these features with merchants in Bangalore and Delhi, and on-boarding more neighbourhoods in the following months,"" said Sengupta.
Google Pay has rivals in Paytm and Facebook Inc.’s WhatsApp targeting the Indian payments market. On Tuesday, Mint reported that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has sealed a deal with Paytm, marking the legendary investor’s first investment in the country. A string of other big-name players are also expanding in India’s digital payments market including its banks, India Post Payments Bank, and Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio.
“The real competition is actually user habits and cash,"" said Sengupta. “So, all of us (referring to the other players) are all in many ways brothers-in-arms who are trying to move people’s habits away from cash to digital so that we can move India to a digital economy. At Google, we focus on the users so we don’t think so much of the competition.""
Since its launch, over 55 million people have downloaded Google Tez and more than 22 million people and businesses actively use the app for digital transactions every month, according to company data and figures quoted by Sengupta. Collectively, they have made more than 750 million transactions, with an annual run rate of over $30 billion.
The search giant also announced other initiatives including expanding its Google Station internet access programme to 12,000 villages and cities across Andhra Pradesh, potentially reaching 10 million people; the launch of Project Navlekha, where Google will work with Indian publishers to bring more relevant content online; and a new feature in Google Go app that can pull up any webpage and let users listen to it with each word lighting up as it is read."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.

For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

Some other top officials of the bank, as also from Videocon Industries Ltd—which allegedly benefitted due to its association with Deepak Kochhar—are also likely to be called for personal hearings. 
New Delhi: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) may soon summon ICICI Bank Ltd’s on-leave CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar as part of an investigation into alleged regulatory lapses with regard to his business dealings, officials said today. Some other top officials of the bank, as also from Videocon Industries Ltd—which allegedly benefitted due to its association with Deepak Kochhar—are also likely to be called for personal hearings.
According to top officials, the multi-agency probe into ICICI Bank and business dealings of Kochhar family will also be discussed by the Sebi board next week. Coordinated efforts are required to be taken by Sebi, the Reserve Bank of India and the government in the Videocon loan case due to ICICI Bank’s systemic importance in the Indian banking.
ICICI Bank and Chanda Kochhar have been maintaining there has been no regulatory violation on their part and that she was not aware of specific business dealings of her husband.
Sebi had earlier issued showcause notices to ICICI Bank Ltd, Chanda Kochhar and others after its preliminary examination favoured initiating adjudication proceedings against them for alleged violation of listing disclosure norms regarding “conflict of interest"" in business dealings of Deepak Kochhar with the Videocon Group.
Chanda Kochhar is believed to have maintained that she had no information about her husband’s business dealings; the bank has given similar replies.
Sebi, however, is of the view that Chanda Kochhar and ICICI Bank cannot feign ignorance in this matter as they have been regularly listing Deepak Kochhar as a “related party"" in the regulatory filings of the company, including in the latest annual filing submitted to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which is also probing the case, officials said. ICICI Bank has maintained the same stance in its submissions to the US SEC as well, officials added.

Sebi may soon issue summons for personal hearings of the Kochhars and others over the next few weeks, they said.
ICICI Bank may face a penalty of up to  ₹  25 crore under the relevant Sebi regulations for such lapses, while Chanda Kochhar may be fined up to  ₹  10 crore, besides other penal actions, a senior official said.
The ICICI Bank board has also constituted an “independent enquiry"" and Chanda Kochhar has gone on leave till completion of this enquiry. While Chanda Kochhar remains MD and CEO, the group’s life insurance business head Sandeep Bakhshi has been appointed as a whole-time director and COO to handle day-to-day operations of the bank. Bakhshi reports to Kochhar officially.
The bank has maintained that its board has full faith in Chanda Kochhar.
According to Sebi’s preliminary investigations, Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar has had many business dealings with Videocon Group over the last several years. Deepak Kochhar and Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot were co-founders and promoters of NuPower Renewables, besides other associations.

New Delhi/Mumbai: BSE, PTC India Ltd and ICICI Bank have come together to form India’s third electricity exchange, BSE said on Monday. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: BSE, PTC India Ltd and ICICI Bank have come together to form India’s third electricity exchange, BSE said on Monday.
A power exchange functions on the lines of commodity exchanges and provides a platform for buyers, sellers and traders of electricity to enter into spot contracts that are for the same day, next day, and on a weekly basis. It also provides a payment security mechanism to buyers and sellers. India has two operating power exchanges—Power Exchange of India (PXIL) and India Energy Exchange (IEX). 
“BSE, along with PTC India Limited and ICICI Bank Limited, have filed a petition with the power market regulator, CERC (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission) on 7 September 2018 for grant of licence for setting up a new power exchange,"" BSE said.
The petition has been filed against the backdrop of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government readying a raft of structural reforms in the power sector, including freeing green energy from licensing requirement for generation and supply and promoting retail competition, according to the proposed draft amendments in the Electricity Act, 2003.
Of around 1,200 billion units (bu) of electricity generated in India, the short-term market accounts for around 130-150bu. This trade volume has grown by around 10% annually and is valued at around  ₹ 22,124 crore. 
“This proposed institutional exchange, subject to necessary regulatory approvals, would leverage on the experience and expertise of its stakeholders in their fields, knowledge of the power sector, funding of power projects and associated infrastructure, setting up and running various exchanges and platforms in India, and offer the market participants a credible power trading platform,"" BSE said.
India’s power demand is expected to grow with the government’s focus of providing “24x7 clean and affordable power for all"" by March 2019.
 “PTC is committed to any initiative that supports the development of the power market in the country. This partnership with India’s oldest exchange, BSE, is in an effort in the same direction,"" said Deepak Amitabh, chairman and managing director, PTC India.
The government has also been exploring steps to boost electricity demand, even as the power sector remains one of the highly stressed sectors, with close to  ₹ 1 trillion of loans having turned bad or recast. 
Distribution companies have so far been the weakest link in the electricity value chain given their poor payment records.
The government is working on an ambitious plan to provide induction stoves to poor households. Also, the  ₹ 16,320 crore Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (Saubhagya), launched last year to provide electricity connections to more than 40 million families by December 2018, will require an additional 28,000MW of power, considering an average load of 1 kilowatt (kW) per household for eight hours in a day.
Experts believe that there is a need to be met.
“There is a need to deepen existing exchanges through more evolved products, clarity on cross border trading along with institutional mechanisms to deal with forward contracts of varying durations would be useful,"" said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner (advisory, power and utilities), PwC India."

Deepak Kochhar is the founder and CEO of NuPower Group, as per its website. 
Alleged lapses involving ICICI Bank’s MD and CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband and other family members, with respect to a loan extended to Videocon Industries by the lender have come under the regulatory lens.
NuPower Renewables and NuPower Wind Farms are among the six companies whose books are being inspected by the ministry.
On 23 April, the ministry ordered an inspection of “books and papers"" of six companies linked to the ICICI Bank loan controversy. They are NuPower Renewables Pvt Ltd, Supreme Energy Pvt Ltd, Pacific Capital Services Pvt Ltd, Videocon Industries Ltd, NuPower Wind Farms Ltd and EchandaUrja Pvt Ltd.
A senior ministry official said that Deepak Kochhar has been summoned later this month for questioning in connection with the case. However, specific details could not be immediately ascertained.
The inspection is being carried out by the office of the Regional Director (Western Region) under the ministry. It was ordered under Section 206(5) of the Companies Act. Section 206 provides powers to call for information, inspect books and conduct inquiries.
According to Section 206 (5), the central government may, if it is satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, direct inspection of books and papers of a company by an inspector appointed by it for the purpose.

Mumbai: Irked with ICICI Bank Ltd’s handling of the controversies surrounding CEO Chanda Kochhar, shareholders on Wednesday were scathing in their remarks on governance standards during the bank’s 24th annual general meeting. 
Mumbai: Irked with ICICI Bank Ltd’s handling of the controversies surrounding CEO Chanda Kochhar, shareholders on Wednesday were scathing in their remarks on governance standards during the bank’s 24th annual general meeting.
Despite the ICICI Bank board requesting shareholders to refrain from asking any question related to Kochhar who is on a leave of absence, the shareholders asked uncomfortable questions and demanded more clarifications from the bank’s directors, two people directly aware of the developments said.
Chanda Kochhar, along with a few other directors, were not present at the 24th AGM held at Vadodara, Gujarat. 
“The directors told shareholders that since an independent probe under retired Supreme Court justice B.N. Srikrishna with regards to allegations against Kochhar was on, the shareholders should not expect the board to answer any question related to her,"" said the first person mentioned above, requesting anonymity.
This did not satisfy shareholders. “The shareholders asked whether the board was aware of the loan facilities given to Videocon Industries Ltd and Kochhar’s husband’s connection with the promoter of Videocon Group. They asked why the board did not disclose this information to the shareholders, if they were aware of such a conflict of interest,"" he added.
Displaying their dissatisfaction with the way the board dealt with the allegations of conflict of interest and quid pro quo against Kochhar, some shareholders also asked the board why it did not launch an independent inquiry before the whistleblower complaints were filed with the bank and the regulators, he added.
They also asked why the board under former chairman M.K. Sharma chose to hastily give a clean chit to Kochhar at the time of announcing the annual financial results of 2017-18, despite the CEO facing serious allegations, and the bank being under investigation by multiple authorities, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and Securities and Exchange Commission.
“Without even considering to initiate an independent probe, the board let her escape at the time of announcing the financial results. The shareholders asked, what took the board so long to decide to launch an independent probe, and why did it choose to hide the details of the probe by RBI in 2016, with regards to allegations against Kochhar over credit facilities given to certain corporates related to her family. They also asked why the board did not question Kochhar when loans were being given to loss-making entities,"" said the second person, also requesting anonymity.
The shareholders urged the bank’s board to take immediate steps to restore corporate governance standards and provide them with clarity on the Srikrishna panel probe’s terms of reference, scope of work and timeline.
The disgruntled shareholders also asked about the functioning of the bank’s overseas subsidiaries and loans given from its foreign subsidiaries to overseas entities, especially those which belong to Indian promoters.
That’s not all. “The shareholders also asked why Kochhar was not asked to quit as the CEO. They also asked on what basis the bank had voted in her favour, while investigations by Srikrishna panel and other agencies are yet to be concluded,"" the second person added.
The shareholders suggested that the board should take a decision on cleaning the bank’s balance sheet by providing for all bad loans and taking a one-time hit.
On 28 March, the bank’s board had first backed Kochhar. On 7 May, following the announcement of the annual results, it chose to stick to its earlier stance on Kochhar. On 23 May, Sebi had sent a 12-page notice to the bank and Kochhar, alleging violation of listing obligation and disclosure requirements.
And then, after considering a whistleblower complaint against Kochhar and the bank’s top management to the regulators and a board meeting on 29 May, a majority of the independent directors on the board asked Kochhar to go on an indefinite leave. On 19 June, Kochhar the board decided to initiate an independent inquiry against Kochhar. The probe under Srikrishna is yet to be concluded .
“Responding to shareholders, the board has said that the bank is cooperating with all agencies conducting probes into the bank and Kochhar,"" he added.
In a separate development, law firm Panag and Babu is looking into yet another whistleblower complaint alleging that the bank had inflated profits by at least $1.3 billion over eight years, by delaying provisioning for bad loans. The complainant also said that top executives, including Kochhar and executive director Vijay Chandok, wilfully breached rules to avoid classifying the loans as bad.
In March, The Indian Express reported that Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot had provided a loan of  ₹ 64 crore to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd (NRPL), a firm he had set up with Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar and two relatives six months after the business group got a loan of  ₹ 3,250 crore as from ICICI Bank in 2012.
Dhoot had transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for  ₹ 9 lakh, six months after he received the loan from ICICI Bank, the report added. The Videocon account was declared an NPA or a bad loan in 2017, according to the report.
On 23 April, the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) had ordered an inspection of the “books and papers"" of six companies linked to the ICICI Bank loan controversy, including NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd, Supreme Energy Pvt. Ltd, Pacific Capital Services Pvt. Ltd, Videocon Industries Ltd, NuPower Wind Farms Ltd and EchandaUrja Pvt. Ltd."

Mumbai:The rupee has been battered along with its emerging market peers in recent weeks, but stock investors would do well to look beyond the currency’s slump and pay attention to an improving earnings picture, according to the nation’s largest brokerage. 
Mumbai:The rupee has been battered along with its emerging market peers in recent weeks, but stock investors would do well to look beyond the currency’s slump and pay attention to an improving earnings picture, according to the nation’s largest brokerage.
“We have moved away from the past when currency sneezed and the equity markets caught a cold,"" Shilpa Kumar, chief executive officer of ICICI Securities Ltd, said in an interview. “The broad view is for a 15% to 20% earnings growth from here on for the next two years and the evidence of that is there.""
Indian equities have lost about $89 billion since rallying to a record on 28 August as the rupee set a string of lows amid a sell-off sweeping most emerging markets. The currency’s slide, she said, follows a “long benign period of stability,"" and indicators including robust consumption and a pick up in loan growth show the economy is on the mend after the shocks of a cash ban and the introduction of a nationwide consumption tax. “Even in times like these certain areas like financial services and consumers are seeing growth,"" she said. “Indicators are pointing in the right direction.""
About three-fourths of Nifty 50 index members reported results that either beat or met profit estimates in the June quarter, the highest proportion in at least three quarters, according to calculations by Bloomberg Quint. Last month, data showed gross domestic product topped 8%, putting the nation ahead of China, where an intensifying trade spat with the US is hurting growth.
While India’s world-beating economic expansion faces risks, most notably from oil prices — and its impact on the rupee — it is unlikely that stocks would “move down too sharply"" solely because of a weak currency, Kumar said. “I don’t think there is a trigger for it to fall given that indicators point to the earnings finally beginning to show up,"" she said."

In a filing, ICICI Bank informed the stock exchanges that it has submitted its response to Sebi’s showcause notice but has not filed any application for settlement.
Sebi had issued showcause notices to ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar and others after its preliminary examination favoured initiating adjudication proceedings against them for alleged violation of listing disclosure norms regarding “conflict of interest"" in business dealings of Deepak Kochhar with Videocon Group.
ICICI Bank and Chanda Kochhar, however, have maintained there has been no regulatory violation on their part and that she was not aware of specific business dealings of her husband.
According to Sebi’s preliminary probe, Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar has had many business dealings with Videocon Group over the last several years. Besides, Deepak Kochhar and Videocon chief Venugopal Dhoot were co-founders and promoters of NuPower Renewables, besides other associations.
The cases under scanner include the significant loan exposure of the bank to Videocon Group way back in 2012 and the alleged involvement of Chanda Kochhar’s family members in the restructuring of that loan.

Rising interest rate regime
SBI, the country’s largest lender, increased its one-year MCLR from 8.45% to 8.50%. For an amount of  ₹ 30 lakh, the bank will now provide home loan at 8.70-8.85%, up from 8.65%-8.80%. 
ICICI Bank Ltd has increased its six-month MCLR from 8.50% to 8.60% and one-year MCLR to 8.65% from 8.55%. The bank offers home loan on both six-month and one-year MCLR. The spread on the home loan from the bank ranges between 30-90 bps depending on the type of loan, type of borrower and the loan amount. A spread is a margin that is above MCLR, which adds up to your overall home loan amount. 
HDFC is providing home loan at 8.80-8.85% for loan amount up to  ₹ 30 lakh, up from 8.70-8.75%.
In the last two policy reviews, the central bank increased repo rate by 25 bps each. According to banking analysts, RBI is likely to increase the rate during the Friday review as well. “We expect a 25 bps hike in repo rate in October policy and it may not be the last in the financial year. We rule out a hike of 50 bps, as it may spook the market. However, there is an outside probability of change in neutral stance too, as three successive rate hikes, with a neutral stance could contradict RBI’s message,"" said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, State Bank of India, in a note.
What should you do?
If you are planning to take a home loan, you need to know that there are two types of loan options—fixed rate loan and floating rate loan. In a fixed rate loan, the bank gives you a fixed rate for a particular tenure. In case of floating rate loan, the interest rate will change depending on the interest rate cycle. Financial planners suggest that one should opt for floating rate loans. 
“No one can time the interest rates while taking a home loan. Moreover, housing loan lasts for a longer duration loan—over 20-year period. Hence, since there will be changing interest rate cycles, it is better to have a floating rate,"" said Suresh Sadagopan, a Mumbai-based financial planner. 
“Again, if you look at a typical home loan borrower, most of them end up prepaying the loan. Hence, there is no need to block it at a fixed rate loan,"" he added.
Remember that usually fixed rate loans are priced higher than home loan rates. Also, when it comes to prepayment, you may have to pay a prepayment penalty for a fixed rate loan. In case of floating rate loans, there is no prepayment penalty.
Besides the interest rate, you also need look at other charges when you opt for a home loan. 
Home loans usually have charges such as processing fee, administrative cost and franking charges. You need to factor in these costs and the interest rate before taking a loan.
As a borrower, you can also negotiate with a bank or housing finance company to waive off the charges if you have a good credit score. If you are an existing home loan borrower, you need to check your interest rate. If it is too high, try to convert into a lower rate through balance transfer. 
“It will make sense only if the new interest rate is lower by over 75 bps. However, if your home loan rate difference is say around 100 bps, in a competitive scenario, these do get corrected. If you are looking to do a balance transfer of your home loan, other than interest rate also check for the charges,"" said Sadagopan. 
Usually balance transfer works if your remaining home loan tenure is over 10 years."
449,2018-10-04,ICICI,"Chanda Kochhar has quit as CEO of ICICI Bank with immediate effect. The private lender has appointed Sandeep Bakhshi as managing director & chief executive officer for five years

Mumbai: ICICI Bank’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Chanda Kochhar, came out of an enforced indefinite leave on Thursday to quit the country’s third-largest lender by assets, amid allegations of loans for favours and conflict of interest. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank’s managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Chanda Kochhar, came out of an enforced indefinite leave on Thursday to quit the country’s third-largest lender by assets, amid allegations of loans for favours and conflict of interest.
The announcement by ICICI Bank on Thursday afternoon drove the bank’s stock higher by 5.8% to  ₹ 320.90. Following a board meeting on Thursday, ICICI Bank said its board had accepted Kochhar’s resignation with immediate effect and had named Sandeep Bakhshi, who has been serving as the bank’s chief operating officer over the past four months, as the new managing director and CEO for a term of five years.
Kochhar’s resignation brought the curtains down on a tumultuous career that began in the same institution in 1984 as a trainee. She grew through the ranks and eventually, in 2009, stepped into the large shoes of her predecessor K.V. Kamath, who had aggressively converted a development financial institution focused on long-term lending into a consumer-focused commercial bank. 
As part of Kamath’s dream team, Kochhar was rotated through multiple critical roles, including as head of retail banking and the bank’s chief financial officer.
In 1993, after the financial institution got the central bank’s approval to convert into a new-generation private bank, Kochhar was on the front lines, recruiting from 40 different organizations, selecting a core banking software platform and even designing the bank’s first cheque books. 
In 2000, Kamath enlisted Kochhar to build the bank’s retail business from scratch. At that time, she was overseeing the bank’s corporate business, which accounted for about 50% of the institution’s balance sheet; but in six years, Kochhar ramped up the retail business to about 67% of the bank’s balance sheet.
Kamath worked assiduously to add size and heft to the bank. This journey was fraught with numerous potholes, including multiple runs on the bank, thereby affording Kochhar invaluable experience in not only managing crises but also in acquiring a competitive gene. This must have come in handy when staving off competition from numerous compatriots after Kamath retired: she prevailed over her senior Shikha Sharma (who thereafter moved to Axis Bank as CEO and MD) to occupy the bank’s corner office.
After taking over as ICICI Bank’s MD and CEO, Kochhar’s first task was to shrink the balance sheet, which was suspected of harbouring inconspicuous non-performing assets, growing against the backdrop of an unprecedented global credit crunch. Her list of priorities included improving the share of low-cost current-account-savings-account deposits as part of the total deposits (26% then), as well as credit quality and capital conservation.
Her tenure has not been without controversy: while ICICI Bank’s net profit improved from  ₹ 878 crore in June 2009 to  ₹ 1,650 crore in December 2017, bad loans ballooned from  ₹ 9,416 crore to  ₹ 46,038 crore during the same period.
Kochhar has been in the eye of a storm since the Serious Fraud Investigation Office summoned her in March 2018 in connection with loans extended to fugitive Mehul Choksi’s Gitanjali Group. 
Later, on 20 March, a whistle-blower complained against the bank and its top management, including Kochhar, alleging a deliberate delay in recognizing impairment in 31 loan accounts between fiscal 2008 and March 2016 to save on provisioning costs and inflate profits by $1.3 billion over eight years. Mint reported this first on 25 June.
But the decisive blow was delivered by allegations of granting loans to the Videocon Group as a quid pro quo for the business group’s dealings with her husband Deepak Kochhar. On 12 April, the Securities and Exchange Board of India began a probe into alleged corporate governance lapses at the bank and failure to make adequate disclosures about the bank’s loan to Videocon Group.
On 2 June, Mint was the first to report that Kochhar had been asked to proceed on indefinite leave until an independent enquiry to probe the alleged cases of impropriety could be concluded. 
The bank’s board has appointed retired Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna to look into the allegations. The independent probe is likely to be completed before December.
“The enquiry instituted by the board will remain unaffected by this (Kochhar’s resignation) and certain benefits will be subject to the outcome,"" the bank said in a statement after a board meeting on Thursday.
Kochhar, 56, will also be stepping down from the boards of all ICICI Bank subsidiaries, the bank said in its exchange filing. Kochhar’s term was supposed to end in March 2019. 
“The board of directors of ICICI Bank accepted the request of Chanda Kochhar to seek early retirement from the bank at the earliest… Kochhar will also relinquish office from the board of directors of the bank’s subsidiaries,"" said the bank.
M.D. Mallya, one of the independent directors of the bank, also resigned from the board on Thursday, citing health reasons, the bank said.
Bakhshi will lead ICICI Bank till 3 October 2023, subject to regulatory approval, while other conditions of his appointment remain unchanged, the bank said."

Independent directors, top executives and boards have rightly been pilloried for being asleep on the job while companies such as Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), ICICI Bank Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd were haemorrhaging. But what about executives down the line, the young MBAs and chartered accountants, trained to spot such financial mismatches. Where indeed were the boys and the girls who could have said the emperor is naked? 
Independent directors, top executives and boards have rightly been pilloried for being asleep on the job while companies such as Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), ICICI Bank Ltd and Fortis Healthcare Ltd were haemorrhaging. But what about executives down the line, the young MBAs and chartered accountants, trained to spot such financial mismatches. Where indeed were the boys and the girls who could have said the emperor is naked?
Sadly, though we know that there are upright young men and women with the financial acumen to see that the numbers were going horribly wrong, no one ever asked them for their opinion.
Across the hallways of Indian businesses lie the vestiges of a feudal culture you would have thought had disappeared with the privy purse in 1971. Private bathrooms, dining rooms, and elevators in offices are only some visible markers. While open offices are being embraced as the new corporate mantra, the head honchos still occupy vast, cavernous rooms, often even entire floors. It is a deliberate effort to separate the bosses from the rest. 
There are honourable exceptions, of course. Old-timers at Bombay House still remember with affection Ratan Tata holding the lift doors for employees. The late B.M. Munjal’s austere office in Delhi in the 1990s and his old-world courtesy of pouring out the tea for an employee who had come to meet him are equally rare instances of company owners not losing perspective of who they were. 
But in general, the boss in India is an object of reverence. He is invincible and his wish is the command of the thousands who work for him and naysayers are not encouraged. 
It is in the servility that is expected of employees that this feudal attitude best manifests itself. It isn’t uncommon in many of the largest Indian companies for employees to melt away at the mere sight of the chairman. In public, their arrival for an event becomes akin to a state visit by a head of state, what with first the bouncers coming in to check out the security details followed by the ubiquitous teams of flacks staking out the venue to ensure best visibility for their client in terms of television coverage, proximity to other VIPs and the pecking order of seating.
Maybe it is a part of our upbringing. For centuries, the Indian joint family system has been based on an extreme sense of deference. Questioning the family patriarch, or the other seniors, just isn’t done. Given that 70% of Indian industry is family-owned, it is quite natural that this same mindset extends to businesses.
What’s worse, it snakes its way quite insidiously into every rung of the corporate structure. Watch office meetings where there is a strict feudal order of seating with the boss of the moment sitting imperially at the head of the table as the minions gather around him or her. 
How does all this matter. The overt deference, the boss is always right world view comes at a huge cost to the stakeholders. Vijay Mallya blew billions of dollars and destroyed a flourishing liquor business because there was no one to tell him that he didn’t have a clue about the airline business and the son whose birthday gift was Kingfisher Airlines didn’t have a clue about any business.
The debacles at ICICI Bank, Fortis and now IL&FS came as a shock to us because they were sudden and unexpected. Many of the independent directors on the boards of these companies have claimed that they simply did not know the extent of their financial woes. For that their disclosure norms and their openness to shareholders and regulators have rightly been questioned. But it would be wrong to believe that a company can be transparent to its shareholders, while being opaque with its employees.
A 2009 Harvard Business Review piece, ‘A Culture of Candor’ by James O’Toole and Warren Bennis, says: “When a team of senior managers suffer from collective denial and self-deception—when they can’t unearth and question their shared assumptions—they can’t innovate or make course corrections effectively. That often leads to business and ethical disasters."" You can see the whole of the IL&FS tragedy played out in these 40 words.

But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.
Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of the current FD rates from some popular banks for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a plea by Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (JAL) seeking to restrain ICICI Bank from initiating insolvency proceedings against it. 
A bench led by Justice N.V. Ramana upheld the order of the Allahabad High Court that had relied on the apex courts August order in the Jaypee Infratech (JIL) insolvency case, where it asked the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), Allahabad, to deal with insolvency proceedings against JIL. 
A limitation period of 180 days had been set to conclude insolvency proceedings at NCLT. 
The Allahabad High Court had also allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to direct banks to initiate separate insolvency proceedings against JIL’s holding company JAL.
The top court was ruling on a plea by debt-ridden JAL seeking to restrain ICICI Bank from initiating insolvency proceedings against it under Section 7 of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). 
In its appeal, JAL told the apex court that the Composite Restructuring and Realignment Plan (CRRP) approved by the Joint Lenders forum (JLF) and pending consideration of the NCLT, Allahabad, could not co-exist with insolvency proceedings initiated at the instance of the RBI.
In the Jaypee Infratech insolvency case, the top court had allowed the RBI to initiate insolvency proceedings against JAL, noting that it owes over  ₹ 30,000 crore to 30 banks.
JAL featured in RBI’s second list of at least 26 defaulters with which it wants creditors to start the process of debt resolution before initiating bankruptcy proceedings."

New Delhi/Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has moved a US court against 11 executives of Mumbai-based diamond company Shrenuj and Co. for allegedly defrauding the bank, and has sought to recover over $12 million (around  ₹ 88.50 crore) from them, besides interest and legal fees. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has moved a US court against 11 executives of Mumbai-based diamond company Shrenuj and Co. for allegedly defrauding the bank, and has sought to recover over $12 million (around  ₹ 88.50 crore) from them, besides interest and legal fees.
The bank’s petition filed on 4 October said Mumbai-based Shrenuj, which is currently undergoing insolvency resolution, diverted funds through its US subsidiary Simon & Golub & Sons (SG), and shell companies in the UAE.
ICICI Bank, through its New York branch, filed the case in Southern District Court of New York, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization (RICO) Act against promoter Vishal Doshi and 10 other executives from Shrenuj and other companies with which it had related party transactions.
“The defendants (11 executives), acting in concert as co-conspirators, engaged in repeated RICO violations in a pattern of racketeering and fraudulent activities spanning the globe from India to the US to the UAE,"" said the bank in its petition filed through its law firm Sabharwal & Finkel Llc. 
ICICI Bank claims that this was done using Shrenuj, SG and UAE shell companies as “instrumentalities of their fraud, inducing Plaintiff (ICICI Bank, NY Branch) to extend and maintain loan facilities to SG, then diverting such loan proceeds to themselves through Shrenuj and the UAE Shell Companies by means of a series of fraudulent transactions, spanning a time period from 2 July 2008 through 31 March 2016.""
Mint has reviewed a copy of the complaint filed by ICICI Bank. 
According to the petition, Shrenuj’s US subsidiary SG had entered into a credit facility agreement in 2008 for $20 million. As of March 2016, SG owed $18.8 million to ICICI Bank. Out of this, $3.6 million was in the form of a letter of credit and $15.2 million under the revolving credit facilities. According to ICICI Bank, a financial statement provided by SG in May 2016 showed it was not in a position to repay these obligations. 
A letter of credit is a financial instrument issued by a bank to another bank (especially one in a different country) to serve as a guarantee for payments made to a specified person under specified conditions.
Subsequently, ICICI Bank had approached the court in Seattle to appoint a receiver for SG. During the course of receivership proceedings, the receiver discovered alleged fraud and fraudulent transactions by SG to certain third parties.
“The New York Branch of ICICI Bank Ltd has commenced a lawsuit in the courts of the State of New York in relation to the collection of an unpaid loan,"" said an ICICI Bank spokesperson in an email response. “The bank cannot comment on the ongoing litigation except to confirm that the case does not include any allegations of wrongdoing against any of its employees,"" he added.
 “We have not received any intimation from any source about this case and in the absence of details of the case, we are not in a position to furnish any response to you,"" a Shrenuj & Co. spokesperson said in an email response. “In future, as and when we receive any details of the allegations, we shall defend the case suitably in court. We also wish to add that ICICI Bank and Shrenuj are engaged in multiple litigations which are subjudice,"" she added.
In August, Bank of India moved NCLT’s Mumbai bench to begin insolvency proceedings against Shrenuj for defaulting on a  ₹ 226 crore loan. The firm owes a total of  ₹ 1,113 crore to a consortium of 17 lenders.
“To tackle misuse of the legal person or complex corporate structure is on high-priority agenda of every government. In India, the task force on shell companies was set up by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) under the joint chairmanship of the revenue secretary and MCA secretary to check the menace of companies indulging in fraudulent illegal activities including facilitation of tax evasion,"" said Paras Savla, a partner at audit and consulting firm KPB and Associates."

In terms of profitability, HDFC Standard Life overshadowed its peers ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and SBI Life in performance. HDFC Life reported a robust 28% growth in value of new business and a huge 43% increase in new business premium. As a consequence, its value for new business margin was 24.3%, the highest among the three insurers who have reported results so far.
Not just individuals, but companies also grabbed the insurer’s products as it saw a 36% growth in its group new business premium. But the key gain was in the margin-friendly protection business (term plans), the share of which grew to 16.2% from 11.8% in the overall annualized premium equivalent. Protection business has been the focus of many insurers mainly due to its potential to increase profitability and the stability it lends to the product portfolio.
In this aspect, HDFC Life’s portfolio mix is superior to its peers. The share of protection in the annualized premium equivalent of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance was 7.9% for the six months ended September.
The share of equity-linked products continues to dominate the portfolio of all three insurers. Considering the dismal performance of equity markets over the past month, Ulips have fallen out of favour, affecting the growth rate of premiums for the insurers. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance saw its new business premium drop by 5%. That said, ICICI Prudential Life could squeeze enough bang for a buck as its value of new business surged 41.5%, unlike the other two. The insurer even reported an impressive value for new business margin, at 17.5%.
SBI Life continued to report strong growth metrics despite being the largest insurer. Its new business premium grew 30% while the value of new business premium rose by 22%. Analysts believe that at roughly two times its estimated embedded value for FY20, SBI Life’s stock is reasonably valued. The valuation of HDFC Standard Life however is viewed as stretched, with some brokerages having a sell call on the stock."

ICICI Bank in a regulatory filing said the clean chit given to Kochhar in March this year was based on the inquiry report of the law firm which is now saying that the same should no longer be treated as valid.
Following the allegations of nepotism and conflict of interest against Kochhar, the then chairman M.K. Sharma in March had expressed full confidence in her and ruled out any quid pro quo as alleged with regard to certain loans given to the Videocon Group.
ICICI Bank in a filing said the bank had expressed confidence in Kochhar on the basis of the inquiry report of the law firm which was engaged in 2016 to probe the allegations of nepotism and conflict of interest against her. The inquiry was conducted by law firm Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, according to the people quoted above.
“The law firm submitted its report in December 2016 stating that it had found no evidence of nepotism and conflict of interest on the part of Kochhar and accordingly the matter was treated as closed,"" ICICI Bank said.
When fresh allegations surfaced in March 2018 on the same matter, the board of the bank on the basis of inquiry report of the law firm issued a statement expressing confidence in Kochhar.

“Further, the bank informed the law firm about the said developments, whereupon the law firm expressed that its earlier report would no longer be valid,"" ICICI Bank said.
Later, ICICI Bank instituted an external inquiry headed by retired Supreme Court judge B.N. Srikrishna to look into the allegations of nepotism and quid pro quo against Kochhar.
Even as the board stood by her, details of misdoings emerged in the media, leading to a multi-agency probe against Kochhar by various law enforcement agencies.
The cases under scanner include the bank’s  ₹ 3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group in 2012 and the involvement of Kochhar family members, including her husband Deepak Kochhar, in first sanctioning the loan and then restructuring the same.
On 4 October, the bank had informed that Kochhar had quit the bank with immediate effect.

Barring its net profit and operating profit growth, private sector lender ICICI Bank Ltd’s September quarter (Q2) results surprised on other key parameters. For instance, the bank’s provisions were lower than anticipated, slippages—i.e. fresh addition of bad loans—hit a 12-quarter low and overall loan growth was steady. Also, the sequential moderation in gross and net non-performing assets (NPAs) provides some respite. Apart from worries on the asset quality front, a key concern for investors in the ICICI Bank Ltd stock lately has been transition at the management level. That overhang is now largely out of the way.

Apart from worries on the asset quality front, a key concern for investors in the ICICI Bank Ltd stock lately has been transition at the management level. That overhang is now largely out of the way.
That said, the ongoing crisis in infrastructure lending major IL&FS Group and its fallout on the overall liquidity conditions of the non-banking and financial companies (NBFC) cannot be overlooked by investors in banking stocks.
In a post earnings investor conference call, the ICICI Bank management said that its exposure to the “infrastructure group"" is through a special purpose vehicle and is non-fund based in nature. The bank has classified the same in the small and medium enterprise and in corporate non-performing assets, it said.
The management further added that its total exposure to NBFCs is  ₹ 36,730 crore and constitutes around 5.4% of outstanding loans.
On the bright side, some analysts expect the bank’s loan growth to benefit from the business slowdown in the NBFC sector.
Although the bank’s net interest margins (NIMs) improved to 3.33% from 3.19% in the previous quarter, the management said, to a certain extent, margins were aided by excess liquidity that was deployed during the quarter.
Investors need to watch the trend in NIMs also because the bank’s management expects funding costs to go up and cautions that NIMs may come under pressure. Further, overseas margins could be volatile as recoveries from non-performing loans happen in the overseas book, the management said. 
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank’s Q2 results are expected to be received well by the Street, providing some fillip to the ICICI Bank’s share price today.
But investors shouldn’t get carried away by the near-term movement in the stock’s price. That is simply because this improvement seen on the slippages and asset quality front has to sustain for investors to be convinced that the bank’s NPA recognition cycle has bottomed out."

In the last two weeks, two things have happened—the launch of OnePlus 6T and the end of Amazon’s Great Indian Festival Sale. The former is successor to one of the best selling premium smartphones of the year, the OnePlus 6, and the latter saw the bestseller to go out of stock. 
In the last two weeks, two things have happened—the launch of OnePlus 6T and the end of Amazon’s Great Indian Festival Sale. The former is successor to one of the best selling premium smartphones of the year, the OnePlus 6, and the latter saw the bestseller to go out of stock.
Amazon is gearing up for another sale during Diwali and so far it looks like it will put the OnePlus 6T in the limelight throughout the course of the sale. Which raises the question—should you upgrade to the OnePlus 6T anyway?
For starters, there will be an introductory offer on the OnePlus 6T, no doubt about that. Buyers will get  ₹ 2,000 instant discount when buying through ICICI Bank or Citibank cards, Jio’s  ₹ 5,400 cash back in the form of vouchers as well as free OnePlus Type-C Bullets. That’s quite a lot to gain.
The price of the OnePlus 6T will be unveiled tonight at 8:30 pm and we expect it to be in line with the current prices of the OnePlus 6, going by its pricing in the American market.
All looks good so far, what about the phone itself—what’s so compelling about the OnePlus 6Tto consider it over the OnePlus 6?
The screen, for instance, is pushed further to the edges, thanks to the teardrop notch. This allows it to have a marginally larger screen packed inside roughly the same overall physical dimensions. The OnePlus 6T has a 6.41 inch display while the OnePlus 6 has a 6.28 inch display. Both displays are exactly the same otherwise—Optic AMOLED with a pixel density of 402ppi. The OnePlus 6T has a better-protected screen though, as it comes with a newer Corning Gorilla Glass 6 protection.
The second striking difference is the absence of a physical fingerprint scanner on the 6T. Instead, it has one embedded underneath the screen. OnePlus claims it’s nearly as fast as a physical fingerprint scanner and takes only 0.34 seconds to scan. Our past experiences with in-display fingerprint scanners haven’t been all that great, with problems ranging from finger placement and latency to an annoyingly bright light shining on your eyes late at night.
Apart from that, the design and underpinnings are exactly the same. The same octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor powers the 6T and it comes in three variants with configurations of 6GB/128GB, 8GB/128GB and 8GB/256GB. It is also shod with the same camera configuration—back and front. You have the same optically stabilised 20MP+16MP rear clicker and 16MP selfie snapper. It does have a few tricks up its sleeve to enhance night photography, but it’s a software upgrade that will also come to the OnePlus 6 (and even older models).
While we are at the software end of things, the phone runs the second version of the Oxygen OS 9 based on Android Pie (which will also be available on the OnePlus 6). It way more polished than the first version and comes with better navigation gestures, software optimisation and digital well-being features.
The OnePlus 6T misses out on the beloved (and now overvalued) 3.5mm headphone jack, which may be a deal breaker for several people. OnePlus’ consolation of cheap Type-C Bullets may work, but it is still a separate, add-on entity which may or may not be cross-functional."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.

Here is a comparative list of bank FDs for terms upto 3 years of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank.

When the share markets are volatile it is considered a good idea to add some debt to your investment portfolio. One of the safer ways to earn something from your idle savings is investing in bank fixed deposits. While the interest rates of bank FDs had been on a downswing in the past, recently all the three major banks — SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank — have increased their FD rates, making them more attractive.

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has drawn up a plan to raise as much as  ₹ 25,000 crore for on-lending as India’s second largest private lender seeks to fill in the vacuum left by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which are facing a liquidity squeeze. ICICI Bank intends to issue non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and other fixed-income securities for raising funds in the year ahead, according to a document sent recently to shareholders after its annual general meeting. 
Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd has drawn up a plan to raise as much as  ₹ 25,000 crore for on-lending as India’s second largest private lender seeks to fill in the vacuum left by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), which are facing a liquidity squeeze. ICICI Bank intends to issue non-convertible debentures (NCDs) and other fixed-income securities for raising funds in the year ahead, according to a document sent recently to shareholders after its annual general meeting.
in that document, ICICI Bank its board has been authorized through a general resolution to borrow the funds by way of issuance of non-convertible securities, including but not limited to bonds, and NCDs in one or more tranches on a private placement basis.
A spokesperson for ICICI Bank did not respond to an emailed query.
The lender’s move is aimed at capitalizing on the growing opportunity to deploy more money towards road, power and infrastructure projects, a space that has been hitherto dominated by NBFCs.
NBFCs began to face a funding crisis because of a liquidity squeeze that surfaced following defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) and DSP Mutual Fund sold commercial papers worth around  ₹ 300 crore of housing finance firm DHFL at higher yields in September.
Banking industry experts said ICICI Bank’s step is a well-thought out one as it comes at an opportune time when NBFCs are finding it tough to borrow money from banks and mutual funds.
“This appears to be a sensible move by ICICI Bank to secure shareholder approval for this enabling resolution to raise capital. In an environment where NBFCs are facing liquidity issues and deployment opportunities are beginning to emerge, there is an opportunity for well-capitalized banks to raise debt at attractive rates and deploy it comfortably in retail as well as wholesale projects,"" said Krishnan A.S.V., lead analyst for banking and financial services at SBICAP Securities Ltd.
“With NBFCs slowing their pace of disbursements, banks are also benefited by a conducive pricing environment with asset yields likely to reflect a gradual return of banks’ pricing power. ICICI Bank has a strong deposit franchise and should find it relatively easier to raise up to  ₹ 25,000 crore as tier-II capital,"" he said.
UBS Securities in a September report predicted tighter liquidity conditions can translate into lower growth and margins for NBFCs going ahead. A reversal in liquidity could imply that funding for NBFCs may remain tight going forward, the financial services firm said. “….They are likely to see lower growth and/or margins ahead,"" said Gautam Chhaochharia, head of research, India at UBS Securities. This is where lenders like ICICI Bank are seeing an opportunity. “Private banks like ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank would be key beneficiaries due to shift in borrowing profile for NBFCs,"" said Jignesh Shial, Kushan Parikh and Himanshu Taluja of Emkay Global in a September report.
Suresh Ganapathy, head of financial sector research at Macquarie, said NBFCs are facing troubles in terms of borrowing money and deploying them, but banks are still fine in the market. “A large part of this money could be used for helping the lending businesses of ICICI Bank’s international operations. The market is vibrant enough for the bank to raise this kind of capital through bonds or NCDs,"" said Ganapathy.
NBFCs, typically, raise funds either from banks or mutual funds. Banks typically finance up to 60% of NBFC’s fund needs while about 30-35% comes from fixed income mutual funds. In the last one-and-a-half years, NBFCs have been increasingly approaching mutual funds for their funding requirements because banks have tightened their lending to NBFCs as their own non-performing assets grew.
NBFCs are also facing refinancing risks with their commercial papers (CPs) and NCDs set to mature before the end of this financial year. Papers worth about  ₹ 78,380 crore of various debt mutual fund schemes, are pending redemption between October and March.
Rating agencies and research analysts have been painting a bleak outlook for the  ₹ 28.4 trillion industry of NBFCs and home financiers, which led to sharp decline in stocks of NBFCs. This crisis for NBFCs has created a new business avenue for bank, especially in lending to large infrastructure projects.
Brokerage Emkay Global said that 12% of DHFL’s liabilities is maturing in three months against 9% of its total assets.
Cholamandalam Finance has 15% liabilities maturing in three months against 7% of its total assets. Shriram Transport faces a similar issue.
In June, rating agency Icra Ltd estimated that retail-focused NBFCs—with an estimated portfolio size of  ₹ 7.5 trillion—will need  ₹ 3.8-4 trillion of fresh debt funding in FY2019 to support their envisaged portfolio growth of about 20% in FY2019.
“About 50% NCDs and CPs of NBFC borrowings were largely at a fixed rate, while 35-37% of bank borrowings get repriced on a quarterly or annual basis. As the share of bank borrowings begins to increase from Q2 FY2018 and borrowings with annual reset dates are expected to get repriced from August-September, retail NBFCs are expected to face increased pricing pressure in the second half of FY2019,"" said Icra."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

These firms would be making their presentation before the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management on November 26, as per a notice on the DIPAM website.
DIPAM had last month floated a Request for Proposal (RFP) to engage one advisor from consulting firms/ investment bankers/ merchant bankers for assisting it in the process of two M&As in the energy sector.
The selected advisor would assist the government on modalities of disinvestment and the timing; and prepare business valuation of companies, as well as suggest measures to fetch optimum value.
The names of the CPSEs selected for M&A would be decided later.
Once the proposal comes from the administrative ministry, it would go to the Core Group of Secretaries on Disinvestment (CGD) and then to the Cabinet, an official explained.
With over four months left for the fiscal to end, DIPAM is fast-tracking the process to achieve the  ₹ 80,000 crore disinvestment target. So far, the government has mopped up over  ₹ 15,200 crore from PSU stake sale through IPOs, OFS and ETF.
According to officials, the government is looking to sell its 65.61 per cent stake in state-owned Power Finance Corporation (PFC) to Rural Electrification Corporation (REC), which could fetch the exchequer about  ₹ 13,000 crore.
At the end of 2017-18 financial year, the total resources of REC stood at over  ₹ 2.46 lakh crore, of which ‘Reserves and Surplus’ stood at  ₹ ₹ 33,515.59 crore. The net worth of the company stood at  ₹ 35,490 crore and ‘cash and bank balance’ was at  ₹ 1,773 crore at the end of March 2018. The REC-PFC deal is being considered on the lines of the acquisition of government’s entire 51.11 per cent stake in oil refiner HPCL by state-owned ONGC in 2017-18. The government got  ₹ 36,915 crore from the stake sale.
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had in Budget 2017-18 said there are opportunities to strengthen CPSEs through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions. “By these methods, CPSEs can be integrated across the value chain of an industry. It will give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders,"" he had said."

Mumbai: Oriental Bank of Commerce said it has begun the process of selling its 23% stake in Canara HSBC Oriental Bank Life Insurance Ltd by hiring ICICI Securities as the manager to a potential sale. The public sector lender did not disclose the valuation of its stake. Two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity, that Oriental Bank is looking to raise around  ₹ 1,500 crore.

The public sector lender did not disclose the valuation of its stake. Two people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity, that Oriental Bank is looking to raise around  ₹ 1,500 crore.
“Oriental Bank of Commerce (the bank or the seller) holds 23% equity stake in the company (life insurance business) intends to disinvest its stake held in the company (proposed transaction). ICICI Securities Ltd (I-Sec) has been appointed as the financial advisor for the proposed transaction by the seller,"" the bank said in its tender document. Oriental Bank is seeking expressions of interest from buyers by 3 December.
Oriental Bank did not respond to an emailed query on the valuation of the stake. A spokesperson for ICICI Securities declined to comment citing confidentiality.
Canara HSBC Oriental Bank Life Insurance is owned 51% by Canara Bank. HSBC Insurance (Asia-Pacific) Holdings Ltd and Oriental Bank own stakes of 26% and 23%, respectively.
“The bank is expected to raise around  ₹ 1,400 crore- ₹ 1,500 crore through the deal. The transaction is likely to close by last quarter of current fiscal year,"" said the first person cited above. He said the proceeds will be utilized to boost the capital base of the bank.
In the September quarter, its common equity tier 1 (CET-1) rose to 7.18% from 6.50% a year earlier. Overall, the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) fell to 10.35% from 10.6% a year earlier. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stipulated a minimum CAR of 9% for banks in India.
Meanwhile, Oriental Bank is hoping to come out of prompt corrective action this year. The banking regulator initiated prompt corrective action (PCA) against the lender in October last year due to high non-performing assets. The RBI initiates PCA against banks on account of deterioration in asset quality, return on assets, capital or leverage ratio. PCA is initiated if the net NPA level breaches 6%. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the net NPA for Oriental Bank stood at 10.07%. The number has improved sequentially from 10.63%. The boards of banks undergoing PCA are advised by the RBI on various strategic, operational, market and profitability related actions among others. The regulator can also advise board to review all business lines to identify scope for enhancement or contraction as well as restriction on investment in subsidiaries and associates.
Oriental Bank’s move to sell its stake in the joint venture comes at a time when state-run banks reeling under the pressure of high NPAs have been looking to divest their non-core assets. For instance, Punjab National Bank is looking to sell its stake in PNB Housing Finance Ltd. Similarly, another public sector lender IDBI Bank Ltd. exited entirely from Clearing Corp. of India Ltd in August this year. The bank has also divested its stake in NSDL e-Governance Infrastructure Ltd (NEGIL) and has been gradually trying to cut its stake in the National Stock Exchange.
Gurugram-based Canara HSBC Oriental Bank Life Insurance had assets under management of  ₹ 13,241 crore as of end-October."

Mumbai: India’s largest private sector insurer, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, expects private banks and big capital goods companies to drive growth next year, as lenders get on top of their bad loans and oil prices come off their highs. Next year is also set to mark the beginning of a much-awaited earnings recovery in India, even as it gears up for general elections that are due by May, Manish Kumar, Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Pru Life told Reuters. “Our belief is that most of the challenges in the corporate sector banks are in the last stage,"" Kumar said, adding he continued to be positive on private banks with exposure to retail clients. 
Mumbai: India’s largest private sector insurer, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, expects private banks and big capital goods companies to drive growth next year, as lenders get on top of their bad loans and oil prices come off their highs. Next year is also set to mark the beginning of a much-awaited earnings recovery in India, even as it gears up for general elections that are due by May, Manish Kumar, Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Pru Life told Reuters. “Our belief is that most of the challenges in the corporate sector banks are in the last stage,"" Kumar said, adding he continued to be positive on private banks with exposure to retail clients.
Indian banks have been grappling with a pile of bad loans that reached a record $150 billion at the end of March. But the bad debt is declining, Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in September.
Kumar said he preferred private lenders as concerns around the leadership of state-run banks and their growth linger.
The insurer also expects top capital goods companies to outperform in 2019 as the sector would remain a priority for any new government.
“Only for a brief period of 3-6 months the ordering momentum weakens just prior to the elections,"" Kumar said. “But whenever any government comes after elections, this is normally an area of priority.""
Kumar said he would only look at top companies that receive orders from both government and the private sector, though strong margins helped by steady metal prices gave him confidence in the sector overall.
A YEAR OF EVENTS
Kumar manages close to 1.5 trillion rupees ($21.2 billion) at ICICI Pru Life, of which about 770 billion is in debt.
The insurer has increased the weighted-average maturity of its bonds portfolio to about four and a half years in the past two months, after cutting it to three and a half years, amid easing oil prices and waning rate hike expectations.
Oil prices are down almost a third since early October, hit by an emerging supply overhang and financial market weakness.
But Kumar also said he would continue to invest in top-rated corporate bonds that were yielding over 9 percent returns - an attractive spread over government bonds.
Kumar’s optimism in 2019, however, was tempered by the volatility he expects in markets ahead of the elections.
Opinion polls show Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in recent local elections that have energised the opposition.
But Kumar said he would look to tweak his holdings only after studying the policies and intentions of any new government that comes to power.
“It’s a year of events,"" Kumar said. “If I have to summarize it in two words, I would say we are cautiously optimistic.""

“Since end-August, India underperformed because of issues in local banks, currency weakness and oil price volatility,"" HSBC analysts said in a note.
“Despite recent underperformance, these risks remain for Indian equity market. But investors’ holdings now lowest relative to history, valuations more reasonable, 2019e (expected) earnings growth highest in region,"" they said, adding, “We raise Indian equities from underweight to neutral in a regional context.""

HSBC analysts said MSCI India EPS (earnings per share) growth consensus expectations are for 18.8% in 2018 and 24% in 2019, which means India is one of the fastest growing markets across the region.
However, five stocks—State Bank of India, Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd—account for nearly half of all 2019 earnings growth, they said, expressing concerns that they estimate 65% market-cap weighted average earnings growth for these five stocks.
Against this background of high growth and the much-anticipated rate hikes, India’s valuation now appears fair and almost in line with the five-year average 12-month forward PE (price to earnings), they said, adding that it was still far from cheap as India trades at 17.4 times whereas MSCI AxJ trades at 11 times.
“Meanwhile, investors’ weights in India are now at historically low levels and there is an opportunity to add to this. In the past, elections have tended to be a key catalyst for performance,"" HSBC analysts said. “A key risk is the dependency on a few large-cap stocks for growth. These are mostly banks. Thus, rising NPLs (non-performing loans) can quickly and significantly change India’s earnings outlook,"" they warned.
The currency could weaken from here, prompting more interest rate hikes, while lower oil prices are supportive now, HSBC said, though it expects oil to rise in 2019-20."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple. 
Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and unlike other loan products such as to buy a house or pay for an education, the process involved is simple.
But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.
The loan amount and interest rate depend on parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others. As personal loans come with high interest rates, continuous default will put you on a downward spiral.
Here are some of the lowest personal loan interest rates offered by various banks."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday directed the resolution professional of Era Infrastructure India to admit ICICI Bank as a financial creditor under the insolvency proceedings.
The resolution professional (RP) had declined to accept ICICI Bank’s claims worth Rs700 crore.
A two-member principal bench of the NCLT also directed the RP to grant ICICI Bank a proportional voting share in the Committee of Creditors (CoC).
“The corporate debtor is liable to repay the amount granted by the ICICI Bank to Era Infra and Dehradun Highway Project as a Financial debt as per the provisions of the code,"" said the NCLT bench headed by President Justice M M Kumar.
NCLT had started insolvency proceedings against Era Infrastructure in May 2018 and appointed an RP for the company.
The RP had denied the claims of ICICI Bank.
“As a consequential relief, a direction is issued to RP to revise the list of financial creditors of the corporate debtor by including the claims of ICICI Bank with respect to the failities granted to Era Infrastructure and Dehradun Highways Project Ltd amounting to Rs700 crore and credit the applicant ICICI Bank in the CoC by adding the aforesaid claims,"" the order said.
It further added: “It shall also grant the applicant its voting share in the CoC in proportion to such claims with all consequential benefits arising therefrom."" ICICI Bank had given a loan of Rs240 crore to Era Infrastructure India and Rs460 crore to Dehradun Highway Projects and was liable to get a repayment from the corporate debtor, according to the terms of the agreement between the parties. The RP of Era Infrastructure had, however, denied this claim saying that agreement could not be construed as akin to guarantee of repayment.
The NCLT, however, rejected the RP’s arguments, saying that once the corporate debtor had undertaken such obligations, the claims against the same could not be denied to the lender.
“Once it is an amount repayable, then the Resolution Professional must admit the claims of the ICICI Bank as financial debt, in respect of the obligations undertaken by the corporate debtor under the credit facilities availed by Era Infrastructure India Ltd and Dehradun Highway Project,"" NCLT said.
Era Infra was in the first list of 12 defaulting companies which was issued by Reserve Bank of India, directing banks to recover debts through the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (IBC) Code.

Acting swiftly, the government on Tuesday appointed Shaktikanta Das, a former finance secretary, as new RBI chief, calming a jittery market.
Here are 10 updates from the stock market
1) In his first public comment after assuming the charge of RBI, Shaktikanta Das struck a dovish tone on prospects for inflation and also hinted that the RBI might adopt a more growth-friendly monetary framework under his watch. He also said that banking sector would be his key focus and more measures were needed to revive lenders. 
2) Financial stocks have led this round of rally on Dalal Street. Today, HDFC Bank, HDFC, Yes Bank, and SBI were among the top Sensex gainers. 
3) Adding to stock market rally, bonds also rose today after inflation eased sharply in November, bolstering expectations of a RBI rate cut sooner than expected. The 10-year benchmark bond yield fell to 7.38% in early trade from 7.41% in the previous session. Markets also hope for liquidity easing measures from the new RBI chief, who said that there was a need to interact with stakeholders on liquidity issues.
4) The rupee also strengthened as US-China trade tensions eased. The rupee also strengthened to 71.70 a dollar, compared with previous close of 72.01.
5) Data released yesterday after market hours showed consumer inflation falling to a 17-month low of 2.33%, driven by falling food prices, and below the RBI’s medium term target of 4%.
6) Falling oil prices in recent months have eased inflationary pressure on India, a major fuel importer. Since early October, Brent crude prices have dropped by nearly 30% to about $60 per barrel. This has also helped the rupee rebound from October lows of 74.48 a dollar.
7) Separately, data released yesterday also showed India’s industrial output expanded at an annual 8.1% pace in November, the highest in 11 months, compared with a forecast of 5.7%.
8) Some economists expect the RBI will change their monetary policy stance to ‘neutral’ in February from ‘calibrated tightening’ currently, making a rate rise less likely. The RBI may even ease monetary policy to support growth, they say. 
9) Global markets have also rallied on signs of easing China-US trade tensions and expectations that China will step up efforts soon to support its cooling economy. US President Donald Trump on Tuesday said trade talks were under way with China. A Reuters report said that China made the first major purchase of US soybeans since Washington and Beijing agreed to a temporary trade truce this month.
10) Trump also said he would intervene in a case against a top executive at Huawei Technologies if it would help secure a trade deal.

403,2018-12-19,ICICI,"Investors need to brace for a run of constrained returns that will last until the Fed's Jerome Powell makes a policy U-turn, says Sankaran Naren, chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential AMC

Mumbai: For all the domestic drivers of India’s stocks—from oil to elections to shadow banking shakeouts—the U.S. Federal Reserve holds the most sway, according to the nation’s biggest money manager. 
Mumbai: For all the domestic drivers of India’s stocks—from oil to elections to shadow banking shakeouts—the U.S. Federal Reserve holds the most sway, according to the nation’s biggest money manager.
Sankaran Naren, who helps manage 3.1 trillion rupees ($44 billion) as chief investment officer at ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co., says investors need to brace for a run of constrained returns that will last until the Fed’s Jerome Powell makes a policy U-turn. Key Indian equity indexes are up less than 10 percent this year, and gauges of mid- and small-sized companies are poised for their first yearly decline since 2013.
“Once the U.S. interest-rate cycle changes and one moves to a situation where they say we are done with the quantitative tightening, then one may have a much more secular bull market in emerging markets and India,"" Naren said in an interview in Mumbai last week. “We are in an accumulation phase of investing, where the near-term returns aren’t likely to be very high.""
While the U.S. central bank’s influence on emerging assets is hardly an unknown phenomenon, India’s $2 trillion stock market has also been whipsawed in recent months by homegrown narratives. For Naren, those issues - including speculation on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s election prospects in 2019, and a cash crunch in the non-bank financing sector - will mostly be resolved in the next year, leaving the Fed as the biggest factor.
For the next year at least, Naren doesn’t see investments in Indian equities fetching more than “mid-teen"" percentage in gains. “We shouldn’t talk of multi-baggers now, we can’t expect stocks doubling and one has to invest with expectations of lower returns than that,"" he said. The $4.1 billion ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund -- the biggest that Naren manages -- has returned 12.85 percent annually in the past five years, the best among its peers for that period, according to Value Research Ltd.
A more dovish Fed could help bring foreign investors back to India: they’ve sold more than $4 billion of the nation’s shares so far in 2018, the first year of outflows since 2011. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has outperformed the MSCI India and the MSCI Emerging Markets indexes in the past three years.
Still, local flows into equity funds have helped cushion markets. Investors have poured 1.2 trillion rupees into stock mutual funds this year, according to the Association of Mutual Funds in India. Naren likes small- and mid-caps, infrastructure stocks, banks and consumption-linked shares, he said. Non-bank lenders still aren’t cheap enough, he added.
“We are currently placed in the middle of greed and fear. We are telling people that one shouldn’t be too bearish or too bullish."" “The last accumulation phase in Indian markets was between 2010 and 2013, where people who invested got returns in the later years.""
“Flows in fixed income from retail investors are much lower than what I would like to see. I would like to see more flows in moderate-duration corporate debt funds as they give good returns."" “Too much political uncertainty isn’t good for markets, it doesn’t help decision making for companies.""

Kolkata: ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund hopes to raise  ₹ 1,200-2,000 crore from its India Opportunities Fund, an official said Wednesday.

The issue opens on December 26 and closes on January 9, 2019.
Meanwhile, Haria said that the discontinuation of fresh investments in the monthly dividend option from its largest scheme ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund from Wednesday will not have any major impact on the fund.
“The dividend income corpus is around just 10 per cent of the fund size but we will continue if investors wish to stay. We are trying to convey to the investors to adopt systematic withdrawal plan,"" he said.
The fund house manages about  ₹ 28,000 crore under the scheme. However, the fund will continue to accept money in the schemes growth option.
The step was taken after a dividend tax of 10 per cent was imposed by government.

Mumbai: As the curtains draw down on a year that saw a shake-up in the private banking space, 2019 promises to be a year of redemption and repair. A new set of leaders will assert its authority at ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd next year. While Sandeep Bakhshi has replaced Chanda Kochhar at ICICI Bank, Shikha Sharma of Axis Bank will pass on the mantle to Amitabh Chaudhry in January and Yes Bank is expected to appoint Rana Kapoor’s successor by the end of next month. 
Mumbai: As the curtains draw down on a year that saw a shake-up in the private banking space, 2019 promises to be a year of redemption and repair. A new set of leaders will assert its authority at ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Yes Bank Ltd next year. While Sandeep Bakhshi has replaced Chanda Kochhar at ICICI Bank, Shikha Sharma of Axis Bank will pass on the mantle to Amitabh Chaudhry in January and Yes Bank is expected to appoint Rana Kapoor’s successor by the end of next month.
With three of the leading private banks undergoing a leadership transition, it will be interesting to see the change in strategy and execution. Mint’s analysis of the transition period and access to discussions at these banks shows that it will be back to the basics: focus on quality, bottom line, technology, people and processes.
Bakhshi’s top priority will be to restore ICICI Bank’s credibility, which took a beating after former chief executive Kochhar was forced to exit because of allegations relating to violation of corporate governance. That said, during the September quarter, ICICI Bank swung to a profit after reporting a historic loss in the June quarter.
ALSO READ | Past karma brings home historic loss for ICICI Bank
The new CEO is focused on the bottom line. “Mr Bakhshi keeps reminding us to focus upon two important things,"" said Sandeep Batra, president, ICICI Bank. “First, improve core operating profit further through granular and risk-calibrated business growth. Second, make delivery more seamless and frictionless by decongesting processes and appropriately empowering teams.""
As the bank shifts its strategy to target highly rated borrowers, Batra believes that there has always been a trade-off between the quality of customers and the impact on a bank’s net interest margin (NIM). “However, we are not looking at NIM on a stand-alone basis. We are focused to give better value to our shareholders,"" said Batra.
The bank had started changing its strategy under Kochhar. It reduced the corporate loan exposure on its books to 25% of its total loan book, while increasing the retail loan exposure to 57%.
 Bakhshi is acquainted with the bank’s culture and processes. The institution, therefore, is unlikely to see a radical change in strategy.
That, however, may not be true of Amitabh Chaudhry who will take charge at Axis Bank after having spent eight years at HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Chaudhry’s exposure to technology through his business process outsourcing days at Infosys Ltd, combined with his knowledge of retail financial products through HDFC Standard Life, is expected to give the bank a much-needed facelift and the retail engine that it lacks.
Chaudhry’s focus will be on investing in digital banking, improving operational efficiency and scaling up subsidiaries, according to the bank’s chief financial officer Jairam Sridharan.
However, Chaudhry’s first priority will be to put in place a new team. Axis Bank’s executive director in charge of retail banking Rajiv Anand has replaced Srinivasan Varadarajan, the outgoing deputy managing director in charge of corporate banking. Anand has been appointed the executive director of its wholesale banking arm. Chaudhry’s entry into the Axis Bank corner room is likely to be accompanied by the induction of some close associates from the insurance industry.

Axis Bank’s financial performance has been improving and it is set to enter the last leg of its balance sheet clean-up. The bank reported an 83% jump in net profit in Q2 FY19 and saw its gross NPAs fall for the third straight quarter to 5.96% of its loan book.
“We see a lot of opportunity in growing the housing loan business in the wake of the NBFC crisis. Lower-end small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which are typically underserved, are another area of opportunity,"" said Sridharan, reiterating that the bank’s confidence in corporate lending is still intact. “However, we will make sure not to concentrate on specific clients or industries,"" he said. Axis Bank, like ICICI Bank, has been reducing its exposure to companies and concentrating on the retail franchise.
Among the three banks, Yes Bank’s new CEO, who is yet to be chosen, is likely to face the toughest challenge. The new executive will replace promoter and CEO Rana Kapoor, who was forced to step down after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised concerns about the lender’s poor corporate governance and accounting practices, and under-reporting of bad loans.
Besides restoring the bank’s credibility, the new leader will have to clean up its balance sheet. The bank has seen a flurry of exits from the board in recent months.

Mumbai: Shapoorji Pallonji Group has hired ICICI Securities Ltd to take its solar engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) business public, two people aware of the matter said. The solar EPC business is housed under the group’s flagship company, Sterling and Wilson. Mint reported in July that the group was considering an initial public offering (IPO) of the business.
“They have recently appointed ICICI Securities to start work on the IPO process. Once the work progresses to an advanced stage, they will appoint more bankers,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to reporters.
He added that the group is also looking at a pre-IPO fundraise in the solar engineering business. 
“The pre-IPO funding will help establish a benchmark valuation for the eventual public offering. That process is being run parallelly. The group expects the solar business to fetch a valuation of around $3.5-4 billion,"" he said. 
The IPO could fetch around $400-500 million, this person said, adding the final number will depend on the eventual stake dilution and the valuation of the company.
According to the second person cited above, the solar engineering business could be an attractive prospect for investors given its global geographic presence.
“The business has grown considerably in size over the last few years, especially on the back of overseas business. They earn close to 80% of their revenue from overseas markets. So, the business has significantly lower geographic and currency risks,"" he said, also on condition of anonymity.
“We continually evaluate various capital raising initiatives from time to time for our business, which may include external financing. We have no further comments at this stage but will make an official announcement if and when appropriate,"" said a spokesperson for Sterling & Wilson in an email response to Mint’s queries.
A spokesperson for ICICI Securities declined to comment. 
Jai Mavani, executive director at Sterling and Wilson, expects the group to raise about $1 billion by bringing outside investors into its solar unit, Bloomberg reported in November.
The plan is part of the group’s efforts to reduce debt, Mavani told Bloomberg. A separate listing of Eureka Forbes Ltd, the water purification unit of publicly traded Forbes & Co., and sales of commercial real estate will also be considered, he added.
Sterling and Wilson ventured into the solar EPC business in 2010. The company has a global presence with installed capacity of more than 1,930 megawatts (MW) and 2,450MW under-construction, according to its website.
In addition to India, Sterling and Wilson has implemented solar EPC projects in countries such as Egypt, Morocco, South Africa, the Philippines and Namibia.
Sterling and Wilson recently won a contract to build a 1,177MW solar project in Abu Dhabi, the largest such project in a single location globally.
Apart from the solar EPC business, the 90-year-old company is also involved in a variety of other EPC services. These include MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing), co-generation solutions, transmission and distribution, turnkey data centres, diesel generators as well as operations and management services. Sterling and Wilson operates in more than 25 countries with a strong presence in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, Europe, the Americas and Australia.
The company reported a revenue of  ₹ 6,200 crore during the financial year 2016-17, according to its website."

3. According to market analysts, the merged Bank of Baroda will have the second largest number of branches in India at 9,511. While BoB already has a widespread network, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank are more regional-focused banks. This will help BoB to strengthen its presence in the western, southern and north-eastern regions. Following the merger, the number of state-run banks will come down to 19 from 21.
4. The finance ministry says the amalgamation will help create a “strong globally competitive bank"" in the form of Bank of Baroda by utilising economies of scale and wide-ranging synergies of Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank. BoB will take over all businesses, assets, rights, titles, claims, licenses, approvals and other privileges and all property, borrowings, liabilities and obligations of the other two banks.
5. “The bailout of Dena Bank comes at a cost, and the swap ratio reflects adjustments for net NPA; and, hence, we conclude banks with stronger balance sheet are likely to fetch better value for their businesses (in this case Vijaya Bank) while weaker franchises, which are struggling with stressed loans and provisioning burden, are likely to be bailed out at a discount,"" Elara Capital said.
According to market analysts, while typical merger issues like cultural and social, network overlaps, relocations, and business team integration are likely to be an overhang on the near-term performance of Bank of Baroda, the back-end technology integration will be relatively smooth as all three banks operate on the Finacle CBS Platform."

The ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd stock has come a full circle since it went public two years ago. The life insurer’s scrip is now 4.5% below its issue price, after having risen over 50% within 10 months of listing. The recent underperformance should not be surprising, given that the company has had a bumpy ride on business growth so far in FY19. 
The ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd stock has come a full circle since it went public two years ago. The life insurer’s scrip is now 4.5% below its issue price, after having risen over 50% within 10 months of listing. The recent underperformance should not be surprising, given that the company has had a bumpy ride on business growth so far in FY19.
ICICI Prudential Life decided to focus on its monthly premium plan and low-ticket products, and ignored high-value policies that were the backbone of its new business growth.
As Nomura Securities notes, the life insurer has offered unit-linked plans though the systematic investment plan (SIP) route, which breaks down yearly premium into monthly flows.
Insurance is a push product and the decision to focus on the average Joe, instead of high net-worth individuals with fat pockets, appears to have backfired, notwithstanding the friendly SIP route. 
Hence, the annualized premium equivalent (APE) for the first eight months of FY19 fell 11% from a year ago. ICICI Prudential Life was the only listed life insurer to witness a fall in APE. An update from the insurer shows it didn’t fare well in December too and the APE contraction for the April-December period chalked up to 4%.
The troubles at its parent ICICI Bank Ltd resulted in a change in top management at both the bank and ICICI Prudential Life. Given these changes, the outlook on growth was bound to get murky.
The new managing director N.S. Kanan indicated that the insurer will maintain decent growth, but did not give a target.
But where investors have feared to tread, analysts have stuck to their positive ratings. Of the 25 brokerages featured on Bloomberg, none have a sell rating. Foreign brokerage firms such as Morgan Stanley have retained their overweight rating. They seem to be taking comfort from the improvement in value of new business (VNB) margin, a key gauge for profitability. The VNB margin rose to 17.5% from 11%, which shows that despite the collapse in premium growth, ICICI Prudential Life has been able to squeeze out profits. 
Also, insurance business is a long-term bet and the growth story of the sector continues to remain. But perhaps, it is time to heed the lone dissenter Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. Analysts at the brokerage firm have downgraded the stock to hold.
Jefferies India believes that profitability has peaked and the outlook on new business growth is muted for FY19. The brokerage firm notes that there is a secular fall in all categories, except protection plans. “We expect premium growth to suffer from declines in the high-ticket savings business, capping further improvement in persistency and slower fixed-cost amortization,"" said Jefferies India in a 10 December note on the insurer.
The company’s valuations are modest compared with its peers. Even so, Jefferies believes they do not justify any more given the recent sharp slowdown in business. 
At a 4.5% fall from issue price, the insurer is trading at a multiple of two times its estimated embedded value for FY20. 
ICICI Prudential Life has to either grab more customers faster than everyone else, or go back to doing what it did best—targeting high-premium policies. Else, investors will soon figure out that the initial public offering wasn’t a good bet, whatever the time period."

388,2019-01-19,ICICI,"ICICI Securities has reported a 34% fall in Q3 net profit to  ₹101.2 croreRevenue slumped 18% during the quarter from a year ago

Broking firm ICICI Securities Ltd has had a rough ride from the day it debuted on stock exchanges in April 2018. Investors have given a cold shoulder to not just its stock but, from the looks of it, also its platform. 
Broking firm ICICI Securities Ltd has had a rough ride from the day it debuted on stock exchanges in April 2018. Investors have given a cold shoulder to not just its stock but, from the looks of it, also its platform.
ICICI Securities reported a net profit of  ₹101.2 crore in the December quarter (Q3), which is 34% lower from a year ago. Revenue fell 18% from a year ago, dragged by a lacklustre performance in all segments. The company makes money every time customers use its platform to trade or buy investment products off its shelves.
Broking has a lion’s share of total revenues and therefore, the 17% fall in brokerage revenues contributed to the drop in overall revenues. Recall that equity markets were roiled by the liquidity crisis in the non-banking finance space in September and October. Since these volatile times gave retail customers cold feet, ICICI Securities saw its retail brokerage slip, while business from institutions grew a bit.
The company’s distribution business struggled as well, with revenue here coming 11% lower than last year. But the blame for this can be partly laid at the doors of the market regulator for banning up-fronting of distribution commission, and lowering expense ratios. The impact of this twin blow will be felt even in the coming quarters and the ICICI Securities management has guided 25-30% decline in distribution yields from FY18 levels, according to HDFC Securities Ltd.
ICICI Securities saw its active customer base grow at a modest 10% in the third quarter. It has lost the crown of being the largest retail broking firm to rival Zerodha, which saw its active customer base surge to 847,000 as of December, marginally higher than ICICI Securities’ base of 845,000, BloombergQuint reported citing data from the National Stock Exchange.
The silver lining for ICICI Securities was that average daily trading volume continued to remain robust, providing some visibility on earnings from its broking operations.
What is in store for the firm in the coming quarters?
The outlook for the brokerage firm is not sanguine. ICICI Securities needs to diversify its revenue but it had little success in the past quarter. That said, distribution income from insurance is expected to be better in the final quarter of FY19, according to HDFC Securities."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them.
For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help.

382,2019-01-24,ICICI,"Value of new business margin has moderated 50 basis points in Q3, despite a rise in protection policiesThe private sector insurer reported disappointing numbers for the December quarter

The worst fears of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s investors are coming true, with the company’s stock dropping over 11% on Wednesday.
The private sector insurer reported disappointing numbers for the December quarter. It was the only listed insurer to report a contraction in annualized premium equivalent (APE). Its APE declined 2.1% for the third quarter, while it showed a drop of 4.2% for the nine-month period ended 31 December.
“The 10% increase in the stock price in the past one month was not supported by fundamentals and, in that context, 3QFY19 performance could temper any build up in market expectations,"" Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
However, the silver lining is that the company’s valuations are modest versus peers such as HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd. While this may limit downside, much depends on how ICICI PruLife performs in the coming quarters.

However, the silver lining is that the company’s valuations are modest versus peers such as HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd. While this may limit downside, much depends on how ICICI PruLife performs in the coming quarters.
The signs are not encouraging though. As analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd noted, the life insurer’s value of new business margin has moderated 50 basis points in the third quarter, despite an increase in protection policies. Protection policies are margin-friendly and, hence, every insurer is trying to sell these products more.
Indeed, ICICI PruLife’s protection APE doubled, which is the silver lining in its earnings. But Jefferies India warns here that the growth comes through group policies, which are relatively lower margin, rather than individual. This doesn’t bode well for future persistency as growth from group insurance tends to be one-time jumps. The insurer didn’t have much luck on persistency either as its 13th-month ratio dropped. The ratio shows whether customers continue to pay premiums after the first year. To be fair, all other durations have gained and analysts are not worried just yet.
In 2017, insurance firms had wooed investors for their initial public offerings (IPOs) on the promise of being a sunrise industry. Prospectuses of firms including ICICI PruLife elaborated on the immense opportunity of growth given the low penetration of insurance products in India.
That growth story seems to have derailed, at least for ICICI PruLife. As this column had noted earlier this month, the insurer’s focus on breaking down premiums into systematic investment plans seems to have backfired.
But an insurance company is not a mutual fund and volume doesn’t come easy as insurance is a push product.
Hence, ICICI PruLife’s growth numbers are not going down well with investors and even analysts. The company’s shares are now 8% lower to its IPO issue price of  ₹334."

379,2019-01-25,ICICI,"It is prudent to keep your investments and insurance plans separate If the SIP is discontinued before three years, the insurance cover stops immediately

Did you know that your systematic investment plan (SIP) could also provide you with an insurance cover? Currently provided by three companies in the market, it is a product that gives you the flavour of equity fund investment along with a free life cover.
“The idea of a SIP Insure insurance cover is that it acts as a bundled product allowing you to systematically save for your long-term financial goal and in the event of an unforeseen circumstance, where the nominee becomes the recipient of a free life insurance cover,"" says Sundeep Sikka, executive director and chief executive officer, Reliance Mutual Fund. “It is free for the investor and the asset management company bears the cost."" says Sikka. “The target consumer for such products is generally any retail investor who is looking to invest in SIPS for their long term goals,"" said Sikka. Reliance Mutual Fund and Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd launched it in 2008 whereas ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund launched it in May 2012.
But are these products worth your money?
Here the AMCS bear the cost by taking a group cover which is cheaper and hence you get the insurance cover for free. “The mutual fund companies buy group insurance policies in wholesale for these bundled products. No health check-ups are required in such plans,"" said Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive officer of Valueresearchonline.com, an online investment advisory platform. In a SIP plus insurance product, an SIP subscriber can begin at the age of 18 and pick select schemes of the chosen AMC to convert it into an SIP combined with an insurance cover. The validity of the bundled insurance cover depends on the age brackets and differs with the companies. The entry age limit is 51 years for all the three companies. The insurance part covers you till you turn 55 in case of ICICI Prudential and 60, in case of Aditya Birla MF. The insurance cover although is only applicable if you do SIP for a minimum of three years. However, in case of Reliance MF, SIP Insure benefit will be applicable from 45 days, that is if the demise of investor happens after 45 days of applying, sum assured will be provided to the registered nominee. There are a few situations where the insurance cover may be denied to you. Partial or full redemption of units before the tenure or till you turn 55 (in case of ICICI Prudential MF and Reliance MF) or 60 (in case of Aditya Birla MF) will lead to cessation of the insurance cover. In cases of a default in three consecutive instalments or five separate occasions, the insurance cover will cease although for Aditya Birla MF the insurance cover ceases if the subscriber has defaulted for two consecutive payments or four separate ones.
“It may seem like there are too many conditions binding the product but considering the life cover is coming for free, such conditions are required to safeguard the product as well otherwise it will bleed, However, the fact that there are too many conditions complicate the product for the investor and makes it less popular,"" said Deepali Sen, founder of Mumbai-based Srujan Financial Advisers LLP.
In Reliance MF and ICICI Prudential, the minimum instalment is  ₹500 and for Aditya Birla MF the minimum instalment varies from scheme to scheme beginning from  ₹500.
“For the AMCS it is a case of sticky SIPS because it is unlikely for the SIPS to be discontinued mid-way if it has a life cover attached to it. However, I would advise investors to go for a term plan and not depend just on this one,"" said Sen.
If the SIP is discontinued before three years, the insurance cover stops immediately. If the SIP is discontinued after three years, you will receive a cover equivalent to the fund value of the units as on the start of the renewal year. This amount is subject to a maximum of 100 times the monthly instalment in case of ICICI Prudential
AMC and Aditya Birla and 120 times in case of Reliance Nippon, capped at  ₹50 lakh. All three companies provide a sum insured of 10 times the monthly SIP instalment in the first year, 50 times the monthly SIP instalment and from the third year onwards. While Reliance Nippon offers a cover equivalent to 120 times the monthly SIP instalment, the other two provide it at 100 times the monthly SIP instalment, capped at a maximum of  ₹25 lakh for Aditya Birla MF and  ₹50 lakh for ICICI Prudential MF.
Should you depend on the life cover?
Taking the example of a 30 year old, living in Mumbai who has started an SIP of  ₹10,000 a month. According to the AMC rules, her insurance cover after the third year will become  ₹10 lakh. For a separate term cover of  ₹10 lakh, premiums can be as low as  ₹2,620 annually and range higher up, according to Policybazaar.com.
“Even though you are getting the life cover at such low prices, there may not be any harm in going for such products but you cannot depend just on the life cover provided by the SIP plan,"" said Kapil Mehta, co-founder of Securenow.in, an insurance web aggregator.
“Since your life cover is dependent on your SIP contributions, the term life cover may not be appropriate according to what you might need"", added Mehta."
378,2019-01-26,ICICI,"Planning to take a loan? Consider one against securities since it is cheaper than a credit card or personal loan  Most banks allow you to take loan against securities, but it comes at a cost

Mumbai: There was a time not long ago when you had to wait for days to get a loan sanctioned. Today, you can get loans online and through apps within a day. Some banks even promise you to give loan within minutes and seconds. Since loans are easily available it doesn’t mean you have to borrow indiscriminately. The loans that are available on tap are unsecured loans, which generally have a higher interest rate. In case of secured loans such as loan against property and loan against securities, the interest rate is lower. Here is a look at how it works:
What is loan against securities?
Do you have securities such as insurance policies, mutual funds, direct stocks, fixed maturity plans, exchange traded funds and savings bonds? If yes, did you know that you can pledge these securities and get a loan in case you are in need of it? The amount and the interest rate can vary from bank to bank and the loan is offered as an overdraft facility. Some banks allow you to take the loan online. To take loan against shares you may need to have a demat account with the bank. State Bank of India (SBI) allows you to take a maximum loan of  ₹20 lakh and a minimum of  ₹50,000 and the loan-to-value ratio is 50% of the value of the shares. In case of mutual funds, you will get loan on up to 50% of the net asset value, according to ICICI Bank Ltd. In case of life insurance policies the minimum amount is  ₹50,000 and the maximum amount is  ₹5 crore. To take a loan against securities, along with the securities that you want to pledge, you also have to provide identity proof, address proof and signature.
The cost
Most banks allow you to take loan against securities and it comes at a cost. The interest rate varies based on the security and the bank. For instance, SBI currently offers interest rate of 10.95% on loan against shares, mutual funds and dual advantage funds. For loan against sovereign gold bond, the interest rate is 10.45% whereas for loan against national savings certificate, Kisan Vikas Patra, RBI relief bonds and insurance it is 13.10%. Besides the interest rate, you have to pay annual maintenance fee, processing fee, stamp duty, credit information company charges, prepayment charges and other fees. For example, HDFC Bank Ltd charges annual maintenance charge of up to 50 basis points for equity, debt, non-convertible bonds and bonds with a minimum cap of  ₹1,000 and maximum of  ₹5,000. In case of processing charges, you may either have to pay a flat fee or a percentage of the loan amount. For instance, ICICI Bank charges a nonrefundable processing charge of  ₹3,500 plus goods and services tax (GST) or 0.25% of the loan amount will a cap of a minimum amount of  ₹5,000 plus GST.
Should you opt for it?
Ideally you should save first and then spend. However, if you are in a situation where you need money and have to take a loan, you should first evaluate the options that are available. Look for loans with lower interest rates.
For instance, credit cards if you don’t pay during the grace period, will cost you 22-44% in interest. In case of personal loan it can range between 12-24% per annum. If you opt for loan against securities, it will be in the range of 10-14% per annum. Hence, it would make sense to go for loan against securities if you have the option. “Loans should be your last resort. Once you have decided to opt for a loan, you should shop for the cheaper options available to you. Secured loans such as loan against property and loan against securities will be cheaper than unsecured loans such as personal loan and credit card. In situations where the securities are giving lower returns than the loan you are taking, logically you should sell it. However, it will depend on case-to-case basis,"" said Melvin Joseph, a Sebi-registered investment adviser and founder of Finvin Financial Planners."

381,2019-01-28,ICICI,"NuPower Renewables founder Deepak Kochhar and Videocon group MD Venugopal Dhoot also namedThe CBI carried out searches at four locations in Mumbai, including the Mumbai offices of Videocon and NuPower

New Delhi: In a move that brought to a head its year-long probe into the case, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday booked former ICICI Bank Ltd chief executive Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon group managing director Venugopal Dhoot for criminal conspiracy and cheating.
With the probe agency accusing Kochhar of receiving illegal gratification, cheating and criminal conspiracy when she was at the helm of the bank, the spotlight is back on financial crimes involving top executives of the banking sector.
While Deepak Kochhar declined to comment on the matter, calls and messages to Dhoot remained unanswered. Chanda Kochhar could not be reached for comment.
CBI had registered a preliminary enquiry against Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot in March 2018 to investigate irregularities in the  ₹40,000 crore loan made by a consortium of lenders to the Videocon group. It also pointed to an alleged conflict of interest in a  ₹3,250 crore loan made to the Videocon group by ICICI Bank.
While Chanda Kochhar, one of the members of the loan sanctioning committee, has been accused of alleged “criminal conspiracy to cheat ICICI Bank dishonestly by abusing her official position"" and receiving “illegal gratification and undue benefit through her husband"", the first information report (FIR) filed by CBI on 22 January also names, among others, Sandeep Bakhshi, chief operating officer of ICICI Bank, as well as K.V. Kamath, who heads New Development Bank of BRICS countries and was managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank from 1996 till 2009.
Both of them, along with six others named in the FIR, could be investigated in the future.
“These loans were sanctioned in violation of credit policy of the bank during the relevant period (from 2009 to 2011). These loans… were sanctioned on various dates by various committees having senior officials of ICICI Bank namely Sandeep Bakshi, K. Ramkumar, Sonjoy Chatterjee, N.S. Kannan, Zarin Daruwala, Rajiv Sabharwal, K.V. Kamath and Homi Khusrokhan… The role of these senior officers of the sanctioning committee may also be investigated,"" the FIR states.
The said loan by ICICI Bank to the Videocon group was part of a  ₹40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012, and was in contravention of “the Banking Regulation Act, Reserve Bank of India guidelines and credit policy of the bank"".
Dhoot had allegedly, as part of a quid pro quo arrangement, given  ₹64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd that he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. It was alleged that Dhoot transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for  ₹9 lakh, six months after receiving the loan from ICICI Bank—an allegation that Kochhar had earlier denied to Mint.
On Thursday, CBI carried out searches at four locations in Mumbai and Aurangabad, including the Mumbai offices of Videocon, NuPower and Supreme Energy Pvt. Ltd, another company founded by Deepak Kochhar.

It was alleged that Videocon pumped money into NuPower Renewables, a firm owned by Deepak Kochhar, husband of Chanda Kochhar.
Amid the raging controversy, Chanda Kochhar stepped down as the bank’s Managing Director and CEO in October.
When asked about the inspection of the six companies with regard to the ICICI Bank controversy, Corporate Affairs Secretary Injeti Srinivas said it is at a “very advanced stage"".
The inspection is being carried out by the Regional Director (Western Region) under Section 206 (5) of the Companies Act, 2013.
“I think they (RD) have completed their inquiries, they have taken the depositions from whomever they want to take and I think they are preparing the report,"" he told PTI.
Section 206 provides powers to call for information, inspect books and conduct inquiries.
As per Section 206 (5), the central government may, if it is satisfied that the circumstances so warrant, direct inspection of books and papers of a company by an inspector appointed by it for the purpose.

New Delhi: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram Sunday slammed the CBI for ""indiscriminately targeting"" some of the bankers, saying the agency has received ""ultimate certificate"" on its action from Union minister Arun Jaitley, who had criticised it.
In a series of tweets, the former finance and home minister said he was glad that Jaitley's conscience and legal acumen have finally stirred to condemn the ""indiscriminate targeting of eminent bankers"", in cases where the allegations are about thousands of crores of rupees.
""The CBI has received the ultimate certificate from the one who has the best ring-side seat, the Finance Minister (on leave): 'Adventurism and megalomania have overtaken investigators'!,"" he said.
Chidambaram said the government was in slumber when there was ""indiscriminate targeting"" of distinguished IAS officers and others, in cases where the allegations are about small sums of money, in an apparent reference to the Aircel-Maxis case in which a number of IAS officers have been named in the chargesheet.
Chidambaram has also been named as accused by the CBI in the case.
""'What cause are we serving or actually hurting?' asks the FM. He knows the answer. The cause of justice,"" he said.
The CBI is also probing the alleged role of Chidambaram as finance minister in INX media case and had last week sought the sanction of the central government to prosecute him.
Jaitley has criticised the CBI for planning to question eminent bankers like K V Kamath in the Chanda Kochhar case of alleged cheating and fraud in the ICICI-Videocon loan case.
Jaitley, in a write-up on Facebook, had slammed the CBI for naming the ""who's who of the banking industry"" without concentrating on the ""bull's eye"" in the case.
He had written a day after the agency filed an FIR against Kochhar and others in the ICICI case: ""There is a fundamental difference between investigative adventurism and professional investigation.""
Jaitley, who was holding the charge of finance ministry but is now on leave as he is away in the US for treatment, had said while adventurism leads to media leaks, ruins reputations and eventually invites strictures and not convictions, professional investigation targets the real accused on the basis of actual and admissible evidence and rules out fanciful presumptions.
""One of the reasons why our conviction rates are poor is that adventurism and megalomania overtake our investigators and professionalism takes the back seat,"" Jaitley wrote.
On Thursday, the CBI filed an FIR against former ICICI Bank chief Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and industrialist V N Dhoot in a  ₹3,250-crore loan involving the Videocon Group and the ICICI Bank.

NEW DELHI :
A fresh round of infighting gripped the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday, with interim chief M. Nageswara Rao being accused of partisan behaviour by another officer of the agency.
With the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led selection panel removing former chief Alok Verma on 10 January, the government had hoped to restore order in the agency. However, with Rao once again being elevated to the post of interim chief, amid a spate of transfer orders sanctioned by him, the equilibrium within the CBI is once again likely to be rocked with Rao being accused of “unfairly targeting"" officers.
An impending battle, former senior CBI officials said, could “derail extremely important investigations such as the ICICI Bank case, which the agency has recently registered. Focus should now be on making the agency work.""
On Monday, CBI superintendent of police (SP) Rajah Balaji moved the Supreme Court challenging his recent transfer order by Rao to the CBI academy from the anti-corruption branch. Among the allegations levelled against Rao, Balaji has claimed that he was “being targeted by Rao"".
On 20 January, in an abrupt churn, Rao transferred 20 officials within the agency, including Balaji who was moved to the CBI academy. Balaji was also awarded the medal for meritorious service, last year.
While CBI said it “did not comment on internal processes,"" another person familiar with the developments said that the genesis of the tussle between Balaji and Rao “dates back to the time when Balaji served under Rao in Chennai where the latter was posted as joint director (Chennai Zone). Problems had crept up then itself and now Balaji has gone against Rao, who is the sitting chief.""
Balaji investigated the Mecca Masjid blast case, the Madhumita Shukla murder case and was supervising several probes in bank fraud cases registered in Karnataka where he was posted, while Rao was joint director (Chennai)."
366,2019-01-30,ICICI,"Kochhar became the managing director and chief executive of the leading private sector lender in May 2009The Srikrishna panel observed that Kochhar violated bank policies and other rules and regulations

MUMBAI :
Chanda Kochhar said she is ""disappointed, hurt and shocked"" by ICICI Bank decision Wednesday evening to treat her resignation as a ""termination for cause"" after an independent probe indicted her.
Kochhar, the first woman to head a bank in India, also said she served the ICICI group for 34 long years ""with all my dedication and hard work"" and the bank's latest decision has caused her ""immense hurt and pain"".
An independent enquiry conducted by retired Supreme Court judge B N Srikrishna has indicted Kochhar, who had led the bank for nearly a decade, for violating various regulations, following which the lender decided to stop all unpaid retirement benefits and also recover bonuses paid to her since 2009.
""I am utterly disappointed, hurt and shocked by the decision,"" Kochhar, who was on leave from June and finally resigned in October 2018, said in a statement Wednesday evening.
She was quick to add that none of the credit decisions at the bank are unilateral and the bank has established processes and systems which involve a committee-based collective decision-making.
""The organisational design and the structure obviate the possibility of conflict of interest,"" she claimed.
The remarks come days after the CBI named in the FIR Kochhar, her husband Deepak along with VN Dhoot of Videocon Group and the then entire credit committee members of ICICI Bank who are today heading other large financial institutions.
The case relates to a  ₹3,250-crore the bank had extended in 2011 to the Videocon group and the ensuing benefits his husband gained in business from the Dhoots. The loan became dud and the entire group has gone bankrupt.
Kochhar said she had served the ICICI group for 34 years ""with all my dedication and hard work"" and the decision from the bank today has caused her ""immense hurt and pain"".
""I have pursued my career as an independent professional with utmost honesty, dignity and integrity. I continue to have faith and belief in my conduct as a professional and I am certain that truth will ultimately prevail,"" she said.
The Srikrishna panel observed that Kochhar violated bank policies and other rules and regulations. Based on the findings of the panel, the ICICI Bank board Wednesday advised to take ""further actions as may be warranted in the matter"".
Meanwhile, present chief executive Sandeep Bakhshi said in an analyst call after the earnings announcement that the bank has put out a statement about Kochhar, and their role now is limited to cooperating with regulatory agencies.
Surprisingly, it can be recalled that in March 2018, the same board of ICICI Bank had given a clean chit to Kochhar with full-backing and had said there was no question of favouritism, nepotism or conflicts of interest on her part in granting loans to Videocon Industries or any other company.
The board, following the receipt of the enquiry report, Wednesday decided to treat ""the separation of Kochhar from the bank as a 'termination for cause' under the bank's internal policies, schemes and the code of conduct, with all attendant consequences"".
These, the statement said, include revocation of all her existing and future entitlements such as any unpaid amounts, unpaid bonuses or increments, unvested and vested and unexercised stock options, and medical benefits.
The board has also asked the bank to take steps for ""clawback of all bonuses paid to her between April 2009 and March 2018, and to take such further actions as may be warranted in the matter"".
Kochhar became the managing director and chief executive of the leading private sector lender in May 2009 and left the bank in October 2018.
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank Wednesday reported 2.7% decline in standalone net profit to  ₹1,604.91 crore for the third quarter ended December 2018 as provisions for bad loans increased."

New Delhi: Nearly a week after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) booked former ICICI Bank chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group managing director (MD) Venugopal Dhoot for criminal conspiracy and cheating, the Justice B.N Srikrishna panel found her guilty of violating the bank’s code of conduct.
The report further seals Chanda Kochhar’s fate, with all three accused and others — including Sandeep Bakhshi, chief operating officer of ICICI Bank, as well as K.V. Kamath, who heads the New Development Bank of BRICS countries and was managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank from 1996 till 2009 — likely to be summoned soon by the CBI in connection with the investigation.
“The Enquiry Report….concluded, primarily on account of ineffectively dealing with conflict of interest and due disclosure or recusal requirements, that Ms Chanda Kochhar was in violation of the ICICI Bank Code of Conduct, its framework for dealing with conflict of interest and fiduciary duties, and in terms of applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations,"" ICICI Bank said in a statement.
The enquiry report also concluded that Chanda Kochhar’s “lack of diligence with respect to annual disclosures as required by the bank in terms of its internal policies, the ICICI Bank Code of Conduct and applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations on her interests (direct or indirect) towards avoidance of conflict of interest, when considered that the Bank’s processes were dependent solely on the directors discharging their fiduciary duty to recuse themselves and avoid conflict, implies that the Bank’s processes were rendered ineffective by her approach to such disclosures and avoidance of conflict"".
On its part, ICICI bank said in a statement that it would decide “to treat the separation of Ms Chanda Kochhar from the Bank as a ‘Termination for Cause’ under the Bank’s internal policies, schemes and the Code of Conduct, with all attendant consequences (including revocation of all her existing and future entitlements such as any unpaid amounts, unpaid bonuses or increments, unvested and vested & unexercised stock options, and medical benefits), and require the clawback of all bonuses paid from April 2009 until March 2018, and to take such further actions as may be warranted in the matter.""

365,2019-01-31,ICICI,"An ongoing probe by CBI will act as an overhang as it reportedly involves the current leadership as wellDelinquencies are far lower and gross bad loan ratio has improved to 7.75%

Even as a new chief starts to clean and fortify ICICI Bank Ltd, the shadow of former head Chanda Kochhar has come back to haunt it.
An independent committee headed by a former Supreme Court judge has found Kochhar guilty of circumventing the bank’s policies.
The allegations pertain to Kochhar extending loans to the Videocon group without disclosing her conflict of interest through the involvement of her husband.
The lender in a release has sought to allay fears, saying that there are no implications of this on the financials of the bank.
However, what will perturb investors is the initial unflinching support of the bank’s board to Kochhar, when it said last year, “ICICI Bank Board expresses and reposes full faith and confidence in its MD & CEO.""
The only consolation for investors is that the bank made changes in its leadership before the findings of the report came out.
But some big questions remain on whether the board colluded or whether it was just in awe of a star leader. Another question is whether there is a risk of more skeletons tumbling out. The ongoing probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) will act as an overhang too, especially since it reportedly involves the current leadership as well.
To be sure, ICICI Bank’s performance over the last three years has seen it pay for past mistakes.
New managing director and chief executive officer Sandeep Bakhshi in his clean-up drive has beefed up provisioning immensely. For the December quarter, provisions rose 19% and the coverage ratio is now an impressive 76%.
Clearly, he is leaving nothing to chance.
Delinquencies are far lower and gross bad loan ratio has improved to 7.75%.
It is evident that decks are being cleared for future growth and the 14% loan growth for the quarter underscores that.
Since the growth comes from the less-risky retail portfolio, which grew by 22%, the outlook on asset quality is positive.
But these positives seem to be already factored in the stock given that it has risen 14% in the last three months.
The worst may indeed be behind ICICI Bank but the stock is likely to take some heat from the conclusions of the report. Especially since the whole report has not been made public and a separate probe by CBI is on.
The scrip trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY20. That could change, provided ICICI Bank clears the air around its past quickly."
364,2019-01-31,ICICI,"Srikrishna panel report says the ex-CEO breached bank’s code of conductICICI Bank said its board decided to treat Kochhar’s separation from the lender as a “termination for cause” 

Mumbai: A little more than a year ago, Chanda Kochhar couldn’t have been faulted for feeling on top of the world, having been named as one of the world’s most powerful women by Forbes.
On Wednesday, Kochhar, 57, was sacked as chief executive of ICICI Bank, India’s second-largest private lender, after a panel indicted her on several counts. Perhaps, the fall was the consequence of using that power unwisely.
The ICICI Bank board terminated her services following a board meeting, where it discussed the Srikrishna panel report that found the former banker to have breached the bank’s code of conduct.
“Chanda Kochhar was in violation of the ICICI Bank code of conduct, its framework for dealing with conflict of interest and fiduciary duties, and in terms of applicable Indian laws, rules and regulations,"" the bank said in an exchange filing. It also faulted her for lack of diligence with respect to annual disclosures as required by the bank.
The Srikrishna panel concluded that under Kochhar, the bank and she herself failed to make crucial disclosures relating to loans and did not follow the required recusal policies while sanctioning them to parties related to her.
The bank plans to claw back all bonuses, amounting to about  ₹10 crore, paid between April 2009 and March 2018.
The findings of the report will add to Kochhar’s worries after the CBI lodged an FIR against her, husband Deepak Kochhar, Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot and six other entities last week for criminal conspiracy and cheating.
CBI had registered a preliminary enquiry against Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot in March 2018 to investigate irregularities in the  ₹40,000 crore loan made by a consortium of lenders to Videocon group.
On 1 June, Mint was the first to report that Kochhar had been asked to proceed on indefinite leave until an independent enquiry to probe alleged cases of impropriety could be concluded. Soon after this, the Srikrishna panel was appointed to look into the allegations and then, in October, Kochhar came out of the enforced indefinite leave to quit the lender.
The Srikrishna panel investigated claims made in a whistleblower report, which alleged that Kochhar had compromised the bank’s credit disbursal policies, favouring certain clients related to her husband and violating basic banking code of conduct, without caring about adherence to corporate governance standards.
The Srikrishna panel report is based on Kochhar’s role during the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2018. The panel, which was assisted by an undisclosed law firm and a forensic and investigative services firm, said Kochhar had snubbed the rules and regulations in her interests (direct or indirect) towards avoidance of conflict of interest.
Kochhar did this despite being aware that the bank’s processes were dependent solely on the directors discharging their fiduciary duty and it was important to recuse themselves for avoiding conflict, said the report.
Kochhar said in a statement on Wednesday that ICICI Bank’s decision has caused her “immense hurt and pain"".
“I am utterly disappointed, hurt and shocked by the decision,"" she said. “I reiterate that none of the credit decisions at the bank are unilateral. I have never shied away from taking tough decisions whenever required to be taken in the best interest of the organization. I continue to have faith and belief in my conduct as a professional and I am certain that truth will ultimately prevail.""
On Wednesday, the bank said its board had decided to treat the separation of Kochhar from the bank as a “Termination for Cause"", meaning such a termination would entail consequences including revocation of all her existing and future entitlements such as any unpaid amounts, unpaid bonuses or increments, unvested and vested and unexercised stock options, and medical benefits, said the bank’s board.
The bank said it might take further actions, if warranted.
However, the bank said the panel’s findings would have no implication on its published financial statements.
It is to be seen how the CBI FIR and the Srikrishna panel report affect Kochhar’s directorships in other firms and the ongoing probe by the US SEC, since the charges against her are serious in nature, raising questions about the way the bank functioned during her decade-long tenure.
Kochhar has been in the eye of a storm ever since the Serious Fraud Investigation Office summoned her in March 2018 in connection with loans extended to fugitive Mehul Choksi’s Gitanjali Group.
Later, on 20 March, a whistleblower complained against the bank and its top management, including Kochhar, alleging a deliberate delay in recognizing impairment in 31 loan accounts between fiscal 2008 and March 2016 to save on provisioning costs and inflate profits by $1.3 billion over eight years. Mint reported this first on 25 June.
The decisive blow was delivered by allegations of granting loans to Videocon as a quid pro quo for its dealings with her husband Deepak. On 12 April, Sebi began a probe into alleged corporate governance lapses at the bank and failure to make adequate disclosures about the bank’s loan to Videocon group."
363,2019-01-31,ICICI,"Allegations of conflict of interest against Chanda Kochhar first arose in October 2016At the heart of the scandal was a  ₹3,250 crore loan to Videocon Group

ICICI Bank Ltd. is seeking to claw back bonuses and stock options paid to departed chief executive officer Chanda Kochhar. That gives shareholders of the nation’s second-biggest private sector lender some justice. But the board should be made to hang its head in shame.
Allegations of conflict of interest against the CEO first arose in October 2016. At the heart of the scandal was a  ₹3,250 crore ($456 million) loan to Videocon Group. Kochhar’s husband had beneficial business dealings with Videocon managing director Venugopal Dhoot, yet the CEO didn’t recuse herself from the credit committee that sanctioned the loan in 2012.
For more than a year, the board of directors sat on a whistleblower’s complaint. Worse still, when the media started asking questions, chairman Mahendra Kumar Sharma gave Kochhar a hasty vote of confidence in March last year. Finally, when it became clear to everyone except the board that her continuing at the bank was a problem, it ordered an inquiry by a retired judge. Even then, Kochhar agreed only to go on leave. Shortly afterwards, Sharma finished his term and was gone.
It’s only now that the inquiry has found Kochhar violated the bank’s code of conduct that ICICI has decided to treat her October resignation — tendered while she was on leave — as a termination. Kochhar says she is “utterly disappointed, hurt and shocked' by the decision.
She’s right to be shocked. Which Indian board willingly reopens a book after making every effort to close it? Even now, the new directors would have liked to forget the whole thing and move on. That’s impossible, now that the government’s investigative agency has charged Kochhar, her husband and Videocon’s Dhoot with criminal conspiracy and cheating. The Central Bureau of Investigation’s first information report also names Kochhar’s predecessor and successor among people who could be investigated in the future.
Suddenly it has become important for ICICI to draw a line between Kochhar and the bank; this time last year, she was the bank. The directors who helped her cultivate that image of invincibility abdicated their duty to uphold governance. Leave aside the Videocon loan, and the “illegal gratification and undue benefit"" Indian sleuthsallege she received via her husband. Ask instead why the board was giving her a performance bonus that it now wants to take back. For piling up bad loans?
ICICI directors shouldn’t get a free pass from regulators. Otherwise, they’ll just show up at other boards, perpetuating a culture of CEO worship that’s at odds with their role as stewards of public shareholders. Indian investors deserve better.

“We fear legal options being pressed from both sides, pulling in current/past executives, and which at best would be a nuisance and noise, to a worst-case situation of digging out unpleasant issues and being a drag to the stock price.""
Jefferies maintains a buy rating and raises its price target to 450 rupees from 385 rupees, noting improvement in asset quality, growth and core profitability.
“ICICI Bank continues to show promise with trending lower new nonperforming loan formation, and balance sheet growth with higher granularity on both asset and liability side.""
Citigroup Global Markets (Manish Shukla)
Pre-provision operating profit and lower provisions should help the bank’s return on equity. Citi lowers its profit-after-tax estimate 24 percent to factor in delay in resolutions by the National Company Law Tribunal. It maintains a buy rating and raises its price target to 450 rupees from 390 rupees.
Morgan Stanley (Anil Agarwal)
“Impaired loans declined and coverage increased to about 60 percent. Provisioning catchup is done, implying normalized earnings"" from the first quarter of next fiscal year.
The report on Kochhar submitted to the board “has no implications for the bank’s published numbers.""
“Valuation still implies asset quality stress, which we think is now firmly behind the bank. Foreign ownership has continued to trend down and is now at a 15-year low.""
Morgan Stanley maintains an overweight rating on the bank and lifts its price target to 525 rupees from 510 rupees. The broker recently listed ICICI as one of 10 emerging markets bank stocks to invest in this year.
Target Investing (Sameer Kalra)
“Though nothing has been mentioned of the impact of the report on the financials, we believe this further enhances the possibility of further investigation of other deals that Ms. Kochhar had during the position in the bank and increases chances of CBI investigation to probe further.""
Goldman Sachs (Rahul Jain)
Goldman notes a “strong 3Q operating performance"" with better-than-expected profit after tax and the problem of nonperforming loans mostly resolved.
“We believe ICBK is well positioned to deliver an average ROA of 1.8 percent and an average ROE of 16 percent"" over the next two fiscal years, driven by improving net interest margins.
Bloomberg Intelligence (Diksha Gera)
ICICI’s 2.7% profit drop may be misleading as pretax profit climbed 28%, led by a strong revenue rebound. Provisions will likely stay elevated in the next one or two quarters as big stressed exposures get resolved.
Overall asset quality should be positive as corporate exposure rated BB and below fell 14% in fiscal 3Q.

""Budget could give some indication of the government's commitment to fiscal consolidation, which is one of the main sensitivities in the sovereign rating"", says Fitch Ratings. “Higher pre-election spending could risk a second consecutive year of fiscal slippage relative to the government's targets and would further delay plans to reduce the high general government fiscal deficit and debt burden,"" Fitch Rating said in a note.

Axis Bank posted robust performance as bottomline jumped 131% year on year at  ₹1,680 crore, ahead of analyst estimates, on the back of non-interest income growth of 54% year on year and net interest income (NII) of  ₹5,600 crore vs expectation of  ₹5,400 crore. Gross slippage at  ₹3700 crore for the quarter was largely in line with expectations.
""We believe that the bank is closer to the end of its stress loan recognition cycle, which along with improving PCR clearly indicates sharp moderation in credit cost in FY20E.

357,2019-02-02,ICICI,"Former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot are named in the ECIRThe Enforcement Directorate is soon expected to summon the accused named in the ECIR

New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a criminal case of money laundering against former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar, Videocon Group promoter Venugopal Dhoot and others to probe alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning of Rs. 1,875 crore loans by the bank to the corporate group, officials said Saturday.
They said the central probe agency filed an Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, taking cognisance of a CBI complaint filed on the matter last month.
An ECIR is the ED's equivalent of a police FIR.
The officials said the agency would probe if alleged kickbacks generated in the loan deal were laundered to create tainted assets.
The ED is soon expected to summon the accused named in the ECIR. The list of accused in the ED case is the same as that of the CBI, they said.
The CBI had named Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, and Dhoot and his companies — Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) and Videocon Industries Limited (VIL). It also named Supreme Energy, a company founded by Dhoot, and Nupower Renewables, a company controlled by Deepak Kochhar, in the FIR.
The CBI has slapped sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal conspiracy, cheating and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act on all the accused.
It had also conducted raids in the case.
It is alleged that Dhoot had invested in Deepak Kochhar's company Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on 1 May 2009.
The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI alleged.  
During its preliminary inquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth Rs. 1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June, 2009 and October, 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank, which have now become part of the probe.
""Existing outstanding in the accounts of these private group companies were adjusted in Rupee Term Loan of Rs. 1,730 crore sanctioned by ICICI Bank under refinance of domestic debt under consortium arrangement on 26 April 2012,"" a CBI spokesperson had said.
The loans were declared non-performing assets in 2012, causing a loss of Rs. 1,730 crore to the bank, it alleged."

The culture of investing in debt funds is yet to take root as retail investors are yet to understand the power of investing in debt instruments. For an investor who is concerned with equity market volatility, debt market should be the go-to option.
Over the past few years, the Indian debt market has shown impressive growth, backed by regulatory reforms, improved demand-supply dynamics, robust economic growth and channelling of money from pension funds, insurance (companies) and mutual funds. However, we believe a lot of investor education is required around debt funds. And Amfi’s campaign is likely to focus on that in its next phase. We have to understand that it is difficult for a retail investor to understand the negative co-relation between interest rates and debt value. Also, it is not easy to communicate the same.
In terms of setting the return expectation, Amfi’s campaign should focus on the communication that equity returns are made over a long period of time and are subject to volatility.
How has the mutual fund industry evolved in the last 20 years?
Over the last two decades, mutual fund as an investment product has evolved into a well-regulated, low-cost and transparent product, aiding in achieving one’s financial goal. From the removal of entry load to the recent Sebi categorisation and rationalisation of mutual fund schemes, the industry has come a long way. The effect can be seen and today the industry successfully manages  ₹24 trillion of public money. Also, today, retail investors understand the benefit of investing via SIPs just the way they understand the benefit of yoga.
Also, companies/industry have evolved in handling the risk to an investor’s money. So asset management as a business is more of risk management. Rather than concentrating on maximising returns every passing day, what is important is to ensure that there are no accidents in terms of risk in a portfolio that can harm an investor’s experience.
What would you tell investors who are perturbed by reports of credit events around debt funds? How well is the industry equipped to handle such risks?
If one considers the size of debt mutual funds (more than  ₹11 trillion), it could be said that debt funds have been managed relatively well. Over the years, the industry has evolved and embraced best practices such as having a robust, independent and transparent process for valuation of debt investments.
Any fixed income investment is exposed to three key risks: credit risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. History suggests that interest rate risk and liquidity risks have been managed effectively by the industry as a whole. Although there have been some instances of credit events which have impacted investments made by some of the schemes, these have been managed in an efficient manner without a significant impact on the industry as a whole. It is clear that adopting stringent corporate issuer selection process and ensuring adequate diversification are the keys to avoiding adverse impact of such credit events.
The industry is well- equipped to handle the risks related to investments. At ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, we have instituted an independent investment risk management team which oversees the credit evaluation and approval processes. We ensure that investments are made after conducting appropriate credit due diligence and with requisite credit approvals.
Having done all this, given the nature of the business, there is still a possibility of a certain paper coming under pressure. Therefore, it is very important to ensure that there is no concentration risk to the portfolio. In the event of a downgrade (rating lowered), the concentration of that paper should also be lowered such that the impact would be limited to reduced returns rather than hit the principal.
How do you see Sebi’s measures to rationalise total expense ratio (TER) in mutual funds playing out over time and its impact on investors, distributors and funds?
We believe, generally, what works well for an investor will benefit the industry as well. Reduction in expense ratio is beneficial for investors, driving overall volumes as increasingly investors may be attracted to this low-expense and transparent product. So, while margins will go down, the rise in volumes can compensate for the decline. The regulation as on date ensures that the interests of all parties involved—investor, distributor and manufacturer—are aligned. Over long periods, it is not only the investor benefiting from better returns, the distributor and the product manufacturer too will gain.
In 2018, domestic institutional investors, particularly mutual funds, compensated for foreign portfolio investors outflows and kept markets steady. But assets under management (AUM) grew at a lower rate than earlier and the last quarter of 2018 saw softening of SIP flows too. Is that a blip or the start of a trend of lower inflows?
We believe the inflows via SIPs have been robust and will continue to grow. As of December 2016, the industry SIP book was at  ₹3,973 crore which as of December 2018 has grown to  ₹8,022 crore. In general, the SIP money tends to be sticky in nature, and is largely immune to change in market sentiment unless an adverse development was to take place.
However, when it comes to making lump sum investments, it is a known fact that retail investors largely go by the past one-year performance data of a fund. Currently, investors are turning cautious and they are thinking twice before deploying cash. We see this as a healthy sign given that investments are not guided by any sort of euphoria in the market. Such a trend is likely to continue until the market delivers sizeable returns.
What are your expectations for the markets in 2019?
At the start of 2018, we were of the view that the valuation was quite expensive and risk reward benefit was not favourable in mid- and small-caps. At the same time, we were positive on large-caps and balanced advantage category of funds, a call which has played out well for our investors. For the year 2019, with the general election around the corner, volatility cannot be ruled out. Historically, election years have proved to be volatile and in all the election years—2004, 2009 and 2014—markets have provided investors with intermittent opportunities to invest. Policy decisions by RBI, end of the bond-buying programme by central banks globally, escalation of trade wars, pace of foreign inflows, among others, would be other significant triggers for the market. During such times, the best investment strategy is to take the SIP route to accumulate equities.
What product categories will investors find acceptable in volatile and uncertain markets?
From a valuation standpoint, the Indian equity market is fairly valued. For those looking to make lump sum investments, balanced advantage funds, multi-asset and large-caps should be the preferred vehicles. In terms of themes, we are positive on special opportunities and those benefitting out of volatility. In debt, we are positive on dynamic duration schemes which can benefit from volatility, low-duration funds which tend to mitigate interest rate volatility (investing in instruments with maturity in the range of 1-3 years) along with credit risk category of funds which can capture the current elevated yields.
Systematic investments work in volatile times

I am 40 years old and want to build a retirement corpus. I invest  ₹6,000 each in Franklin India Focused Equity Fund, ICICI Prudential Bluechip Fund, ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund and Quantum Long Term Equity Value Fund. I intended to invest equally in large-cap, multi-cap, mid-cap and small-cap categories. However, over a period of time, the nature of these funds has changed. Please suggest one fund in each category (or new suggested categories) for 15-20 years, assuming a high risk-taking capacity. Also, I would be redeeming my 15-year PPF corpus next year. Please suggest ways to add the proceeds to funds.
—S.K. Abraham
While putting together a portfolio, it is not enough to picks funds from different categories—one must ensure diversity of investment styles among the funds chosen. In your current portfolio, three of funds follow a value investing strategy (of picking good companies at a fair or lower price). It would be better if you have one or maximum two out of the four funds following such a strategy, while the others can look for growth in the market. I would recommend you keep the ICICI Prudential Bluechip fund, and choose between Quantum Long Term Equity fund and Franklin India Focused Equity fund (both in the diversified category). For a mid-cap fund, you can go with L&T Mid-cap fund, and for a small-cap fund, you can choose Franklin India Smaller Companies fund.
Regarding deployment of PPF corpus that you will redeem next year, it would be easy to invest the proceeds in your four funds using systematic transfer plan (STP). Please divide the corpus into four parts and invest them in liquid funds in ICICI Prudential, Franklin Templeton (or Quantum), L&T, and (again) Franklin Templeton AMC. From there, you can set up STPs to your equity funds on a monthly basis. Please ensure that the quantum of money you transfer every month is such that the entire STP schedule gets completed in 12 months from the date of start.
I invest around  ₹33,000 in about nine funds, with 80% in equity and 20% in debt. During review, I noticed that a HDFC Midcap fund went down by 10% overall. Now that the markets are flat, should I remain invested in it or should I exit and book a loss because of poor performance?
—Abhishek Gupta
I assume you are referring to the HDFC Mid-Cap Opportunities fund. This is a stellar fund in this category and you should continue investing in it. Although this fund has gone down in the past year, that negative performance happened during a very bad time in the markets for mid-cap stocks. To compare, the benchmark Nifty Midcap 100 TRI went down by close to 15% in the same period. Even the peer funds in this category went down by close to 13%. Such is the nature of the mid-cap segment. If such volatility makes you contemplate selling, then you should consider lowering the overall risk profile of your portfolio.
Also, I note that you have nine funds for a  ₹33,000 portfolio—that is a lot of funds and you will do well to consolidate your holdings to 5-6 funds. You can use this consolidation exercise to wean yourself off high-risk funds such as mid- or small-cap funds.

351,2019-02-07,ICICI,"Firm to close first domestic tranche of fund-raising by month endThe Avendus India ESG Fund will raise money from domestic and international investors

MUMBAI :
Financial services firm Avendus Capital on Thursday launched a $1-billion fund to invest solely in companies that promote environment, social, and governance (ESG) values.
The Avendus India ESG Fund, housed under the company’s alternate asset management arm, will raise money from domestic and international investors.
The fund said it will invest on the basis of predetermined ESG factors, alongside in-depth financial analysis, with the aim of generating long-term risk adjusted returns. Avendus had said in August that it plans to launch an ESG fund.
ESG investing, while seeking positive returns, also considers and evaluates the long-term impact that business practices have on society, the environment, and the performance of the business itself.
Corporate governance in India attracted attention in 2018 with questions about corporate and board practices at ICICI Bank Ltd, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) group and many midcap companies.
Last week, Mint reported that mutual fund veteran Ajit Dayal, former Tata brand custodian Mukund Rajan and at least three other former Tata group executives have floated a $1-billion ESG fund with Quantum Advisors mutual fund to invest in listed companies.
According to Andrew Holland, chief executive at Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, Indian investors have warmed up to the idea of ESG values.
“Six months ago, a lot of investors would not be too enthused by ESG. However, more recently, when I spoke to investors, ESG is resonating well with them because of the fact that we are looking at these issues and scoring companies,"" he said.
Globally, investors are increasingly looking at ESG parameters while investing in companies and the same trend is expected to be replicated in India, said Abhay Laijawala, managing director and fund manager, Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies.
“Today, 26% of total assets globally are managed under Sustainable Responsible Investing ($22.9 trillion versus $13.6 trillion in 2012). The data points justify the fact that investors, globally, are increasingly seeking to invest in companies that are compliant with sustainable principles. We strongly expect this trend to be replicated in India,"" he said.
Avendus plans to close the first domestic tranche of fund-raising by the end of February.
Of the $1 billion target, 30% will be raised from domestic investors.
The fund will evaluate the top 100 NSE stocks and invest in those which make it to the top 50 in ESG parameters, said Laijawala.
The fund has already started making investments.
“Unacceptable ESG performance (i.e. a ranking worse than 50) cannot be offset by attractive financial parameters, no matter how attractive they are. Such companies go into a bucket list for engagement,"" Laijawala said.
The drive towards an ESG fund is also driven by the fact that companies that are well-governed and responsible and those that deliver superior risk-adjusted returns have a positive correlation, he said.
“Investors are beginning to ask the right questions. They are seeing things world over. With the number of governance issues and valuation concerns, everyone sees this as the way forward and wants to see it become mainstream,"" said Laijawala.
Avendus has tied up with corporate governance and proxy advisory firm Institutional Investor Advisory Services to put in place a ranking framework covering ESG principles."

Mumbai: Union Finance Minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that if a borrower does not get its dues from entities like discoms, it should not lead banks to classify that borrower automatically as defaulter.
The comments come a day after the Reserve Bank of India made it clear that it is not having a relook at a contentious circular about recognising of bad assets, issued on February 12 last year.
""Law cannot be a blind, wherein in 90 days arithmetically it becomes an NPA (Non performing asset). We will also discuss this and we hope to resolve it quickly,"" Goyal said, speaking to industry representatives in a post- budget interaction at the BSE here.
He cited the case of a power producer to which a distribution company owed money, stating that just because the discom did not pay up, the power producer does not become a defaulter.
It can be noted that sections of the industry have moved the Supreme Court for special treatment to the power sector when it comes to classification of NPAs.
Also read RBI policy: Key highlights
""I think it is worth discussing with the Reserve Bank that if a payment is overdue and discom is not paying its bill, then we will have to think about NCLT and NPA,"" he said.
Exhorting the industry to report any such instances, Goyal said the Government could ensure capital markets watchdog Sebi withdraws a proposal to disclose every default by listed companies, and hinted that similar measures will be taken up with RBI as well.
Goyal also said that there is a need for specialised development finance institutions like IDBI, IFCI and ICICI, saying that asset liability mismatch results in difficulties for the banking system to support the infrastructure sector.
He said the Government is also trying to get the remaining eight banks out of the restrictive prompt corrective action (PCA) framework.

Singapore: Indian equities will see “double-digit"" earnings growth for the next three fiscal years as changes to government tax and bad-loans policies allow more cash to be channeled into Asia’s third-largest economy, according to the nation’s largest brokerage.
Rules for tackling soured debt and a nationwide sales tax would increase savings and lower the cost of capital for companies, helping drive the pace of earnings growth to between 10 to 15 percent for each of the next three years, Shilpa Kumar, chief executive officer of ICICI Securities Ltd., said in an interview in Singapore.
India’s benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index has seen profit growth only once in the past four calendar years, while the gauge has gained by a third in that period -- including touching a life-time high in August, according to Bloomberg data. That’s prompted fund managers to warn that valuations are too high and led to lowering in earnings estimates this year from record levels.
Kumar blames the elusive profit growth on the disruptions caused by policy changes, and said the bedding down of reforms should result in more robust future earnings. “Structural pain is behind us.""
There’s some evidence of the recovery. Most of the Nifty companies that have reported earnings so far for the three months through December have either exceeded or matched estimates, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Earnings growth could accelerate, especially in the year to March 2020, as reforms “start bearing fruit"" and the consumption stimulus announced in the recent budget takes hold, Jitendra Gohil, head of India equity research at Credit Suisse Wealth Management, wrote in a Feb. 8 note.
India’s economic outlook also gets a boost from “benign"" crude oil prices, which are more important to investors than national elections in May because lower fuel costs will give the government scope to improve its financial position, Kumar said.
While India is among the fastest growing major economies in the world, the expansion faces risks from the price of oil -- the nation’s top import -- and its impact on the rupee, already Asia’s worst-performing currency this year, and the health of public finances.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government Feb. 1 widened its fiscal deficit targets for this financial year and the next to 3.4 percent of gross domestic product, giving it more spending power before national elections in May.
Kumar advises investors to buy shares of banks, financial intermediaries and producers of fast-moving consumer goods that will benefit from changes in the structure of the economy."

New Delhi: Union minister Arun Jaitley is likely to resume charge as the finance minister today after his return from the US on last Saturday, official government sources said speaking under condition of anonymity.
Interim finance minister Piyush Goyal hinted the same at an event on on Sunday as reported by Mint on Monday.
“I have got this opportunity to address you because I have the temporary charge of the finance ministry. It is a matter of happiness that Arun Jaitley has returned yesterday evening in good health. I spoke to him yesterday and told him that can I excuse myself from this event. He said, “No, because you have agreed for this event, you have to go’,"" Goyal said speaking at foundation day event of Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Limited, a public sector unit under the finance ministry that prints currency notes and mints coins.
However, Goyal replied to the debate on the Interim Budget in Parliament.
Jaitley will now address the board meeting of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) scheduled to take place in New Delhi on 18 February. It is a custom for the finance minister to address the boards of RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) after presentation of the Budget where RBI board members often place their queries on the Budget before the finance minister and other ministry officials.
On Saturday, Jaitley tweeted: “Delighted to be back home"".

Mumbai: Vijay Shekhar Sharma's One97 Communications Ltd, the parent of fintech startup Paytm, has pledged all its current assets and mutual fund investments to be able to borrow  ₹1,400 crore for working capital needs from ICICI Bank Ltd.
On 18 January, Paytm and ICICI Bank Ltd entered into an agreement under which One97 Communications’ entire current assets worth  ₹7,085.1 crore as on 31 March 2018 was hypothecated by the bank to boost the startup’s borrowing capacity. Until now, Paytm could borrow up to  ₹400 crore from the bank for working capital.
The higher borrowing limit helps Paytm secure capital for everyday operations amid tight liquidity conditions in the market and banks’ unwillingness to lend to startups and financial services companies. It may also help Paytm fuel its growth plans that primarily include online-to-offline (O2O) retail businesses and enter new overseas markets in the digital payments space—moves that are aimed at narrowing losses. The agreement was formally registered with the ministry of corporate affairs on Wednesday.
Mint has reviewed a copy of the documents.
“One97 Communications has clear goals. Several attractive deals are on the table and even if there is a difficulty to get an equity buyer due to the cost of stake in a large-scale startup such as One97, the company’s plans should not suffer due to shortage of working capital limits,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the development.
In a recent share-swap deal (registered with MCA on 18 January), involving issuance of shares by One97 Communications to acquire stakes of Gamnat Pte. Ltd and SAIF Partners India IV Ltd in Little Internet Pvt. Ltd, a unit of One97 Communications, the firm was given an enterprise value of  ₹44,893.29 crore by Corporate Professionals Capital Pvt. Ltd, the appointed valuer for the deal.
On 24 January, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, One97 Communications’ chief financial officer Madhur Deora said Paytm is considering foraying into one or two more developed markets in 2019.
While the company can’t commit to a definite launch in other markets, it is working on building a scalable business, Deora said.
In August, billionaire investor Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought a $356 million stake in One97 Communications.
Paytm recently hired Raghu Chakravarthi from online grocery retailer BigBasket to help with its O2O strategy.
Over the past few years, Paytm group has been losing more money in its online retail business as compared to digital payments, where it is the market leader.
Paytm’s online retail business Paytm Mall, under Paytm E-Commerce Pvt. Ltd, saw its financials deteriorating with a loss of  ₹1,787.55 crore on a total revenue of  ₹774.86 crore during FY18, according to filings with the registrar of companies.
Paytm has been expanding its businesses rapidly over the past one year.
On 22 October, it launched a barcode-based smartphone payment service called PayPay in Japan, in a joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and Yahoo Japan Corp.
On 30 January, Paytm acquired a hotel booking app called NightStay that allows travellers to book hotels instantly.
With the  ₹142 crore acquisition of NightStay, Paytm is looking to re-enter the hotel aggregation business and expand its travel operations by offering last-minute deals to tourists especially in the mid-to-upper range hotel booking segment.
Paytm has already tied up with at least 5,000 hotels across the budget, luxury and business segments.
One97 Communications’ total losses during the fiscal year 2018 almost doubled to  ₹1,604.34 crore from around  ₹899.64 crore in the previous year."
343,2019-02-18,ICICI,"Carriers post better than expected performance despite costlier fuel and a fall in passenger load factorsImproving pricing at a time when load factors have dropped suggests that the quality of air traffic has improved

MUMBAI :
Indian airlines’ operating profits were expected to nosedive in the December quarter. Not only were fuel prices far higher, but even passenger load factors had fallen owing to unusually high capacity addition.
Analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd had anticipated Ebitda losses for all three publicly traded airlines—InterGlobe Aviation Ltd (which operates IndiGo), SpiceJet Ltd and Jet Airways (India) Ltd. Kotak Institutional Equities, which only tracks InterGlobe Aviation, had estimated losses for the market leader, which is as good as saying all Indian airlines would post losses.
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
But as it turns out, not only IndiGo, but even SpiceJet reported positive Ebitda. While analysts at ICICI Securities were expecting Ebitda losses of 5-6% of revenue for IndiGo and SpiceJet, they reported Ebitda of 2.8% and 4.6% of revenue, respectively. Of course, this still represents a sharp drop from the year-ago Ebitda of the two airlines. But amid expectations of losses, the fact that they reported profits were in itself a big relief for investors.
Yields at both airlines were much better than expectations. “The improvement in fares was pleasantly surprising, and was the key driving force behind the better than expected performance of all the three listed airlines for the December quarter,"" said Ansuman Deb, an analyst with ICICI Securities.
Market leader IndiGo’s yields increased 3.7% from a year earlier. This comes after the measure had declined for three consecutive quarters previously.
For airlines, yield is a relevant pricing measure and refers to passenger ticket revenue divided by revenue passenger kilometres flown.
“We saw a much better revenue performance (per available seat kilometre) in November and December. This improvement in our performance was largely because of improvement in yields, especially in the 0-15 day booking window during these months,"" IndiGo’s management said in its post earnings conference call. Note that IndiGo was facing pressure in the lucrative 0-15 days segment for three quarters prior to the December quarter.
SpiceJet and Jet both have seen their yields for the December quarter increase in a similar range as that of IndiGo’s.
However, it’s worth noting here that airlines have settled for lower passenger load factors in the bargain. IndiGo and SpiceJet saw their load factors drop 320-340 basis points on a year-on-year basis. Jet’s load factors declined marginally, supported to an extent by a decline in its capacity. One hundred basis points equal one percentage point.
Improving pricing at a time when load factors have dropped essentially means that the quality of traffic has improved, pointed out Deb of ICICI Securities. In short, passengers have had to pay more to travel.
Of course, not everything is hunky-dory. For instance, some analysts are concerned that SpiceJet’s profits were boosted by an unusual jump in its other operating income. IndiGo is facing a challenge because of a shortage of pilots, which is beginning to bite. “The scale of the problem is not large enough yet to warrant a cut in earnings estimates, although the situation needs close monitoring,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.
Jet has its own peculiar financial problems. It reported massive consolidated loss of  ₹732 crore for the December quarter. Jet’s board has approved a bank-led provisional resolution plan, which estimates a funding gap of  ₹8,500 crore to be met by equity infusion, debt restructuring and sale/sale and lease back/refinancing of aircraft, among others.
“While efforts are being made to rationalize costs and rejig the existing network to reduce losses, adequate capital support to execute the plan will be key for the airline’s revival,"" wrote analysts from SBICAP Securities Ltd in its Jet result review report on 15 February.
While Jet investors await more details, the good news for the industry is that the skies are clearer now in contrast to the cost pressures faced last year. 2019 started on a good note with a big relief coming from lower aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices, as crude oil prices are relatively lower at the moment.
The pricing scenario, too, seems to be healthier. On yields, “the better environment that we had in November and December has continued so far"", said IndiGo on 23 January in its call.
“Our air fare tracker, which shows a 15-day advance air fare of 653 domestic routes, states average industry yield improved ~15% year-on-year during January-February 2019 on declining capacity of Jet Airways,"" said analysts from Elara Securities (India) Ltd in its SpiceJet results review report on 11 February.
For all we know, if airfares persist with healthy trends and crude prices remain lower, the current quarter may turn out to provide a far bigger surprise than the December quarter. That should offer ample support to aviation stocks to enjoy a good flight.
Jet, of course, is a peculiar case as mentioned earlier, and its shares will move in tandem with developments on the liquidity situation."
342,2019-02-18,ICICI,"The company did not specify how much of an impact the accounting change had on its revenueThe first signs of trouble emerged last year when the company said its volume growth came to a standstill (down 0.1%) in Q2

When Page Industries Ltd, the maker of Jockey garments, reported September quarter (Q2) results, the stock lost 9% in two trading sessions. At the time of the December quarter (Q3) results, there was a replay of the same, with the stock losing as much 7% in a single day.
The fall underscores a moderation in its volume growth. The stock is now down 22% from its Q2 results, compared to a 1% fall in the Nifty 500 index during the same period.
The first signs of trouble emerged last year when the company said its volume growth came to a standstill (down 0.1%) in Q2. The stock has been underperforming since. This slowdown has been attributed to non-recurring events such as the goods and services tax (GST)-related inventory destocking.
Volumes recovered in Q3, registering a 12% growth. This quarter had the benefit of a delayed festive season. However, the volumes did not translate into a higher revenue growth.
According to analysts, adjusted for accounting changes, revenue growth in Q3 stood at 14%. This is less than the 17-22% growth the company had been clocking in Q1 FY18 to Q1 FY19. Revenues in Q2 had increased 10%.
Cumulatively, revenue in the first nine months of FY19 are up 15.5%. This has not been adjusted for the accounting change in Q3. In the previous two fiscal years, revenues increased 19-20% in the first nine months.
Nevertheless, this 15.5% revenue growth is nothing to scoff at. However, tracking its historical growth rates and an expansion in its product portfolio and retail network, investors are expecting better growth rates in the coming quarters.
However, slowing growth is bringing its lofty valuations to the fore, triggering a reset in expectations. “Factoring in the performance of year to date FY19, we revise our earnings estimate downward for FY19/20,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a note. “The stock currently trades at 48 times price-to-earnings and seven times market capitalization/sales on FY20E estimates. To justify these plump valuations, a surge toward its past revenue growth rate of 18-20%, with sustained improvement in EBITDA margins remains critical."" Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Compounding the issue is an information vacuum. Page Industries did not specify how much of an impact the accounting change had on its revenue. Further, as analysts at ICICI Securities point out, it stopped disclosing segment-wise data, making it difficult to track category-wise product growth.
This is fuelling concerns about growth momentum at its mainstay inner wear business, where companies such as Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail Ltd are making headway.
Of course, the shift to the organized sector on the introduction of GST will create enough elbow room for all market participants. But the question for investors is whether Page Industries can retain its market share."
341,2019-02-18,ICICI,"At the end of the December quarter, gross debt was  ₹3,540 crore, up from  ₹3,100 crore in the year-ago periodThe company’s intent to create capacity over paring debt is discomforting to analysts

It is said that debt is like any other trap: Easy enough to get into, hard enough to get out of. And, this is precisely what India Cements Ltd’s investors are worried about.
Punished for the dismal performance on margins and realizations in the December quarter, the stock hit a 52-week low of  ₹74.75 on Tuesday.
Although cement prices in south India were recently raised by  ₹30-35 per 50kg bag, analysts are sceptical about these steep price hikes persisting. Even if they do, India Cements’ ballooning debt due to capacity expansions, is feared to counter the positives of better realizations.
At the end of the December quarter, gross debt was  ₹3,540 crore, up from  ₹3,100 crore in the year-ago period, the management told analysts in a post-earnings conference call.
It should be noted that India Cements has been a case of swollen debt for some time now. What is turning analysts off is the fact that no major steps have been taken to clean the balance sheet. On the contrary, chances of further stretching are highly likely.
If the price hikes are absorbed by the market, the company would pursue capital-expenditure opportunities in central India and other locations. Further, the south-based cement maker is looking to spend  ₹150-200 crore a year on various projects.
Even though India Cements aims to reduce gross debt by  ₹200-250 crore in the current quarter, its repayment liability for fiscal year 2020 is estimated at  ₹3,750 crore.
“The company is adding capacities in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh at a cost of  ₹1,200 crore. We believe this ongoing expansion might further swell its debt, by another  ₹500 crore. With current debt levels of over  ₹3,500 crore and low margins (12-13%), we expect return ratios to be constrained till FY20,"" ICICI Securities said in a report on 13 February.
In short, the company’s intent to create capacity over paring debt is discomforting to analysts.
No wonder then that the stock price has halved in the past year. The scrip now quotes at  ₹84.25 on the National Stock Exchange. Similarly, valuations are nothing to write home about. On an EV/Ebitda basis, the stock trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of around six times, lower than its peers. EV is short for enterprise value and Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Unless the company does some serious deleveraging, even a price revival would not be of much help to boost the stock’s performance."

Mumbai: From cloth makers to shipyards, Indian banks are getting stuck with shares of companies that are rapidly losing value even as the lenders seek to turn more loans they have made into equity in borrower firms.
In the latest move, State Bank of India and other creditors are planning to convert part of their loans to the beleaguered carrier Jet Airways Ltd. into equity as it struggles to repay debt. That’s a risk for the largest Indian bank, whose equity holdings’ market value crashed to about $104 million last quarter from $480 million a year earlier, while its stakes remained largely unchanged, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
State Bank of India isn’t alone: competitors including ICICI Bank Ltd., Bank of Baroda and Axis Bank Ltd. saw the market value of their equity holdings drop last year. Those banks switched debt into equity in stressed companies from Bombay Rayon Fashions Ltd. to ABG Shipyard Ltd.
“No bank in India has expertise in turning around companies. None of them engage with the companies,"" said A. K. Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd. “Converting debt to equity normally leads to losses without such expertise.""

New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has issued lookout notices against former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group managing director Venugopal Dhoot, officials said in New Delhi Friday. The move was taken nearly a week after a case was registered against Chanda Kocchar, Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, they said.
The move is to ensure that none of the accused in the case related to alleged corruption in clearing loans worth  ₹1,875 crore to the Videocon Group were able to leave the country, the officials said. No summons have so far been issued against Chanda Kochhar to record her statement, the officials said.
A lookout notice is an intimation to immigration authorities at all the ports of exit to intimate the investigation agency in case the accused tries to leave the country.
The immigration authorities may also detain the person if requested by the agency.
CBI cut a sorry figure after its dilution of lookout circular against liquor baron Vijay Mallya led to his escape to the UK in 2016. 
It is alleged that during Chanda Kochhar's tenure as ICICI Bank CEO, six loans worth  ₹1,875 crore were cleared for the Videocon Group and its associated companies. She was on the santioning committees for two of these loans.
In its first investigation report filed in the ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, CBI has also named several top honchos of the banking industry, including ICICI Bank CEO Sandeep Bakhshi, alleging that they were also members of the sanctioning committees and their role needs to be investigated.
Chanda Kochhar was on the sanctioning committee deciding two loans:  ₹300 crore to Videocon International Electronics on 26 August 2009 and  ₹750 crore to Videocon Industries Ltd on 31 October 2011, the FIR says. 
The loans were issued in the alleged violation of laid down policies and regulations of the bank. Most of these loans became non-performing assets over the course, causing a loss of  ₹1,730 crore to the bank."

Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is carrying out searches at the premises of former CEO of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Industries promoter Venugopal Dhoot in a case of alleged money laundering, said ED officials.
The ED confirmed the developments on its official twitter handle.
Messages sent to Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and Venugopal Dhoot for comments were not answered immediately.  
The raids are being carried out in five locations in Mumbai and Aurangabad, which include the Mumbai-based office of Videocon and residences of the Kochhars.
The ED had registered a money laundering case in the matter under Prevention of Money Act (PMLA) in the first week of February based on a Central Bureau of Investigations (CBI) case on 22 January.
The agency is probing alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning of  ₹1,875 crore loans by the ICICI Bank to Videocon. Out of the this loan, sanctioned in 2012, an amount of  ₹300 crore allegedly was involved in a quid pro quo arrangement. Chanda Kochhar is alleged to have misused her office and received illegal gratification through her husband from Dhoot in the matter of a  ₹300 crore term loan sanctioned to Videocon International Electronics Ltd.
A team of ED sleuths, assisted by the police, is looking for more evidence and the raids were launched early Friday morning, one of the ED officials quoted above said.
It is alleged that Dhoot had invested in Deepak Kochhar's company, Nupower Renewables Ltd, through his firm Supreme Energy a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on May 1, 2009.

Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate on Friday carried out searches at homes and offices linked to Chanda Kochhar, the former chief executive officer of ICICI Bank Ltd, her husband Deepak Kochhar, and Venugopal Dhoot, promoter of Videocon Industries Ltd, in a case of alleged money laundering, ED said on its official Twitter handle.
ED is conducting searches under PMLA at the premises of Chanda Kochhar, former chairman ICICI Bank and  Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon Group in Mumbai and Aurangabad respectively.
The raids, which started early Friday morning, were carried out at several places in Mumbai and Aurangabad, including the Mumbai-based office of Videocon and the residences of the Kochhars, according to ED officials.
Messages sent to Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot were not answered till the publishing of this story.
The ED registered a money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the first week of February on the basis of a CBI probe.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning of  ₹1,875 crore in loans to Videocon International Electronics Ltd by ICICI Bank in 2012. Of this, a term loan of  ₹300 crore was allegedly part of a quid pro quo for the business group’s dealings with her husband Deepak Kochhar. Chanda Kochhar is alleged to have misused her office and received illegal gratification through her husband from Dhoot for this  ₹300 crore loan.
CBI had registered a preliminary inquiry against Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot in March 2018 to investigate irregularities in the  ₹40,000 crore loan made by a consortium of lenders to the Videocon Group. It also pointed to an alleged conflict of interest in a  ₹3,250 crore loan made to the Videocon group by ICICI Bank. Out of the  ₹3,250 crore,  ₹2,810 crore remains unpaid and the banks ended up declaring the account a non-performing asset (NPA) in 2017.
It is alleged that Dhoot had invested in Deepak Kochhar’s company, NuPower Renewables Ltd, through his firm Supreme Energy, in a quid pro quo for loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as CEO on 1 May 2009. Chanda Kochhar was part of the credit committee which sanctioned the Videocon loan.

The ED is also coordinating with the income tax department, which is probing the companies involved for alleged tax irregularities.
“The income tax department’s findings have been shared with us. Requests have also been sent to certain foreign jurisdictions for information assistance. The requests have been sent under double taxation avoidance agreement and mutual legal assistance treaty. These jurisdictions are where we suspect some of the funds have been routed,"" said an ED official.
The directorate is also searching the Mumbai office of Mauritius-based Matix Group in connection with alleged transactions between Firstland Holdings Ltd, which is the holding group of Matix, and Deepak Kochhar’s Nupower Renewables, he said.
Nupower is alleged to have received  ₹325 crore from Firstland Holdings.
Chanda Kochhar is also facing adjudicating proceedings from Sebi, which has alleged violations of disclosure and the bank’s model code of conduct by her failure to make adequate disclosure and to recuse herself from the credit committee.
Under Sebi norms, if found guilty, Kochhar could face a monetary penalty and be barred from holding directorship in a listed company.

This was the first time the ED had called Kanodia for interrogation. Kanodia is son-in-law of Essar Group's Chairman Ravi Ruia.
The ED has also called ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kocchar for questioning on Sunday. She was interrogated on Saturday too.
Kanodia is married to Smiti Ruia, daughter of Ravi Ruia and is owner of Matix Group and its holding entity, Firsthand Holdings Ltd, both based in Mauritius.

Mumbai: India's central bank has fined at least 19 lenders, including top banks such as ICICI Bank and State Bank of India, for failing to comply with its guidelines on the use of global payments network SWIFT.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed the fines over the past four days, according to stock exchange filings by the banks, though specifics of the non-compliance were not disclosed.
Four bankers whose institutions were fined said that most of the issues related either to interpretation of the RBI's guidelines or minor technical matters.
""These are petty, procedural issues like counterparty confirmation and nothing major or structural,"" said one banker who is directly aware of the matter but declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The penalties totalled more than Rs. 40 crore ($5.67 million) and ranged from Rs. 1 crore to Rs. 4 crore for each bank, the filings showed.
The Indian banking system was sent reeling early last year by a $2 billion fraud at state lender Punjab National Bank (PNB) , resulting from unauthorised credit guarantees to businesses linked to billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi via SWIFT.
""The series of fines imposed is a stern signal from RBI to banks to strengthen their internal systems and minimise fraud after the PNB fraud last year, which tarnished the image of India's banking system,"" said Mitul Budhbhatti, associate director and head of banking, financial services and insurance at CARE Ratings.
""I expect RBI to continue to be more and more vigilant and continue with such monitoring.""
After the PNB loan fraud, which prompted criticism of the RBI by the government for its lack of regulatory oversight, the central bank had sent a confidential directive to banks about how they must use the SWIFT payment system, requiring most banks to overhaul their financial systems.
Most notable among those rules was the requirement for banks to connect the SWIFT interbank messaging system with their core banking software by 30 April last year.
However, gaps in compliance were found in more than two dozen places, prompting the RBI to impose the fines.
The RBI had conducted the audits at banks 8-10 months ago and issued show-cause notices four months ago. Since the notices were issued, banks have plugged those holes, bankers said.
""After the show-cause notices were issued to us, we have addressed those minor points,"" said one banker."

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a fine of  ₹2 crore on Allahabad Bank for non-compliance of directions with regard to Nostro accounts, the state-owned lender said on Tuesday. A Nostro account is an account that a bank holds in a foreign currency in another bank.
Private sector lender ICICI Bank, too, has been slapped with a fine of  ₹1 crore for delay in compliance with directions related to global messaging software Swift.
Allahabad Bank was fined for non-compliance of RBI directions dated 20 February, 2018 pertaining to the reconciliation of Nostro on a real-time basis with immediate effect, according to a BSE filing.
According to RBI directions, banks have to interpret real time as T+1 for Nostro debits and T+5 for Nostro credits.
The amount of penalty was not material considering the size of the bank, and necessary measures for compliance with the said RBI directions had been taken, Allahabad Bank added.
In a separate filing to exchanges, ICICI Bank said: ""The Banking Regulation Act, 1949, levied an aggregate penalty of  ₹10 million vide its order dated February 25, 2019. The penalty has been levied for delay in compliance with RBI's directives on 'Time-bound implementation and strengthening of Swift related controls.""
Yes Bank also informed on Tuesday about a fine of  ₹1 crore for non-compliance of directions on Swift.

NEW DELHI :
The CBI has sought more documents from ICICI Bank relating to  ₹1,875 crore loans given to Videocon Group during the tenure of its former CEO Chanda Kochhar which is under probe by the agency, officials said on Wednesday.
The officials refused to give any further details about the nature of documents as the agency is at a crucial stage of determining points on which it may call Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon Group MD Venugopal Dhoot, all named as suspects in the CBI FIR, for questioning.
The CBI has not issued notice to any of the accused in the FIR for questioning so far, they said.
The additional documents have also been sought from NuPower, Supreme Energy and Videocon Group, they said.
The agency is going through hundreds of pages of documents seized by it during searches, besides loan records, communication exchanges, meeting discussions, etc. related to the details before it will prepare a questionnaire for the accused, they said.
It has issued Look Out Circular against Kochhars and Dhoot to prevent them from leaving the country and keep a track of their movements, they said.
A look out notice is an intimation to immigration authorities at all the ports of exit to intimate the investigation agency in case the accused tries to leave the country.
The immigration authorities may also detain the person if requested by the agency.
It is alleged that during the tenure of Chanda Kochhar, six loans worth  ₹1,875 crore were cleared for the Videocon Group and its associated companies. In two of these cases, she herself was on the sanctioning committees.
In its FIR, the CBI has also named several top honchos of the banking industry, including the present CEO of ICICI Bank Sandeep Bakshi, alleging that they were also members of the sanctioning committees whose role needs investigation.
Chanda Kochhar was on the sanctioning committees deciding two loans --  ₹300 crore to Videocon International Electronics on August 26, 2009 and  ₹750 crore to Videocon Industries Limited on October 31, 2011, the FIR has alleged.
The loans were issued in alleged violation of laid down policies and regulations of the bank, it alleged.
Most of these loans became non-performing assets over the course, causing a loss of  ₹1,730 crore to the bank, it alleged.

Mumbai: The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) has discovered at least 25 violations of the Companies Act by NuPower Renewables Ltd and Videocon Industries Ltd, the companies at the heart of the controversial ICICI Bank-Videocon loan case, two people aware of the matter said.
The report prepared by MCA’s Mumbai regional director will be submitted to the union finance ministry this week. The alleged breaches, however, do not pertain to transactions where charges of conflict of interest and quid pro quo have been levelled.
“The MCA had initiated a probe against the companies last year to examine violations of Companies Act. The findings indicate that the companies defaulted on at least 25 occasions and were in contravention of the provisions of the Companies Act. The report will be submitted to the finance ministry later this week, with an opinion on strictures against the companies and their directors,"" said the first of the two people cited earlier, a government official. Both the people spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mint has not reviewed the contents of the report.
Messages sent to Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of Videocon Group, and Deepak Kochhar, founder of NuPower Renewables, remained unanswered till press time.
Chanda Kochhar, ICICI Bank’s former managing director and CEO, was part of a credit committee that sanctioned a loan of  ₹3,250 crore to Videocon Group. The transaction turned controversial when it came to light that her husband Deepak Kochhar’s NuPower Renewables received funds from Dhoot.
On 30 January, the board of ICICI Bank fired Kochhar and asked her to return bonus payments since 2009, after an internal inquiry charged her with violating the bank’s code of conduct.
“The violations against NuPower Renewables, the company owned by Deepak Kochhar, and Videocon Industries include irregularities in appointment of directors, some of whom the corporate affairs ministry suspects to be shadow directors,"" the second person cited earlier said, referring to directors who exist only on paper.
Other violations by Videocon and NuPower, the second person said, include false disclosures about board meetings and inadequate or misleading disclosures in annual reports and financial statements.
“NuPower and Videocon were also found to be irregular with their board meetings and issuing shares to directors beyond prescribed limits. Loans were also extended to the directors of Videocon beyond prescribed limits,"" this person added.
Under the Companies Act, such violations attract fines, removal from directorship and a jail term for repeat offences.
MCA is the third agency probing alleged lapses in ICICI Bank loans to Videocon.
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case of misuse of public office and cheating against the Kochhars and Dhoot on 22 February 2018. The alleged lapses occurred in sanctioning of  ₹1,875 crore loans by ICICI Bank.
Out of this loan sanctioned in 2012, an amount of  ₹300 crore, according to CBI, was given as part of a quid pro quo arrangement.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted searches at the residence of the Kochhars and the offices of Videocon. They were also called in for questioning over the weekend. ED is also probing Matix Group in connection with the alleged transactions between Firstland Holdings and NuPower Renewables.
On Sunday, ED quizzed Matix Group owner Nishant Kanodia, son-in-law of Essar Group chairman Ravi Ruia."

MUMBAI :
Strong alignment with the management team and strong focus on exits are key to succeeding in the minority growth investing space, said senior private equity (PE) professionals at the Mint India Investment Summit.
“Our fundamental philosophy is that we partner with high quality teams and we are there to take the business from where it is today to the next level. What drives that is alignment with those teams and that really is our focus area to ensure that there is complete alignment upfront in terms of strategy, execution, exit path,"" said Ankur Thadani, principal at TPG Growth. According to Pavninder Singh, managing director (PE) of Bain Capital, it is important to have a high level of engagement in a minority situation. “When we look at minority, we want to be one of the more significant shareholders. We always make sure that it is a high engagement model. So, we are looking for partners in minority situations that will work closely with us,"" he said.
PE investors said that it was important to focus on the exit options right from the beginning and having a strong focus on execution. “You have to be really focused on execution and this we do with a mindset that is as rigorous as any buyout fund. Even on the exit side, even before we enter the company, we talk with promoters, management team on the exit options. If one is not working, then at what time we are going to move on to the next one. We are very clear about it,"" said Gagandeep S. Chhina, director (PE), ICICI Venture.
Aditya Parekh, co-founder and MD at Faering Capital, said exits are not a big challenge if one has a strong portfolio of companies. “Faering is a believer in minority growth investments. Our view is that it is a little unfair to say there is an exit challenge. It is about portfolios. If you have a strong portfolio of companies, whether they are majority or minority, you should be able to exit them. If you have good portfolio companies that have performed well with high level of corporate governance then the exit issue is a little bit overblown.""
According to Nishant Parikh, partner at law firm Trilegal, minority investors have started focusing on exits early on in recent times. “Although exits have been good in the last couple of years, still a fairly large number of deals have been stuck. But, we definitely see nowadays in minority investment, people are putting a lot of focus on exits and talking about that from day one,"" said Parikh.
Industry experts feel that minority investors dwell deeper into diligence than those acquiring control, which is contrary to popular belief.
“The general view is that buyout deals will have far more rigour and diligence. However, it is far more rigorous in minority because at the end of day they will not have control on the company and they will be dependent on the mindset, the direction of the promoter,"" said Nitish Poddar, partner and national leader (PE) at KPMG India.
Alignment is also critical to ensure that the parties invest in the right tools such as tech to accelerate value creation.
“Both in the case of buyout and minority what drives the need for technology to be looked at as an enabler for value acceleration is the alignment between the management team and the PE firm. We have seen cases where there is a buyout but that alignment is not there and we don’t get to step in,"" said Aditya Narayan Das, senior director (private equity engagement program) at SAP India."

MUMBAI :
A day after State Bank decided to link its short-term loans and large savings deposits rates to the repo rate, chairman Rajnish Kumar Saturday said loans and deposits below  ₹1 lakh will continue to be linked to the present MCLR to protect retail customers from market vagaries.
In a first, the nations largest lender had Friday said from May 1, it would link its savings accounts with deposits over  ₹1 lakh and all cash credit accounts and overdrafts or short term loans with limits above  ₹1 lakh or short-term loans, to the repo rate, which currently is at 6.25 %.
At present some banks like Kotak Mahindra, Yes Bank, RBL Bank and Singaporean lender DBS Bank pay higher interest to the tune of 5-6 % on savings deposits regardless of the balance, while large players like SBI and other state-run lenders, and private players like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and others pay 4 % per annum.
From May 1, the savings bank deposits with balance above  ₹1 lakh will earn an interest of 3.5 %, 2.75 % lower than the repo rate and lower amounts in balance will earn 4 %.
The bank has also linked all cash credit accounts and overdrafts with limits above  ₹1 lakh to the repo rate plus a spread of 2.25 %.
""The category which we have linked to the external benchmark is the best category--all cash credits and overdrafts above  ₹1 lakh. Here also, for accounts with  ₹1 lakh and below, we've kept out of the purview as we believe that retail customers should not be forced to suffer from the market vagaries,"" Kumar told reporters on the sidelines on event organised by Indian Chamber of Commerce.
He also said, across the world, retail loans are not left to the market forces alone when it comes to pricing and that it is mostly corporate accounts that are left to the market conditions.
He also said the move is in accordance with the RBI guidelines on the MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rates) and other loan pricing norms.
Kumar said SBIs retail loans are currently priced as per MCLR and the system is working well and will continue to be remain so.
""Retail loans will continue to be linked to MCLR for the time being. If the loan is long-term in nature, you cannot re-price it very frequently...that way MCLR is a good solution,"" Kumar said.
He said by linking savings bank deposits rate to the repo rate, MCLR will get adjusted automatically as and when there is a change in the repo rate.
He, however, said MCLR will not move by 25 bps if there is a similar reduction by the RBI in the repo rate.
""It will depend on what portion of our savings banks gets repriced and its consequent impact on MCLR. To that extent the MCLR will get repriced,"" Kumar said.
Currently, the bank is offering a rate of 3.50 % for savings bank deposit rates up to  ₹1 crore, and 4 % above  ₹1 crore.
As much as 33 % of its savings account-holders will get the benefit of the new pricing system, the bank said.
On the thorny issue of swift monetary transmission, Kumar said liabilities are mostly fixed for banks and transmission on the asset side alone cannot happen.
""Transmission cannot happen only on one side. If transmission has to happen it has to happen on both sides and that is why SBI came out with this solution that the deposits savings bank account with 1 lakh and above, we will link it to repo rate and all the working capital loans which are theoretically payable on demand.
Talking about NCLT clearing ArcelorMittal's  ₹42,000-crore bid for Essar Steel rejecting the  ₹54,389 crore offered by a company run by the Ruias of Essar group, Kumar said they are awaiting the final order.
""The written order is yet to come. But our stand as well as that of the committee of creditors is that we abide by the order. The final process of the resolution of Essar Steel began with the NCLT order yesterday,"" he said.
Kumar said in the case of Jet Airways, whatever is the resolution plan, it will be implemented if all the conditions by all stakeholders--Naresh Goyal, lenders, Etihad and approval from the government, are met.

Reserve Bank of India is seen curtailing its support for the bond market, dashing hopes of relief for investors reeling under two straight months of declines.
The central bank may buy  ₹1.7 trillion ($24 billion) of debt in the year starting April 1, according to a Bloomberg News survey of traders and economists. That compares with an estimated record  ₹3 trillion spent on such purchases this fiscal period.
Tightening the spigot on purchases is bad news for a market already jittery about the heavy supply of paper from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s record $100 billion borrowing plan. The yield on new 10-year debt may climb as high as 7.75% over the coming months, according to ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd., a level last seen in November.
“If the OMOs go out of the picture at a time when we have humongous debt supply hitting the system, we may see bond losses intensifying,"" said Naveen Singh, head of fixed-income trading at ICICI Securities.
In a sign of things to come, the Reserve Bank of India on Feb. 26 unveiled purchases for the first two weeks of March after earlier saying it would extend support for the entire month. The central bank may halt fresh buying in the quarter starting April as higher spending by the government will likely boost liquidity in the banking system, Singh said.
The purchases, aimed primarily at addressing the cash crunch in the banking system, have helped absorb a little over half the sovereign bond supply of 5.71 trillion rupees this fiscal year. The support may taper because of an improvement in liquidity, and HSBC Holdings Inc. expects the RBI to cut back buying to between  ₹1.8 trillion to  ₹2 trillion.
Even so, a clear majority for BJP in the upcoming elections may burnish the appeal of Indian assets and lure dollar inflows, reducing the market’s reliance on RBI’s support, according to ICICI Securities. Foreigners have bought about $65.5 million of rupee bonds so far this month, paring the year’s withdrawal to $1.6 billion.
“If there is a continuity at the center, foreign inflows might surpass our assumption and the RBI may not have to do huge OMOs,"" ICICI’s Singh said. “In that case, things can change drastically.""

316,2019-03-11,ICICI,"UP electricity board says Tata Power can buy Prayagraj Power with no debt and interest costs so that it can reduce power tariffsTata Power says Prayagraj Power has been sold under IBC and thus UP electricity board cannot interfere in the matter

Mumbai: Tata Power Ltd will not agree to lower tariffs for its proposed acquisition of Prayagraj Power Generation Co. Ltd as suggested by the electricity regulator in Uttar Pradesh,a company executive said on the condition of anonymity. 
The regulator recently said Tata Power would receive the plant without any associated debt and interest costs; so it can afford to reduce the power tariff by 40 paise once the transaction is completed.
During a hearing on 6 March, the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission observed: “There is no denying the fact that now with zero debt, the element of interest on loan, which would be part of the fixed cost, becomes zero. As a result, enough headroom is available for the new incumbent to share this saving with consumers… If power sector assets are sold by financial institutions at much less than the book value without a corresponding adjustment in tariff, it will create a perverse incentive to buy these assets at the cost of the public. This will also create a possibility of undue arbitrage.""
The commission also said a “reduction in fixed charge by a reasonable amount"" is necessary to safeguard the consumer’s interest and directed State Bank of India the petitioner, to offer a nearly 40 paise/unit discount in tariff.
In November 2018, Resurgent Power—a joint venture of Tata Power, ICICI Bank and a few global investors—successfully bid for a 75.01% stake in Prayagraj Power, making a one-time settlement offer. Prayagraj Power owns and operates a 1,980 MW power plant in Uttar Pradesh’s Bara district. Resurgent Power agreed to pay around  ₹6,000 crore to the plant’s lenders and give them 14% equity stake in the plant after the acquisition. It also agreed to settle tax dues and not pursue disputes with the state power distribution company.
In order to transfer the asset to Resurgent Power, SBI reached out to the electricity regulator in UP, which later suggested the tariff cut.
A spokesperson for Tata Power said, “The sale has happened under the IBC process and the regulator cannot intervene. It is for banks to take a call. The current petition is for an ownership change in the asset; we cannot modify the PPA. It is not within the purview of the regulatory commission to decide this.""
He said no stressed asset within the power sector will be resolved under the IBC process if PPAs are subject to modification. “We have made the offer to SBI; we will not change anything,"" he said.
While a Supreme Court directive on 16 November gives interim relief to debt-laden power firms from bankruptcy proceedings, banks are hurrying to settle cases under one-time settlement offers.
The case will be next heard on 25 March."

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank on Thursday said SBI, ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank will have to comply with additional capital requirement norms by April 1 as the banks continue to remain 'too big to fail' lenders, referred to as D-SIB or domestic systemically important bank.
SIBs are subjected to higher levels of supervision so as to prevent disruption in financial services in the event of any failure.
""The additional Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) requirement for D-SIBs has already been phased-in from April 1, 2016 and will become fully effective from April 1, 2019. The additional CET1 requirement will be in addition to the capital conservation buffer,"" the central bank said.
The additional CET1 core capital requirement in case of the State Bank of India applicable from April 1 has been prescribed at 0.6% of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs) while for the other two banks it is 0.4%.
The Reserve Bank had issued the Framework for dealing with D-SIBs in July 22, 2014. The D-SIB framework requires the RBI to disclose the names of banks designated as D-SIBs starting from 2015 and place these banks in appropriate buckets depending upon their Systemic Importance Scores (SISs).
Based on the bucket in which a D-SIB is placed, an additional common equity requirement has to be applied to it.
SIBs are seen as 'too big to fail (TBTF)', creating expectation of government support for them in times of financial distress. These banks also enjoy certain advantages in funding markets.

312,2019-03-18,ICICI,"Although India has only 3 robots for every 10,000 workers, enterprises are increasingly turning to robots to save manpower and costThe adoption of robots has been slow in India. However, with more firms investing in digitization, the levels are set to increase

In early 2018, Thiruvananthapuram-based startup Genrobotics joined hands with the Kerala government to deploy a spider-shaped robot named Bandicoot to clean sewers and manholes in the city. The robot’s mechanical arms reached inside the manhole and reportedly cleaned out the sludge in a few minutes, a task that earlier required three people and several hours of hard labour.
Bandicoot is just a case in point. Governments and enterprises are increasingly turning to robots to save time, manpower and cost. Around 3,412 new industrial robots were installed in India in 2017— an increase of 30% over the 2,626 units that were installed in 2016, claims the International Federation of Robotics (IFR) report published in January, 2019. While the automotive industry has seen the highest adoption, the demand for robots is growing in general industry as well.
However, India still lags Japan, the US and Germany when it comes to robotics adoption. When it comes to density of robots, the US roughly uses 189 robots for every 10,000 workers. In China, the number is 68 while in India we have hardly 3 robots for every 10,000 workers, according to IFR. There is still long way to go, but the awareness is increasing and the market is slowly opening up in India as well, points out P. Satyanarayana, director of LFP, visual products and robots, Epson India.
“The adoption of robots has been slow in India because Indian companies prefer to have more stable and tested tools. Also, many processes in Indian market are not very standardized and many business still run in an unstructured way with lower levels of digitization compared to other developed markets,"" points out Vijay S. Bhaskaran, partner, robotics and intelligent automation, Ernst & Young. However, with more companies investing in digitization, the adoption levels are set to increase, he adds.
Besides automotive, robots are used in electronics, food and packaging, education and banking sector for routine jobs.
For instance, in the electronics and packaging industry, they are used to sort, pick and place objects, while in automotive sector, their role is limited to assembling and screw tightening.
Among electronics companies, Samsung is using around 80 Epson robots in its new manufacturing plant in Noida. In the banking sector, ICICI Bank has also deployed their robots in 14-15 locations across India where currency notes are sorted, said Epson’s Satyanarayana.
Bangalore-based SME Suparna Plastics Ltd. which makes plastic ball valves is using SCARA (Selective Compliance Assembly Robot Arm) robots in its assembly operations for the high speed and accuracy it brings to the table. “Instead of taking the conventional way and hire more skilled workers we went for automation using robots. Labour cost is one of the main contributing factors to the cost price of the end product. Robots have helped us bring down the labour cost,"" says Arun Bhat, director, Suparna Plastics Ltd.
In the case of ICICI Bank, currencies collected from various branches are brought to locations where they are grouped, inspected, counted and redistributed to ATM machines or other branches, based on their condition. If the notes are soiled or very old, the ATM machine will have trouble identifying them and will have to be sent to the bank. Once the machines used by the bank have determined the condition of the notes and where they are supposed to go, robots pick up the notes, put them in the counter for counting followed by strapping and then place them in the appropriate slot.
“Deploying a robot can cost as low  ₹5 lakh for entry-level robots, and can go up to  ₹30- ₹40 lakh depending on the application, nature of job and the payload involved,"" says Epson’s Satyanarayna.
Robots are also being introduced in healthcare for operations that require greater precision. According to reports, Ahmedabad-based Apex hospital used Corpath technology of US-based Corindus Vascular Robotics to remotely control a robot to perform a telerobotic heart surgery on patient who was located 32km away in Gandhinagar in December 2018.
In another instance, this February, doctors at PGIMER Chandigarh used robots for a precision surgery on a two-year-old baby born with esophageal atresia, a condition where food pipe is not developed. Bhaskaran points out that India has one of the lowest doctor to patient ratio. Bringing healthcare to large set of population can only be done through technology and industrial robotics will play a big role in that."

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow’s income today, and the process involved is simple. But you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan. This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset.

Selling Indian government bonds and buying high-yielding paper issued by the nation’s states is a favorite trade among the biggest holders of sovereign debt right now.
The strategy is offering lenders extra returns of about 100 basis points at a time when concerns about an oversupply from the federal government’s record borrowing plan has damped the appeal of sovereign securities, according to ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. and Deutsche Bank AG.
“Most of the banking system is replacing sovereign debt with state-development loans or credit,"" said Srinivas Varadarajan, treasury head at the Indian unit of Deutsche Bank.
India’s $807 billion sovereign-debt market is battling poor demand and increased volatility ahead of the upcoming elections. Underwriters have rescued bond sales twice since January as the government’s plan to borrow $100 billion in the year starting April 1 and a slowdown in buybacks of the securities by the central bank damps appetite.
That dynamic doesn’t apply to the nation’s states, some of whom recently borrowed funds at about 8.4%, richer than the 7.39% yield on the 10-year federal paper sold at the most recent auctions.
“It makes sense to sell a government bond at 7.5% and buy a state development loan at 8.2-8.3%, or give the money out as a loan,"" Mumbai-based Varadarajan said.
Banks are buying state bonds and moving them to the so-called held-to-maturity group, a category that shields them from price swings. Central bank rules allow lenders to shift their holdings between three buckets -- held-to-maturity, available-for-sale and held-for-trading -- before the start of the new fiscal year on April 1.
“Banks are tendering their stock and moving out of government bonds and into state-development loans and putting them into the HTM category,"" said Naveen Singh, Mumbai-based head of fixed-income trading at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership. “That’s the name of the game as of now.""

Investors can’t stop piling up on the stock of Axis Bank Ltd, India’s third-largest private sector lender. Part of this is driven by the hope that the bank’s new CEO will narrow the gap with the top private sector lender, HDFC Bank Ltd.
Axis Bank’s stock has risen 20% so far this year, while HDFC Bank and second-ranked ICICI Bank Ltd haven’t managed to notch up more than 9% increase, each. Axis Bank’s new managing director and chief executive officer (CEO), Amitabh Chaudhry, is making all the right noises on strategy, and analysts seem to have bought the idea that the bank’s return on equity target of 18% by 2021-22 is achievable. 
The bank’s management made a presentation to analysts last week, wherein Chaudhry outlined a cautious game plan, which was laced with enough aggression.
“I did not come here and appear for the interview to remain No. 3. Let me put it that way,"" Chaudhry told The Hindu Business Line newspaper. This reveals much about his aggression. But he is not willing to compromise on the quality of the assets either, which is a heartening sign.
Especially so, since the lender saw its worst year in FY18, which ended with a massive loss of  ₹2,188 core for the March 2018 quarter. This was a direct fallout of its past mistakes of taking on too much risk. Axis Bank has been on the mend ever since, consciously hacking off the dodgy BB-rated loans and bringing down the share of even loans rated BBB. Its slippages have been on the decline, and it has built a reasonable insurance against risk, with a provision coverage ratio of 75%.
Under the new leadership, the lender is clear that project financing is a strict no-no and new borrowers need to be strong, if not pristine, on credit quality. At the same time, the bank is firing on all cylinders to grab retail business as well as growth in working capital financing.
But falling risk tempers returns. Axis Bank is chasing good credit and more retail loans at a time when interest rates are poised to slip. Ergo, analysts are expecting margins to compress going forward.
Besides, a superior performance under the new leadership has already been factored in by the Axis Bank stock when Chaudhry took over in January. In fact, the recent surge in the stock price looks like an overkill. The stock trades at 2.5 times its estimated book value for FY20, more expensive than ICICI Bank’s 2.1 valuation. This is beginning to make some investors edgy.
Also, not all analysts believe that Axis Bank’s performance would improve markedly from previous quarters. Citing that the stock is priced to perfection, Centrum Broking Ltd said, “While we are optimistic that management will deliver on guidance for the long term, we remain circumspect about the near to mid-term outlook."""

“Over the last decade, Northern Arc has created a strong platform, which enables access to debt capital for emerging sectors.

Former State Bank of India (SBI) Chairman Arun Kumar Purwar tops the list of probables to head the interim board of Jet Airways, among others, sources told IANS.
The other names doing the rounds include Janaki Ballav and Arundhati Bhattarcharya, both former chairpersons of SBI, according to people privy to the developments.
Banking sources said that Purwar's chances of heading the board are higher and he could be one of the two nominees on the Jet board, which became vacant after former Chairman Naresh Goyal and his wife Anita Goyal stepped down on Monday.
The other vacant seat could go to one of the other lenders -- IDBI Bank, ICICI Bank or Yes Bank.

""The SBI wants to appoint a Chairman to head the interim board fast, as it does not want the baord to remain headless and also wants to start work on finding a buyer at the earliest,"" a source said.
On Tuesday, the Civil Aviation Ministry had a meeting with the representatives of the SBI, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and Jet Airways whereby the airline assured that it would not ground any more flights and would talk to lessors to operationalise as many as 40 grounded aircraft by April-end.
Jet Airways has been struggling with cash flows for the past six months because of rising fuel costs and intense competition. It has even delayed payment to lessors, airport operators and oil marketing companies (OMCs) besides a part of its workforce to keep the company running.
Around 50 of its aircraft were grounded due to the inability to pay rentals. Its pilots and certain sections of the employees have been without pay for some months, forcing the pilots to issue an ultimatum to the erstwhile management on salary payments.

NEW DELHI :
Mumbai: Mindtree Ltd’s independent directors’ committee has appointed Khaitan and Co. as the legal adviser and ICICI Securities Ltd as financial adviser for guiding the company’s directors in providing recommendations to Mindtree shareholders on the open offer to be launched by Larsen and Toubro Ltd.
Following a meeting of the independent directors on Tuesday, Mindtree’s lead independent director Apurva Purohit said: “This (independent directors’) committee will discharge the legal obligations placed on the independent directors under the prevailing regulations with respect to providing reasoned recommendations on the offer.""
“The written reasoned recommendations on the open offer shall be provided within the timeline and as per the guidelines laid down by Sebi. Since the entire matter is under evaluation at this stage, no opinion has been formed by the independent directors thus far. Any reports suggesting otherwise are incorrect and baseless,"" Purohit added in a statement. On 26 March, the Bengaluru-based IT company’s board scrapped its plan for a share buyback that was aimed at preventing a hostile takeover by L&T.
L&T had on 18 March announced that it would launch an open offer to buy additional 31% of Mindtree after agreeing to buy a 20.32% stake from V.G. Siddhartha and his firms, the company’s largest shareholder group.
L&T will launch its open offer on 14 May.
L&T also said it would buy a 15% stake in Mindtree from the open market. L&T aims to buy a total of 66.32% in Mindtree, which will cost it around  ₹10,700 crore at  ₹980 per share.
For now, L&T wants Mindtree to remain listed and function independently. But, on 19 March, in an investor presentation, L&T mentioned that it might consider a possible merger of Mindtree with L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services, once the combined revenues from the three entities cross the $5 billion threshold.
L&T said it will file its draft letter of offer with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the Mindtree takeover on 2 April, while Mindtree’s IDC could send its recommendations to the shareholders by 10 May. L&T has the option to raise the open offer price or the offer size till 13 May.
On Tuesday, L&T shares fell 0.19% to  ₹1409.70 apiece while Mindtree's gained 0.08% to 945.25 apiece on the BSE. The benchmark Sensex rose 0.48% to end the day at a record high of 39,056.65 points.

A subsidiary of RPG Group, KEC International, is one of the leading engineering, procurement and construction companies in India. Its ability to estimate project cost at the time of bidding helped it win projects, deliver margins and mitigate risks. These estimates were based on the analysis of contour maps and physical surveys, which was both time-taking and prone to human errors. After trying out several alternatives, KEC decided to go with autonomous surveys using drones. Once the data was captured, it used image analytics, computer visions, and machine learning models to calculate excavation and backfilling of land. This allowed its bidding team to estimate project costs more accurately and this improved its bid-to-win ratio significantly. In terms of cost savings, the spending on excavation and backfilling quantity was reduced by up to 30%. Now KEC can survey 250 acres in five hours, which earlier took more than five days. This has also allowed it to build a repository of data in digital format for future use.
Internet of Things (IoT): Voltas Ltd
Voltas has seen immense benefits by using IoT to gather data to perform preventive and predictive maintenance of its cooling equipment. Providing services to a fragmented enterprise customer base of 3,500 across 45 locations in the country was proving to be a major challenge for the company. That is when it decided to turn away from a reactive after-sales service, where it had to be informed by the customer of the breakdown, to an I-T-based predictive and preventive maintenance system where all connected Voltas equipment share real-time data with their engineers, allowing them to remotely keep track of the equipment’s health. This not only helped them prevent failures but also ensured customers’ business remained unaffected by breakdowns. According to Voltas, the general turnaround time is 10-12 days, but with the help of IoT, it has managed to bring it down to three days. In terms of cost savings, this has allowed the company to reduce raw material and overhead rationalization by 10% and has led to revenue growth of 15% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) since deployment.
Robotic process automation (RPA): HDFC Bank Ltd
HDFC Bank processes around five million loan applications across multiple locations every year. The average processing time for each loan request was over 45 minutes as everything from application indexing, data entry, document verification and underwriting forward was being done manually. By using RPA, HDFC Bank has automated the data capturing process. Loan processing across all locations is now placed in a centralized server where real-time loan processing status would be visible to all credit administrators. It has also allowed the bank to allocate the cases to credit managers based on the nature of loan, location and eligibility.
This has reduced the turnaround time for processing loan requests by 50%, offering the bank the opportunity to scale up and handle more customers. The tangible benefits of RPA have been the improvement in productivity of data entry staff by 40% and decision-making staff by up to 12%. This has also minimized the scope for manual errors, resulting in better credit quality decisions.
Blockchain: ICICI Bank Ltd
ICICI Bank has emerged as one of the first banks in India to use blockchain for paperless trade process that is safe and secure. The platform is being used for exchange and authentication of overseas transactions and international trade documents. The switch to blockchain has helped the bank reduce the turnaround time of trade cycles, leading to better management of cash flow and inventories. It has also made transactions more transparent as auditing and tracing of blockchain transactions is a lot easier.
The bank hopes this will bring in new asset classes and open up new revenue generation opportunities for it. On a daily basis, the bank is processing all overseas transactions between India and Canada via blockchain. So far, it has processed Canadian $32 million on the platform. Another area where the technology has helped the bank is in trade, which is a paper-intensive process. The bank is looking at how to create a digital letter of credit within 10 minutes.
Augmented reality (AR)/Virtual reality (VR): Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd
In the intermediate commercial vehicles industry, most customers are single vehicle owners or driver owners, who usually rely on feedback or advice of friends and peers when it comes to buying new vehicles, since most original equipment manufacturers in the industry do not provide ownership experiences to them. Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is using VR to provide individual buyers a more personalized experience.
The automaker’s VR platform provides 360-degree videos of the working of its Furio trucks in real-life environment. It puts the customer in the co-passenger seat while the driver can explain the various features of the truck. It includes a VR headset developed by Procus and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro smartphone that comes preloaded with a Furio VR App and mobile device management service.
It is being used for customer/driver meets or local events and during individual customer showroom/office visits. M&M is hoping the use of Furio VR will help improve the conversion ratio of leads to sales and save around  ₹15-30 lakh per dealership."

LONDON :
Embattled liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya on Wednesday faced yet another legal battle to prevent a consortium of Indian banks led by State Bank of India (SBI) getting access to nearly £260,000 in a UK bank account.
The 62-year-old is contesting an interim debt order obtained by the Indian banks in January this year, which relates to funds in the former Kingfisher Airlines boss’ current account with ICICI Bank in London.
At a hearing before Master David Cook at the Queen's Bench Division of the court, Mallya's legal team sought a dismissal of the interim order. A judgment in the case is expected at a later date.
""The hearing concerns an interim third-party debt order obtained by the banks in January and relates to funds worth just short of £260,000 in Dr Mallya's current account with ICICI Bank in London,"" said a spokesperson for TLT LLP, the law firm representing the Indian banks.
""This is part of the banks' ongoing efforts to enforce the (Indian) Debt Recovery Tribunal judgment against Dr Mallya in the UK. Dr Mallya is opposing the application and asking that the court discharges the interim order. If it is made final, the funds will be released to the banks,"" the spokesperson explained.
The case is part of wider efforts by SBI and 12 other Indian banks – Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd – to recover some of the funds owed to them as a result of unpaid loans by Mallya's now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines.
In a ruling in May last year, a UK High Court judge had refused to overturn a worldwide order freezing Mallya's assets and upheld an Indian court's ruling that the consortium of 13 Indian banks were entitled to recover funds amounting to nearly £1.145 billion.
TLT LLP has been representing the banks in their efforts to recover their dues as part of the worldwide freezing order, including a bankruptcy petition aimed at seizing his assets to recover dues filed at the end of last year.
Mallya had been granted £20,000 in weekly allowance as a result of the worldwide freeze order after his legal team made representations to the court to hike the initial £5,000 weekly allowance.
Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail after his extradition was ordered by Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London in December last year and signed off by UK home secretary Sajid Javid in February.
He has since filed an application in the UK High Court seeking leave to appeal against that order, with the papers now awaiting a judge's ruling on whether it should be rejected or can move to a hearing stage."
300,2019-04-04,ICICI,"ICICI Bank wants to be made a party in the case filed by Daiichi Sankyo seeking  ₹3,500 crore from the Singh brothersICICI Bank says if the entire award is secured in favour of Daiichi Sankyo, there may be nothing left for ICICI Bank to recover

New Delhi: Claiming  ₹250 crore in dues from the erstwhile promoter of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Religare Enterprises Ltd, Malvinder Singh, ICICI Bank Ltd has filed an application with the Supreme Court, asking to be made a party in the case filed by Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. Daiichi Sankyo is seeking enforcement of a  ₹3,500 crore arbitration award by a Singapore-based tribunal.
The matter is likely to be taken up on Friday for hearing in the Supreme Court.
The lender has filed an intervention application in the Supreme Court stating that both ICICI Bank and Daiichi Sankyo have equal rights in seeking dues and should be treated on a par, two people aware of the matter said.
According to the people, the bank, in its special leave petition, has stated that both ICICI Bank and Daiichi Sankyo are unsecured creditors and thus similarly placed. Therefore, according to the bank’s plea, if the entire awarded amount is secured in favour of Daiichi Sankyo, there may be nothing left for ICICI Bank to recover.
It has submitted that its application may be put on a par with Daiichi and that it should be allowed to intervene in the proceedings.
ICICI Bank has alleged that it had granted credit facility to the tune of  ₹250 crore to Religare Finvest Ltd, one of the subsidiaries of Religare Enterprises, which was backed by the deed of guarantee executed by Singh in his personal and individual capacity in December 2015. As per the bank’s plea, under the terms and conditions stipulated in the credit arrangement letter, the money had to be repaid in full at the end of five years and five months. Singh, however, failed to pay up or comply with the demand notices served by the bank.
The bank has already initiated recovery proceedings before the debt recovery tribunal (DRT). ICICI Bank had also approached the Delhi high court regarding the same issue. However, its plea was disposed of on the grounds that it had no locus standi in the matter. The judge had asked the bank to come back after having a decree in its favour from the DRT.
Supreme Court had in its least hearing directed both the Singh brothers—Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh—to come up with a plan to secure the  ₹3,500 crore award. 
The court had asked both the brothers to sit with their lawyers and accountants, and find solutions to secure the arbitration award. “It is not about individual honour, but it doesn’t look good for the country’s honour. You were the flag-bearers of the pharmacare industry and it doesn’t look good that you are appearing in court.... You’re coming to the Supreme Court for the first time, let’s hope it’s the last time,"" Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had said, before adjourning the case till 28 March.
The court is hearing a plea by Daiichi Sankyo related to the sale of the Singh brothers’ stake in Ranbaxy to Daiichi for $4.6 billion in 2008. Following the sale, several quality issues surfaced at Ranbaxy’s plants. Daiichi blamed the Singh brothers for suppressing facts relating to the plants. In 2016, the Singapore tribunal ordered Singh brothers to pay compensation to Daiichi."
299,2019-04-06,ICICI,"Small-ticket insurance cover, also known as sachet or bite-size insurance, is a non-comprehensive plan, focusing on a specific need and comes with a low premium and lower coverIf you intend to buy bite-size covers then understand the inclusions and exclusions to avoid last-minute surprises

Mumbai: Buying products in small affordable sizes is not a new concept. For instance, shampoos were successfully sold, especially in rural India, in sachets through which the shampoo industry tapped into the lower-end market, which could buy it at a low cost for one-time use. Taking this concept ahead, the insurance industry has introduced sachet or bite-sized insurance products in the market. Still at a nascent stage, sachet insurance products are gaining interest from investors and consumers. Here we looks at bite size insurance products and tells you whether you should buy it.
Low premium, low cover
Small-ticket insurance cover, also known as sachet or bite-size insurance, is a non-comprehensive plan, focusing on a specific need and comes with a low premium and lower cover. It is different from micro insurance, which has been around for a while and typically caters to the bottom of the pyramid.
An example of bite-size insurance is the insurance you get with your train ticket on IRCTC website, which is supported by a public insurance company. Insurance companies and online insurance technology companies are building sachet insurance for both life insurance and general insurance. However, currently it focuses on general insurance categories such as health, travel, home appliances and lifestyle needs. Companies such as Toffee Insurance, Digit Insurance and Mobikwik provide bite-size insurance online. Insurance companies such as ICICI Lombard also offer bite-size insurance, which you will notice when you book airline tickets online. “The sum insured gets defined by the premium. A premium of up to  ₹1,000 per year can be called as sachet insurance and the sum insured will depend on the category where it can go up to Rs4-5 lakh,"" said Rohan Kumar, chief executive officer, Toffee Insurance. For instance, Digit Insurance offers a holiday home cover for  ₹200 excluding tax for  ₹2 lakh cover. These insurance products require less documentation for underwriting unlike conventional policies.
Should you opt for it?
Targeted towards millennials who don’t have insurance or are first-time buyers, these policies can be a starting point. “There is a large segment that doesn’t have any insurance and may perceive threat to certain risks as opposed to complete coverage. Bite-size covers can help individuals get introduced to a product and take certain benefits before she decides to opt for a full fledged cover,"" says Rahul Aggarwal, chief executive officer, Optima Insurance Broker. But the low cover may not be adequate. Let’s consider a fitness insurance plan at  ₹430, which offers an accidental death and disablement lump sum up to  ₹1 lakh. Although targeted for a section that does not have insurance, it does not really benefit the family in case of death because the accidental death coverage of Rs1 lakh is extremely low. “They are definitely not for everyone as consumers with pre-existing conditions and higher risks will have a different requirement,"" said Kumar.
Another problem is the insufficient data to establish the claim settlement ratio considering most products have been introduced only recently. And bite-size insurance that have existed for a while have low claim settlement ratio. “For instance, in domestic travel insurance, the claims ratio is 8% of the premium and for overseas travel insurance it is 25-30%. The incurred claim ratio should exceed 50% for any product. It is low because people either don’t claim or most claims are not properly paid because of specific conditions that are difficult to interpret,"" says Kapil Mehta, co-founder, Securenow.com. According to financial planners, it is advisable to have a term plan if you have dependents and a basic health plan in place. If you intend to buy bite-size covers then understand the inclusions and exclusions to avoid last-minute surprises."

SBI Asset Management Co. Ltd climbed two places from the fifth to the third spot with an AUM of  ₹2.83 trillion.
Fastest and slowest
Among the top 20 AMCs, Mirae Asset Global Investments (India) Pvt. Ltd registered the fastest growth compared to the corresponding quarter of FY2017-18. The AMC has witnessed growth in the past few years as well. Its AUM grew by 54% compared to the last quarter of FY2017-18.
SBI Mutual Fund recorded the second fastest growth rate at 30% despite its already huge size. “Among the fund houses that grew the largest in FY18-19, the AUM growth of SBI Mutual Fund is likely to be the result of ETF (exchange-traded fund) inflows. It gets huge inflows from the EPFO (Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation). In case of Mirae, both of its flagship funds—Mirae Asset India Equity (now Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund) and Mirae Asset Emerging Business Fund— have delivered very strong performance which has in turn driven inflows,"" said Mahesh Mirpuri, Proprietor, Invest Mutual, a Chennai-based mutual fund distributor.
On the other hand, LIC Mutual Fund Asset Management Ltd saw a 24% contraction in AUM, while Sundaram Asset Management Co. Ltd witnessed an 11% contraction.
A financial planner, on the condition of anonymity, indicated that the contraction in Sundaram Mutual Fund may be on account of a clampdown on closed-end funds by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The regulator capped the total expense ratio (TER) for closed-end equity schemes at 1.25% and non-equity schemes at 1% through a notification issued in September 2018.

Life insurance is not about investing your money to earn a return on it, it’s about financial protection for your loved ones. The most efficient way to do that is through a term insurance policy. You pay only for insurance and after the policy term ends, you don’t get any money back. But on death during the policy term, it pays a huge corpus to the nominees.
Look at the premium (cost of the plan) and the claims settlement record of the insurer.
We list premium rates for some policies of a sum assured of  ₹ 1 crore across three age categories for policy terms of 30, 25 and 20 years. The claims settlement rate is measured by the value of the policies as a lower settlement rate is indicative of high ticket-size policies being rejected."

Corporate earnings for the March quarter and elections are expected to be key drivers of equity markets in this truncated week. Indian markets are shut for trading on Wednesday and Friday. Most analysts expect volatility in the markets is likely to continue till general elections are over.
Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said the current corrective phase in the markets has just begun and it may last till the middle of May, however, the undertone of the market will not be weak. ""The amount of price correction would be difficult to estimate but the markets will take their own time till May to correct. The markets are witnessing a whipsaw phase where neither the bulls nor the bears could make headway during the week. This is typically a corrective phase which the markets are undergoing after witnessing a strong rally. Statistically, similar such corrections in the past have taken around a month’s time.""
As India is set to see a new government post elections, analysts and investors will be keenly watching out for commentary and guidance by companies, which are expected to be indicative of economic and business growth. The surge in crude oil prices in the January-March period is expected to further delay a recovery in corporate earnings.
While private banks, cement and utilities, which have been a drag on earnings, are likely to post good numbers, the performance of former champions such as metals, auto, retail, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is likely to moderate in Q4FY19, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a 5 April note.
Major companies that will declare Q4 earnings this week are Reliance Industries, Wipro, HDFC Bank, RBL Bank, Mindtree and ICICI Lombard General Insurance.
This week investors are likely to react to TCS and Infosys stocks as the IT majors announced their March quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. Infosys reported a mixed bag in Q4FY19, with margins below expectations even as revenue was in-line. For the full year FY19, Infosys has posted 9% revenue growth in constant currency terms versus a guidance of 8.5- 9% and EBIT margin of 22.8% versus guidance of 22-24%. It has provided 7.5-9.5% growth guidance and has lowered its margin guidance by 100 basis points (bps) to 21-23% for FY20 – both lower than the street’s expectations. Analysts believe that lower-than-expected growth and margin guidance may lead to a cut in street’s earnings estimates.
“We believe Infosys is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, given that YoY constant currency growth was 11.7% in Q4FY19, with robust order wins also reflecting underlying revenue strength,"" Reliance Securities Ltd said.
TCS ended FY19 with full-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 11.4% YoY, EBIT margin of 25.6% and net income growth of 22.5% YoY.

288,2019-04-17,ICICI,"The case revolves around 258,559.79 pounds held in a bank account with the ICICI UK, which is named as a third party in the High Court caseMallya's lawyers had argued for the dismissal of the interim order on a number of grounds

LONDON :
Vijay Mallya on Wednesday failed to convince a UK High Court to dismiss an order related to money in one of his London bank accounts, dealing a blow to the embattled liquor tycoon's efforts to prevent a consortium of Indian banks getting access to nearly 260,000 pounds.
In one of the many legal cases being faced by the 63-year-old liquor tycoon in the UK, Master David Cook ruled that an interim debt order in favour of SBI and other banks seeking access to funds in the ICICI UK bank account ""should remain in force"" but that the application to make it final should be adjourned until after the hearing of Mallya's pending bankruptcy petition.
The funds in the account will meanwhile remain frozen as part of the worldwide freezing order in favour of the Indian banks last year.
Mallya's lawyers had argued for the dismissal of the interim order on a number of grounds, including a claim that it was a ""deliberate ploy"" to prevent Mallya ""reasonable"" living expenses.
""I reject the proposition that the application for a TPDO (third party debt order) was a deliberate ploy to thwart Dr Mallya's ability to meet his ordinary living expenses and reasonable legal expenses which are permitted under the terms of the WWFO (worldwide freezing order),"" Master Cook notes in his judgment.
""The relevant context here is that Dr Mallya is in a post judgment scenario where the Claimants (Indian banks) are attempting to enforce their judgment and discover the true extent of his assets. I note that Dr Mallya has made no voluntary payment to date… while continuing to incur substantial legal costs in opposing the Claimants’ efforts to enforce their judgment,"" he said.
The case revolves around 258,559.79 pounds held in a bank account with the ICICI UK, which is named as a third party in the High Court case. It is among one of many orders pursued by TLT LLP, the law firm acting for the Indian banks, as part of efforts to recoup some of the 1.142 billion pounds owed to them arising from proceedings in the Bangalore Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) against Kingfisher Airlines and others.
The DRT case was registered in the UK under the Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933 and went in favour of the Indian banks in an appeal in May 2018.
The banks have since also filed a bankruptcy petition against Mallya in the UK courts, which is being challenged by the former Kingfisher Airlines boss and is expected to come up for hearing around December this year.
Meanwhile, in yet another legal intervention, Mallya is seeking a stay of all enforcement proceedings which have been commenced since the presentation of the bankruptcy petition by the Indian banks in September last year, a hearing of which is expected next month.
The outcome of that hearing will determine the future course of the funds being sought by the SBI, Bank of Baroda, Corporation bank, Federal Bank Ltd, IDBI Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jammu & Kashmir Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of Mysore, UCO Bank, United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co. Pvt Ltd.
Mallya, meanwhile, remains on bail after his extradition was signed off by UK home secretary Sajid Javid in February and is seeking leave to appeal against that order in the High Court as well.

New Delhi: Private sector lender ICICI Bank Wednesday announced the launch of insta car and two-wheeler loans that will provide existing customers final sanction letters instantly.
The first service, called 'Insta Auto Loan', enables over two million pre-approved customers to avail the final sanction letter of a car loan instantly and digitally up to  ₹20 lakh for a tenure of up to seven years, ICICI Bank said in a statement.
The second initiative, named 'Insta Two-Wheeler Loan', offers over 12 million pre-approved customers the facility to get instant sanction of loan up to  ₹2 lakh for a tenure of up to three years, it said.
Both the plans will offer 100 per cent of the on-road price of vehicle, it added.

Benchmark stock market indices Sensex and Nifty today closed at record highs, led by gains in banking stocks and IT heavyweight TCS. The Sensex rose as much as 458 points intraday to 39,364, before ending at 39,275, up 369 points. Broader benchmark index Nifty, which hit a fresh high of 11,810 intraday, settled 0.90% higher at 11,787. Banking stocks led the gains with Nifty Bank index rising 1.5%. Earnings, investment flows and elections are likely to be the key drivers for Indian markets this truncated week. Indian markets would remain closed on Wednesday and Friday for Mahavir Jayanti and Good Friday. Voting for the second phase of Lok Sabha elections will take place on April 18. The global cues remained positive with Asian and European markets higher today.
Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets:
1) The earnings season got off to a good start with market heavyweight TCS reporting yet another quarter of strong results and the management expects continued strong growth in the new fiscal year starting April 1. TCS shares ended 1% higher, extending their Monday's 5% gain.
2) ICICI Bank surged 4% on reports that Goldman Sachs has raised its target price to  ₹492, from  ₹451. IndusInd Bank (4%), Axis Bank (1.6%), and HDFC Bank (0.80%) were among the other top gainers in the banking pack.
3) Infosys shares continued to drag after its margin and growth guidance disappointed the Street. Infosys shares ended 0.40% lower, after falling nearly 3% on Monday.
4) Wipro shares ended 2.3% lower ahead of its earnings announcement later in the day. RIL and HDFC Bank are also set to report quarterly numbers later this week.
5) Polycab India made a blockbuster debut today on bourses, with shares listing at 20% premium. Shares of Polycab India Ltd was listed on the stock exchanges at  ₹644.45, up 19.8% from its issue price of  ₹538 per share on Monday. The IPO had got a massive response, with subscription of over 50 times.
6) Elsewhere, SpiceJet shares extended gains to the fourth day as investors bet that the airline will be able to increase capacity amid Jet Airways's financial woes. SpiceJet shares rose 11% today. Jet Airways shares fell 7% after reports, citing sources, said that the management of airline has proposed to suspend all operations of the debt-laden airline at its board meeting today.
7) ""Indian markets had a dream run over the last few weeks on the back of dovish and accommodative global central banks and unprecedented foreign flows. The sentiment got a fillip once the Meteorological Department forecast near normal south-west monsoon,"" said Devang Mehta, head of equity advisory at Centrum Wealth Management.
8) ""The Street is also anticipating further rate cuts to reverse the economic slowdown and sensing a return of consumption demand, post the election results. The banks continue to have a lion’s share in the ongoing rally and the onus to lead the earnings for Nifty will lie with the corporate banks,"" Mehta said. ""With two good primary market listings (Metropolis Healthcare and Polycab India) in two days and upbeat mood, all eyes are now set on the ongoing fourth quarter earnings season.""
9) Expectations are rising that the RBI could deliver yet another rate cut in June to boost the economy. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) grew at a measly 0.1% in February. Consumer inflation rose at a faster pace than anticipated in March, but remained below the central bank's target for an eighth straight month, increasing the chances for a key interest rate cut in June.
10) Crude oil price remains a key risk for Indian markets as any substantial movement beyond $70 per barrel is not conducive for the Indian economy, analysts say. Brent crude prices are hovering near five-month high of around $71 a barrel."

Mumbai: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) this week has issued fresh summons to former CEO of ICICI Bank Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar to appear for questioning in a money laundering case.
The agency is probing whether a part of the  ₹300 crore loan that she allegedly received as illegal gratification was laundered.
ED is probing a case of money laundering based on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) case. The CBI case is probing alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning of  ₹1875 crore of loan to Videocon International Electronics Ltd by ICICI Bank in 2012.
Of this, a term loan of  ₹300 crore was allegedly a part of quid pro quo for the business group’s dealings with her husband. Chanda Kochhar is alleged to have misused her office and received illegal gratification through her husband from Dhoot for this  ₹300 crore loan.
While ED has summoned the Kochhar brothers on 30 April, Chanda Kochhar has been summoned on 5 May, said an official with the investigative agency.
The ED on 1 March had conducted series of searches at the residence and office premises of Kochhars as part of its investigations.
""The ED has called them with their bank account details and statements to verify the trail of money,"" said the official.
It is alleged that Videocon group's promoter Venugopal Dhoot had invested in the Deepak Kochhar company, NuPower Renewables Ltd through his firm Supreme Energy. This transaction was alleged quid-pro-quo for loans cleared by the ICICI Bank and Chanda Kochhar was part of the credit committee of banks which sanctioned  ₹40,000 crore loan to the Videocon group. Out of this  ₹3250 crore was given by ICICI Bank. A large portion of the loan by ICICI Bank to Videocon group was unpaid at the end of 2017. The bank then proceeded to declare the  ₹2810 crore of unpaid loan as Non Performing Asset."

BENGALURU :
Mumbai-based EnKash, owned by Nehat Tech Solutions Pvt. Ltd., has raised $3 million in a Series A round from venture capital fund Mayfield India and early-stage investor and accelerator Axilor Ventures.
EnKash is a business-to-business (B2B) payments management and automation platform. The latest investment will be used to enhance its existing technology base and for building a leadership team, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
Vikram Godse, managing partner, Mayfield, will join Enkash’s board of directors, the company said. Over the last three years, Mayfield India has also invested in other fintech companies such as LendingKart, Upwards Fintech, and M1 Exchange.
Industry experts say the B2B market records annual transaction values of more than $1 trillion globally. EnKash, which enables businesses to process high volume transactions, plans to make a dent in this market by adding support for credit-based payments and payment reconciliation for buyers and suppliers.
Founded in 2017, by Yadvendra Tyagi, Hemant Vishnoi and Naveen Bindal, EnKash connects corporates, vendors and credit providers. The product helps automate the entire process of B2B payments and ease the working capital requirements of suppliers.
It also helps businesses manage their purchase orders and invoices, and enable and track payments to suppliers or from buyers. The company believes that by automating B2B payments, buyers and suppliers can improve their cash flow by receiving advance payments or quick financing options on their invoices.
EnKash is live with banks like Kotak Mahindra Bank and ICICI Bank and is in advanced discussions with several other financial institutions, it added in its statement.
“Businesses in India have been struggling with manual payment processes for a long time. We are easing B2B payment problems for thousands of businesses today. Along with the partnerships of Mayfield and Axilor, we are bullish about the positive impact that we can have in the buyer/supplier ecosystem,"" said Yadvendra Tyagi, chief executive of EnKash, in a statement.
“Their (Enkash’s) core tech platform solves issues around the dearth of working capital through a payment mechanism, which we believe will create tremendous value for the supplier ecosystem. We are excited to partner with them,"" added Vikram Godse, Managing Partner, Mayfield."

—Naman Gupta
You are investing in an all-equity portfolio (save one fund that has some debt allocation in it) for a 3-5 year time frame. Such a portfolio is way too aggressive for this time frame and there is a chance you could lose money.
First, tax-saving funds should be used for tax deduction; at the end of the lock-in period (of three years), you can keep it or move the corpus to open-ended funds. They are all broadly diversified funds and avoid mixing purposes (tax-saving and long-term wealth generation) as it could skew your asset allocation.
Second, while the funds you have chosen are good with decent track records, many of them belong to the aggressive categories of diversified funds or small or mid-cap funds. Like I said, this is risky for a short time frame such as yours.
My recommendation would be to first separate your tax-saving investments. You are investing  ₹20,000 a month in such funds and can continue holding them. The remaining  ₹16,000 should ideally be invested in a more moderate portfolio with not more than 60% in equity. ICICI Prudential Value Discovery, Franklin India Equity, Kotak Standard Multi-cap and Franklin India Smaller Companies are good for the equity portion. The remaining 40% can go in short-term bond or liquid funds from Axis and HDFC mutual funds.

282,2019-04-25,ICICI,"All the profitability metrics of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance held up. The value of its new business margin rose to 17% in FY19ICICI PruLife saw its business growth drop because it shifted its focus to small-ticket products a few quarters ago

Mumbai: Life insurance as a product may be a hard sell but that doesn't seem to be the case with the stocks of life insurers.
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Ltd’s stock surged 4% in opening trades today despite the insurer reporting a 23% drop in net profit for the March quarter and a 30% drop for the full year.
Even the most popular insurance growth story didn’t reflect in the metrics of the insurer with its annualised premium equivalent growing by just 11%. For the full year, it declined by 3%.
So what explains the sanguine reaction of investors today when fourth-quarter results aren’t any better?
Part of the reason could be that bad news had already been factored in by investors. To be sure, ICICI PruLife saw its business growth drop because it shifted its focus to small-ticket products a few quarters ago. Nomura Securities noted that the effect of this change on growth could last a year.
The silver lining of the results: The insurer squeezed profits even as its business growth fumbled. All its profitability metrics held up. The value of its new business margin, a key profitability metric, rose to 17% in FY19.
What's more, the share of margin-friendly protection business increased to 20.9% of new business premium for the year from just 11% the year before.
That said, ICICI PruLife is ceding market share to aggressive competitors, which is a bad sign. The insurer gave up its job of selling big-ticket products, mainly market-linked, to rich investors and turned its focus to smaller retail customers.
As insurance is a long term business, there is nothing wrong with this move. But in the short-term, this entails a lot of pain on the growth side, which is already visible now.
So far, investors seem to have taken the pain in stride in the hope of long-term dividends.
A testimony of this was the good response to the life insurer’s promoter stake sale a month back. Shares had gained 9% after the offer for sale sailed through.
Notwithstanding the rise, ICICI PruLife’s stock has gone nowhere in FY19, while its peers have seen modest gains. Also, the life insurer’s stock trades at a sober multiple than its peers. Jeffries India Pvt Ltd estimates the insurer’s embedded value for FY21 to be  ₹25,922 crore and notes that valuations are reasonable."
286,2019-04-26,ICICI,"You can earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6% on your savings accounts, depending on the amount and the bankKotak Mahindra Bank has lowered rate of interest on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh to 4.5%

A savings account is one of the basic financial products that everyone must have. All the major banks including State Bank of India (SBI), Bank Of Baroda (BoB), Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC and ICICI Bank offer their customers several variations of savings accounts. These are just basic savings accounts where you can leave your money and earn an interest in the range of 3.5-6%, depending on the amount and the bank. The interest amount then gets credited to the customer on a quarterly basis, according to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules.
Here are the savings account interest rates for major Indian banks:
SBI: The State Bank of India, the largest one, offers its customers 3.50% interest rates on savings deposit balance of up to  ₹1 crore. Above  ₹1 crore, the interest rate levied on savings balance is 4% per annum. Following the 25bps reduction in repo rate by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 4 April, SBI’s cash credit and overdraft rate will be reduced by 25bps with effect from 1 May. The savings bank rate also stands revised to 3.5% for balances up to  ₹1 lakh and 3.25% for above  ₹1 lakh.
Kotak Mahindra Bank: Private lender Kotak Mahindra Bank has cut the interest rate on savings account deposits of up to  ₹1 lakh. The rate of interest has been lowered to 4.5% from 5% earlier, according to the bank’s website. The revision in interest rate came into effect from 15 April 2019. The interest rate on savings account deposits on balance above  ₹1 lakh and up to  ₹1 crore remains unchanged at 6%. Similarly, the interest rate on savings accounts balance of above  ₹1 crore remains steady at 5.5%.
Bank of Baroda: Bank of Baroda (BoB), which has become the second largest public sector bank after SBI following its amalgamation with Bengaluru-based Vijaya Bank and Mumbai-based Dena Bank, offers an interest rate of 3.50% to 4.00% on savings account.
HDFC Bank: HDFC Bank is offering an interest rate of 3.50% per annum (p.a.) on savings deposit balance below  ₹50 lakh. Above this amount, HDFC levies an interest rate of 4% p.a.
ICICI Bank: ICICI Bank, too like HDFC, gives its customers the same range of interest rates. For account balance below  ₹50 lakh, the interest rate is 3.5% per annum. The interest rate of 4% for savings balance amount over  ₹50 lakh."
281,2019-04-29,ICICI,"In FY19, more than a quarter of HDFC Life’s new business came from selling plain protection productsHDFC Life reported growth of 13% in annualized premium equivalent (APE), slower than its past performance

HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd’s profitability metrics for FY19 outshone those of its closest rivals SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
HDFC Life reported growth of 13% in annualized premium equivalent (APE), slower than its past performance. But its rival ICICI PruLife reported no growth at all. SBI Life did marginally better with 14% growth in APE.
But its value of new business margin of 24.6% was superior compared with SBI Life’s 17.7% and ICICI PruLife’s 17%. But there is no secret sauce here. All insurers have realized that growing the margin-friendly protection business is key to better profitability.
HDFC Life has just been more successful than others in pushing plain term plans. In FY19, more than a quarter of its new business came from selling plain protection products. ICICI PruLife is far behind with a share of 9.3%, while SBI Life had 12% of new business coming from term plans.
So, why are analysts wary on HDFC Life and prefer to be bullish on SBI Life and even ICICI PruLife? Nomura Securities India Pvt. Ltd has a neutral rating on HDFC Life, while Deutsche Bank recommends hold. Both have a buy rating on SBI Life and ICICI PruLife.
According to analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, SBI Life has the muscle for distribution compared with others as it has exclusive access to parent State Bank of India’s (SBI’s) branches. It has also shown superior traction in its protection business and its persistency ratios outshine those of peers.
“(SBI’s) management is confident of growing protection faster than the overall annual premium equivalent. Persistency trends and surrender ratio of SBI Life remains favourable,"" noted analysts at Deutsche Bank.
However, a large part of analysts’ stock preferences within the life insurance space has to do with the valuations of the three companies. HDFC Life has run up 13% over the last two months and trades at a multiple of more than four times its embedded value for FY19.
Compare this to SBI Life’s multiple of about three times and ICICI PruLife at about two times, HDFC Life indeed looks richly valued."

—Srabanjit Guha
To reach your target of  ₹10 crore in 25 years (including the two years that have passed since you started investing), the main thing that needs to change is the amount of money you are investing. You are currently investing  ₹14,000 and plan to add another  ₹2,500. However to get to your target, assuming an aggressive 12% annual return over the 25-year period, you would need to invest close to  ₹60,000 a month. So the sooner you can add substantially to your monthly investments, the better. Else, you could adjust your goal lower. If, for example, you invest  ₹25,000 a month over this period, you would end up with close to  ₹5 crore. Or, you could simply invest the most you can by adding to your SIP every year, and adjust your goal as you go along—which might be the most practical thing to do.
Regarding funds, you are investing mostly in multi-cap funds (ELSS funds are diversified multi-cap funds in terms of market coverage), which is not a bad for a long-term portfolio. You have one small-cap fund, one large-cap fund, and a focused fund (which also, in a way, is a diversified fund). So, there’s nothing wrong per se with your portfolio. Please avoid investing in closed-end funds, and divert your surplus to your SIP portfolio.

279,2019-05-02,ICICI,"These funds offer the benefit of diversification, but consider the risks tooUse these funds for some tactical allocation when there is a strong case for a particular market to do well

If you were to sort all equity mutual funds available for retail investment by their one-year performance, international funds would come on top. The best performing funds in this category gave one-year returns of over 20%, as on 30 April. In comparison, exchange-traded funds and index funds that tracked the Sensex gave returns of less than 15% in the same period, while actively-managed equity funds fared badly with the top five large-cap funds giving an average return of around 9% and multi-cap funds faring marginally better at 10%. Should international funds then make it to your portfolio?
What are they?
International funds invest primarily in securities of foreign companies listed in foreign markets. But they differ on structure, the markets they invest in and the type of asset class they take exposure to.
There are international funds that invest directly in international stocks, and others that invest in international indices such as the Nasdaq or the S&P 500. There are some that act as feeder funds which invest in an identified mutual fund in the international market. Then there are fund of funds that invest in units of international funds.
“From an investor’s perspective, whether the fund creates its own portfolio, like the ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Fund (actively managed) or whether it is a feeder fund like the ICICI Prudential Global Stable Equity fund, which feeds into Nordea 1 – Global Stable Equity Fund Unhedged, an investor here gets the opportunity to achieve currency and geographical diversification,"" said Priyanka Khandelwal, fund manager at ICICI Prudential AMC. There is no particular cost advantage in either structure. However, a feeder fund that invests in an ETF is likely to have lower costs.
The geographies or markets in which they invest is another basis for categorization. Some funds that focus on a single economy, while some others invest across geographies.
Themes are another way to categorize an international fund. Some invest in emerging markets, while others in commodities and so on.
Pros and cons
The principal advantage international funds offer is that of diversification.
Different economies and markets do not move in tandem with each other. International funds provide an opportunity to invest in the economy that is performing well at a particular point in time. The good returns from the foreign market will support the overall return from your portfolio in periods when the primary market, in this case the Indian market, is not doing well.
These funds also offer the benefit from diversifying into a different currency. Rupee depreciation enhances the returns from investments made in foreign markets.
But there are drawbacks as well. First, you would be unfamiliar with the economy and the market in which the fund invests. Not all international funds have performed well in the past one year. Funds invested primarily in the US markets did well, while those invested in, say, the Brazilian or Hong Kong markets did poorly. Selection of the right opportunity is, thus, important, but you, as a retail investor, may have limited availability of information and the skill to determine whether the economic and political conditions of a foreign market are suitable for investment.
Second, the currency factor can affect your returns. One of the reasons for the good return performance of international funds in the last one year has been rupee depreciation. The one-year return from such funds has been bolstered by the over 5% depreciation in the rupee against the US dollar in the same period. That may not have been the case if the rupee appreciated instead.
The tax aspect is the third drawback. International funds are taxed as debt funds, unless they invest at least 65% of their portfolios in Indian equity instruments. When treated as debt funds, short-term capital gains are taxed at the investor’s marginal rate of tax and long-term capital gains on investments held for more than 36 months is taxed at 20% with indexation benefits.
What you should do
While the diversification argument is a compelling one, the risk-reduction benefit of a small allocation on the portfolio may be negligible. A larger allocation may not be advisable given the risks associated with an unfamiliar market and geopolitical and forex risks.
That leaves the case for returns. Use these funds for some tactical allocation that you can consider when there is a strong case for a particular economy or market to do well.
“Investors in India are underinvested in Indian equities itself. Investing in other markets is for investors who understand the associated risks well,"" said Gajendra Kothari, managing director, Etica Wealth Management Pvt. Ltd.
Kothari sees these funds as products that retail investors can consider for diversification benefits as well as to hedge any future dollar expense, say, funding an education abroad. Khandelwal agrees. “An average retail investor is less likely to have the opportunity to diversify into international markets. These funds are a good way to get stocks of global e-commerce leaders and other technology companies that are a part of our daily lives into their portfolios. On a sustainable basis, having an SIP in a US fund is better than investing a lump sum,"" she said.
Like with all equity investments, have an adequately long investment horizon when investing in these funds. Also, it’s best to have an adviser who is equipped to give the relevant information and advice."
278,2019-05-02,ICICI,"Top lenders like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and others offer FDs starting from 6 months up to above 5 yearsRemember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."

We believe that this will significantly drive new card acquisition,"" said Prasad. According to the latest Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, as on February 2019, HDFC Bank was the market leader in terms of the number of outstanding credit cards at 12.48 million.
SBI Card is over 4 million cards behind the private sector lender at 7.9 million outstanding credit cards in the same period. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have 6.4 million and 5.7 million cards, respectively. While HDFC Bank’s market share is at 27.1%, SBI Card has a market share of 17.3%.

267,2019-05-07,ICICI,"Credit rating downgrades of several NBFCs have shaken up the sector again, but instead of pushing for a clean-up, regulators are addressing only a liquidity squeeze. This won’t work

It is in the nature of India’s political economy and policy architecture to act only once confronted with a crisis. This was evident in 1991 when, pushed to the wall, the Indian government had to undertake large-scale economic reforms. A crisis has been brewing in the non-banking financial companies (NBFC) sector for a while, and the regulatory response seems to have been rather tepid so far. It almost seems like sector regulators are waiting for some catastrophe to occur before they muster their crisis-management skills. The long-drawn tragic story began with infrastructure lender IL&FS defaulting on its loans which, due to market linkages, also affected a larger number of banks, mutual funds and NBFCs. The financial system, already reeling under the burden of bad loans, gummed up completely. This was followed by a series of scandals at Yes Bank and ICICI Bank, the emergence of a crisis at housing and asset finance companies due to questionable lending practices, liquidity pressures and serious asset-liability mismatches, plus the shock revelation of a fiduciary breakdown in mutual funds which had lent large sums of investor money to dubious Indian industrialists against the tenuous security of their shares. Over the past few weeks, credit rating agencies have downgraded a large number of NBFCs, raising fresh questions over the sector’s health. Logically, all this should have prompted the regulator to come down hard on NBFCs and squeeze out risk from their books to prevent another contagion. In reality, the regulator is still in wait-and-watch mode.
So, is Reserve Bank of India (RBI) waiting for matters to reach a tipping point before calling in the cavalry? There is reason to be worried: Calculations by securities firm Credit Suisse show that  ₹1.3 trillion of repayments will be due for the NBFC sector this quarter. Some NBFCs have already defaulted and rating agencies have downgraded their debt paper to “Default"" grade. RBI has largely focused on repeated liquidity infusions to keep financial flows going. There is nothing wrong with that, except for the timing and the philosophy that undergirds such an action.
Ideally, the regulator should have continued with its liquidity injections in conjunction with a tightening of the system; this would have ensured that healthy NBFCs continue to finance asset creation efficiently without hitches while simultaneously mitigating risks emanating from the legion of misgoverned and corrupt NBFCs. The word “corrupt"" has been used advisedly here because it is well known how unscrupulous NBFCs indulged in round-tripping—in league with banks and other unprincipled NBFCs—to evergreen loans taken by wilful corporate defaulters. The central bank seems to be in denial, believing that the only solution is to keep systemic liquidity high. It is difficult to ignore the politics of RBI’s sustained obsession with currency sufficiency, especially since its use tends to spike during elections. Unfortunately, RBI is not the only negligent regulator here. The Securities and Exchange Board of India has also soft-pedalled the issue of mutual funds lending investor money against share pledges in gross violation of fiduciary propriety, and their defaulting on redemption payments. The bigger danger is that neither regulator seems to have its sights on retail investors, small savers or on broader financial sector stability. They seem driven by a larger political-economy agenda. This could turn out to be harmful for the economy in the long run."
268,2019-05-07,ICICI,"ICICI Bank shares decline after net profit fell 50% in the fourth quarterThe bank made sufficient provisions for classification of Jet Airways as NPA 

Mumbai: ICICI Bank shares opened at  ₹400.90 on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 0.5% down from its previous close after the private sector lender reported a 50% fall in net profit for the full financial year. At 12 pm the bank's shares were trading at  ₹399.80 on the BSE.
In a call with analysts on Tuesday, the management said Jet Airways was classified as non-performing asset (NPA) in the fourth quarter of 2018-19. However they clarified that the bank had made sufficient provisions against the same. In addition, the bank also classified the fund-based exposure of  ₹276 crore towards Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) as NPA and made a provision of  ₹146 crore against the same.
The management also said that it expects some slippages in the kisaan credit card portfolio, which forms 3% of the total loan book.
Brokerage firm Nomura expects overall slippage of  ₹29,000 crore over 2020-21, with credit cost improving to 90 basis points in the current financial year from 120 basis points last year.
Nomura expects the bank to improve its margins by 10 basis points for the current financial year. The management guided for an improvement in margins from 3.4% levels of FY19, but does not expect international margins to improve materially, given large NPA and no growth in the book, the brokerage firm in its report said.
Philip Capital for instance expects high credit growth, recovery of NPA and margin improvement to trigger earnings upgrade for the bank stock.
Brokerage firm Elara Capital expects strong loan growth of 18% year on year in the current financial year given that ICICI Bank has improved its retail asset and liability franchise significantly and with likely stabilisation in its overseas loan book. The brokerage firm also expects higher balance sheet growth could lead to reduction in CASA composition.
“We estimate gross slippages ratio at 220bp and credit cost at 170bp vs guidance of 120-130bp. We arrive at a Return on Assets (ROA) of 98bp & 127bp in FY20 & FY21, respectively,"" Elara Capital said in its report."

271,2019-05-07,ICICI,"The bank’s provision coverage ratio increased to 70.6% at the end of March quarterOn a quarterly basis, net profit in the fiscal fourth quarter fell 5% year-on-year to  ₹969 crore

ICICI Bank Ltd posted a 50% decline in net profit for fiscal year 2018-19 at  ₹3,363.30 crore because of higher expenses and provisions. Operating profit however grew 17% to  ₹22,072 crore, suggesting an improvement in core operational performance at the private sector lender.
On a quarterly basis, net profit in the fiscal fourth quarter fell 5% year-on-year to  ₹969 crore, widely trailing estimates of  ₹2,292.1 crore in a Bloomberg poll of 23 analysts.
The bank’s provision coverage ratio, which is a measure of the funds set aside to cover bad loans, increased to 70.6% at the end of the March quarter from 47.7% in the same period last year.
The bank therefore saw improved asset quality on account of higher provisions. Net non-performing assets (NPAs) as a percentage of total assets fell to 2.06% as on 31 March from 4.77% in the previous year.
Gross NPAs as a percentage of total assets excluding provisions improved to 6.7% from 8.84% a year earlier and 7.75% in the third quarter.
Fresh additions to bad loans stood at  ₹3,547 crore, which includes  ₹850 crore of exposure to an account in the sugar sector. The bank wrote off nearly  ₹7,300 crore of bad loans in the quarter, taking the total amount of write-offs to  ₹11,000 crore.
The management expects the situation on provisions and slippages to improve in FY20.
“The run-rate for slippages for FY19 itself has come down substantially from  ₹11,000 crore of additions compared to  ₹29,000 crore in FY18. Since slippages have reduced, loan-loss provisions should also reduce going ahead. We are at the end of the asset quality cycle,"" said Sandeep Batra, executive director, ICICI Bank.
On the operational side, the bank improved its margins to 3.72% at the end of March 2019 from 3.24% in the same period last year. Higher margins were on account of a one-time income tax refund of  ₹414 crore in the fourth quarter.
The total loan book grew 14.5% with retail loans growing at 21.7% and corporate loans at 5.7%.
The management of ICICI Bank expects to achieve a return on equity (RoE) of 15% by June 2020, improving from the current RoE of 3.2%.
Another reason for the sharp fall in net profit was higher expenses which stood at  ₹14,680 crore at the end of March 2019 compared to  ₹12,428.99 crore during the same period last year.
The management expects credit costs to normalize from the current level of 3.5%.
“In 4QFY19, ICICI Bank witnessed further improvement in balance sheet outcomes (loan growth and asset quality), adjusted for a special situation account in the sugar sector. While the NPA ratios are beginning to trend lower, suggesting that the impairment cycle is at its tail-end, loan loss provisioning continues to be elevated, largely on account of ageing provisions,"" said A.S.V. Krishnan, analyst at SBICap Securities.
ICICI Bank lost 0.11% to close at  ₹401.40 per share on Monday on the BSE, while the benchmark index, Sensex, lost 0.93% to close at 38,600.34 points. The Banking Index, Bankex, lost 0.98% to close at 33,117.33 points."
272,2019-05-07,ICICI,"Given the poor legacy, valuations are low. The stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-book of 1.97 timesThe bank’s provision coverage ratio increased to 70.6% as of 30 March, 2019 from 47.7% during same period last year

ICICI Bank Ltd’s shares have steadied around the  ₹400 mark in recent months. Investors seem to be assuming major skeletons are already out of the bag. On the other hand, it’s still early days to expect any fireworks.
So, it shouldn’t be very surprising that the bank’s March quarter earnings were largely in line with expectations. The bank’s asset quality improved. Net non-performing assets fell from 2.58% in the December quarter to 2.06% in Q4.
Secondly, loan growth at 17% was at a multi-quarter high, thanks to growth in retail loans. Further, net interest margins (NIMs) improved to 3.72% from 3.4% in the previous quarter. In a post-earnings conference call, the bank’s management clarified that NIMs were aided by an income-tax refund of around  ₹400 crore. Adjusted for it, NIMs would have been around 3.52%, which is still a positive, say analysts.
On the other hand, net profit at  ₹969.06 core, down 5% year-on-year, was lower than Bloomberg analysts’ consensus estimates, as profit was impacted by higher expenses and lower treasury income. But a more important measure to track is the trend in slippages and provisions.
Gross slippages in the March quarter stood at  ₹3,547 crore. Of this,  ₹850 crore was on the back of an account in the sugar sector and  ₹1,900 crore from double-BB and below-rated accounts, said the management. Further, the bank’s provision coverage ratio increased to 70.6% as of 31 March 2019, from 47.7% during same period last year.
The ICICI Bank management is hopeful that the situation on the slippages and provisions front would improve further. “The run-rate for slippages for FY19 itself has come down substantially to  ₹11,000 crore of additions compared to  ₹29,000 crore in FY18. Since slippages have reduced, loan-loss provisions should also reduce going ahead. We are at the end of asset quality cycle,"" it said.
So far this year, the ICICI Bank stock has risen 12%, slightly higher than the 9% gain in the Nifty Bank index. From its 52-week low of  ₹256.50 in July last year, the stock has risen about 57%. But given the poor legacy, valuations are understandably low. The stock is trading at a one-year forward price-to-book of 1.97 times. This is lower than competitors HDFC Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd, which are trading at 3.28 times and 2.52 times, respectively."

266,2019-05-08,ICICI,"Indian shadow banks lent heavily to the property industry in recent years, helping to fuel a construction boomThey now face rising risks that weaker developers may struggle to repay those borrowings, as housing sales have failed to keep pace with debt expansion

Mumbai: The next flash point in India’s credit markets could be real-estate debt.
That’s the view of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co., a major corporate bond buyer and one of India’s top life insurers. The firm avoided investing in debt of stressed companies before credit market strains spread last year.
That crisis was triggered by shock defaults by major infrastructure financier IL&FS Group, and its fallout pushed up financing costs for a range of borrowers including wealthy property tycoons struggling to roll over debt. The country hardly needs more stresses now just as credit markets regain some normalcy after policy makers took steps to inject more liquidity into the financial system.
“While most of the credit market is healthy, one needs to be cautious on NBFCs having large exposure to the real-estate sector,"" said Chief Investment Officer Manish Kumar, who oversees 1.1 trillion rupees ($15.8 billion) at ICICI Prudential Life. Pressure may rise at non-bank firms, raising the need for lenders to liquidate assets or for stronger developers to buy up projects, he said.
Indian shadow banks lent heavily to the property industry in recent years, helping to fuel a construction boom. They now face rising risks that weaker developers may struggle to repay those borrowings, as housing sales have failed to keep pace with debt expansion. Teetering economic activity also isn’t helping.
Earlier this year, troubles for mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. were among factors that pushed up financing costs.
An analysis of about 11,000 home builders by research firm Liases Foras in February showed that developers on average have to repay twice as much in debt each year as the income they generate that can be used to service it. Property prices in India’s biggest cities have been flagging -- home values in Mumbai sank 11 percent last year.
That all means property debt investors need to be extra cautious, but there are still pockets of opportunity, according to ICICI Prudential. The firm has raised corporate bond holdings to 33 percent from 31 percent since the IL&FS crisis, mainly by increasing investments in notes issued by top-rated housing finance firms and bonds that will be serviced by the government.

Mumbai: The Registrar of Companies (RoC), the wing of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, which is examining the books of accounts of Jet Airways Ltd, has found instances of Companies Act violation and some unexplained fund trail, a government official said.
""The RoC preliminary inspection in the books of Jet Airways was completed earlier this week and the report was submitted to the MCA on 8 May,"" he said.
""The MCA will have to take a call on whether it is satisfied with the findings for further course of action. If the findings are serious and indicates fund diversion, the report may be referred to the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) for a probe of fraud allegations,"" he added.
Mint could not immediately reach Jet Airways for a comment.
The RoC’s inspection of a company’s books is similar to a preliminary fact-finding exercise and will lay the ground for further action.
The RoC investigation was initiated last August after the company deferred its first-quarter FY19 results the same month. The RoC investigation followed a complaint by Arvind Gupta. Gupta was also the chief complainant in the ICICI-Videocon case.
In the complaint, Gupta alleged that promoters were trying to siphon off  ₹5,125 crore from the books of the struggling airline. He added that the audit committee was unable to prevent the fund diversion.
Jet Airways and JetLite brands undertook transactions with companies owned by promoters in the guise of selling and distribution, Gupta alleged.
The income-tax department, in a report in February, had already found tax evasion of over  ₹600 crore at Jet Airways.
""There were some transactions concerning a Dubai-based entity, which were found to be of a suspicious nature,"" an income tax official said on the condition of anonymity. “Commissions were paid to this Dubai-based company, which were excessive in nature."""

MUMBAI :
The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Friday reserved its order on the  ₹4,350-crore offer by Patanjali to take over the crippled edible oil firm Ruchi Soya and again sought clarity on  ₹600-crore of part-funding committed as internal accruals for the acquisition.
This is the second time that the tribunal has sought details of  ₹600 crore, and asked them to file written submission on the same.
The counsel for the Haridwar-headquartered Patanjali reiterated that  ₹600 crore of the  ₹4,350-crore fund will be met through internal accruals and offered to submit a written submission on the same.
The committee of creditors said Patanjali has already paid  ₹200 crore as guarantee.
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank moved the tribunal to secure  ₹65 crore dues from Ruchi Soya.
NCLT had earlier directed ICICI Bank to reverse the transactions carried out on Ruchi Soya to retrieve around  ₹48 crore and  ₹65 crore with interest, that the bank had paid towards a letter of credit from latter's current account.
Following this, ICICI Bank approached National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, who said the private lender cannot be forced to pay the amount.
To which, the lenders said since ICICI Bank will not pay the amount, their cut in the overall recovery amount will also be lower.
The ICICI Bank counsel said in case NCLAT reverses its order later, the lender will not only have to pay but also to take a lower haircut from the total recovery.
An NCLT bench of judges VP Singh and Ravikumar Duraisamy asked them to file a written submissions in this regard saying as ICICI Bank is also a financial creditor they will consider their application.
In December 2017, NCLT had referred Ruchi Soya for insolvency on applications moved by Standard Chartered Bank and DBS Bank and appointed Shailendra Ajmera as the RP.
Patanjali, the lone player left, had last month increased its bid value by around  ₹140 crore to  ₹4,350 crore. The offer excludes capital infusion of  ₹1,700 crore.
Ruchi Soya owes over  ₹9,345 crore to financial creditors led by the State Bank, which has an exposure of  ₹1,800 crore, followed by Central Bank at  ₹816 crore, Punjab National Bank at  ₹743 crore and StanChart at  ₹608 crore.

261,2019-05-13,ICICI,"ICICI Bank has already claimed dues in proceedings against EIIL’s parent Era Infra Engineering, says tribunalNCLT dismissed a petition by ICICI Bank to begin insolvency case against Era Infra India

MUMBAI :
The principal bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in New Delhi has dismissed a petition by ICICI Bank to begin insolvency proceedings against Era Infrastructure India Ltd (EIIL), on the grounds that the bank was already claiming its dues in insolvency proceedings against EIIL’s parent and corporate guarantor Era Infra Engineering Pvt. Ltd.
“Therefore, on account of duplicacy of the claims, the petition cannot be entertained,"" the order dated 7 May said.
Parent Era Infra is one of the 12 bad loan accounts that Reserve Bank of India had directed for reference under Insolvency and Banking Code (IBC). Proceedings started last year, with Rajiv Chakraborty as interim resolution professional. Chakraborty had rejected ICICI Bank’s claims as a financial creditor, but his decision was overturned by the NCLT in December.
Referring to a January judgement by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in Vishnu Kumar Agarwal vs Piramal Enterprises, the tribunal said that once a claim application is admitted against one of the debtors (principal borrower or corporate guarantor), second application by the same financial creditor for the same set of claims and default cannot be admitted against the other.
An email sent to ICICI Bank remained unanswered till press time.
An insolvency professional who declined to be named said this judgement could become the basis for admitting claim disputes for large companies where loans to subsidiaries are based on corporate guarantees by the parent. “At present, many banks are filing claims on both the subsidiary and the parent company on the same loan and this order could help lenders,"" the insolvency professional said. It would help lenders who aren’t aware they can file only for one of the companies, either borrower or the guarantor for the same loan.
The NCLT order said ICICI Bank had lent  ₹200 crore to Era Infrastructure India in 2011. Loans were also given to parent Era Infra Engineering’s related companies including Hyderabad Ring Road Project Pvt. Ltd, Apex Buildsys Ltd, Dehradun Highways Project Ltd, Gwalior Bypass Project Ltd.
According to the order, for these loans, Era Infra had furnished various securities to ICICI Bank.
ICICI Bank and Era Infra also entered into a loan purchase agreement on 5 March 2011 wherein the parent company guaranteed that it would purchase the entire outstanding amount of EIIL if it defaults.
Additionally, ICICI Bank, the parent company and IDBI Trusteeship Service Ltd (EIIL Security Trustee) entered into a non-disposal arrangement on 16 June 2011. According to the terms of the agreement, the parent company will not deal with or divest 30% equity share capital of EIIL held by it, and deposit those shares in a designated trust and retention account. After EIIL started defaulting on the loan, a joint lenders’ forum (JLF) was formed on 30 April 2014 comprising ICICI Bank and Yes Bank to restructure the loans. However, the parent company deposited 12.7% of the equity shares, instead of 30% and also failed to buy back the loans as promised earlier, following which ICICI Bank recalled its loan.
Meanwhile, the NCLAT had in a separate order in January said that it was not necessary to initiate a corporate insolvency resolution process against the principal borrower, before initiating it against corporate guarantors.
The appellate authority said this in a case between the Rural Electrification Corp. and Ferro Alloys Corp.

NEW DELHI :
Former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar were questioned Monday for over eight hours by the Enforcement Directorate after they appeared before it in connection with an alleged bank loan fraud and money laundering case registered against them.
The couple arrived at the Enforcement Directorate's headquarters in Khan Market here shortly before their scheduled appearance time of 11 am, official sources said.
They were allowed to leave just before 8 pm, they said.
While it was not immediately known as to what was the ED's line of questioning, sources said that the two were required to assist the investigating officer (IO) of the case in taking the probe forward.Sources said their statement was recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
It is expected that the two may be questioned again on Tuesday.
The Kochhars were supposed to depose before the agency early this month but they had then sought an extension of time and were allowed, they said.
Chanda Kochhar's brother-in-law and Deepak's brother, Rajiv Kochhar, has also been grilled by the ED multiple times in the case a few days ago here. Rajiv Kochhar has been questioned by the CBI in the same case in the past as well.
He is the founder of Singapore-based Avista Advisory and was questioned about his company's role in the restructuring of the loan by the CBI, the sources said.
Rajiv Kochhar was asked by the CBI sleuths about the help he had extended to Videocon in relation to the loan from ICICI Bank, which was part of a  ₹400-billion credit given by a consortium of 20 banks to the group of main promoter, Venugopal Dhoot.
The Kochhar couple have been questioned in the past too at the ED zonal office in Mumbai after the central agency conducted raids in this case on March 1.
The searches were conducted at the premises of Chanda Kochhar, her family and Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon Group in Maharashtra's Mumbai and Aurangabad.
The ED has registered a criminal case under the PMLA early this year against Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, Dhoot and others to probe alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning  ₹1,875-crore loans by ICICI Bank to the corporate group.

It has slapped sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal conspiracy, cheating and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act on all the accused.
The CBI alleged that Dhoot had invested in Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy in a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on May 1, 2009.
The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI alleged.During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth  ₹1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June, 2009 and October, 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank, which have now become part of the probe.

NEW DELHI :
Former ICICI Bank Ltd boss Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar appeared before the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday to record their statements yet again, as the case against the suspects in the  ₹40,000 crore alleged bank loan fraud dragged on for the fourth month.
The ED has repeatedly summoned Chanda and Deepak Kochhar since registering a case on 2 February, while the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) had filed its own case against the Kochhars and Videocon managing director Venugopal Dhoot in January.
A person familiar with the development, however, said that the agencies were probing the “extent of involvement of all parties"". Only after establishing this will the next step in the matter be taken.
The Enforcement Directorate has been probing the matter since February, after registering a case against Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot. The homes of both men was searched by the probe agency in February.
The CBI had registered a preliminary enquiry against Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot in March 2018 to investigate irregularities in the  ₹40,000 crore loan made by a consortium of lenders to the Videocon group. It also pointed to an alleged conflict of interest in a  ₹3,250 crore loan made to the Videocon group by ICICI Bank.
In January 2019, the CBI the booked the Kochhars and Dhoot for criminal conspiracy and cheating.
Allegations against Chanda Kochhar referred to “criminal conspiracy to cheat ICICI Bank dishonestly by abusing her official position"" and receiving “illegal gratification and undue benefit through her husband.""
The ICICI Bank loan to the Videocon group was part of a ₹40,000 crore loan by a consortium of 20 banks in 2012, and was in contravention of “the Banking Regulation Act, Reserve Bank of India guidelines and credit policy of the bank"".
As part of a suspected quid pro quo arrangement, Dhoot is alleged to have given  ₹64 crore in 2010 through a fully owned entity to NuPower Renewables Pvt. Ltd that he had set up with Deepak Kochhar and two of his relatives. It was alleged that Dhoot transferred proprietorship of the company to a trust owned by Deepak Kochhar for  ₹9 lakh, six months after receiving the loan from ICICI Bank—an allegation that Kochhar has denied to Mint.

256,2019-05-15,ICICI,"An SBI report said it is penciling a larger rate cut (in excess of 25 bps) by RBI in the forthcoming policyRBI is slated to announce its next bi-monthly policy decision on June 6

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) needs to go for a larger rate cut, of more than 25 basis points, in its June monetary policy review to reverse the current economic slowdown, said an SBI research report.
The RBI had cut the key short-term lending rate (repo) by 25 basis points each in its last two policy reviews. The central bank is slated to announce its next bi-monthly policy decision on June 6.
""Are we currently facing a quasi growth slowdown? The apparent nervousness is clearly reflected in the trends exhibited in key stock indices,"" said the SBI's research report 'Ecowrap'.
As per a report published by ICICI Bank, there is room for the MPC to cut rates (underscored by the growing slack indicated in the diffusion index output gap), in the August policy.
""However, the action would be highly dependent on realised outcomes of monsoons (current forecasts indicate a near-normal monsoons) impacting food prices and trajectory of oil prices. We also think that we are moving towards the last leg of accommodation with both domestic and global growth poised for slight recovery towards the end of the calendar year and our own CPI headline inflation projections averaging 50-60 bps higher than MPC's,"" it said.
ICICI Bank's Research Diffusion Index indicates a slowdown in industrial activity in Q4 FY2019; while services activity is showing mixed results.
Moreover, global indicators of languishing global trade and rising commodity prices are unfavourable, along with sluggishness in rural activity, it said.
""Based on these indicators we expect GDP growth in Q4 FY2019 at ~6.2-6.3 per cent and improve slightly to 6.5 per cent in Q1 FY2020,"" it said.
SBI Report said that the initial trends in fourth quarter of 2018-19 exhibit overall decline in sectors such as telecom equipment and infra services; agro chemicals; petrochemicals; infrastructure developers and castings.
Also, pharmaceutical companies dependent on exports are likely to report poor growth numbers. In January-March 2018-19 quarter, of 384 companies more than 330 companies exhibited negative growth in mid-line and bottomline.
Perhaps, significantly depressed rural prices is disturbing rural income and weak demand is affecting the FMCG sector, the report said.
Overall, the report said: ""We still believe the current slowdown could still be transitory, if proper policies are adopted in interregnum. For example, the high real interest rates are severely acting as a impediment to investment.""
To this end, ""We are thus penciling a larger rate cut (in excess of 25 bps) by RBI in the forthcoming policy"".
However, such larger rate cuts will still not help fully but transmission will, said the Ecowrap.
The RBI should now ensure that asset and liability side of banks move in tandem and ensure repo rate is directly benchmarked to non-volatile bank liabilities/Current Account Savings Account (CASA) that are mostly used for transaction purposes. Otherwise, we would continue to be constrained by lack of transmission, it added.

258,2019-05-15,ICICI,"Vodafone Idea and Airtel recently introduced ‘service validity vouchers’, which required customers to make minimum recharges to continue using their networksThe move helped both operators weed out low-value subscribers, while increasing revenues

MUMBAI :
In light of the ruthless land grab that followed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry into India’s telecom industry, the last thing one would have expected is for telcos to say no to some subscribers. But this is exactly what incumbents Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have done in recent months.
They introduced so-called “service validity vouchers"", which required customers to make minimum recharges to continue using their networks.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, this resulted in a decline of 53.2 million subscribers or about 14% in the March quarter.
As it turns out, this was a smart move. With low-value subscribers getting weeded out, total revenues increased. Vodafone Idea’s average daily revenues for the quarter increased 2.3% sequentially.
In light of the ruthless land grab that followed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry into India’s telecom industry, the last thing one would have expected is for telcos to say no to some subscribers. But this is exactly what incumbents Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have done in recent months.
They introduced so-called “service validity vouchers"", which required customers to make minimum recharges to continue using their networks.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, this resulted in a decline of 53.2 million subscribers or about 14% in the March quarter.
As it turns out, this was a smart move. With low-value subscribers getting weeded out, total revenues increased. Vodafone Idea’s average daily revenues for the quarter increased 2.3% sequentially.
Bharti Airtel had earlier reported a 6.7% sequential jump in average daily revenues. While the company, too, got rid of low-value subscribers, its subscriber base did not fall at the same pace as Vodafone Idea’s.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, synergy benefits from last year’s merger are beginning to accrue at a faster pace, leading to higher-than-expected profits as well.
The company reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) of  ₹1,590 crore in the March quarter, after adjusting for one-offs. This was as much as 39.4% higher than the December quarter profit of  ₹1,140 crore.
While the increase in profitability is heartening, it clearly is far from being enough. The company’s net interest cost stood at  ₹2,789 crore last quarter, about 75% higher than current Ebitda levels.
Also note that Vodafone Idea has already achieved 60% of its synergy target. All else remaining the same, its quarterly Ebitda will rise to about  ₹2,420 crore when 100% of the synergies kick in. That is still short of its quarterly finance costs.
Note also that Vodafone Idea’s total number of broadband sites fell sequentially by about 4,900 sites, which is unusual given the backdrop of increasing coverage by competitors Jio and Airtel.
While Vodafone Idea has successfully raised  ₹25,000 crore through a rights issue, it still doesn’t have the financial flexibility to raise capex to the levels of its rivals.
“The company’s survival hinges on market repair and pricing uptick which is yet to be seen, analysts at ICICIdirect.com said in a post-results note to clients.
But there are no signs of price hikes, especially since Jio is still a distance away from its targeted revenue market share. While strategies such as “less is more"" may have resulted in some short-term dividend, the need of the hour clearly is more pricing power and higher growth in quality subscribers.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures."
254,2019-05-20,ICICI,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India."

Mumbai: The predicted victory of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) in the Lok Sabha elections drove stocks of 40 companies to record highs on Monday. This included blue-chips, mid-caps, small-caps and penny stocks.
Some of the blue-chip stocks that hit all-time highs were Bajaj Finance Ltd (up 3.2%), DCB Bank Ltd, Federal Bank Ltd and HDFC Bank Ltd (both 3%), ICICI Bank Ltd (4.5%), Titan Co. Ltd (3.4%) and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd (2.8%).
Among large-caps, Adani Enterprises Ltd jumped 27%, with the forecast of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s win and the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Morrison’s re-election is seen as a positive for the Adani group’s mining operations in Australia, as he is widely expected to ease restrictions on its mega coal mines in Queensland, facing protests over concerns of environmental impact.
“Adani group shares rallied on exit polls’ prediction that Narendra Modi-led BJP would come back to power. The rally was further fuelled by Australian poll results, which too augurs well for the business interests of Adani group,"" an analyst said on condition of anonymity. “We expect the positive momentum to continue in the coming trading session in view of the positive political development.""
Other Adani group stocks rose as well: Adani Green Energy was up 14.97%, Adani Gas Ltd gained 12.54%, Adani Power Ltd advanced by 15.27%, Adani Transmission Ltd by 8.98% and Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd by 9.10%.

I am 26 and will start earning about  ₹60,000 a month from June. I plan to invest at least  ₹20,000 every month in mutual funds. I have already invested  ₹1.1 lakh in SBI Bluechip Growth Fund and recently started systematic investment plans (SIPs) in L&T Midcap and Tata India Tax Saving Fund. All the SIPs are for  ₹1,000 a month. Should I continue with these? Should I increase the SIP amounts?
—Monil Shah
At present, you are investing  ₹2,000 every month in two funds, and  ₹12,000 a year in a tax-saving fund, which I presume is for you to take advantage of your 80C deduction. Ensure that this is adequate for the deduction requirement.
For the remaining amount, you can create a good, well-diversified portfolio of funds for the long term. A portfolio that has equal distributions to ICICI Prudential Nifty Next 50 fund, Mirae Asset India Equity fund, Franklin India Equity fund, and Parag Parikh Long term equity would be a good, aggressive long-term portfolio. Considering your age, and penchant for investing, such a portfolio will yield healthy returns over the long term.
I am 22 and invest  ₹500 each in SBI Small Cap, Reliance Small Cap, Mirae Asset Emerging Bluechip, L&T Mid Cap and SBI Bluechip. I also invested a lump sum of  ₹5,000 in Mirae Asset India Equity. I have an investment horizon of 25-30 years and I intend to increase my investments periodically. Will I be able to accumulate a corpus of  ₹4-5 crore.
—Harshvardhan Saraf
If we take your goal to be  ₹4 crore in 30 years, you would need to invest around  ₹13,000 (at 12% long-term portfolio return) every month to get there. So, as you indicate, you would definitely need to increase your SIP contribution over time. Right now you are investing  ₹3,000 a month, and if you increase it every year and bring it up to  ₹15,000 in 4-5 years, you would be able to reach your target. Your SIP portfolio has a small- and mid-cap flavour to it, which in itself is not a bad thing for a young person who is starting to invest. But keep in mind that equity returns don’t happen in a smooth upward curve and that there would be a lot of volatility on the way.

Indian markets edged higher today, a day ahead of counting of votes in the general election, in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to retain power. Exit polls that came out on Sunday after the seven-phase Lok Sabha elections ended showed Modi is set for a clear win. Markets have been on a bull run with both the NSE Nifty and the BSE Sensex gaining 6% in three sessions to Monday.
The Sensex closed 140 points higher 39,110 while Nifty settled at 11,737, up 0.25%. Financials led the markets higher, with ICICI Bank, IndusInd Bank and HDFC among top gainers.

Tech Mahindra shares fell 3% after March-quarter profit dropped 7.4% and missed estimates. Shares of DHFL, one of India's biggest home loan lenders, fell 9%, after it stopped taking new deposits and blocked premature withdrawals following a credit rating downgrade.
However, analysts predict that the markets will quickly discount the election results. ""Going forward in the medium term...we expect the markets to consolidate post the election outcome as focus would shift back to fundamentals and global cues which have been volatile due to re-escalation of US-China trade tensions,"" said Jayant Manglik, president - retail distribution at Religare Broking.
Technically, the underlying trend remains up, says Sahaj Agrawal, head of research for derivatives at Kotak Securities. ""We remain structurally positive on the markets and expect the markets to trade with a positive bias post elections.

New Delhi: Infrastructure major Larsen and Toubro (L&T) has raised its stake in IT firm Mindtree by about 2 per cent between May 20-24 by picking up shares worth over  ₹316 crore, according to regulatory data.
The development assumes significance as L&T has already acquired around 20 per cent stake in the mid-sized IT firm from V G Siddhartha and Cafe Coffee Day and is keen to increase its shareholding up to 66 per cent.
According to BSE data, L&T acquired shares from the open market throughout the week with the highest quantum of shares being purchased on May 24 when it picked up nearly 25 lakh shares of Mindtree at  ₹980 a piece.
A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the company spent over  ₹316 crore during the week for these transactions which took its overall shareholding to 28.45 per cent from 26.48 per cent at the start of the week.
In multiple tranches, L&T mopped up about 32.25 lakh shares during the said week. Shares of Mindtree ended flat at  ₹980 apiece on the BSE on Friday.
In March, L&T mounted a hostile takeover bid on Mindtree when it entered into a deal to buy Cafe Coffee Day owner V G Siddhartha's 20.32 per cent stake in Mindtree and also placed an order with brokers to pick up another 15 per cent of the company shares from the open market.
Subsequent to these deals, L&T was to also make an open offer to buy additional stake. In all, the infrastructure major is eyeing up to 66 per cent stake in Mindtree for around  ₹10,800 crore.
L&T's open offer - which was earlier slated to begin on May 14 - has been postponed as the engineering major is awaiting a nod from the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
In a recent interview to PTI, L&T Group Chairman A M Naik had said the acquisition of Mindtree is the topmost agenda for the company at the moment.
""Right now, our mind is completely occupied on Mindtree and I hope, we will be able to eventually make this into a big company as well...We have got around 26 per cent stake in Mindtree and now, we will wait till we get 51 per cent,"" he had said adding that the offer would be launched in a fortnight's time.

Life insurance is not about investing your money to earn a return on it, it’s about financial protection for your loved ones. The most efficient way to do that is through a term insurance policy.

242,2019-06-04,ICICI,"Fitch downgraded the long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to BB+ from BBB- for both banksThe one-notch downgrade of ICICI Bank, Fitch said, reflects its assessment of India’s operating environment

Mumbai: Fitch has downgraded the credit ratings of two private sector lenders— ICICI Bank and Axis Bank—to junk at a time when the banking sector is struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalization.
Reacting to the development, ICICI Bank lost 1.6% in intraday trading on Tuesday, ending the day lower by 0.92% at  ₹418.95 on the BSE. Axis Bank, on the other hand, lost 0.8% on an intraday basis but ended the day gaining 1.12% to close at  ₹821.40. The benchmark Sensex lost 0.46% to close at 40,083.54 points.
Fitch downgraded the long-term issuer default rating (IDR) to BB+ from BBB- for both banks. These downgrades follow Fitch lowering its midpoint for India’s operating environment to BB+ from BBB- after a review of the banking sector’s performance in the last three years, its regulatory framework, and the outlook in the near term.
An analyst who declined to be named said the rating downgrades, which cited a difficult operating environment in India, are strange because other banks operating in the same environment have not been downgraded.
Fitch said it “compared the operating environment in India, using key metrics such as gross domestic product per capita and the ease-of-doing-business ranking, with those of other sovereigns in Asia rated in the BBB category"".
The rating agency expects the performance of India’s banking sector to be below average over the next one to two years despite faster growth and improved business prospects. Banks in India can take advantage of this only if their damaged balance sheets recover sustainably with the infusion of fresh equity that encourage them to support credit growth, said Fitch.
The one-notch downgrade of ICICI Bank, Fitch said, reflects its assessment of India’s operating environment and its belief that several of ICICI Bank’s key financial indicators are generally weaker than those of banks rated higher by Fitch. It said the downgrade of Axis Bank’s viability rating reflects its relatively weak core capitalization and asset quality, which, despite some improvements in the near term, are not commensurate with Fitch’s expectations of higher rated entities.
Fitch believes the performance of Indian banks has largely bottomed out, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalization. It said Indian banks’ impaired loan ratio fell to 10.8% at end-December 2018 from 11.5% on 31 March 2018, which continues to be high by global standards.
“Capital buffers are still assessed by Fitch as moderate, including for private-sector banks, especially in light of their high impaired loan ratios, high risk appetite and the challenging but competitive operating environment,"" it said.
Bad debts seem to have eased for public sector banks and also somewhat for private lenders in FY19. Mint reported on 4 June that aggregate bad loans of state-run banks declined 12% to  ₹7.17 trillion in the year ended 31 March.
For private sector banks, the reduction in gross bad loans was 1.3% during the same period."

New Delhi: Global ratings agency Fitch said Monday it has downgraded two leading private sector lenders ICICI Bank and Axis Bank as the banking sector of the country remains under stress.
Fitch said it took the rating action after lowering its midpoint for India's operating environment to 'bb ' from 'bbb-' following a review of the banking sector's performance, particularly in the last three years, the regulatory framework for the sector, and the outlook in the near term.
The performance of India's banking sector is expected to be below-average over the next one to two years despite high growth prospects, it said.
""Fitch Ratings has downgraded ICICI Bank Limited's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'BB ' from 'BBB-' and its Viability Rating to 'bb ' from 'bbb-'. The Outlook on the IDR is Stable,"" it said.
The rating action comes amid the challenges the bank faces in its operating environment, Fitch Ratings said in a statement.
The rating agency has also affirmed ICICI's Support Rating at '3' and Support Rating Floor at 'BB '. BB rating indicates speculative grade while BBB points at good credit quality.
Fitch also downgraded the Long-Term IDR and Viability Rating of Axis Bank to 'BB ' and 'bb ', respectively, from 'BBB-' and 'bbb-'.
""We expect the performance of India's banking sector to be below average over the next one to two years despite our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects,"" it said.
Banks in India - which remain the biggest credit intermediaries in the country - are positioned to take advantage of this opportunity, provided their damaged balance sheets recover sustainably with the infusion of fresh equity that encourage them to support credit growth in a meaningful way, it added.
It also concluded the sector will perform below the average of its peers over the next one to two years in spite of our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects in India.
The performance of Indian banks should have largely bottomed out, but the sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalisation, it said.
""We estimate that Indian banks' impaired-loan ratio declined to an average of 10.8 per cent by 9 months of 2019-20 from 11.5 per cent in the financial year ended March 2018 (FY18), which continues to be high by global standards,"" it said.
Capital buffers are assessed by Fitch as moderate, including for private-sector banks, especially in light of their high impaired-loan ratio, risk appetite and the challenging but competitive operating environment, it said.
Fitch further said ICICI Bank's core capitalisation is higher than that of most other Indian banks but within the current operating environment poses only a moderate buffer against risks.
That said, Fitch believes the bank has some capital fungibility through the sale of stakes in profitable subsidiaries and the repatriation of excess capital from foreign subsidiaries.
Its impaired-loan ratio is weaker than that of other large private banks and most banks with Viability Ratings in the 'bb' category, even though the measure has improved slightly to 7.5 per cent in 2019-20 from 10 per cent in the previous fiscal, it added.

Two major Indian lenders slumped in the bond market after their credit ratings were cut to junk by Fitch Ratings, in the latest sign of concerns about the nation’s banks that are battling the world’s worst bad-loan ratio.
Fitch lowered its long-term issuer default ratings on ICICI Bank Ltd. and Axis Bank Ltd. to BB+ from BBB- late on Monday. Certain dollar bonds from ICICI slumped the most in more than a year, while ones from Axis Bank fell the most in over six months on Tuesday.
“We expect the performance of India’s banking sector to be below average over the next one to two years despite our expectations of high economic growth and improving business prospects,"" Fitch said in a statement Monday. “The sector is still struggling with poor asset quality and weak core capitalization.""
What happened
ICICI Bank’s 3.25% notes due 2022 fell 0.5 cent, the most in over a year, to 99.7 cents on the dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Axis Bank’s 3.25% due 2020 dropped 0.2 cent, the most in over six months, to 100. Fitch said that the performance of Indian banks has largely bottomed out but the sector is still addressing poor asset quality and weak core capitalization. The rating company said that ICICI’s key financial indicators are generally weaker than those of banks rated higher. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank have investment-grade ratings from other credit assessors.
Analysis
Nomura sees Fitch’s move as “harsh and backward-looking"" as the rating’s company has cut the scores at a time when both these banks have reported a decline in gross non-performing assets in their FY19 financial results. “We agree that the operating environment for Indian banks will remain challenging, notwithstanding the recent positive election outcome which saw PM Narendra Modi return to power with an increased majority, which along with relatively rich valuations, is why we continue to advocate an Underweight positioning in Indian banks’ seniors,"" Nomura desk analyst Nicholas Yap says in a note. A $190 billion pile of stressed debt along with eroding capital buffers is constraining lenders ability to navigate the “challenging but competitive operating environment,"" Fitch said.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk or simply don’t have the wherewithal to invest in other asset classes like mutual funds. In a sense, FDs are simple comfort food on a menu comprising investment products with complicate recipes.
But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be a great idea as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years and want to park your savings in a safe investment avenue, an FD can help.
Remember that interest earned from FDs gets added to your total income and is accordingly taxed at your slab rate. Usually, banks you already have a relationship with allow you to open an FD through your netbanking account.
But how do you pick the right FD? FD rates vary across banks, tenure and the amount you need to invest. You should compare the interest rates on offer before investing your money. Here is a list of some of the popular banks and the rates they currently offer for deposits up to Rs1 crore over various tenures.

241,2019-06-06,ICICI,"Fitch’s argument is that there seems to be no resolution in sight for assets stuck in insolvency proceedingsThe problem for the lenders arising out of these downgrades is that cost of borrowing overseas goes up

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd and Axis Bank Ltd both found their ratings for foreign issuances downgraded to so-called junk or below investment grade earlier this week by Fitch Ratings.
Fitch’s reason: The operating environment doesn’t warrant a BBB- rating for these lenders. Both these lenders are now rated lower at BB+.
The problem for the lenders, arising out of these downgrades, is that their cost of overseas borrowings go up. Indeed, Bloomberg shows that the yield on both ICICI Bank’s and Axis Bank’s dollar bonds rose in international trade after the downgrades. But the rise was marginal largely because Fitch’s reasons for the downgrade have already been largely factored in by the markets.
Fitch Ratings’ argument is that there seems to be no resolution in sight for assets stuck in insolvency proceedings and of bad loans outside courts. Considering the slowing of the Indian economy, resolution for banks is going to be tricky.
This means that further additions to bad loans cannot be ruled out, which in turn has implications for capital adequacy and profitability.
“Indian banks are looking at a tough year ahead as resolution is slow. These are known facts, but FY19 has been a good year for some of them. A downgrade now sends a wrong signal,"" said an analyst from a global brokerage firm, requesting anonymity.
To be sure, analysts believe that the timing of the rating agency’s move is unfair as the lenders reported an improvement in their metrics in FY19.
Both ICICI Bank and Axis Bank reported notable improvement in asset quality compared with their peers. Kotak Institutional Equities in a note pointed out that overall stressed assets dropped 150 basis points sequentially to 11% for ICICI Bank and the fall for Axis Bank was 80 basis points to 9%. A basis point is 0.01%
That said, Fitch Ratings’ downgrade is a wake-up call for Indian policymakers and lenders.
Foreign capital is impatient and to keep attracting it, it is not just necessary to fix the banking sector, but to fix it quickly.
For that to happen, insolvency resolutions should pick up pace and recoveries should increase. Most large corporate lenders have shown encouraging signs in recoveries, but their write-offs too are high. In other words, lenders are simply writing off loans after providing for them through capital, instead of getting their money back from errant borrowers.
As for rating agencies, analysts believe that Fitch’s move may not hurt private sector lenders, but if other rating agencies follow suit, banks would find themselves in a bind for raising capital. Axis Bank has already issued $3.5 billion worth of medium-term notes, while ICICI Bank has raised $3.7 billion through such notes over the last four years."

March quarter earnings were a mixed bag, with companies dependent on consumption largely playing spoilsport. Now, with the much-talked about consumption story fizzling out and the new government in place, the Street is pinning hopes on investment-focused firms to drive earnings, purportedly on the back of expected reforms.
But when it comes to corporate earnings revival, as past experience shows, it is easier said than done.
“Even if the government pumps in more funds, it is not like we are going to get the desired results in a quarter or two. Also, we don’t know how and to what extent slowdown in consumption has impacted investment demand. There are too many moving parts and just a handful stocks can’t drive a broad-based earnings recovery,"" said an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm, who did not want to be identified.
As the chart alongside shows, the Nifty Infrastructure Index has outpaced the Nifty Consumption Index lately. Whether these companies will deliver on expectations built into their stocks is another story.
“Our analysis shows that the financial sector would grow at a rapid pace, accounting for ~78% of the earnings growth over FY20E. But this will be largely driven by base effects, which is unsustainable. While the market is hoping investments will compensate for consumption, only government spending isn’t enough. Private investments have to pick up as well. So far, there are no meaningful signs of that happening.

That’s not all. What could make the reform process further challenging is limited scope for fiscal stimulus given India’s grim fiscal position.
One silver lining as far as the overall earnings outlook goes is that prices of Brent crude, derivates of which are used as inputs by many Indian companies, are softening. Brent crude prices are down nearly 19% from their April peak of $75.6/barrel. That could aid operating margin growth for many companies. But apart from that, there aren’t many triggers for an earnings revival in the near term.
This column recently pointed out how the current rally in Indian equities is purely driven by hope of reforms. But apart from the absence of corporate earnings growth, what makes this upmove look further unjustified are the markets’ high valuations.
The MSCI India Index is trading at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 18 times, much higher than peers across the world. In this scenario, either earnings have to meaningfully improve or valuations have to moderate."

New Delhi: The ED is set to expand its probe in the ICICI Bank-Videocon money laundering case and may soon question some officials of the bank, besides grilling its former CEO Chanda Kochhar again, officials said Thursday.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had last month questioned and recorded the statements of Chanda Kochhar and her husband Deepak Kochhar over multiple sessions.
Official sources said the agency is now mulling to call some more bank officials to confront them with the statement made by Chanda Kochhar and obtain a clear picture of the deal.
Chanda Kochhar will soon depose before the agency as she has recently sought more time from the agency owing to some health issues and personal commitments, they said.
It is understood that she was supposed to depose before the ED on Thursday but skipped the appearance.
The agency is also preparing to analyse the details of assets of the Kochhars and others so that they can be provisionally attached under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).
Chanda Kochhar's brother-in-law and Deepak's brother, Rajiv Kochhar, has also been grilled by the ED multiple times in the case.
He is the founder of Singapore-based Avista Advisory and was also questioned by the CBI about his company's role in the restructuring of the loan.
Rajiv Kochhar was asked by CBI sleuths about the help he had extended to Videocon in relation to the loan from ICICI Bank, which was part of a  ₹400-billion credit given by a consortium of 20 banks to the group of Venugopal Dhoot.
The Kochhar couple have been questioned in the past too at the ED zonal office in Mumbai after the central agency conducted raids in this case on March 1.
The searches were conducted at the premises of Chanda Kochhar, her family and Venugopal Dhoot of Videocon Group in Maharashtra's Mumbai and Aurangabad.
The ED has registered a criminal case under the PMLA early this year against Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, Dhoot and others to probe alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning  ₹1,875-crore loans by ICICI Bank to the corporate group.
This action of the agency was based on an FIR registered by the CBI.
The CBI has named all the three and Dhoot's companies -- Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) and Videocon Industries Limited (VIL) -- in its case.
The anti-corruption probe agency also named Supreme Energy, a company founded by Dhoot, and NuPower Renewables, a company controlled by Deepak Kochhar, in the FIR.
It has slapped sections of the Indian Penal Code related to criminal conspiracy, cheating and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act on all the accused.
The CBI alleged that Dhoot had invested in Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy in a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the CEO of the bank on May 1, 2009.
The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI alleged.
During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth  ₹1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June, 2009 and October, 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank, which have now become part of the probe.
The loans were declared non-performing assets in 2012, causing a loss of  ₹1,730 crore to the bank, it alleged.
The ED, the sources said, is also probing at least two other instances of loans given by ICICI Bank (during Chanda Kochhar's tenure) to Gujarat-based pharmaceutical firm Sterling Biotech and to Bhushan Steel group.
The agency is investigating these two instances of alleged bank loan fraud under the PMLA."

MUMBAI :
When city-based financial planner Melvin Joseph, now 52, started working 25 years ago, he had made up his mind that he would not buy a property. “Immediately after my wedding, I got transferred from my home town in Kerala to a hill station while working for an insurance company. Since then, I have always stayed on rent as I knew I would be changing cities owing to my work profile,"" says Joseph. In the past 25 years, he has shifted multiple cities across Kerala and Tamil Nadu, before winding up in Mumbai. Not owning a property has actually given him the freedom to explore his career without any restrictions, says Joseph. “Had I purchased a house in Kerala 25 years ago, then my career would have been limited, as I would be thinking about my real estate investment and would have been locked into an EMI [equated monthly instalment],"" he says.
Unlike Joesph, who was clear about his decision, majority of salaried individuals, at some point or the other, have to tackle this common dilemma—to buy a house or rent one. Once you keep your emotions aside, it gets easier to decide this. Here are some key questions you need to ask yourself to make an informed decision on property for self occupancy:
PLAN TO LIVE IN THE CURRENT LOCATION FOREVER?
Today, most individuals tend to change cities for better opportunities. “Don’t purchase a house in the early part of your career if you are likely to move cities or if there is no job certainty,"" says Joseph. Real estate is an illiquid asset and you also can’t predict the growth on it. Plans to sell and buy properties at your convenience may not work. “With the need for flexibility being paramount in careers and the requirement to reskill at multiple stages, the flexibility of renting and not having EMIs can be very advantageous,"" says Vishal Dhawan, founder of Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house if you don’t plan to live in the city for long.
CAN YOU AFFORD IT?
Real estate is an expensive asset. In case of salaried individuals, a house is likely to be the most expensive buy. Hence, you need to ask yourself if you can afford to buy a property. “A house requires a huge amount of capital and for most of us it entails taking a loan. Buying a house to live may make sense if you are going to be in the city for long, travel time to work place is less and have at least 25% of the amount available as down payment,"" says financial planner Deepali Sen.
Verdict: If the rent is 1-2% of the property value and EMI is likely to be 1.5 times above monthly rent, stay on rent.
SETTLE FOR A SMALL HOUSE?
To woo homebuyers amid high prices, developers reduce the size of the property to try and fit the house in your budget. But do you actually want to live in it? Besides location and affordability, you also need to factor in the property size. Just because you can afford only 280 sqft for  ₹1 crore in Mumbai, you shouldn’t lock yourself in. Similarly, just because you fancy a big house, you shouldn’t go for it if you can’t afford it.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house which doesn’t fit your requirement.
CAN YOU REPAY THE LOAN?
Remember that home loans are of longer duration and are large ticket-size loans. And you should have the long-term ability to service these loans. You have to make sure your home loan repayment is cushioned against job loss, loss of income due to medical emergency, and any other unforeseen circumstances.
Verdict: Don’t buy a house if you don’t have the ability to repay your loan.
CAN YOU MEET OTHER GOALS?
Remember, buying a house is only one of the financial goals. You will also have other goals to fulfil, such as higher education, child’s education, buying a car, travel plan and retirement. You have to ensure you are able to meet these goals too. “You should think of buying a house without hurting your lifestyle and your other goals.
Usually, a bigger home loan means the future cash flow gets used up for at least two decades. This leaves little room for other key goals,"" says Sen.
Verdict: Buy a house only if it doesn’t hurt your lifestyle and other goals."
234,2019-06-10,ICICI,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

An Indian resident invests through his Indian bank accounts in mutual funds like Franklin India Feeder - Franklin US Opportunities or ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Equity. The funds invest primarily in select bluechip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. Should the Indian resident investor, while filing returns, declare his holding as a foreign asset?
—A. Venkat
The requirement to report foreign assets in the income-tax return depends on the residential status in India for the relevant financial year (FY). Only if the individual qualifies as a resident and ordinarily resident, the individual is required to report all foreign assets in the India return. One has to be very careful in reporting foreign assets or income. Any omission or inaccurate particulars may invite penal consequences under Black Money (Undisclosed Foreign Income and Assets) and Imposition of Tax Act, 2015.
Units of global equity mutual funds may be reported in the income-tax return as a foreign asset only if the individual is an owner (legal or direct owner) or a beneficiary or a beneficial owner of the shares of overseas entities held by the global equity mutual funds.
In the present case, the individual is the owner of the units of the global equity mutual funds registered under the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and governed by Indian laws. The individual may not be considered as the owner of the downstream investments made by the global equity mutual funds as he or she cannot have any interest (including beneficial interest) in the individual assets owned by global equity mutual funds. The interest in global equity funds in such a case will be limited to the units held by the individual. Also, the individual will not have any right or control over the assets of global equity mutual funds in the capacity of a unit holder.
The intent of the law is to capture the details and information of foreign assets and/or interests located outside India in the income-tax return, whereas a holding in Indian global equity mutual funds formed in India and registered with Sebi are per se Indian assets.
Accordingly, there is no requirement to report global equity funds as foreign assets in the income-tax return. It may, however, be clarified that this conclusion is based on the critical assumption that the individual as a unit holder in Indian global equity funds does not have any right or control over the underlying foreign investments made by such fund in his/her capacity as the unit holder.

Even as investors bet on a resurgence for medium-sized Indian companies after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s return to power, one of the country’s top mid-cap fund manager advises caution.
This group of stocks won’t get an immediate lift from Modi’s victory as it isn’t immune to the slowdown in the economy and the lingering shadow-bank crisis, said Vinit Sambre, who oversees $1.6 billion in two mid- and small-cap funds at DSP Investment Managers in Mumbai.
“Corporate India is feeling the pressure of slowdown across the board, and we have not steered out of the non-bank finance crisis that began in September,"" he said. “The overall market volatility will have some bearing on mid-cap stocks as well.""
Brokerages including CLSA India Pvt. and ICICI Securities Ltd. expect mid-sized businesses to benefit on hopes Modi’s sweeping win would help him push through measures to boost growth. A day after the election results last month, Angel Broking said it expects the “party to begin"" after a weak spell that’s left the Nifty MidCap 100 Index trading at the highest discount to the main large-cap gauge in six years.
As the euphoria from the election victory fades, the focus is shifting back to reality. Many small- and mid-sized companies rely on loans to meet cash commitments and are prone to liquidity tightness in the financial system.
The midcap gauge Friday halted two weeks of gains as data on May 31 showed the economy grew last quarter at a slower pace than economists expected. Investor confidence was also shaken by the crisis faced by shadow banks after the default of IL&FS Group in September. This past week, the bad news roared back, with troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corp.’s rating cut to default.
“Growth has to return but it doesn’t look like it is coming back soon,"" said Sambre, whose fund has beaten 93% of peers over a five-year period. “High expectations are being built on the government taking measures to improve demand. Any delay in their ability to do so can have negative repercussions.""
Sambre said he used the soft patch for mid-cap stocks to consolidate his fund by reducing the number of holdings to 50 from as high as 70. The fund exited non-bank finance stocks, while adding insurers and consumer-focused firms that are likely to be less impacted from the slowdown, he said. The fund is also betting on private-sector banks, drugmakers and producers of specialty chemicals and auto parts.

232,2019-06-11,ICICI,"In a first step, Sebi has sought to address the issue of so-called vested complainants in cases of insider tradingTo address the issue of veracity of complaints, Sebi proposes to set up an office independent from investigations department

Mumbai: Investigations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi into the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Infosys Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd all have one thing in common -- they are all based on so-called whistleblower complaints.
Sebi found some merit in these complaints; with it passing orders in the case of alleged lapses at NSE's colocation platform, allowing settlement in the probe into corporate governance lapses at Infosys, sending letters to Sun on a case of alleged insider trading when it purchased Ranbaxy, and issuing notice to ICICI Bank on inadequate disclosures.
However, during the probes questions were raised on the veracity of the complaints and complainants. For instance, one of the so-called whistleblower complaints in case of lapses at NSE came from the office of 63 Moons Technologies Ltd (formerly known as Financial Technologies Ltd), similarly Sun asked Sebi to intervene and look into the genuineness of the complaint.
In a first step, Sebi has sought to address the issue of so-called vested complainants in cases of insider trading.
Sebi on Monday issued a discussion paper which proposes a reward, amnesty and protection policy for 'informants' who blow the whistle on cases of insider trading. Sebi will create a separate disclosure window for such whistleblowers to submit information of alleged wrongdoing and they will be rewarded to the tune of  ₹1 crore for cases where disgorgement has been at least  ₹5 crore. Sebi hopes that this policy move will improve its conviction rate in cases of insider trading.
To address the issue of veracity of complaints, Sebi proposes to set up an office independent from the investigations department which will look into complaints filed in cases of alleged insider trading.
In case the office determines that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious, Sebi can initiate appropriate action against the informant under the securities laws and any other applicable law, Sebi said in the discussion paper.
While this addresses the issue of 'vested and frivolous complaints' it may also discourage complainants as the ramifications of a wrong complaint have been kept wide ranging, said a lawyer practicing securities law.
Considering that the past two years have seen big cases come to light through complaints filed by anonymous complaints, Sebi should propose such a mechanism for fraudulent trade practices too and not limit it to insider trading, he added."

230,2019-06-12,ICICI,"For a refiner, GRM is realization from turning a barrel of crude oil into finished productsSure, the improvement in overall Singapore GRM is encouraging, but investors should not get carried away just yet

Oil refining margins have been weak in recent quarters. Still, some comfort can be derived from the sequential improvement in the benchmark Singapore gross refining margin (GRM). According to ICICI Securities Ltd, Singapore GRM has increased by about 11% to $3.54 per barrel so far in the June quarter compared to the March quarter.
The quarter-on-quarter rise is driven entirely by a 2.2 times sequential jump in petrol cracks to $8.2 per barrel, said ICICI Securities in a report on 10 June, adding: “All other product cracks are down quarter-on-quarter.""
For a refiner, GRM is realization from turning a barrel of crude oil into finished products.
Sure, the improvement in overall Singapore GRM is encouraging, but investors should not get carried away just yet. That’s because the measure still remains drastically lower on a year-on-year basis.
Plus, it’s not as if the overall refining outlook is bright. For one, demand outlook is relatively subdued at a time when large global refining capacity additions are expected. China, a key market, is not giving respite either. Chinese gasoline exports are expected to remain high on account of growing refining capacity and tepid domestic demand, pointed out Nitin Tiwari, an analyst at Antique Stock Broking Ltd.
Needless to say, a weaker refining margin environment won’t bode well for refining firms. For Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), many analysts have clipped their refining margin estimates over the course of FY19. For instance, Kotak Institutional Equities’ refining margin assumption for FY20 was $10.1 per barrel after Q4 FY19 results. This measure was at $12.1 per barrel after Q1 FY19 results. The broker has factored in near-term weakness in refining margins, which may be followed by gains from implementation of the International Maritime Organization’s (IMO’s) 2020 rules for marine fuels and a gradual ramp up of RIL’s petcoke gasifiers.
In that backdrop, investors will have to closely watch whether GRMs improve when IMO’s new regulations come into effect in 2020. These require ships to use oil with lower sulphur content, which in turn is expected to boost diesel demand, boosting refining margins.
However, should these gains not fructify and the current muted GRMs persist, investors can expect further cuts in RIL’s refining margin estimates going ahead."
229,2019-06-12,ICICI,"GAIL said it will take over Konkan LNG’s entire debt of  ₹4,000 crore at a 15-20% discount on the total outstandingThe talks are at a nascent stage since the proposal requires an independent valuation of the stakes

State-run gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd has proposed to assume the debt of about  ₹4,000 crore of Konkan LNG Pvt. Ltd in lieu of receiving the lenders’ stake in the company for free, said two bankers aware of the discussions.
The talks are at a nascent stage since the proposal requires an independent valuation of the stakes held by the lenders in Konkan LNG, said the first person cited above.
“GAIL has said that it will take over the entire debt of Konkan LNG at a 15-20% discount on the total outstanding, but our equity in the plant should be transferred for free,"" the banker said, requesting anonymity.
Gail owned 25.5% in unlisted Konkan LNG in March 2018, according to a shareholding document from the registrar of companies (RoC). Another RoC document showed more than 260 million shares were issued to GAIL in August last year. The offer for issue of these shares on rights basis was made to existing shareholders on 24 July 2018. Only GAIL subscribed to 260 million shares, the document showed.
An undated shareholding pattern of Konkan LNG, available on its website, showed that GAIL now owns 56.71% of the paid-up share capital. The lenders—IDBI Bank, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Canara Bank and IFCI—collectively own 20.62%. Others include NTPC Ltd (14.82%) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board Holding Co. (7.85%). If approved by lenders, GAIL’s stake in Konkan LNG will increase to 77.33%.
Another banker, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that taking a 15-20% haircut on their loans will be feasible; however, they are not too sure about the free equity transfer proposal. “Following fresh equity infusion last year, GAIL has now become the largest shareholder in Konkan LNG and since banks are anyway exiting non-core businesses, the transaction will make sense if we are paid in exchange of our shares,"" he added.
Emails sent to GAIL and the lenders remained unanswered till the time of going to press.
An analyst tracking GAIL said that one possible reason for the company to take over the extra debt from lenders is to get full control of the plant and complete the breakwater facility pending for several years. With lenders, being part of the consortium, it would have been difficult to achieve a consensus on the financial closure of the project, the analyst said. “The offer to get the equity for free would not have been feasible without the offer to take over debt,"" he said.
The demerger of the LNG business of Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt. Ltd (RGPPL) into a new company, Konkan LNG, was filed for approval with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 23 December, 2016. It was finally approved by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on 11 March, 2018.
The debt restructuring proposal of RGPPL included bifurcation of existing loans of  ₹9,000 crore into RGPPL and Konkan LNG. About  ₹5,000 crore loans to RGPPL was then split into sustainable ( ₹2,000 crore) and unsustainable debt ( ₹3,000 crore) with the latter being converted into cumulative redeemable preference shares.
The sustainable loan was given a longer repayment term and interest rates cut from 13% to 9%. Meanwhile, Konkan LNG received additional loans of  ₹1,200 crore to build the breakwater facility. At present, the LNG facility is not an all-weather terminal since there is no breakwater, because of which, no cargoes are received during the monsoon period. The LNG terminal is designed to supply 2.1mmtpa of re-gasified LNG to RGPPL and the balance 2.9mmtpa is for re-gasification and transportation to catchment gas markets through a pipeline network.
RGPPL, earlier known as Dabhol Power Co., was conceived in the 1990s and originally promoted by the now-bankrupt US energy firm Enron Corp. The asset was transferred to the government in mid-2005, and the project was fully commissioned on 31 March 2010."

227,2019-06-17,ICICI,"Credit rating is one of the inputs in investment decision, but not the sole determinant, says Nimesh ShahAccording to Shah, the biggest outcome of the crisis is the focus on risk management and diversification

The liquidity crisis faced by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) is an isolated event and does not pose any systemic threat, Nimesh Shah, chief executive officer of ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund said. India’s  ₹25.93 trillion mutual fund industry which has lent to NBFCs has received particular attention in the crisis, with questions being raised on the safety of  ₹13.24 trillion of assets under management (AUM) of debt funds. According to Shah, the biggest outcome of the crisis is the focus on risk management and diversification. Edited excerpts from an interview:
The debt mutual fund story has taken a hit in the past one year after the IL&FS crisis, where funds have been questioned on credit risk and valuation. How do you view the current loss of credibility?
We are of the view that NBFC crisis is an isolated, individual company event and does not pose any systemic risk. It is important to note that the concerns pertaining to each of the debt papers under question is confined/limited to specific schemes within select fund houses and are not at an industry-wide level, as it is being largely perceived. This can also be gauged from the fact that financial index as on 13 June has delivered 16.26% and has outperformed the benchmark index Nifty, which generated 9.74% over the last one year. We have always believed that credit rating is one of the inputs in investment decision, but not the sole determinant.
Two key tenets of our credit decision-making have been the focus on client selection and avoiding concentration. This discipline has helped us not to overly rely on credit rating and has helped us avoid potential problems, considering that, till recently, many of the credits currently under stress, carried the highest safety rating.
What is your view on the recent credit events, downgrades, defaults and delays in repayments by NBFCs?
If we look at some of the recent credit events, they had the following broad characteristics:
• Borrowers had relied upon short-term market borrowings to finance long-term use of funds which resulted in liquidity mismatch, thereby exposing them to increased refinancing risk. Increasingly, the borrowers are taking measures to address these issues through diversification of their liability mix and reducing excessive reliance on shorter term sources of funding.
• Credit spreads on the bonds issued by some of the issuers were significantly higher than similar rated papers. This was clearly pointing towards the growing divergence between the credit standing as suggested by the ratings provided by the rating agencies and the market perception. Thanks to the rating downgrade, some of these anomalies have got addressed.
• Lack of transparency and/or adequate disclosure for groups with complex group structures created challenges in assessment of credit profile of the issuers.
Do you think these credit events have settled down now? How have mutual funds adapted to these? And what sort of an impact the so-called NBFC crisis has had on debt funds?
We have seen that systemically, some of the credit issues have been addressed or (are) under the process of being addressed. We believe the panic phase has run its course. Most of the headlines have been negative around debt mutual funds and so the sentiment around investing into debt mutual funds has turned negative.
The biggest outcome of these developments has been the focus on risk management and portfolio diversification in debt funds. These events have also highlighted that just as volatility is an integral part of equity investments, rating upgrades and downgrades are part and parcel of credit investments. There is a need to differentiate between various ratings downgrades. A downgrade in credit rating from “AAA"" to “AA"" has entirely different connotation than that from “BBB"" to “BB"". We need to appreciate that despite the downgrade, a AA rated credit continues to belong to relatively high safety grade.
While the asset (investment) side of the mutual funds has been under scrutiny thanks to recent events, what is important is to maintain granularity in liability side e.g. in ICICI Prudential Credit Risk Fund, we have a limit of  ₹100 crore stipulated on investment from single investor.
Focus needs to be on ensuring adequate diversification. This ensures that even under the event wherein liquidity of a particular instrument gets adversely impacted, the overall scheme level liquidity does not come under stress. There has been a flight to better managed funds. As can be seen from the monthly data, investors have moved on to funds with better risk management practices.
Do you think that mutual funds are highly exposed to papers of NBFCs and should the slant change? If yes why? If not, why?
NBFCs are an important part of the financial ecosystem. Within the NBFC space, there is a wide variety of companies operating in this space, of which some of them are backed by a strong corporate group or a bank. For example: There are companies which operate in two, three and four wheeler space, housing finance, infrastructure finance, gold loan etc. Each of these companies possesses a unique business model.
Within these companies, there are specific pockets which are under stress while for others, it is business as usual. What is important here is to distinguish which of them possess a strong liability franchise.
We believe the current crisis should not be a deterrent when it comes to investing into well-managed NBFC papers. At ICICI Prudential AMC, we have increased our exposure to NBFC names which are backed by banks or strong corporate groups.
How has the debt fund strategies changed in the wake of these back-to-back setbacks?
At ICICI Prudential AMC, our risk management processes followed has held us in good stead till date. But, as an industry, the current debt market situation has sharply brought into focus the importance of robust risk management practices. Our credit due diligence considers both qualitative and quantitative factors, which has helped us navigate the credit ecosystem soundly. The risk management team is independent of the investment team and does not have any return targets.
The biggest puzzle was on valuation of debt funds. Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi) has come out with a valuation methodology; is this binding or optional?
The valuation methodology put out by Amfi provides uniformity in the manner in which the valuation of a debt fund is carried out by all fund houses. Despite the bond market being highly illiquid, the valuation practices followed by the MF industry is one of the best. Within various industries, the MF industry is the only one where valuations are done on MTM (mark to market) basis and with inputs from valuation agencies; an investor should derive comfort from this fact.
Sebi is working on a radical thought of having an SLR mechanism for debt funds to ensure liquidity buffer for investors. Your thoughts on this?
The SLR mechanism is a step forward to insulate retail investors from losses in case any of the debt paper held by liquid funds comes under stress. We believe this is a positive development in the interest of investors. The processes followed by ICICI Prudential AMC ensure that there is sufficient liquidity for all its investments.
At a time when credit risk funds have been shrouded in negatives, why do you have a buy call on this category? What is your investment rationale?
Currently, credit risk category of funds is facing reduced inflows owing to negative sentiments (NBFC liquidity crunch), but valuations are attractive at current levels given the elevated yields. We are of the view that the risk-reward benefit has turned favourable and it’s a good time to earn the carry with high credit spreads available in the corporate bond space."

221,2019-06-21,ICICI,"ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. prefers the shorter end of the sovereign bond curveIt is trading “opportunistically” in the long end

As India’s credit markets reel from a string of defaults, the nation’s top bond underwriter is taking refuge in the safety of government debt.
ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd. prefers the shorter end of the sovereign bond curve as it expects the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates further to revive growth, according to Shailendra Jhingan, the firm’s chief executive officer. It is trading “opportunistically"" in the long end, where it sees concerns over fiscal slippage limiting further gains after a strong rally.
“Sovereign debt is looking like the best option in an environment of risk aversion,"" Mumbai-based Jhingan said in an interview. “There could be up to two more rate cuts. So short-term state-government bonds and gilts are core portfolios.""
Investors are growing wary of credit as India’s shadow-banking crisis is showing few signs of abating, even a year after a series of defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. exposed weaknesses in the sector. Refinancing risks for the nation’s non-bank financing companies are rising as they face of a record 1.1 trillion rupees ($15.8 billion) of local-currency bonds due next quarter.
Problems at some of the housing-finance firms “aren’t going to go away,"" Jhingan said. “Some of them are selling their retail assets at significantly higher yield and paying short-term borrowers but that creates a problem for people who’re holding longer-term bonds.""
Rate Cuts
The NBFC crisis is also weighing on consumption in the economy, especially the real-estate sector, Jhingan said, adding that he expects another 25-50 basis points of rate cuts by the central bank to revive expansion.
“The growth slowdown is going to be there for the next 6-9 months at least,"" he said.
India’s sovereign bonds are set to cap a third quarter of gains. The benchmark 10-year yield has slumped 59 basis points since the end of March as the central bank cut rates, Prime Minister Narendra Modi triumphed in elections and as slowing global growth spurred a worldwide rally in debt.
However, concern about the government’s fiscal discipline is now turning investors a little jittery ahead of next month’s federal budget.
“We are expecting slippage on the fiscal parameters and maybe in the second half we get an extra borrowing because of that,"" Jhingan said. “The government won’t want to cut spending in a year when growth is slowing anyways, so you need some kind of stimulus there.""
Jhingan expects fiscal worries to limit further declines in the 10-year bond yield. He sees it falling to 6.60% in the next six months. That’s versus a level of 6.76% in Mumbai on Thursday.
“The scope for bonds yields to come down is not significant,"" he said. “We are looking at a steeper curve so we like the two-to-five year segment more, while we are tactically trading on the belly of the curve, the 10-14 year segment."""

218,2019-06-24,ICICI,"Boards can no longer afford to be passive. They must swing into a more engaged role

IL&FS. ICICI. Yes Bank. Boeing. Bayer. GE. Even as many boards the world over find themselves challenged by crisis, the discourse around revamping boards remains in the nature of band-aids. What’s needed, instead, is a whole new paradigm.
Military historians draw a vital distinction between peacetime and wartime armies, peacetime and wartime generals. This is a useful metaphor for corporate boards. In peacetime, when the environment is stable and the company is doing well, boards need not do much beyond ensuring compliance and appropriate disclosures, and providing advice to the management. In times of great change or turbulence, however, peacetime boards frequently find themselves overwhelmed—as we have seen repeatedly. Societal demand for greater transparency and accountability, whistleblowers, activist investors, leadership misdemeanours, promoter transitions and technology disruptions are coming together to create a near-perfect storm for many companies. Their boards must be designed to weather the storm, or they will surely capsize.
Boards can no longer afford to be passive; they must proactively swing into a more engaged role with the management and become active in critical areas such as strategy, risk, organization development and investor engagement–roles that traditionally are firmly in the realm of management. Specifically, boards need a rethink in at least four areas.
Composition
Traditionally, boards the world over have been disproportionately stocked with people who won’t rock the boat. Contemporary boards are working boards. They need to be compact and they need a very different mix. They need leaders, not bureaucrats: leaders who are independent in spirit and can ask the vital, difficult questions; who are active. They need directors who have expertise particularly in technology. They need a seasoned CEO or two who have led transformational change and dealt with crises and activists. Global diversity is essential in addition to gender diversity.
Strategy and risk
Strategy development under uncertainty is a process of discovery. Companies have to feel their way to the future and this means taking many little steps, trying experiments to see what works and scaling what does. This process of discovery and learning is fraught with risks and therefore risk management and strategy have to be closely coupled requiring a close collaborative relationship between the management and the board. The board has to understand both the risks posed by the new strategy as well as the risks to the success of the strategy. Asking whether the organization is taking too much or the wrong risks, not enough of the right risks, whether it should pursue alternative strategies is crucial. So, too, are seemingly simple decisions such as what metrics to use and targets to set.
Organization, talent and culture
Culture trumps strategy. Many of the very things that made the company successful in the past are now core rigidities and have to be dumped. New talent has to be brought in and integrated but invariably this sets up a clash of “old versus new"". Boards have to question whether they have the right CEO to lead the transition. How well is the CEO managing talent and reshaping culture in support of the strategy? Do we have the right talent in key roles? The board must be aware and engaged in helping the CEO and management make the right choices.
Board leadership: the invisible hand
Stewardship of an organization in times like these places a premium on the leadership of the board chairman. The chairman is an orchestra conductor shaping the agenda, ensuring that the board is prioritizing its time and intellect on the vital few issues that really matter, guiding debates to good conclusions drawing from a wide range of talent and perspectives. The chairman must be thoughtful and questioning, but most vitally, wise and courageous. Companies give a lot of thought to hiring their CEO; they must give even greater thought to selecting the chairman.
Conclusion
The neck of the bottle is always at the top. it is therefore inconceivable for a company to navigate through turbulence without a paradigm shift about the role and functioning of the board.
Ravi Venkatesan is former chairman of Microsoft India, Bank of Baroda and Cummins India. He has also served on the boards of Infosys, AB Volvo and Thermax."

NEW DELHI :
Asset restructuring firm JM Financial ARC Wednesday said it had taken over Unitech's loan from a financial institution in November 2016 and no new debt of the realty firm has been acquired thereafter by it.
The company disbursed some funds over a period of time to help Unitech restart/complete certain projects, JM Financial ARC said in a statement.
""JM Financial ARC had taken over debts pertaining to Unitech Group from a financial institution in November 2016. As part of restructuring of the debts so taken over, some funds were provided to them to help them restart/complete certain of their projects,"" the statement said.
The funds were disbursed by JM Financial ARC over a period of time from the date of taking over their debts, it further said.
JM Financial ARC has taken over debts and provided additional loans as a lender and has not taken over projects, it said adding that the asset restructuring firm does not control or manage the projects.
The Gurugram-based developer had 74 pending real estate projects, comprising 16,500 housing units, in August 2017, when its two managing directors Sanjay Chandra and Ajay Chandra were arrested.
In the last two years, the company has completed about 22 projects comprising 4,000 units, while 52 projects are still incomplete, according to sources.
Chandra brothers were arrested after some homebuyers dragged the company and its directors to court for non-delivery of their apartments and sought refund.
A bail application was filed before the Supreme Court, but the apex court had directed Unitech to first deposit  ₹750 crore in the registry. The realty firm has so far deposited about  ₹480 crore.

New Delhi: The ED Friday questioned former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar, her husband Deepak Kochhar and Videocon promoter Venugopal Dhoot in connection with a money laundering case involving their business concern, officials said.
The three deposed as part of a regular summon and their statement is being being recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they said.
They have been grilled by the central agency in the past in connection with the alleged corruption case involving the bank and Videocon group.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) had last month questioned and recorded the statements of Chanda Kochhar and Deepak Kochhar over multiple sessions at its office in Delhi.
The agency is also preparing to analyse the details of assets of the Kochhars and others so that they can be provisionally attached under the anti-money laundering law.
Chanda Kochhar's brother-in-law Rajiv Kochhar has also been grilled by the ED multiple times in the case.
The Kochhar couple and Dhoot were questioned at the ED's zonal office in Mumbai after the central agency conducted raids on March 1.
The searches were conducted at the premises of Chanda Kochhar, her family and Dhoot in Maharashtra's Mumbai and Aurangabad cities.
The ED registered a criminal case under the PMLA earlier this year against Chanda Kochhar, Deepak Kochhar, Dhoot and others to probe alleged irregularities and corrupt practices in sanctioning  ₹1,875-crore of loans by ICICI Bank to the corporate group.
This action of the agency was based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
The CBI has named all the three and Dhoot's companies -- Videocon International Electronics Ltd (VIEL) and Videocon Industries Limited (VIL) -- in its case.
The anti-corruption probe agency also named Supreme Energy, a company founded by Dhoot, and NuPower Renewables, a company controlled by Deepak Kochhar, in the FIR.
The CBI alleged that Dhoot had invested in Nupower through his firm Supreme Energy in a quid pro quo to loans cleared by ICICI Bank after Chanda Kochhar took over as the bank's CEO on May 1, 2009.
The ownership of Nupower and Supreme Energy changed hands through a complex web of shared transactions between Deepak Kochhar and Dhoot, the CBI alleged. 
During its preliminary enquiry, the CBI found that six loans worth  ₹1,875 crore were sanctioned to the Videocon Group and companies associated with it between June 2009 and October 2011 in alleged violation of laid-down policies of ICICI Bank, which have now become part of the probe.
The loans were declared non-performing assets in 2012, causing a loss of  ₹1,730 crore to the bank, it alleged.
The ED, sources said, is also probing at least two other instances of loans given by the ICICI Bank (during Chanda Kochhar's tenure) to Gujarat-based pharmaceutical firm Sterling Biotech and to Bhushan Steel group, both of which are under its probe for alleged money laundering charges

Fixed deposits (FDs) are considered a preferred mode of investment for investors who want guaranteed returns as well as the highest level of safety for their money. Top lenders like State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and Punjab National Bank (PNB) provide customers with the facility of opening a short-term or a long-term FD account. Recently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) lowered its lending rate also known as repo rate for the third time in a calendar year. Accordingly, major banks like ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and Yes Bank too revised their interest rates on deposits.
FD comes with a wide range of tenures; you can choose from as low as 7 days up to 10 years. Based on the tenure you chose, banks offer different interest rates which also vary from bank to bank. The interest rate typically ranges from 5.75 per cent to 7.50 per cent in a year. Interest offered to senior citizens are 0.5 per cent higher than the regular customers.
SBI revised fixed deposit (FD) rates

Mumbai: The second largest private sector lender ICICI Bank has cut its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 10 basis points (bps) across tenors. The new rates are effective immediately. The one-year MCLR or the minimum lending rate now stands at 8.65%.
The one-year MCLR is the benchmark against which most customer loans such as auto, personal and home loans are priced. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
This comes weeks after the bank cut its deposit rates on some select maturities with effect from 17 June 2019.
Last month, IDBI Bank had reduced its MCLR by 5-10 basis points across various tenors, with immediate effect. India's largest bank, State Bank of India (SBI), too reduced its marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points (bps) across tenors.
Top private sector lenders like Axis Bank, Yes Bank and HDFC Bank had initiated deposit cuts between 0.10 and 0.25 percent in the middle of June across select buckets.
At the 6 June review, RBI had cut the key policy rate by 0.25% and had asked banks to quickly pass on the benefits of rate cuts. RBI also hinted at further easing by shifting its stance to accommodatory from neutral, taking the total quantum of rate cut to 0.75 % in 2019.

I have invested around  ₹20,000 each in ICICI Prudential Value Discovery Fund, Axis Long term equity fund, Franklin India Focused Equity Fund, Aditya Birla Sunlife Equity Fund and L&T Mid cap Fund. I want to start systematic investment plans (SIPs) with a monthly investment of about  ₹80,000. My time horizon is 20-25 years, with a goal of about  ₹2 crore for my daughter’s education and  ₹3 crore for my retirement. Suggest a few funds for me.
— Omi Santoliya
You have invested in good schemes and have a diversified portfolio within the equity asset class with a spread of value, multi- and mid-cap funds. Equity as an asset does carry risk and hence is recommended for long term. As your investment horizon is long, you can consider equity as an asset class for creating a corpus for your daughter’s education as well as for your retirement. The monthly investments you want to start making via SIPs can also be in the same schemes where you have made the one-time investments. You may consider adding a large-cap fund to your portfolio for further diversification.
You can achieve your investment goals, but you need to be wary of inflation. A retirement corpus of  ₹3 crore 25 years from now at 6% inflation would be equal to  ₹70 lakh today. Hence, you need to increase your savings every year with increase in income. Make sure you invest any bonuses or extra funds as well.
I moved abroad for a job in September 2018. I didn’t close my Provident Fund (PF) account with the previous employer which I have had for 10 years. I don’t want to withdraw the money as I don’t need it. I plan on living abroad for about a year and a half. I want to know if I can leave the account as it is. Will it earn any interest on the accumulated amount? Will it become inoperative if I stop contributing?
—Durgadutt Shetty
If you leave your job and don’t join any new organisation, which is true in your case as you have moved overseas, your PF account will become inoperative. This is applicable when there is no fresh contribution for a continuous period of 36 months, thereby classifying the account as a dormant account.
All PF accounts were eligible to interest before restrictions were imposed in April 2011, whereby interest accrual was stopped for dormant accounts. This was done primarily to help the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) save on interest payout. However, this restriction was lifted in April 2016 and dormant accounts were again allowed to earn interest till the account holder attained retirement age.
If you continue to hold your inoperative account, make sure that the account is compliant with KYC (know your customer) and that the UAN (Unique account Number) has been allotted to you for ease of dealing with the PF authority in the future. Keep in mind that interest accrued on a dormant PF account will be considered taxable income.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

204,2019-07-12,ICICI,"Of DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt,  ₹38,000 crore has been raised from banks. The rest was raised by selling debt securitiesDHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July

Mumbai: Lenders to Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) are planning to ask the company’s 86,000 non-convertible debenture holders to be part of the inter-creditor agreement to pre-empt likely litigation over dues, three bankers aware of the matter said.
Seven state-run lenders to DHFL, including State Bank of India and Union Bank of India, met 300 institutional bondholders comprising mutual funds, provident funds and pension funds on Thursday to explore options of working together to restructure DHFL’s  ₹1 trillion debt. DHFL’s chairman Kapil Wadhawan was also part of the meeting.
“We are looking at restructuring the company as a going concern. Lenders will work with NCD holders, shoulder-to-shoulder, to realize the maximum value,"" said a senior banker, one of the three cited above, on the condition of anonymity. “It’s not mandatory on the part of NCD holders to sign the ICA.""
Of DHFL’s total  ₹1 trillion debt as of February,  ₹38,000 crore has been borrowed from banks. The remaining amount was raised by selling debt securities. On 5 July, close to 30 banks signed the ICA to restructure the debt of the home financier.
The decision to include these investors as part of ICA is mainly to prevent NCD holders from moving the Debt Recovery Tribunal to recover outstanding dues, stalling the restructuring process. Currently, financial institutions cannot be referred to the National Company’s Law Tribunal for insolvency proceedings.
The Indian Banks’ Association, on behalf of lenders, has already written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India to permit investors to participate in the ICA. Under the Reserve Bank of India’s guidelines on resolution of stressed assets released on 7 June, only banks and non-banking financial companies are allowed to be part of the ICA.
However, in the case of DHFL, as the number of debenture holders is large, lenders say that the debenture trustees can seek permission from these holders before signing the ICA. This involves going through a voting process and giving the holders 21 days’ time to exercise their vote.
Catalyst Trusteeship Ltd and IDBI Trusteeship Services Ltd act as the debenture trustees for the NCDs issued by the housing company.
“This is the first time that NCD holders could be part of a restructuring process. There are not too many cases where such a large portion of debt is being held by NCD holders,"" said the second banker, also requesting anonymity. “DRT is equipped to handle these cases. Hence it’s necessary that it goes through restructuring,"" he added.
Meanwhile, DHFL will submit the resolution plan next week after a board meeting scheduled for 13 July.
The restructuring plan, which is being prepared under RBI’s 7 June circular, could include extension of the tenure of loans, conversion of debt into equity, infusion of fresh working capital and induction of a new management team and financial investors.
Currently, DHFL is a “special mention account-zero"", indicating an asset where interest and principal is not overdue for more than 30 days and the account exhibits signs of incipient stress. Lenders have to ensure the restructuring is completed by end-September in order to avoid the account being classified as non-performing.
Under RBI’s new framework, lenders have 30 days to decide on a resolution plan. The decision of lenders who constitute 75% by value of total outstanding facilities (fund-based as well non-fund based) and 60% by number shall be binding on all other lenders.
DHFL’s consortium of lenders also includes Axis Bank, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. SBI has the largest exposure of around  ₹10,000 crore.
Over the past few months, DHFL has sold retail loans worth ₹30,000 crore. It has also sold several of its strategic assets, including affordable housing arm Aadhar Housing Finance Ltd, educational loan business Avanse and DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers. In January, DHFL sold wholesale loans worth  ₹1,375 crore to alternative investment management fund Oaktree Capital, which buys distressed loan portfolios at a discount."

MUMBAI :
Better safe than sorry has never been more relevant to Indian banks.
The first quarter results of Indian banks would kickstart today with IndusInd Bank announcing its numbers later in the day.
While investors will monitor several parameters to determine which banks are safer and which would be sorry, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) is expected to be a deciding factor.
After all, insurance against risks is the best way to ensure future profits.
In its financial stability report, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) noted that there is a wide disparity between banks with regards to PCR. “PSBs, in particular, showed a range of 42% to 74% in PCRs,"" the report said.
Analysts believe that banks having superior PCR would be better placed to tide over any future stress and therefore are more likely to show improved profitability for the June quarter.
Kotak Securities noted that private banks mainly into corporate lending such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank will benefit given their superior provision levels.
For the March quarter, ICICI Bank’s PCR was 80.7% while that of Axis Bank was 77%.
“We believe large banks with a strong liability franchise and higher provision coverage are well-placed vis-à-vis others, and therefore should attract premium valuations,"" said analysts at Reliance Securities in a recent note.
Lenders that start with a high level of PCR may not need to make large incremental provisions towards stressed assets.
RBI’s report noted that public sector banks have seen the sharpest improvement in PCR. On aggregate level, public sector lenders saw their PCR rise to 60.6% in March from 48.3% a year ago. The PCR for private banks was lower at 57%.
As for provisions, analysts believe that lenders are likely to increase provisions to beef up the PCR and deal with the fresh stress seen in Q1."

Last November, at the company’s Future Decoded event in London, Microsoft chief executive officer (CEO) Satya Nadella insisted that every organization should embrace “tech intensity"" to be successful in today’s digital age, which means companies should not only be fast-adopters of technology but also build their own digital capabilities.
Anant Maheshwari, president of Microsoft India, echoes Nadella’s thinking. “If you consider tech intensity, every company on the planet is becoming a tech and a software company,"" he said in a recent interview in Bengaluru.
According to him, it’s the infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) in applications—and adoption of advanced analytics using AI and Internet of Things (IoT) devices—that are helping the move from a mobile-first, cloud-first world to a new world that is going to be “made up of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge"", he adds.
For instance, Microsoft partnered with ICICI Lombard to develop India’s first AI-enabled car inspection feature in its mobile app Insure. Narayana Health uses Microsoft’s data analytics and AI in its healthcare business while Microsoft is helping Apollo Hospitals predict cardiovascular diseases with an AI-powered cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk score API, or application program interface.
Piramal Glass has deployed Microsoft’s Azure IoT platform to digitally transform its manufacturing operations. And Microsoft has also tied up with the International Crop Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (Icrisat) to leverage technologies such as AI, cloud machine learning, satellite imagery and advanced analytics to help farmers arrive at the best sowing date for crops, helping increase crop yields by 10-30%, according to Maheshwari.
Microsoft also uses AI to help people with disabilities. For instance, “Seeing A"" is an app designed for people with visual disabilities to help them describe people, text, currency, colour and objects. Microsoft Research has also developed an AI-powered Interactive Cane to aid people with visual impairment to navigate. “The whole multi-sense, multi-device capability is going to become an even bigger part of humanity as we go forward,"" insists Maheshwari.
Maheshwari acknowledges, though, as AI becomes mainstream, “organizations will require talent with skill sets that are very different from what exists now"".
This explains why Microsoft launched the AI Digital Labs in India last month in partnership with 10 higher educational institutions including BITS Pilani and the Indian School of Business, (ISB). As part of this three-year programme, Microsoft will support these institutions with infrastructure, curriculum and content, access to cloud and AI services as well as developer support.
According to Maheshwari, while security and privacy “get a lot talked about because of some recent incidents and also because of EU GDPR (general data protection rules), what’s emerging as a bigger conversation is transparency and compliance"".
Microsoft, he concludes, “has the potential to help businesses make use of AI without inadvertently discriminating against certain groups of people—it will help AI researchers catch more instances of unfairness"".
Microsoft in India also engages with both M12 (company’s venture arm) and Microsoft for startups. “M12 is three-year-old, and has already done 120 investments around the world—in the US, Europe and Israel, and it has now opened in India since the early part of this calendar year in the last six months,"" said Maheshwari.
Microsoft already has partnerships with unicorns like Flipkart, InMobi and Ola. The partnership with InMobi uses Microsoft’s Azure platform, which helped “their (InMobi’s) ability to create a full marketing cloud for the CMO (chief marketing officer), creating a data cloud for the CMO and the CIO and thinking through customers in a very big way"", said Maheshwari.
Microsoft in India will continue to use emerging technologies to help in the digital transformation of traditional enterprises, government and public services, and the entire startup and unicorn ecosystem. “We are still in the zone of empowering all these three types of ecosystems rather than trying to be one of them,"" he added.

199,2019-07-20,ICICI,"If you are an existing home loan borrower, a cut of 5-10 bps on MCLR will not bring down your home loan interest rate immediatelyIf you are about to take a floating rate home loan, you are set to get relief. Banks have cut interest rate marginally

MUMBAI :
Recently, State Bank of India (SBI) cut its one-year marginal cost of fund-based lending rate (MCLR) by 5 basis points (bps) to 8.40%. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. This month, banks including ICICI Bank Ltd, Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce, have cut their MCLR by 5-10 bps. The move comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut policy rate for the third time in June. Here is what it means for you:
HOME LOAN RATES WILL NOT FALL IMMEDIATELY
If you are an existing home loan borrower, a cut of 5-10 bps on MCLR will not bring down your home loan interest rate immediately. If you have a floating rate home loan and your loan is linked your MCLR, you will have a reset clause linked to the tenure of the MCLR. For instance, if your loan is linked to one-year MCLR, you will have a one-year reset clause. Now, if the reset clause is in May and the MCLR cut happened in July, your home loan will not change till next May. If your loan has a reset clause of July or August, you will see a fall in your home loan rate. Also, your equated monthly instalment (EMI) will not go down as banks usually adjust the tenure of the loan instead of the EMI.
SOME RELIEF FOR NEW BORROWERS
If you are about to take a floating rate home loan, you are set to get relief. Banks have cut interest rate marginally. Considering that it is a falling interest rate environment, you will get a better interest rate than the last couple of months. However, it is difficult to predict whether you should wait and watch for another rate cut before taking a loan. New borrowers should instead compare home loan rates across financial institutions before taking a loan. Usually, home loans come with a spread on MCLR. Try opting for loans that are on MCLR without spread.
OPT FOR ALTERNATIVE FLOATING RATE OPTION
You now also have the option to go for loans linked to repo rate or other external benchmark rates instead of MCLR for floating rate loans. For instance, SBI this month launched a floating rate linked to the repo rate. The rate has a margin and a spread making it 10bps cheaper than MCLR. In these loans, your interest rate will fluctuate in case of any change in repo rate. In the case of MCLR, the impact of change in repo rate comes with a lag considering the banks also have to evaluate their cost of funds.
AVOID FIXED RATE HOME LOANS
In the current interest rate environment, you should avoid opting for fixed-rate loans. Fixed rate home loans are usually fixed for a certain duration of the loan. Considering that the interest rate is falling, it is possible that you may get locked into a higher interest rate for your home loan and getting out of it will be expensive since you have to pay a higher penalty to switch loans from fixed to floating."
198,2019-07-20,ICICI,"For most part of the week, the India volatility index was downIn the week ahead, the market's mood will depend largely on earnings performance of HUL, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors and L&T

With many large events including the general elections and the Union Budget out of the market's way, the Nifty has been in a consolidation mode. With that, fear gauge the NSE India volatility index (VIX) also cooled down from its recent highs.
For most part of the week, the India VIX was down. And this complacency coincided with the slew of unimpressive macro-economic data. These included inflation, industrial production, trade data and purchase managers' index monthly survey. But as the week ended, the market started coming to terms with poor macro data, mixed earnings and subdued global cues. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman not providing any relief to foreign portfolio investors on the proposed surcharge also soured sentiment.
As a result, the Nifty shed 1.15% in this week and India VIX rose 4.31%. That said, on a calendar year-to-date basis, the India VIX is down 21.78%.
In the week ahead, the market's mood will depend largely on earnings performance of index heavy weights such as Hindustan Unilever Ltd, ICICI Bank, Tata Motors and Larsen & Toubro. Asian Paints, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Auto are some other blue-chips that will announce their June quarter earnings in the coming week. In the wake of ongoing consumption slowdown, commentary by consumer-focused companies on demand will be closely watched by investors.
Apart from earnings, progress of monsoon will also be closely tracked.
Globally, besides the US-China trade negotiations, expectations of deeper interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve are among the key cues. Investors will also monitor situation in the Middle East, after President Trump said a US Navy ship destroyed an Iranian drone in a defensive action in the Strait of Hormuz.
It should be noted that Nifty futures and options contract for the July series expires in the coming week. And the aforementioned factors are likely to keep volatility in Indian equities high."

New Delhi: Private insurance companies received a premium of around  ₹46 crore in the last two years from railway and its passengers while making a payout of only  ₹seven crore in claims under the national transporter's travel insurance scheme, an RTI has found.
IRCTC, which is a wholly owned undertaking of the Ministry of Railways, has entered into an agreement with three private insurance companies through limited tender - Shriram General Insurance Company Ltd, ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd and Royal Sundaram General Insurance Company Ltd for its Optional Travel Insurance Scheme which was launched in September 2016 with a premium of  ₹0.92 per passenger.
This facility is for confirmed/RAC railway passengers who booked e-ticket through the official website of Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC).
Under the scheme, a sum assured is paid to the victim/family or legal heir of the victim as the case may be in case of death/injury of reserved passengers due to train accident/untoward incidents.
While the national transporter bore the insurance premium till August 31, 2018, the cost was transferred to passengers since and the premium was revised to  ₹0.49 per passenger in October 2018.
According to the RTI reply received by Madhya Pradesh-based social activist, Chandra Shekhar Gaur, while IRCTC has paid  ₹38.89 crore to insurance companies, passengers have so far paid  ₹7.29 crore in the past two years.
The travel insurance provides a coverage of  ₹10 lakh for death and permanent total disability arising out of any train accident or other untoward incident. For permanent partial disability you get  ₹7.5 lakh. The  ₹2 lakh coverage for hospitalization expenses for injury is over and above the death or disability coverage.
Acts like accident, robbery, dacoity and other violent acts during the train journey are covered by the policy.
Insurance companies received 206 claims in the two years, while 72 were rejected.
Officials, when contacted, said claims were less in the last two years as the number of rail accidents had dipped significantly. Railway accidents have decreased from 118 in 2013-14 to 104 in 2016-17, to 73 in 2017-18 and further to 59 in 2018-19.
Railways are also carrying more passengers - there is an increase of 2.09% in the number of passengers carried by the Indian Railways during 2017-18 as compared to 2016-17 and 0.64 per cent increase in 2018-19 as compared to 2017-18."

Mumbai: The Indian equity markets are expected to be wobbly amidst weak global peers. Asia stocks eased on Monday as investors reduced expectations of an aggressive interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, while heightened Middle East tensions following an Iranian seizure of a British tanker lifted crude oil prices.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.1%. South Korea's KOSPI shed 0.3%, Australian stocks lost 0.2% and Japan's Nikkei fell 0.5%.
Global equity markets had risen briefly towards the end of last week after dovish comments by New York Fed President John Williams boosted the prospect of the central bank lowering rates by 50 basis points at its 30-31 July meeting.
But the stock markets gave back those gains on Friday, with Wall Street shares ending in negative territory, after the New York Fed walked back Williams’ comments by saying his speech was not about potential policy action at the upcoming Fed meeting.
Expectations for a 50 basis points cut were scaled back further after the Wall Street Journal reported the Fed was likely to cut rates by 25 bps when it meets later this month, and may make further cuts in the future given global growth and trade uncertainties.
Back home, key companies which will announce their June quarter results on Monday are Kotak Mahindra Bank, United Spirits, Dewan Housing Finance Corporation (DHFL), Oriental Bank of Commerce, TVS Motor Company, ICICI Securities, Just Dial, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals and Mastek.
Shares of Reliance Industries (RIL)and HDFC Bank are likely to be in focus on Monday after they announced their June quarter earnings after markets closed for trading last week. Reliance Industries Ltd on Friday reported a 6.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) increase in net profit for the June quarter, beating Street estimates on the back of strong performances by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Reliance Retail. RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to $8.1 a barrel—an 18-quarter-low for the company.
HDFC Bank Ltd on Saturday said its first quarter net profit rose 21% on account of higher provisions and other income. Asset quality deteriorated marginally as gross non-performing assets (NPAs), as a percentage of total advances, rose to 1.4% in the June quarter compared to 1.33% in the year-ago period.
Meanwhile, the dollar and US Treasury yields rose on the greater likelihood of a shallower 25 bps rate cut.
The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 97.152 after rising 0.4% on Friday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield stretched Friday’s rise and climbed to 2.058%.
The greenback was nearly flat at 107.830 yen after adding 0.4% on Friday thanks to the rise in US yields. The euro was little changed at $1.1218 after shedding 0.5% on Friday.
In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 1.26% at $63.26 per barrel following a gain of about 0.9% on Friday. Crude was buoyant after Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on Friday captured a British-flagged oil tanker in the Gulf after Britain seized an Iranian vessel earlier this month, further raising tensions along a vital international oil shipping route.
Gold slipped from a six-year high as the dollar firmed and as expectations for a deep rate cut by the Fed were dialed back.
Spot gold traded at $1,425.82 an ounce after going as high as $1,452.60 on Friday, its strongest since May 2013.

Mumbai: Buying cheap stocks isn’t rewarding as some bargains may be too good to be true, according to a unit of India’s second-largest private bank.
There’s a very low probability for a stock to reclaim its previous high if it has slumped more than 75% from its peak, analysts led by Vinod Karki at ICICI Securities Ltd. wrote in a note. Only eight of the 228 stocks, which fell more than 75% over a two-year period since 2010, have been able to reach their previous high, the report said.
“The key reason for this behavior is the adjustment to the new reality after original beliefs of the attractiveness of the business model and prospects are shaken, resulting in permanent de-rating of stocks,"" the analysts wrote.
While India’s frontline indexes have posted modest declines from their recent peaks, thanks to gains in only a handful of stocks, the broader market has seen a meltdown in companies with risky debt and poor corporate governance policies. About a third of the S&P BSE 500 Index members have slid at least 50% from their two-year peak, while 41 stocks have seen their market value erode by more than 75%, according to ICICI Securities.

The tilt in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd’s business mix towards protection from savings may have helped the company report an improvement in profit metrics, pushing its shares 4.8% higher over two trading days.
But its overall annual premium equivalent (APE), an insurance term for annual premiums, has been sluggish. In the June quarter, overall APE rose a modest 5.3% year-on-year, implying slower growth and changing business dynamics.
Here, the protection segment clocked faster growth rates. It surged 88% year-on-year (y-o-y), which led to an increase in APE.
A positive of the improved protection business is the impact it has had on new business margin, leading to an improvement of about 350 basis points y-o-y.
A negative has been the de-growth in annual premium from its savings business. This witnessed a de-growth of about 2.1% y-o-y.
Within this, ULIPs saw a higher de-growth of about 6% y-o-y in the June quarter. ULIPs are unit-linked insurance plans and much of the growth in this segment depends on market conditions.
But slower ULIP growth shows up in persistency ratios, which is a measure of policy renewal rates. The 13-month persistency was down by about 20 basis points in the first quarter. “High net worth individual customers tend to use ULIP products to take views on asset markets and the general sluggishness and dislocations in fixed income markets have made such customers risk-averse, in our view, marginally impacting persistency in the 13th month cohort,"" said brokerage Nirmal Bang Securities Private Ltd.
Operating expenses increased 8.5% y-o-y. That’s a key metric to watch going forward. Besides, higher operating expenses have meant that the company has seen a slower net profit growth of a mere 1.2% y-o-y.
Going forward, market conditions need to be watched. Additional pressures on its savings business could even impact returns on savings products if the market weakens. Besides, it also remains to be seen how much IPruLife manages to grow its annual premium equivalent.
For now, though the firm has managed to increase its value of the new business, lower annual premium growth is not comforting."

Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect core earnings trajectory to remain strong at 15% year-on-year (y-o-y), led by healthy loan growth of 15% y-o-y and better net interest income (NII) growth at 19% y-o-y.

“We expect reduction in gross non-performing loan on the back of write-offs. Credit costs will decline quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) led by lower slippages (primarily from agriculture). Below investment grade portfolio would decline and coverage ratio would improve sequentially,"" said a report by Kotak Institutional Equities.
Meanwhile, analysts at Reliance Securities believe that market share gains by ICICI Bank will continue to aid growth in the corporate loan portfolio and driven by an increasing share of retail loans, margins are expected to increase.

The strength of a stock is determined by how clear investors are on the outlook of the company.
ICICI Bank gets top marks on this as the lender not only reported improved asset quality but its management also gave a clear outlook.
The private lender swung to profit in the June quarter because it didn’t need to make big provisions as bad loans fell and core income improved.
The management in a call with media on Saturday categorically said there was no loan growth target but an intention to price risk appropriately. In other words, the lender won’t bind itself to a number on loan growth but will shop for the best borrower to serve.
This sounds logical as ICICI Bank was the hardest hit among private lenders from the sharp rise in toxic loans over the last three years. It has learnt its lesson as around 88% of its loans to companies in June quarter was made to firms rated A- and above.
For the June quarter, the bank saw its gross bad loan ratios decline and even incremental stress reduce through a fall in slippages. Its watchlist of stressed loans or those rated BB and below have also declined to  ₹15,355 crore from  ₹17,525 crore in the previous quarter.
The bank has guided that credit costs may not worsen from hereon and the pace of slippage will be contained. Moreover, it has chosen to beef up its provisions to guard against risk with coverage ratio at over 70% now.
Given the upbeat guidance from the management, analysts believe, the stock could return to favour. “ICICI remains our top Buy with a major OW (overweight) position in our sector EAP given its clear focus on portfolio quality and profitability versus growth, which should lead to better return ratios and a re-rating of stock,"" said brokerage firm Emkay Global in a note.

The strength of a stock is determined by how clear investors are on the outlook of the company to which it belongs.
ICICI Bank Ltd gets top marks on this as the lender not only reported improvement in asset quality, but also gave a clear outlook.
The private sector lender swung to profit in the June quarter because it didn’t need to make big provisions as the toxic level of its loan book reduced and core income improved.
The stock gained more than 3% on Monday as a reward from investors to an all-round improvement in asset quality metrics in the June quarter. The lender also beefed up its provision coverage ratio.
That means, ICICI Bank is safe even if stress increases or recoveries from bankruptcy proceedings disappoint.
The private sector lender has guided that credit costs may not worsen from here on and the pace of slippage would be contained. Slippages for the June quarter were down over 30% from the year-ago period.
Brokerage firm Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd noted that the lender does not have significant exposure to troubled Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd and the Essel Group.
ICICI Bank is firmly on the mend, but that doesn’t mean it is willing to chase growth.
As far as the outlook goes, the lender doesn’t sound dire, but there is enough caution laid out by the management.
Considering that the commentary from a handful of private sector firms has been tepid, it is obvious that lenders to them are on guard now.
Ergo, ICICI Bank’s message that it would serve only good borrowers and not run after loan growth came across as prudent to investors.
The management in a call on Saturday said that it won’t bind itself to a loan growth target but would rather price risk appropriately. Executives at its peer Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd too had cited a similar intention a week back.
What this means is that a sharp pickup in growth cannot be expected from ICICI Bank. Loan growth in the June quarter was 18%, while that of the banking industry was 12%.
With the 3% gain on Monday, the ICICI Bank stock trades at a modest multiple of more than two times its estimated book value for FY21. That is cheaper than the over 3.3 times of HDFC Bank Ltd and more than 5 times for Kotak Mahindra Bank."

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Monday that the government plans to take policy measures “fairly quickly"" to address the challenges plaguing the industry. She said also that the government is open to hearing out the grievances of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs).
The minister was speaking to reporters after meeting chief executives of private and state-run banks as she kicked off a series of meetings planned with various industry heads. She met the heads of State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Punjab National Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank among others. The meeting also discussed the credit requirements of non-bank lenders, automobile industry and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), and the transmission of interest rate cuts to the economy.
“Behind the series of meetings is to hear them out and fairly quickly after that come out with something that will help those sectors...We are getting inputs from various sectors and trying to respond so that the confidence of those sectors is being restored,"" Sitharaman said.
Over the next few days, the minister will meet representatives from several sectors —FPIs, automakers, industry associations, financial markets, MSMEs, industry associations and real estate to listen to their challenges. This is the first time the finance minister is meeting top executives in the second term of the National Democratic Alliance government, in a way acknowledging the ongoing economic slowdown and the government’s willingness to take inputs from businesses.
Sitharaman said the economic affairs secretary will soon hold talks with FPIs on their problems. There has been a massive outflow of overseas funds following the Union budget announcement to impose higher surcharge on some of these investors.
Bankers who attended the meeting sought the government’s intervention on tax notices asking lenders to pay service tax and Goods and Services Tax (GST) on minimum balance accounts. Banks will soon respond to the notices, Sitharaman said, adding Jan Dhan accounts and basic deposit and savings accounts do not attract any charges.
On the decision to borrow overseas in foreign currency, Sitharaman said she will not speculate on the number of tranches and the finance ministry has done nothing in this regard, besides the announcement in the budget, owing to commitments in the ongoing Parliament session.
During the March quarter, India’s economy grew at 5.8%, the slowest in five years. Growth in 2018-19 was 6.8%, down from 7.2% a year ago. Besides the slowdown in fresh private investments, subdued demand and stress at non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are affecting growth.
In signs of a persistent slowdown, India’s automobile makers are finding it hard to sell vehicles, and NBFCs and MSMEs are struggling to access credit.
Overall credit growth continues to be at 12%, which is marginally lower than 13.3% at the end of March, the finance ministry said in a statement after the meeting.
“At the same time, with turnaround in the NPA cycle, high provision cover of over 75%, and record recovery, banks’ balance sheet are healthier than before. Banks are now, therefore, in position to step up lending,"" said a finance ministry statement.
MoS for finance Anurag Thakur, finance secretary Rajiv Kumar, economic affairs secretary Atanu Chakraborty, expenditure secretary G.C. Murmu, revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey, RBI deputy governor NS Vishawanathan, were among those who attended the meeting."

176,2019-08-09,ICICI,"The Roys were stopped from flying out based on a 'fake and wholly unsubstantiated corruption case', said a statement from the companyCBI officials in New Delhi said a 'preventive' LOC was issued against the duo in June in connection with an alleged fraud in relation to ICICI Bank

Mumbai: News television network NDTV's founders Prannoy Roy and his wife Radhika, facing an alleged corruption case, were prevented from flying abroad on Friday on the basis of a ""preventive"" lookout circular (LOC) issued by the CBI.
In a statement, the media company said Roy and his wife were stopped from travelling abroad on the basis of ""a fake and wholly unsubstantiated corruption case initiated by the CBI"" two years ago.
Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials in New Delhi said a ""preventive"" LOC was issued against the duo in June in connection with an alleged fraud in relation to ICICI Bank.
They were stopped from leaving the country on the basis of the LOC, they added.
A preventive LOC is aimed at stopping a person from leaving the country but does not warrant detention by authorities.
The said LOC was only to prevent the duo from leaving the country, not to detain them, the officials said.
Roy and his wife were on their way to an undisclosed destination and were scheduled to return on 16 August, NDTV said.
""Today's action is, along with events like raids on media owners, a warning to the media to fall in line- or else,"" the company said, hinting at intimidation.
This was ""a complete subversion of basic rights"", it added.
The statement also described the two founders of the media network as ""journalists"" but did not specify the reasons for their travel.
The action comes months after Naresh Goyal, the promoter of bankrupt carrier Jet Airways, was stopped from flying abroad from the city airport after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money-laundering case against him.
The development comes more than two years after the premises of the Roys were searched by the CBI in connection with the alleged bank fraud case.
After lodging an FIR on June 2, 2017, the CBI, in a statement, had said it was not probing loan default but alleged violations of Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rules, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) guidelines and reduction in the rate of interest by ICICI Bank, which caused a loss of  ₹48 crore to it.
The case pertained to a loan, which was already re-paid by NDTV in 2009, and there was no complaint from the bank, the company had said.
The news network, which is credited with pioneering television news in the country, had then called the action a ""witch hunt"".
""We will not succumb to these attempts to blatantly undermine democracy and free speech,"" NDTV had said in a statement then.
The Editors Guild of India had also expressed its concern in the matter.
The CBI had registered an FIR on the basis of a complaint filed by a shareholder of NDTV and ICICI Bank.
The central agency's move to proceed against NDTV without conducting a preliminary enquiry was criticised by the media fraternity as an attempt to muzzle the press.
The agency got its powers to register cases against private banks after the Supreme Court order in the Global Trust Bank case in 2016, which said executives of private banks were covered under the Prevention of Corruption Act, the CBI had said.

167,2019-08-19,ICICI,"The bank has scrapped grades of employees above AGM rank, retaining grades only for executive directors and MDThe private sector lender has also allowed 500 employees access to its executive dining room, which was earlier open only to the top tier of the management

MUMBAI :
Employees at ICICI Bank Ltd are in the midst of a cultural shift as the bank adopts open office structures, abolishes grades and imparts skills to employees to adapt to sales jobs that would need human intervention amid automation and digitization.
The changes in office space structure, include the group leader sitting alongside the team instead of a cabin; and access of a larger section of employees to its management dining room and changes in the way certain benefits are handed out. Interestingly, the bank saw a change in top leadership in October with Sandeep Bakhshi taking over as chief executive.
Under the new structure, office floors will have a few conference rooms for use by employees but will not have enclosed cabins earmarked for team leaders. The bank is renovating its head office in Mumbai’s Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) to allow the seating makeover. This will also be the new design for all its new offices.
“We are certainly removing hierarchy within the organization. The objective is to become flexible and agile so that we significantly improve the speed at which we are able to respond to the marketplace. We have done so through a combination of structural changes and through the abolition of symbols associated with grades,"" said T.K. Srirang, group chief human resources officer, ICICI Bank.
The bank has scrapped grades of employees above the assistant general manager (AGM) rank, retaining grades only for executive directors and the managing director. This affects around 500 employees who are now identified by their roles (like segment heads) and are clubbed together as the leadership team. For instance, in the erstwhile setup, a designation would be prefixed by the grade, which has been removed.
A general manager and head of retail (west) will now just be called head of retail (west) on his visiting card. As on 31 March, the bank had 86,763 employees.
The private sector lender has also allowed 500 employees access to its executive dining room, which was earlier open only to the top tier of the management.
“Our executive dining room where only the top management was allowed earlier is now open to our entire leadership team. In today’s agile world, the time has come for the entire senior management to connect on a regular basis and it provides a good platform,"" Srirang said.
Another change has to do with how a person’s grade could be guessed from the office car allotted. Employees can now opt for a cash payout instead.
“Symbols like difference in cars, size of the cabin, which were manifestation of certain grade-led benefits, are no longer present. So, we have done away with those benefits and cashed out some others,"" he added.
That apart, Srirang said, the new structure allows the bank to appoint the most suitable person to a particular role, not necessarily driven by the grade of the person. “For instance, say a zonal head of our bank in a particular region was at the erstwhile level of deputy general manager (DGM). Now, if I have a chief manager (junior to DGM) who is brilliant and could be appointed there, I can move the person swiftly. Earlier, the bureaucracy of the grade structure would have prevented me because that level was associated with a DGM,"" said Srirang.
Veinu Nehru Dutta, director (financial services), ABC Consultants, said all new firms, whether it is the fintechs or the new non-banks, are bringing in an open office culture. While grades are yet to go off completely because designations still matter in India, the open office culture is picking up, she said."

Indian market indices Sensex and Nifty fell sharply today amid a broad-based decline. Outflows from Indian markets, rupee’s tumble and weak global markets hurt the sentiment. The rupee today tumbled to its lowest this year against the US dollar. The Sensex fell 587 points lower at 36,472 while Nifty settled 1.7% lower at 10,736. Among other Sensex stocks, Vedanta slumped 8%, Bajaj Finance 4.5%, Tata Motors 4%, ONGC 3.5% and Hero MotoCorp 3.2%. Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets:
1) “Markets plunged sharply lower and lost over one and a half percent, in continuation to prevailing corrective phase. The recent fall is a result of growing uneasiness among the participants as they are keenly awaiting some action from the government to boost the market sentiment. Besides, feeble global cues are further adding to the negativity,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking.
2) “Nifty has now reached closer to its immediate and critical support of 10,750 so we may see some consolidation or pause ahead. We suggest continuing with “sell on rise"" approach and focusing more on stock selection now,"" he added.
3) Among the Sensex stocks, Yes Bank shares slumped 14%, extending their decline to the fourth day.
4) In financials, SBI, ICICI Bank, HDFC, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank fell between 2% and 3%.
5) DLF Ltd, India’s largest real estate developer by market value, fell 16% today after Supreme Court issued notice on non-disclosure of key information on QIP.
6) Other real-estate stocks Indiabulls Real Estate fell 7% while Oberoi Realty declined 5.6%. The Nifty real estate slumped 6.7%.
7) Global markets mostly struggled today. The minutes of the Fed's July meeting, released on Wednesday, showed policymakers deeply divided over rate cuts, while hopes for a fiscal stimulus dimmed as President Donald Trump said he was not looking at cutting payroll taxes.
8) The rupee today weakened to its year’s lowest falling to near 72 a US dollar.
9) Broad gains in US dollar and continued outflows from Indian equity markets over last two months have hurt the rupee.
10)	Foreign institutional investors have withdrawn over $3 billion from Indian markets since the government hiked tax on super-rich in the July Budget."
165,2019-08-22,ICICI,"Single-digit revenue growth underscores weak execution, in spite of a decent order bookNegative operating leverage dents Ebitda margins, which contracted year-on-year

Since early July, when companies started announcing their June quarter results, the BSE Capital Goods index has fallen 17.01%. This is far steeper than the 7.42% drop in the benchmark BSE 500 index and some of the other sectoral indices.
What disappointed the Street was the drop in revenue growth and profitability during the quarter.
The mere single-digit growth in revenue was mainly on account of slow progress in execution of projects. A report by ICICI Securities Ltd shows that revenues of 15 companies under its coverage grew by a paltry 5.5% year-on-year. Excluding the largest capital goods conglomerate, Larsen and Toubro Ltd, revenue growth was flattish at 0.3%.
On the whole, the performance was checkered. Companies with short-cycle orders in food processing or automation in sectors such as cement fared better than those with large projects in the power sector. For instance, in spite of its huge order book of  ₹1 trillion, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd’s revenue contracted by 24% year-on-year on account of land-acquisition issues in some of its projects. On the other hand, Thermax Ltd beat the Street’s forecast with a revenue growth of 35% year-on-year, while Cummins India Ltd with multinational parentage posted a tepid 1% growth.
Weak revenue mars profit expansion, simply because fixed costs weigh on margins. Although raw material costs did not soar in absolute terms, weak capacity utilization and operating leverage impacted profitability in the June quarter. The same was true for employee costs as well.
Not surprisingly, therefore, Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) growth was below forecasts for most companies. Ebitda margin contracted year-on-year in most cases by 100-400 basis points, with a handful showing marginal growth.
Meanwhile, the slowdown in the economy is getting worrisome. There has been no increase in new orders after the general election. Even so, there is some hope that the government outlay towards infrastructure will offset the weakness in private sector capital expenditure (capex). While some companies bagged overseas orders, with the turmoil in global markets increasing, these too may be at risk.
On the home ground, a series of interest rate cuts has failed to kickstart investment in consumption and capex. According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, “Liquidity continues to be low and may impact execution in case the problem persists. Working capital towards execution increased, as companies opted to support their vendors in a tight liquidity scenario.""
Little wonder then that the shares of capital goods firms, which rose in early 2019, have shed all the gains in the last two months. Even so, most companies trade at rich valuations between 15 and even 40 times estimated FY20 earnings. Things will improve only with a broad-based improvement in consumption and investment cycle."
164,2019-08-24,ICICI,"Financial planners suggest continuing with your investmentsYour mutual fund SIP investments should continue as you are getting more units for the same money

MUMBAI :
The economic indicators are signalling a prolonged slowdown in the economy. The unemployment rate in India is at 6.1%, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO). The liquidity crunch, NBFC crises and credit downgrades in the financial services sector have spurred some serious downturn in consumption. “There are evidences of a serious slowdown in consumption as reflected in sales of automobiles, FMCG, air travel, textiles and other discretionary products amid patchy monsoon,"" said Navneet Munot, chief investment officer, SBI Funds Management Pvt. Ltd.
The sale of passenger vehicles declined 21.56% in April-july 2019 from the same period last year, according to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). Credit-rating agencies have projected a negative outlook for the overall growth rate in India.
Global factors have also played a huge role. “The dollar has been so strong meaning that the money flowing into emerging markets will slow down,"" said Manish Gunwani, Cioequity investments, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd.
Two things that have been hit hard are industries and investment, said Sujan Hajra, chief economist and executive director, Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers. In this time, analysts and financial planners suggest continuing with your investments. “The long-term structural growth story looks intact. However, the near-term outlook does not look favourable because of which we are seeing some volatility and outflow from the market,"" said Swarup Mohanty, chief executive officer, Mirae Asset Global Investments.
It is an opportune time for equity investors to accumulate. “Markets being low translate to an appropriate time to accumulate your equity investments to record strong returns. Your SIP investments should continue as you are getting more units for the same money,"" he said. With lump sum investments too, you are getting more value for your money during this time. It is not a bad time for new investors to enter either. “You should stick to asset allocation. A new investor can maintain 65:35 ratio between large- and mid-cap investments for equity investments,"" said Mohanty.
The large-cap investments can take care of the stability, while the mid-cap investment can take one or two kicks to the returns of your overall portfolio. However, you should consult with your financial planner or financial advisor before investing.
When it comes to the debt markets, there has been a significant rally and the money market yields have gone down. The 10-year government bond yield has fallen 11.02% since January and 6.3% since June according to data retrieved from the Bloomberg Terminal. “That is what happens. In a low inflationary environment and low growth period, debt funds investments do well. The reason is people want to move to safe investments and the demand for bonds pushes the prices up, leading to capital gains for debt fund investors,"" said Hajra.
He further said that it cannot be ruled out that the 10-year bond yield can breach 6% and the yield curve will go down."

7) ""Nifty has immediate hurdle near 11,100-11,180 zone. Any decisive break above 11,180 can push index towards 11,350 zone in near term and support for index is coming near 11,000-10,930 zone,"" says Rohit Singre, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities.

162,2019-08-26,ICICI,"Growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio more stable and increased marginsThe growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio of life insurers more stable and increased margins

Selling life insurance has never been easy, but getting investors to buy their stocks is becoming all too easy for life insurers. A booming business and a growing market share have led to big gains for the three listed life insurance companies in India.
Shares of HDFC Life Insurance Co. Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd have surged 33.59% and 37.37%, respectively, so far this year. Even ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd hasn’t fared badly, with returns of 19.14%, although its growth in the past two quarters has been wanting. In comparison, the Nifty Financial Services index has risen about 4.27% in 2019.
There are several factors that seem to have worked for life insurance companies. But, Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd highlighted the main reason.
“Private insurers (excluding ICICI Prudential Life) continue to deliver robust growth in spite of volatile markets; this, coupled with increasing protection share in the business mix, justifies the re-rating in the last four months, in our view,"" it said in a note to clients.
In the first four months of FY20, private sector insurers saw 23% new business growth in retail, in terms of annualized premium equivalent, even as the overall industry growth was 15%, primarily due to Life Insurance Corporation of India’s (LIC’s) 5.5% growth.
This growth was led by non-participatory and annuity products.
Aggressive marketing of term plans in the past two years has helped HDFC Life and even its peers corner market share from the country’s largest life insurer, LIC.
“Shrinking profitability of linked business has made it a mere revenue driver, edging players to move towards non-linked products (protection, annuities and return-guarantee) for profitability,"" said Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note.
The growth in retail insurance sales of non-participatory products has made the portfolio of life insurers more stable and increased margins.
Life insurance stocks are likely to continue to enjoy investor attention over the next few quarters, too, though analysts warned that the profitability metrics may have peaked for some firms."

BENGALURU :
Embassy Buildcon LLP, the holding company of WeWork India, is pledging its shares in the co-working firm for a  ₹200 crore financing facility from ICICI Bank Ltd, according to a filing with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).
As per the pledge agreement, Embassy Buildcon has agreed to pledge its shares in WeWork India Management Pvt. Ltd, representing 26% of the paid-up equity share capital of the latter, in favour of ICICI Bank.
The We Co., the American firm which operates co-working office spaces under the WeWork brand, posted robust revenue growth in India, even as it reels under massive losses globally, as per the company’s first public regulatory filing, Mint reported on 15 August.
Since its entry in India in 2016 through a partnership with Bengaluru-based real estate firm Embassy Group, WeWork has been aggressively expanding its footprint. At present, it has 23 co-working centres—nine each in Bengaluru and Mumbai, and another five in Gurugram—adding up to 39,000 seats.
A WeWork India spokesperson declined to comment.
“The WeWork spaces, globally, require far greater investment than typical co-working spaces. But, only in India, do WeWork’s local partners have to bear the entire cost of setting up and operating the WeWork locations,"" said Vivek Durai, founder of business signals platform Paper.vc.
According to a report by Reuters, The We Co. is looking to raise $3-4 billion through an initial public offering (IPO), which is likely to be launched in September this year. New York-based We Co. posted net loss of around $689.7 million and revenue of $1.54 billion in the first six months of 2019.
Unlike other Asian markets such as China and Japan, The We Co. operates on a revenue and profit sharing model with its Indian partner.
“Arbitraging short-term leases with long-term debt is the only way co-working companies can get their centres up and running, if they want a large scale operation. This is a capital-hungry business and you need to invest big money. While occupancy rates in these spaces are in their 60-70% across India at the moment, there are headwinds coming their way, thanks to the global fears of a recession,"" said Juggy Marwaha, executive managing director, JLL India.
According to property consultant CBRE, leasing quantum of the co-working segment is expected to rise to 10 million sq. ft. by 2020 from 7.1 million sq. ft. in 2018."

NEW DELHI :
India’s youngest and only profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio is now also the number one operator by revenue market share with 31.7% share of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) that the industry recorded in the April-June period.
Airtel came a close second with 30% market share and Vodafone Idea Ltd was third with 28.1% share, data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India released on Tuesday and analysed by brokerage ICICI Securities showed.
“RJio AGR (including National Long Distance calls) rose 9% year on year to  ₹109 billion, and finally became the No. 1 operator,"" the brokerage said in a note dated 27 August.
Mint had on 31 July reported that Jio would be crowned as number one operator in terms of revenue in the June quarter.
With this, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has achieved a rare feat with his telecom company grabbing the top spot in the market in less than three years of starting operations.
Jio entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap data plans and affordable handsets, which led to an unprecedented rise in mobile data consumption in the country, with an average user consuming 11 GB data per month.
Bharti’s AGR (including National Long Distance calls) was at  ₹103 billion, up 5.9% from December quarter. Vodafone Idea’s AGR (including National Long Distance calls) stood at  ₹96 billion.
Last month, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers. According to data from TRAI released last month, Jio had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May.
While the telecom industry also witnessed intense disruption, shrinking revenue streams, bankruptcy and, finally, consolidation, the last three years have been monumental as 4G coverage soared and became a catalyst for the growth of mobile data and new applications and services, especially in the content ecosystem.
Jio’s present subscriber base is 331.3 million subscribers, according to its April-June financial results announced last month when it reported a profit of  ₹8.91 billion, up 45.6% year on year and an operating revenue of  ₹116.79 billion rupees, up 44% on year.
Despite more subscribers, Vodafone Idea, which posted revenue of  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter, lagged behind Reliance Jio’s  ₹11,679 crore.
“In eight leadership circles, Vodafone Idea’s AGR dipped 4.6% QoQ to  ₹45 billion and five established circles were down 7.3% QoQ to  ₹13.9 billion,"" the brokerage said."

Mumbai: Private sector lending major ICICI Bank has become the first in the country to deploy industrial 'Robotic Arms' to count millions of currency notes at its currency chests across the country, a top official said. These Robotic Arms are currently functioning at Mumbai, and Sangli (Maharashtra), New Delhi, Bengaluru and Mangaluru (Karnataka), Jaipur, Hyderabad, Chandigarh, Bhopal, Raipur, Siliguri and Varanasi, said ICICI Bank Head of Operations & Customer Services, Anubhuti Sanghai.
These 14 machines (Robotic Arms) deployed in 12 cities help sort over six million notes on all working days, or about 1.80 billion notes annually, she said.
""This brings in a frictionless and completely mechanised process of note-sorting, leading to higher accuracy and flexibility to handle large volumes continuously. It has enabled the bank personnel to focus on other value-added and supervisory functions,"" Sanghai pointed out.
She said ICICI is the first commercial bank in India and among a few banks globally to customise and deploy industrial robots to automate and perform repetitive high volume steps in handling cash processing on high-end note sorting machines.
""The Robotic Arms use a combination of sensors to check over 70 parameters within second that enable them operate continuously and seamlessly without break,"" Sanghai explained.
Pursuing the Clean Note Policy mandated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), banks operate currency chests which collect cash from various branches and other centres, sorts them on high-end note-sorting machines and re-send them to branches/ATMs for dispensing to customers.
The Robotic Arms feed on unprocessed cash in three high-end note-sorting machines simultaneously, pick up the processed cash from the output stackers, align the loose notes, bind the packets and finally drop them in the respective trays as per the quality of the note.
ICICI Bank plans to invest in further mechanisation of note sorting technology with next generation machines across all its currency chests and a slew of other technology-led innovative services.

155,2019-09-03,ICICI,"The PSU banking index on NSE fell 5%, with PNB shares slumping 9%Both BSE midcap and smallcap indices also fell sharply

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty fell sharply today while the rupee also suffered a big loss against the US dollar. At the day’s low, the Sensex fell over 850 points to 36,466 after data released last week showed GDP grew at its weakest pace in over six years as consumption demand weakened. A separate private sector survey indicated that expansion in the country's manufacturing sector hit its slowest in 15 months in August. The Sensex finished 2% lower at 36,562 - its biggest one-day fall since October last year - while Nifty settled 2% lower at 10,797.
Here are 10 updates from today’s stock markets:
1) The decline was led by banking stocks with the Nifty bank index falling 2.2%. Among financials, PNB fell 9%, ICICI Bank 4%, HDFC 4%, RBL 4% and Axis Bank 3%.
2) The PSU banking index on the NSE fell 5% after the government announced a series of mergers involving 10 such banks to boost the struggling sector and revive economic growth. Indian Bank, Canara Bank, Union Bank and Oriental Bank slumped between 10% and 12%.
""Market slid as deceleration in economic growth due to fall in consumption and subdued manufacturing activity diminished the scope for a turnaround in the near-term. The consolidation of PSU banks is a step in right direction however, they may take more time before earning benefits from synergy. Additionally, weak monthly auto sales and outflow from foreign investors added volatility to rupee,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.
3) Among auto stocks, Tata Motors, Bosch, Motherson Sumi and Eicher Motors fell between 3% and 4% after top automakers reported a slump in August sales over the weekend. Another market heavyweight Reliance Industries fell over 3%.
4) Many analysts have revised lower their growth estimates for the year after GDP growth decelerated sharply to 5% on the back of weakness in private consumption and investment. “With a deeper-than-estimated trough and lack of significant impetus to the growth drivers in the near term, we further revise down our FY20 GDP growth estimate by 50 bps to 5.8%,"" Kotak Securities said in a note.
The Nifty is down about 10% from its June highs. And market analysts remain cautious. Ajit Mishra, vice president for research at Religare Broking, said: ""In the near term, weak domestic sentiments and uncertain global cues may continue to have negative impact on the Indian markets. Hence, we continue to remain cautious until there are meaningful signs of revival in the economy. Further, falling rupee (vs US dollar) is a key concern which could negatively impact the sentiments. On global front, trade tension between US-China is likely to induce volatility across markets.""
5) The broader markets were also weak today with the BSE midcap and smallcap indices falling 1.6% and 1.3% respectively.
6) Shares of ONGC fell 3% today after a fire broke out in a storm water drainage network at the company's oil and gas processing plant in Uran, Navi Mumbai.
7) ONGC said there has been no impact on oil processing and gas from Bombay High has been diverted to its Hazira plant. Reliance Securities does not see a major impact of the fire incident at the Uran plant on ONGC gas sales in the second quarter of FY19. ""A fall in oil prices can impact earnings in FY20 while the target for disinvestment receipts has increased to  ₹1.05 lakh crore for FY20 from  ₹90,000 crore in the interim Budget. This is a key overhang on the stock as the government holds a 64.25% stake in ONGC,"" said Reliance Securities, which maintains a positive view on the stock.
8) The rupee slumped 100 paise to 72.40 against the US dollar today, as compared to the previous close of 71.40.
9) Indian markets continue to be hurt by selling pressure from foreign investors, which sold a net $2.3 billion worth of Indian stocks last month.
10) Asian markets ended mixed today while European equity markets struggled as investors waited to see if Chinese and American officials can schedule a planned meeting this month to continue trade talks."

NEW DELHI: :
India’s second largest private lender ICICI Bank has reduced its lending rates by 10 basis points (bps) across all tenors, a report by news agency PTI said on Wednesday.
The report said the lending rates have been cut under the marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR).
The one-year MCLR is the benchmark against which most retail loans such as home loan and auto loan are priced.
After the rate cut, which would be effective from 1 September, one-year MCLR will fall to 8.55% and the overnight MCLR will drop at 8.30%.
ICICI Bank had also cut its MCLR by 10 bps across all tenors in July this year.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Compared to ICICI Bank’s new lending rate, India’s largest private lender HDFC Bank's one-year MCLR stands at 8.60% and the third largest private sector lender Axis Bank’s one-year MCLR is at 8.55%.
Owing to higher net interest income (NII) and lower provisions, ICICI Bank had recorded a standalone net profit at  ₹1,908 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal, against a loss of  ₹120 crore in the same period last fiscal year.

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

“CDEL’s debt at the consolidated level is around  ₹4,400 crore. The sale of the Global Village Tech Park will bring down this debt to around  ₹2,000 crore, while a part of the proceeds from this sale will go to CDEL’s books towards working capital requirements,"" the person said.
On Saturday, CDEL hired IDFC Securities to advise on strategic options including the sale of its holding in Coffee Day Global Ltd, the unit that owns India’s largest coffee chain, as well as to advise on refinancing of the group’s debt.
On 5 September, Mint reported that the promoters and lenders of CDEL have shelved a plan to sell a controlling stake in Coffee Day Global after holding initial talks with potential suitors, including Coca-Cola and ITC Ltd. The promoter family may revisit the sale of the coffee business at a later date, the report said.
Mint reported on 30 July that Siddhartha was in talks to urgently refinance a large portion of his and his company’s outstanding debt. Tanglin Developments Ltd, a real estate subsidiary of CDEL, is closing its sale of the 90-acre Tech Park to New York-based buyout firm Blackstone Group Lp for  ₹2,800 crore. Alongside, CDEL is exploring other options to reduce the group’s debt after Siddhartha’s suspected suicide.
CDEL’s promoter stake has fallen substantially since 26 July. According to a series of filings by the company on exchanges, pledges on 26.47% of CDEL shares (pledged with debenture holders) have been invoked by debenture holders between 26 July and 30 August, leaving the promoter group of CDEL with only 27.46% in the company."

Mumbai: American private equity firm Warburg Pincus on Wednesday sold its remaining 2.7% stake in general insurer ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd, for  ₹1,378 crore (approximately $194.5 million).
According to data from stock exchanges, Red Bloom Investments, through which Warburg Pincus held the stake, sold its entire shareholding comprising of 1.22 crore shares for a price of  ₹1,122.27 apiece. ICICI Lombard’s shares closed the day at  ₹1,128.6 per share, down 4.15% on the BSE.
The stake sale marked a complete exit from the company for Warburg, which had invested in ICICI Lombard in 2017, ahead of the insurer’s initial public offering.
Warburg had acquired the 9% stake in ICICI Lombard from Fairfax Financial Corp. In May 2017, Fairfax sold a 12.18% stake in ICICI Lombard in a pre-IPO round to Warburg Pincus and other investors for around $383 million (around  ₹2,372.5 crore then). The share sale valued the insurance company at  ₹20,500 crore.
In September 2017, ICICI Lombard went public in an IPO that valued the company at  ₹30,000 crore and saw the company’s two sponsors, ICICI Bank Ltd and Fairfax, sell shares worth  ₹5,700 crore. The two had set up the insurance firm in 2001.
As on Wednesday, the company’s market capitalisation was worth  ₹51,285.4 crore.
Warburg started selling its ICICI Lombard stake last year, when in November it sold a 3.14% stake for  ₹1,062 crore. In June, the PE firm sold another 3.15% stake for around  ₹1,577 crore."

145,2019-09-12,ICICI,"A total fine of  ₹10 lakh has been imposed on ICICI Bank while Sandeep Batra has been fined  ₹2 lakhThe probe revealed that ICICI Bank failed to disclose the information regarding signing of the binding agreement to the stock exchanges in a timely manner

Capital markets regulator Sebi on Thursday levied a total fine of  ₹12 lakh on ICICI Bank Ltd and its compliance officer Sandeep Batra for disclosure lapses, including delayed disclosure of binding agreement signed with Bank of Rajasthan.
The regulator during an investigation found that a ""binding implementation agreement"" was signed between ICICI Bank and Bank of Rajasthan on May 18, 2010 in order to procure cooperation and support of dominant shareholders of Bank of Rajasthan to effect the proposal of its amalgamation with the private lender.
The probe revealed that ICICI Bank failed to disclose the information regarding signing of the binding agreement to the stock exchanges in a timely manner.
It was noted that the agreement was signed between the banks on May 18, 2010 at approximately 04:30 am but ICICI Bank made the disclosure to the exchanges at 08:10 pm, despite the fact that the agreement was entered into before opening of the stock markets.
Therefore, the lender delayed the disclosure by one trading day, Sebi said in an order.
The binding agreement was a proper formalised legal agreement and a crucial step to effect the amalgamation of Bank of Rajasthan with ICICI Bank. It also contained clauses regarding the swap ratio of shares and the draft scheme of amalgamation among other information, Sebi added.
Further, Sebi said that ""any information related to the amalgamation, mergers or takeovers of a listed company are deemed to be price sensitive information. Therefore, in the instant matter, the signing of the binding agreement is a price sensitive information.""
Such information was supposed to be disclosed to the stock exchanges ""on an immediate basis.""
""However, by withholding such disclosure for one full trading day, ICICI created a situation of information asymmetry wherein the general public was not aware of any such agreement,"" Sebi said.
By doing so, the lender has violated listing agreement norms as well as provisions of Prohibition of Insider Trading regulations.
Regarding Sandeep Batra, the regulator said that ""being the compliance officer of ICICI Bank and also being aware of the developments regarding the signing of the binding agreement, failed to ensure that ICICI Bank complies with the requirements of making immediate and continuous disclosures regarding binding agreement to the stock exchanges.""
Consequently, a total fine of  ₹10 lakh has been imposed on ICICI Bank while Sandeep Batra has been fined  ₹2 lakh."

Indian key benchmark indices, the Nifty and the Sensex, opened in the red on Thursday and traded on a weak note.
What explains this muted reaction? According to analysts, an interest rate cut with little concern about the outlook has left the market dissatisfied. In the current backdrop of global slowdown, there are heightened expectations of further easing.
According to analysts at the research arm of ICICI Bank, from a market’s perspective, the recent action could be described as a ‘hawkish cut’, given that there were references that the recent easing remained more of an ‘insurance’ than a full-fledged easing cycle.
""We are maintaining our call of another 25 bps cut in 2019 and possibly more accommodation over 2020 if external headwinds remain in place, but acknowledge that the bar for easing is a lot higher than previously anticipated,"" it said in a report on 19 September.
The CME Group's FedWatch tool also showed that after the Fed's latest policy action, expectations of another 25 bps interest rate cut rose from 21% to 45%.
In short, the Fed is largely optimistic about the US growth outlook and its decision to trim rates was based on external factors — weakness in exports and investments due to the ongoing trade war. So further policy action will depend on how well or badly the October meeting between the US-China pans out."
140,2019-09-19,ICICI,"Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank have the largest direct exposure to commercial real estateOther banks like ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also have significant exposure to the sector

Mumbai: Rating agency Moody's on Thursday said real estate financier Altico Capital India Ltd's default is credit negative for banks with significant exposure to real estate sector. The default signals increasing tight liquidity among property developers, said the agency.
Moody's also said banks such as Yes bank and Indusind Bank which have the largest direct exposure to commercial real estate would be susceptible to asset quality difficulties if the real estate sector continues to slow. Other banks like ICICI Bank and Axis bank also have significant exposure to the sector.
Banks have indirect exposure to real estate sector through their lending to non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and housing finance companies (HFCs), which also lend to real estate developers. While the overall exposure of NBFCs and HFCs to the real estate sector is only about 6% of their total assets, some NBFCs and HFCs are more exposed than others, making them vulnerable to a slowdown in the sector.
In response to the tightening liquidity in the real estate sector, the Indian government on 13 September announced that it would create an investment fund to provide soft loans to residential real estate developers to complete partially constructed affordable housing projects.
The government will contribute  ₹10,000 crore to the fund and expects a similar-size contribution from entities including the Life Insurance Corporation of India, Indian banks and development institutions.
According to Moody's, the creation of the investment fund is credit positive for the real estate sector, but its timeline and modalities are not yet known, and is unclear if it will help address the sector's immediate liquidity constraints. In addition, it will not address the broader solvency constraints of real estate developers given its narrow remit of targeting only certain residential real estate projects."

Yet another much anticipated 25 basis points (bps) interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve has failed to cheer global markets. The Fed cut its benchmark overnight rate to a range of 1.75% to 2% on Wednesday. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.
Global equity markets weren’t too euphoric in spite of the Fed cutting interest rates for the second time this year. US equities ended Wednesday’s session with marginal gains. In Asia, equity markets, including India, didn’t show much enthusiasm on Thursday.

The CME FedWatch Tool also shows that after the Fed’s latest policy action, expectations of another 25bps interest rate cut have risen from 28.2% to 42.8%.
In short, the Fed is largely optimistic about the US’ growth outlook and its decision to trim rates was based on external factors—weakness in exports and investment due to the trade war. Therefore, further policy action will depend on how well or how bad the October meeting between the US and China turns out.
Analysts at Nomura Holdings Inc. are of the view that the slowdown will be sufficient to move some of the more hawkish participants into the dovish camp. They believe that another 25bps rate cut at the October meeting remains the most likely outcome for this year, before the Fed holds rates steady through 2021."

Indian stock market indices Sensex and Nifty today jumped over 3%, extending Friday’s gains as the sentiment turned positive after the government last week cut effective corporate tax rate. The Sensex today rose 1,075 points to settle at 39,090, adding to Friday’s 1,921-point gain. The two-day gain has pushed up investor wealth by over  ₹10 lakh crore. Here are 10 things to know about the 2-day Sensex rally:
1) Banking stocks have outperformed in the two sessions with Nifty Bank index rising 14% during this period. Banking heavyweights ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank today hit new 52-week highs.
2) FMCG heavyweights HUL (+3.5%) and ITC (7%) also rose today with analysts saying that financials and FMCG sectors will be one of the key beneficiaries of corporate tax rate cut.
3) IT stocks however saw some profit-taking today with Infosys losing 5% and TCS 2.5%.
4) ""The 10% corporate tax reset has witnessed frantic buying across high tax paying entities in the last two trading sessions. The rebalancing act has led to selling in IT and pharmaceuticals with a shift towards manufacturing and private banks and select FMCG stocks,"" said S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities.
5) Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO (Equity) at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, said: “The decision to lower corporate taxes meaningfully is a key structural measure to support India's growth outlook. One of the key objectives of the sharp cut in corporate tax rates is to make India globally competitive. This step significantly boosts medium-term investment potential in the economy.""
6) Many brokerages have upgraded their earnings estimate as well as Sensex targets after the corporate tax cut. The tax cuts have also prompted Morgan Stanley to raise its June-2020 target for Sensex back to 45,000 after slashing it to 40,000 just two weeks ago.
7) Some analysts have turned cautious after the sharp upmove in past two sessions. “Indian markets are trading near peak valuations so we would remain cautious on the markets and expect it to consolidate in the near term. However, the recent announcements made by the FM are definitely positive for the Indian economy from a long-term perspective. Hence, investors should focus on accumulating fundamentally sound stocks,"" said Ajit Mishra, vice president of research at Religare Broking.
8) Shrikant S. Chouhan of Kotak Securities, said: “We need to be cautious while adding long positions at current levels,"" citing a spike in India VIX or the volatility index, which jumped 11% today.
9) In terms of technicals, Ruchit Jain, technical analyst at Angel Broking, said Nifty has support in the range of 11400-11300 whereas the near term resistances are seen around 11705 and 11800.
10)	Some analysts remain positive on midcap and smallcap stocks that have also participated in the two-day rally. “Mid and small caps are likely to catch in a big way going ahead,"" said Amit Shah, technical research analyst with Indiabulls Ventures."
133,2019-09-23,ICICI,"According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, fiscal 2018 and 2019 were the slowest in the last 10 yearsICICI bank’s branch expansion comes at a time when banks are slowing down on branch expansion

MUMBAI :
ICICI Bank on Monday said it has opened 320 bank branches so far this fiscal and was looking to add another 130 branches over the next 6 months, taking the total branch network to over 5,320 by the end of March 2020.
“Our strategy is to set up branches wherever business activity emerges. In line with this strategy, we have chalked out a plan of setting up around 450 branches this fiscal in fresh catchments and micro-markets where economic activity is present,"" said Anup Bagchi, executive director ICICI Bank.
According to the private-sector bank, customers are more keen to seek advice and guidance from branches for complex transactions, loans and investments. For simple transactions, they prefer doing it over digital channels like internet and mobile banking.
ICICI Bank’s branch expansion comes at a time when banks are going slow on network expansion. According to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, fiscal 2018 and 2019 were the slowest in the last 10 years. In FY2018 and FY2019, banks expanded their branch network by 1,804 and 2,958, respectively, as per the RBI's Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy (2018-19).
The bank reported a standalone net profit of  ₹1,908 crore for the June quarter, against a loss of  ₹120 crore in the same period last year, due to higher net interest income (NII) and lower provisions. Its net interest income (NII), the difference between interest earned and interest expended, rose 27% year-on-year (y-o-y) to  ₹7,737 crore in the first quarter of FY20. Net interest margin (NIM), a key measure of profitability, expanded 41 basis points (bps) y-o-y to 3.61%."

Banking and financial stocks were under severe selling pressure on Wednesday. The BSE Bankex has declined 1.7% so far today after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) put curbs on Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank. The central bank’s restrictions include limits on cash withdrawals amid a probe into accounting lapses, sparking speculation that the regulator may force a management change at the cooperative bank through a merger, according to a Mint report.
Shares of Housing Development & Infrastructure Ltd (HDIL) fell 4% on news report that the RBI’s action on the PMC Bank was the result of a loan of  ₹2,500 crore to the now bankrupt real estate firm.
Among banking stocks, shares of State Bank of India fell the most--down over 4%--following a rating downgrade by brokerage firm Morgan Stanley. Other banking stocks such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, and Axis Bank were down 1-2% each.
India Ratings and Research has placed ratings of most of the public sector banks (PSBs) on ‘rating watch evolving (RWE)’, maintain a stable outlook for private banks. The rating agency believes banks have been facing the double whammy of absorbing aging provisions on corporate stressed assets and growing their balance sheets, while on-boarding minimum incremental stress.
“Post announcements of amalgamations, the anchor banks may deliver credit growth, although management bandwidth could be diverted towards the amalgamation process. Credit growth and asset recovery may not receive adequate attention in the short term as focus is also diverted towards asset quality harmonisation, human resource integration and other challenges,"" India Ratings and Research said in a report on 24 September.
It added that some of the banks excluded from the amalgamation process are likely to continue to shrink their balance sheets and may also require additional capital in FY20-FY21. It estimates that among its rated banks, the return on assets (RoA) of PSBs and private banks is expected to increase by up to 10 basis points (bps) and 30 bps (10%-15% higher than base case), respectively, as a result of the lowering of the corporate tax rate by government.
It said public sector banks may not see a material impact in FY20, especially given that many of them would be making net losses.
Others concur.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the revised lower tax rate to have negligible impact on banks with high DTA (deferred tax asset). “We expect a positive impact on loan growth and provisions but offset by lower treasury. We maintain estimates but the long-term impact of return on equity (RoE) improvement is debatable. The impact on non-banks is mixed with lower tax rates (for non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), negligible impact on housing finance companies (HFCs) that already enjoy 26-27% tax rates,"" it said in a report on 22 September."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

129,2019-09-25,ICICI,"The QIP money will increase its Tier-I capital by over two percentage points, which should bring some cheerThe stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, lower than rivals such as HDFC Bank and even ICICI Bank

Axis Bank raised a massive  ₹12,500 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) without breaking a sweat and investors who made that happen deserve good news.
To make them happy, the third largest private lender will have to show an improvement in asset quality and convince the market that its balance sheet growth will trump that of rivals.
Improving asset quality won’t be easy and that could make balance sheet growth a challenge, too. “The QIP is a positive for the bank and the funds will be obviously used for more provisioning and even growth,"" said Suresh Ganapathy, analyst, Macquarie Capital Securities. “But asset quality is still unresolved and fresh stress has emerged,"" he added.
Moreover, since it is de-risking its portfolio, margins are going to be under pressure. So, there isn’t much earnings upside for the stock to price in.
Axis Bank has exposure to a handful of stressed companies that have of late shown deeper troubles. Some of these, such as companies belonging to Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group and Essel Group, are yet to see some resolution.
Axis Bank also has exposure to real estate developers that were downgraded by rating agencies due to stress. Its exposure to small and medium enterprises (SME) stands at 12% and the increased stress on small businesses due to the economic slowdown has increased risk on this portfolio.
To be sure, the bank showed improvement on asset quality in the June quarter with a 10% year-on-year drop in its bad loan stock. That said, the lender also reported an increase in fresh slippages.
Analysts said some of the newer stressed exposures are not included in the watch list and so could throw a negative surprise for the lender.
To be fair, the bank has made it clear that it will have enough insurance against fresh risk. It has beefed up provisions and is likely to continue doing so.
That brings us back to the fact that if more money is set aside for provisions, less is available for growth.
Even so, the QIP money will increase its Tier-I capital by over two percentage points, which should bring some cheer.
Also, much of the negatives seem to be priced into the stock, given that it is down 3.4% over the past two months despite the 10% rise post the corporate tax cut announcement by the government on Friday.
“Our analysis shows the potential stress at Axis Bank is only marginally higher on corporate assets than at ICICI Bank, and given its underperformance, we believe it presents a good buying opportunity,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
The stock trades at a modest multiple of two times its estimated book value for FY21, lower than rivals such as HDFC Bank and even ICICI Bank."

MUMBAI :
Financial services firm Vivriti Capital, which runs an online marketplace for mid-market corporates to raise debt, plans to raise  ₹500 crore for a debt fund that will invest in companies in its marketplace, said a top executive of the firm.
Along with the marketplace model, where large-cap investors such as State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank and Templeton Mutual Fund lend to mid-market corporates, Vivriti also lends from its own balance sheet as a part of these transactions to showcase its deep involvement in the business.
“There will always be different sources of capital, who want to invest in different ways, directly, on our balance sheet, and as a fund. We are raising this alternative investment fund (AIF) so that we have a structure that can absorb every type of money. The AIF becomes another participant in the marketplace,"" Vineet Sukumar, co-founder and managing director Vivriti Capital, said in an interview.
Vivriti’s own loan-book is about  ₹1,000 crore, which it expects to grow to  ₹2,500 crore by the end of this fiscal, Sukumar said. Disbursals from the marketplace are also expected to increase from about  ₹19,000 crore so far to about  ₹29,000 crore by 31 March 2020, he said.
The new debt fund will have a base size of  ₹250 crore with an equal amount as a greenshoe option, which will let the fund raise more capital in case of robust investor demand.
The investors in the fund are expected to be large insurance companies, high net-worth individuals (HNIs), and bank treasuries, Sukumar said. “While the LP (limited partners) base will mostly be domestic, we are setting up a structure to raise money from overseas, and are setting up an offshore manager,"" he added.
Vivriti expects to close the fundraise by the end of this fiscal. The firm has already received commitments worth  ₹140 crore, and plans to start investing from the fund from next month onwards, Sukumar said. He said the fund will lend to mid-size corporates and financial institutions with annual revenues of around  ₹50 crore.
It also plans to raise further equity capital, and has started a formal process to raise  ₹450 crore from private equity funds, Sukumar said.
The two-year-old company has so far raised  ₹300 crore in equity from Creation Investments, a US-based impact investor."

Mumbai: India’s surprise $20 billion tax break to companies bodes well for high dividend-yield stocks that benefit in a low-rate environment, according to ICICI Securities Ltd.
Assuming companies pass on the profit gains from the reduction as dividends, the payout of the NSE Nifty 50 Index may immediately jump 37% as a slowing economy prompts businesses to go slow on new investments, the firm said.
“Sectors where growth is slow and stable but cash-flow generation is high should step up the payout to at least three-fourths of their profit because new investments will be risky in a slowing demand environment,"" analysts Vinod Karki and Siddharth Gupta wrote in a note on Monday.
High-dividend strategies also perform better in times of falling global and local yields, the analysts wrote. Benchmark yields in India have declined 70 basis points this year after the central bank cut its policy rate four times in Asia’s most aggressive easing cycle. A fifth reduction is widely expected when the authority reviews borrowing costs on Friday.
“Interest rates globally are headed lower along with improving liquidity and hence, real yields in India could dip further as the Reserve Bank of India expected to cut rates incrementally,"" the analysts wrote.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman last month unexpectedly slashed the corporate tax rate on local companies to 22% from 30% in an effort to boost growth from a five-year low. Analysts expect the decision to improve earnings for India Inc. by up to 10%
Excerpts from the report:
■ Top picks include ONGC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd., Coal India, Hero Motorcorp, NMDC and Power Grid.
■ Higher dividend payout to also help improve the government as state-run companies are big contributors.
■ Share of financials, largely state-run banks, in high dividend yield strategy peaked in 2014 and is the lowest since 2007. Software stocks now have the highest ever representation within the high dividend portfolio."

Indian banks have faced rough weather in the past two weeks and investors are rediscovering stocks that act as lifeboats in choppy waters.
HDFC Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd have emerged as these lifeboats over the last 10 days. Ergo, while the Nifty Bank index lost over 6% since 23 September, these stocks have weathered the selling pressure.
As the adjoining chart shows, the market capitalization of the two private sector lenders now exceeds that of the other 10 banks in the Nifty banking sector index by about 10%. Just three months ago, the combined value of the two banks was about 10% lower than the other 10 lenders, which include State Bank of India (SBI), ICICI Bank Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and seven of the remaining largest lenders in the country.
So what transpired in the last 10 days to drive investors away from other banks and towards HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank?
The collapse of Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Ltd, which had an absurdly high exposure to real estate developers, brought to the fore the vulnerabilities of Indian banks in general.
Investors realized that Indian banks have an uncomfortable exposure to non-banking financial companies (NBFC) that finance real estate developers (HFCs). “Negative news flow around HFCs/NBFCs and banks has overshadowed the recent tax cut tailwind, bringing focus back on sector issues: liquidity issues and contagion risks,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The result was a massive fall in stock prices, and banks such as Yes Bank Ltd and RBL Bank Ltd saw their valuation erode sharply. According to Jefferies India, Yes Bank has an exposure of more than  ₹10,000 crore to troubled companies it terms as “high risk"".
Even the more stronger and larger balance sheets such as SBI and ICICI Bank weren’t spared by investors.
In addition to the resurgence of stress, concerns that the current slowdown would affect the loan growth of banks also weighed in. Analysts at Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said banks are not likely to grow their loans as most companies would use savings from tax cuts to boost profits.
Analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd wrote in note, “We expect overall system credit to see 10-12% growth, but near-term growth trajectory depends on pick-up in consumer sentiment in this festive season.""
Investors flocked to HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank as they showed a track record of pristine asset quality. Moreover, both lenders have negligible exposure to troubled NBFCs. Lower stressed assets would mean lower provisioning for the two lenders and, therefore, the banks would have more free capital to lend. Ergo, their loan growth is likely to be superior to others.
Even so, the consumption slowdown is likely to affect all lenders. Investors know this. While HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank may have been spared in the recent rout in bank shares, investors await the quarterly performance for clarity."

Mumbai: Investors on Wednesday cheered the government’s decision to raise dearness allowance (DA) in the middle of the festival season, driving Indian markets up nearly 2% in a rally led by financial sector stocks.
The benchmark 30-share BSE Sensex closed 1.72% or 645.97 points higher at 38,177.95, while the 50-share Nifty closed at 11,313.30, up 186.90 points or 1.68%.
The five percentage point increase in DA to 17% will put more money in the hands of at least 5 million government employees and 6.5 million pensioners. The hike, which will cost the exchequer  ₹16,000 crore, will be effective from July.
Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities Ltd, attributed Wednesday’s rebound to bargain hunting as well, coming after six straight days of losses. “Sentiments also turned positive after the government hiked dearness allowance. Most emerging market stocks were headed lower for a third day on Wednesday as the US and China showed little signs of backing off from their trade dispute ahead of a crucial round of negotiations. However, later, European shares moved sharply higher and the Chinese currency in the offshore market jumped on Wednesday after a Bloomberg report said China was still open to agreeing a partial trade deal with the United States,"" he said.
The Bankex rose 3.67%, with State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank rising 3-5%.
According to Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, banking stocks rallied on hopes of greater liquidity and consumption, as the plunge in bond yields indicates further room for rate cuts. “Further, the hike in DA will add impetus to festival demand. Going forward, the results season will dictate the market direction and investors are expecting some green shoots on account of festival demand and good monsoon,"" he said. The 10-year bond yield jumped 22 basis points to 6.45% on Wednesday.
After a bumper rally triggered by corporate tax cuts on 20 September, the markets had turned volatile ahead of second quarter earnings. Analysts said the tax cuts are a pro-investment stimulus, but will take time to show results, given the nature of the ongoing economic slowdown.
Rahul Singh, chief investment officer-equities at Tata Mutual Fund, said the 8-9% lift in Nifty earnings per share after the corporate tax cuts will provide support to stock valuations, in addition to the fact that India’s valuation premium to other emerging markets is at a more acceptable level now. “The recent privatization initiative indicates the government’s seriousness in tackling the economic slowdown and we believe that there is more to come in the coming weeks and months,"" he said.
Indian companies are set to report a drop in revenue and profit for the second straight quarter amid a slump in consumer demand that sent the government scrambling to boost investment and consumption through a raft of measures, including tax cuts for companies.
“It has been a year since the IL&FS crisis erupted and the repercussions of the same are still being felt, especially in financials. Besides NBFCs, banks too have started facing asset quality concerns now,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.

112,2019-10-10,ICICI,"Growth in overall loan book for the Sep quarter was 19%, higher than 17% of Jun quarter but lower than 22% a year agoInvestors have to realize that HDFC Bank is not immune to the broad-based slowdown, especially when a consumption slowdown is under way

There is no doubt that investors love HDFC Bank Ltd. The island of safety the stock offered during the past three volatile weeks is a reflection of the private sector lender’s strong balance sheet.
Its exposures to major troubled assets are a shadow of its peers and it seems HDFC Bank made all the right decisions in lending. After all, its gross bad loans totalled just  ₹11,769 crore as of June quarter. Its closest competitor in size, ICICI Bank Ltd has a bad loan stock nearly four times that of HDFC Bank even though its balance sheet is smaller.
Public sector banks of similar size fare worse on their asset quality metrics. According to Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd, HDFC Bank’s exposure to high-risk stressed loans was just 0.9% of its FY19 net worth, the lowest among banks. To the several defaulting companies that have cropped up in the last three months, HDFC Bank has the lowest exposure among peer banks.
Ergo, the bank’s valuations have only soared even after its stock is trading at a multiple of more than three times its estimated FY21 book value, deemed expensive by some analysts.
In all this, investors have to realize that HDFC Bank is not immune to the broad-based slowdown, especially when a consumption slowdown is under way. Indeed, the private sector lender’s large retail portfolio is making it run countercyclical to the rest of the banking system.
The deep slowdown in the automobile sector is weighing down HDFC Bank’s commercial vehicle loan growth. Even growth in unsecured personal loans have decelerated for the lender as of the June quarter. That said, the bank told the exchanges that its overall loan book grew a healthy 19% in the September quarter. That is higher than the 17% growth in the previous quarter but lower than the 22% growth a year ago.
But a bank can be profitable despite lack of growth if its operations are cost-efficient.
Hemindra Hazari, an independent research analyst, pointed out that the private sector bank has managed to give high return on assets to investors simply because it runs its shop efficiently and is able to keep a lid on operating costs.
“In the current faltering economy, the bank is unlikely to increase its net interest margin and its fees to compensate for the expected higher credit costs and if it is unable to continue with its earlier strategy, shareholders should expect a decline in its profitability,"" Hazari wrote in a note on research website Smartkarma.
Notwithstanding the pressure on its profitability, HDFC Bank in all likelihood may look better than its peers, which are still saddled with dud loans. But it sure is a duller version of its illustrious past."
110,2019-10-13,ICICI,"There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loansPersonal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral

Personal loans are a way to use tomorrow's income today, and unlike other loan products that are used for buying a house or paying for an education, the process involved is simple. In fact, if you already have an account with a bank, you would have come across many offers for a personal loan. While these are easy to get, and offer almost instant gratification, you must note that the interest rates are much higher than, say, for a car loan.
This is because personal loans are unsecured loans. This means that the loan is not backed by any asset; you don’t have to put up any asset like property or gold to be able to get the loan. However, the loan amount on offer and its interest rate depend on a few parameters such as your income, credit, repayment capacity, and others.
There are various versions of personal loans available now, some of which are called instant loans. These are pre-approved loans—the lender has already looked at your information, based on which it is offering this loan.
Easy to get, but not so easy to pay back. One must remember that personal loans come with high interest rates, so continuous default will put you on a downward spiral. Here are some personal loan rates and other costs of the top private and public sector banks in India.

111,2019-10-13,ICICI,"The spat between ICICI Pru Life Insurance and its former employee reveals a larger industry problemFront-end commission structure and high exit cost contribute to mis-selling in insurance

The fact that life insurance policies are prone to mis-selling is now a well-documented fact, and with a fat commission structure that’s also front-loaded, intermediaries selling these plans have very little to lose. There are many shades to a mis-sell—sometimes customers don’t understand the policy well and the agent is unable to explain the nuances, given the overly complicated structure of insurance-cum-savings plans, sometimes the agents deliberately mislead the customers into buying the wrong plan and sometimes the sale is an outright fraud.
But in all these instances, it’s the customers that end up with the wrong end of the stick, given the high surrender costs in some of the bundled insurance plans—they lose if they stay on and even when they opt out because they end up paying a heavy surrender penalty. On the other hand, intermediaries, who get to pocket a fat commission, rarely suffer. However, there are moments of reckoning for them too.
For Nitin Balchandani, who was a customer service manager with ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd based in Udaipur, this moment came in 2012 when, sickened by the alleged complaints that emerged from his company’s push to sell, he quit his job. He went on to file a public interest litigation (PIL) in 2018, where he listed out specific instances of alleged mis-selling. These include cases where poor farmers from around Udaipur approached the bank for a Kisan Credit Card (KCC) but were sold bundled traditional insurance plans; cases of signature forgery on proposal forms; manipulation of age and income of senior citizens; and sales to people below the poverty line or to students who could not otherwise be sold insurance as per the company’s guidelines.
“A farmer who took a  ₹5 lakh loan from the bank was told that only  ₹3 lakh could be disbursed. The balance  ₹2 lakh had to be kept in the form of a fixed deposit (FD),"" alleged Balchandani. “However in reality, the amount taken from the farmer went towards the issuance of a life insurance policy. The next year, the farmer was asked to pay another  ₹2 lakh premium or risk complete forfeiture,"" he added. Since the money was parked in a traditional insurance policy, surrendering the plan after a year meant the policyholder, the farmer in this case, wouldn’t get any money back. Traditional plans come with very high surrender costs, which continue through the tenure, and could go up to 100% at the beginning.
Upset by the alleged sales practices, Balchandani quit the company to set up a firm, Insurance Angels, to take up mis-selling claims on behalf of customers. While mis-selling is rampant in the industry, a bulk of Balchandani’s customers are from his previous employer. He usually charges a percentage of the amount recovered. “The amount is only taken after the money is actually recovered and is entirely voluntary for the person whose case I have taken up,"" said Balchandani.
Click here to see the enlarged version of the graphic
While Balchandani crossed over to the other side to champion the cause of aggrieved customers of bundled plans, in his previous avatar as a customer service manager, Balchandani wasn’t completely above board. A person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke to Mint on the condition of anonymity, said that Balchandani had indulged in the practice of assigning policies to himself while he was still an employee at the company. Assignment refers to transfer of insurance benefits from one person to another. According to Balchandani, he had assigned two unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) to himself as he was bullish on the performance of the funds the Ulips were tied to. “I paid the customers the surrender value and took the policies in my name, as did 30 other employees in Rajasthan (there may have been a lot more pan India). I was not fired because of it and nor were the other employees involved,"" he said.
“The practice of stranger-owned life insurance is discouraged, by the regulator, due to lack of insurance interest. This can lead to all sorts of malpractices,"" said Kapil Mehta, co-founder, SecureNow.in.
While Balchandani may not have paid a price for assigning of policies, he did pay a price as a whistle-blower. After he quit the company in July 2012, he started fighting alleged mis-selling by helping aggrieved customers fight the battle. In October 2016, he was sent to jail for a month in a case filed against him by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance on grounds of cheating and data theft. That case was quashed by the Rajasthan High Court on 16 January 2018.
An ICICI Prudential Life Insurance spokesperson said, in an email to Mint, that the company has a defined whistle-blower policy. “The purpose of the policy is to encourage employees to report matters without the risk of subsequent victimisation, discrimination or disadvantage.""
Subsequently, Balchandani registered another FIR in February 2018 against various officials of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance for criminal defamation and giving false evidence in their original case against Balchandani. This ultimately led to the issuance of a bailable warrant last month against the defendants, including Sandeep Bakhshi, then managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and present MD and CEO of ICICI Bank. Balchandani also filed a PIL in December 2018 in the Rajasthan High Court, listing out the details of alleged mis-selling ICICI Prudential Life Insurance indulged in along with its bancassurance partner ICICI Bank in Rajasthan.
The PIL also draws attention to the pressure within banks to meet third-party targets such as sale of insurance policies. “We would like to inform that there are no specific targets assigned to branches for solicitation of life insurance policies,"" said a spokesperson from ICICI Bank in an email to Mint.
Balchandani claims to have handled around 400 mis-selling cases over the past four years. “In more than 90% of the cases, the insurer accepted the mis-selling claim and refunded the money,"" he claimed. In response to our query about the alleged mis-selling in Rajasthan, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance’s spokesperson said that during the period from April 2016 to September 2019, the company met with customers in certain pockets of Rajasthan through a combination of proactive visits and over 50 service camps to help resolve customer grievances.
“The two important customer service metrics of persistency and grievance ratio have improved over the years. For FY19, the 13th month persistency of 86.2% is one of the highest in the industry. The grievance ratio in FY19 of 72 grievances per 10,000 retail policies issued in FY19 is well below the private industry average of 83 grievances per 10,000 retail policies issued,"" said the spokesperson. Persistency is the percentage of policies out of the total policies sold which are continued by the customer beyond specified points of time.
The big picture
Balchandani has taken on the battle head on, but the incident exposes the cracks in insurance regulations with regard to sales practices that continue to allow a front-loaded commission structure. While the previous regulations hard-coded the remuneration structure to intermediaries, the Insurance Laws (Amendment) Act, 2015, gave enough freedom to the insurance regulator to revisit insurance commissions. While other investment products in the financial industry encourage trail model for incentives, the new regulations on commission continued with the front-loaded structure (read more about it here: bit.ly/2MtGjim).
In the case of Ulips, where the surrender costs have been reduced to a bare minimum and the overall charges have been capped, commissions have by default taken a beating. However, traditional plans continue with hefty surrender penalties, and commissions are still high. “Depending on the premium paying term, insurers can pay 15% to 35% of the first-year premium in the form of commissions for regular paying policies,"" said Mahavir Chopra, director, health, life and travel insurance, Coverfox. “Traditional policies continue to have high margins and commissions,"" he added. “80% of the policies that are mis-sold are endowment policies,"" said Balchandani.
While ICICI Prudential Life Insurance may have seen mis-selling of its traditional plans, the company has less than 10% exposure to these plans. In fact, Bakhshi wasn’t a fan of traditional products. In an interview to Mint, Bakhshi had pointed to the heavy surrender charges that stood to harm policyholders (read the interview here). An ICICI Bank spokesperson told Mint that the bank has stopped selling traditional bundled products for the last two years.
Front-end commission structure coupled with complex insurance products that obfuscate customer understanding is at the heart of mis-selling. According to Chopra, aggressive revenue targets without strong sales processes and controls that require need-based selling are contributing factors as well.
It is for this reason that despite regulatory reforms, the insurance industry has not been able to improve persistency of customer by a huge margin. According to the FY18 figures reported by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India on persistency, insurance companies, on average, were able to retain less than 70% of the policies. Compare this against the global average of close to 90%. Further, by the fifth year, this average dropped to around 35%.
“Insurance products should allow customers to get out of a policy with low surrender charges. Also, at the time of sale, returns from a policy should be explained very clearly and this means the benefit illustration should carry the net yield, particularly for traditional plans. Lastly the commission could be evenly distributed as in non-life products,"" said Mehta.
Time and again, there have been instances of grave mis-selling in the insurance industry that necessitates a serious relook at product structure and front-loaded commissions. The insurance regulation has some checks in place, the latest being market conduct guidelines that emphasises on suitability-based sales. However, that may not be enough. More disclosures at the time of sale, and a review of incentives for intermediaries is the need of the hour."

104,2019-10-22,ICICI,"Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley reckons that ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and Siemens are likely to be includedTheir combined new weightings could be about 1.8% if they are included in the index

Mumbai: The Indian markets could see inflows of as much as $1.5 billion in an upcoming MSCI India index re-jig that is due on 8 November.
In the semi-annual review of the MSCI India index, brokerage firm Morgan Stanley reckons that ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life Insurance and Siemens are likely to be included. This could see inflows to the tune of about $614 million.
The MSCI Index could also increase the weightings of ICICI Bank Ltd in the November shuffle to about 5.7%, which alone would draw in about $907 million in inflows.
MSCI semi-annual index review on 8 November and the upcoming changes in weightings will be effective from 27 November. In its stock inclusion methodology, MSCI frameworks counts full market cap and free float market cap as an important criteria to include stocks in the MSCI index.
MSCI believes that the ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, SBI Life and Siemens India meet the criteria for inclusion into the MSCI India index. Their combined new weightings could be about 1.8% if they are included in the index. Morgan Stanley believes that the likelihood of inclusion in the index is high for ICICI Prudential Life and SBI Life, while Siemens has a low probability of inclusion.
Additionally, the latest shareholding pattern gives room to make the adjustments to the weightings of ICICI Bank in the MSCI index. The bank’s foreign shareholding come down in the recent quarter to about 54%, which gives room to increase the free float to 0.74 in the index. “We expect the weight of ICICI Bank to rise due to upward movement of the adjustment factor as foreign room on the stock goes above 25%,"" said Morgan Stanley in a note to clients.
Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, however, could make an exit from the list. The potential outflows if these companies are excluded could be to the tune of $104 million.
Overall, this would increase the weight of Indian stocks in the MSCI EM index if all these stocks are included. “If all the above changes were implemented, India's weight in MSCI EM could rise by 37bps from the current level of 8.89%. Over the medium term, the proposed Finance Minister's announcement to increase the minimum statutory limit for FPI investment in a company be increased from 24% to the foreign investment limit of the sectors, has the potential to increase India's weight in MSCI EM by 81bps,"" said the Morgan Stanley report noted."

New Delhi: Private sector ICICI Bank on Friday said it has exited the GST Network, the company facilitating collection of the indirect tax, by selling its entire 10 per cent stake to as many as 13 state governments.
The stake sale is for aggregate cash consideration of  ₹1 crore, ICICI Bank said in a regulatory filing.
The stake transfer to various stake governments will be completed by the end of March 2020, it said.
The bank will transfer 0.14 per cent stake to the Assam government and 0.81 per cent stake to the Telangana government.
Besides, it will transfer Goa, Kerala, Manipur, Tripura, West Bengal, Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Arunachal Pradesh governments 0.82 per cent stake each.
ICICI Bank has exited the company following the government of India's decision to make GST Network into a public sector entity last year.
As per the decision, the Centre will own a 50 per cent stake in the GST Network and the remainder will be held by the states on a pro-rata basis in the new structure.
Currently, the Centre and the states together hold a 49 per cent stake in the company, which provides the IT backbone to the indirect tax regime. The remaining 51 per cent is held by five private financial institutions – HDFC, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, NSE Strategic Investment Co and LIC Housing Finance.
GSTN was incorporated as a private limited company on March 28, 2013, under the previous UPA government. It is a not-for-profit entity. There had been criticism about allowing private companies to hold a majority stake in GSTN and demands to change its structure.
However, it was then felt that private sector participation in the company would provide it with flexibility in hiring and operational freedom. GST, which replaced multiple state and central taxes with a single levy, was rolled out across the nation on July 1 last year.
GSTN faced widespread criticism after the portal crashed several times and businesses found it difficult to file returns. With the portal stabilising, the government said the time was right to change the ownership."

NEW DELHI :
Loss-making Indian mobile carrier Vodafone Idea will ask the federal government for relief on payments of at least $4 billion after a court ruling requiring it to pay overdue levies and interest, the company said on Friday.
Supreme Court on Thursday upheld a demand by the country's Department of Telecommunications (DoT) that wireless carriers pay nearly $13 in overdue levies and interest.
Vodafone Idea and rival Bharti Airtel Ltd posted losses in the quarter to June, hit by a price war that began after conglomerate Reliance Industries launched its Jio telecoms arm in 2016 with free voice and cut-price data services.
""The judgment has financial implications, which we are reviewing,"" Vodafone Idea said in a statement. ""We will engage with the DoT in order for it to consider granting relief, including a waiver of interest and penalties.""
Both Vodafone Idea and Bharti sparred for over a decade with the DoT over the definition of so-called adjusted gross revenue (AGR), a percentage of which they pay as usage charges for spectrum or airwaves and as licence fees.
The companies maintained that AGR should comprise only revenue accrued from core services and not other revenue such as income from sale of mobile phones, income from rent of property or sale of scrap.
The Supreme Court however upheld the DoT's view that all revenue be included in AGR.
On Friday, shares in Vodafone Idea closed 5.6% lower, while Bharti gained 0.8% in a broader Mumbai market that ended flat.
Vodafone Idea will be the worst hit given their already stretched balance sheet, local brokerage ICICI Securities said.
The company, a combination of Britain's Vodafone Group Plc and local Idea Cellular, posted consolidated net loss of 48.74 billion rupees ($687.68 million) in the quarter to June, and had a gross debt of 1.2 trillion rupees.
Rival Bharti Airtel, which owes over 216 billion rupees to the DoT, reported a net loss of 28.66 billion rupees at the end of the June quarter, while net debt was 1.17 trillion rupees.
Bharti could scrape through making the overdue payments, but Vodafone Idea ""is estimated to require additional capital to fund even the current operations beyond the next 3-4 quarters,"" local brokerage Motilal Oswal said.
The court ruling will have limited impact on Jio as it started operations in late 2016, compared with rivals whose outstanding dues, interest and penalties have been mounting for over 10 years."

94,2019-10-27,ICICI,"Reliance Industries shares hit a new highMidcap and smallcap stocks also posted strong gains

Samvat 2076 started on a strong note today. Key stock market indices ended higher in the special one-hour Muhurat trading session on the occasion of Diwali. The Sensex gained 192 points to settle at 39,250 while the broader Nifty ended 0.40% higher at  ₹11,628. Tata Motors surged 18% after the automaker posted a smaller-than-expected loss in the second quarter as a pick up in sales of its luxury car in China helped it ride out weak vehicles sales in India, its home market.
Reliance Industries or RIL shares today hit a new high of  ₹1,445. The company on Friday said it would invest nearly $15 billion to create a digital services company as it seeks to cut debt at its Jio telecom venture, potentially making way for the entry of a strategic investor. RIL shares ended 0.30% higher at  ₹1,435.
Over the past ten years, the Sensex had risen on seven occasions in Muhurat trading session.
The breadth of the market remained strong, with BSE midcap and smallcap indices rising 0.70% and 1.2% respectively.
Analysts say that Nifty has strong support near 11500-11450 zone and strong resistance near 11,650-11,700. A breakout about 11,700 zone could push the Nifty towards 12,000 mark, they say.
The global backdrop remained positive with Wall Street rising on Friday after US said it was close to finalising parts of a trade pact with Beijing.
Indian capital markets witnessed a net inflow of over  ₹3,800 crore by foreign portfolio investors (FPI) so far this month on the back of steps taken by the government to revive domestic demand, coupled with positive global cues. (With agency inputs)"
93,2019-10-28,ICICI,"Investors should be pleased that core income growth was maintained at 26% and domestic loan book managed to expand 16.4% despite the protracted slowdownBut stress is around the corner again and the malaise from non-bank finance companies hasn’t abated

ICICI Bank didn’t throw any nasty surprises on asset quality for the September quarter but the outlook is far from sanguine for investors. The private sector lender reported a 29% fall in its net profit but that can be blamed on the one-time charge of  ₹2,920 crore due to tax adjustment.
Indeed, net profit should be ignored and the bank should be lauded for taking a prudent step to adjust its deferred tax assets at one shot. From here on, ICICI Bank can reap the benefits of a lower tax rate.
Investors should be pleased that core income growth was maintained at 26% and domestic loan book managed to expand 16.4% despite the protracted slowdown.
Of course, like all banks, ICICI Bank too chased the retail customer for growth and its personal loans were the fastest growing segment in its retail portfolio. Since the bank is able to lend at reasonable speed, its future earnings are not under threat.
Here comes the asset quality issue. For the September quarter, bad loans formed just 6.4% of ICICI Bank’s loan book on a gross basis, a sharp fall from 8.5% a year ago. Adequate provisions ensured that the net bad loan ratio fell to a greater extent.
But stress is around the corner again and the malaise from non-bank finance companies hasn’t abated. ICICI Bank’s exposure to non-banks has increased ever since the liquidity crunch hit a year ago.
The lender has even bought loans from troubled non-bank finance companies (NBFC) through securitisation. However, the management has indicated that it is not worried over its NBFC exposure.
Telecom is another emerging stress segment especially after the Supreme Court ordered operators to pay up licence fee. The burden on telcos is likely to affect their repayment capacity in the short-term.
Besides all this, the ongoing resolution of several large bad assets in insolvency courts will continue to weigh on the bank’s recoveries.
Its watchlist of stressed loans has marginally increased.
Considering these, analysts are less sanguine about a fall in credit costs. “We have maintained credit costs at 1.5% vs management guidance of 1.3% which includes certain IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) recoveries,"" analysts with Jefferies India Pvt Ltd wrote in a note.
To be sure, ICICI Bank has come a long way on asset quality over the last two years. Its bad loan ratios have improved markedly and provisions have been made prudently over time. But as newer stress emerges, the lender could find itself in a tough battle and investors would do well to be cautious.
After the 20% rise since corporate tax cut, the stock trades at a multiple of nearly three times its estimated book value for FY21."

Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets: 
1) The sentiment was boosted after new reports, citing sources, said that the government is working towards a revamp of tax structure on equities to boost sentiment.
2) Tata Motors shares jumped 17% today, following a similar rise on Diwali-day trading on Sunday. On Friday, Tata Motors posted a smaller-than-expected loss in the second quarter as a pick up in sales of its luxury car unit JLR in China helped it ride out weak vehicles sales in India, its home market. Indian markets were closed on Monday.
3) Domestically, Q2 numbers from large cap companies have beat the expectations and the pessimism is waning, said Ashish Nanda of Kotak Securities.
4) S Ranganathan, head of research at LKP Securities, said that markets buoyed today led by hopes of divestment and tax cuts as a slew of midcaps and under-owned stocks staged a smart upmove.
6) Metal stocks Tata Steel and Vedanta ended firm today, rising 7% and 3% respectively. 
7) Optimism over US-China trade deal and the European Union extending Brexit deadline to 31 January, 2020, also boosted sentiment.

9) Auto stocks M&M and Maruti also posted strong gains, rising 3.4% and 4% respectively. M&M said that on Dhanteras-day the auto division of the company delivered close to 13,500 vehicles across the country. ""This figure was substantially higher than the deliveries last year on Dhanteras,"" it added.
10) Shares of Bharti Airtel fell 3.4% after the company deferred earnings announcement till November 14, 2019 ""on account of the fact that more clarity is needed on the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) matter arising out of recent judgement of Supreme Court."""
91,2019-10-29,ICICI,"A former Infosys board member, on condition of anonymity, corroborated the views of the reportThe report clarified there is concern only if 'material information was held back from the auditors and board which we see as less likely.'

Data points shared by Infosys Ltd., do not have any “perceivable inconsistency"" as alleged in a whistleblower letter, according to a report by ICICI Securities.
“Some of the data points shared by Infosys, like (the) Verizon deal being margin dilutive by 40 basis points, or visa costs being a margin drag of 80 basis points in Q1FY20, or (the) Stater deal being dilutive by 40 basis points, are consistent with the nature of these deals and investments in our opinion,"" the brokerage firm said in the report today. One basis point, or bps, is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Also, Infosys has always been clear that “certain deals like Verizon and Stater should be seen as investments made to build relationships with strategic clients with margins on these deals expected to remain dilutive to company average for an extended period of time,"" the report said.
A 20 September letter by an anonymous group called Ethical Employees alleged, among other things, that “in large contracts like Verizon, Intel, JVs in Japan, ABN AMRO acquisition, revenue recognition matters are forced, which are not as per accounting standards."" The whistleblower allegations, which became public earlier this month, battered Infosys stock.
A former Infosys board member, on condition of anonymity, corroborated the views of the report saying “such large manipulations were not possible for a company like Infosys and most of the data points were intrinsic to the nature of the deals.""
However, according to the ICICI Securities report, investor response to the whistleblower allegations worsened due to “absence of proactive disclosures by the company as well as the allegations not being looked at in isolation but also in the context of Ranganath Mavinakere (ex-CFO) and Jayesh Sanghrajka (Dy CFO) moving on from the company since Salil (Parekh) has taken over.""
Sanghrajka quit the company on 14 October after spending about 14 years in the company. In November last year, Sanghrajka was made the interim CFO after the then CFO and MD Ranganath quit.
The report clarified that there was concern only if “material information was held back from the auditors and board which we see as less likely.""
ICICI Securities has rated the Infosys stock as “attractive"" and upgraded it to “buy"" as the stock is currently trading at a discounted 15.5 times its FY21 estimated earnings per share compared with that of Tata Consultancy Services trading at 22.5 times. The possibility of a management discontinuity driven by the whistleblower allegations will remain a key risk, the report concluded.
On Tuesday, shares of Infosys closed 0.2% higher at Rs650.60, while the IT index rose 1.7% to close at 14908.32 points. The BSE Sensex rose about 1.5% to 39,831.84 points."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Wednesday:
Infosys: Financial services firm ICICI Securities said the tech major does not have any “perceivable inconsistency"" in data points shared by Infosys Ltd as alleged in a whistleblower letter. This may reverse the negative sentiment surrounding the company over accounting malpractices. Separately, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has sought information regarding the whistleblower complaints, which have triggered an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Bharti Airtel: Shares plunged more than 3.3% on Tuesday as the Supreme Court rejected telcos’ definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), ordering mobile operators to repay past dues within three months to the government amid piling debt and shrinking revenues. Separately, Airtel on Tuesday reported a drop in its average revenue per share user in July-September as growth in its subscriber base outpaced the increase in revenue from mobile services in India.
RIL: The company said it will infuse  ₹1.08 trillion into its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Proceeds from the infusion will be used to pare debt of the largest telecom operator by revenue market share. As a result, Reliance Jio's debt to equity ratio will fall from about 2.5 times to 0.3 times. Shares of the largest company by market capitalisation had touched a fresh 52-week high on Tuesday.
IndiGo: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline IndiGo, has sought support from its employees following its biggest quarterly loss in July-September, saying that it will have to deal with weakening revenue environment going ahead.

Bandhan Bank: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday imposed a penalty of  ₹1 crore on the private lender for failing to meet its promoter shareholding norms.

Net profit more than doubled to  ₹1,103 crore compared with  ₹560 crore in the same period last year. The company’s revenue rose 8.7% to  ₹9,361 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal. The revenue was higher than a year-ago figure of  ₹8,613 but lower than the estimate of  ₹9,027 crore.
Vodafone Idea: Traders fear Vodafone Idea Ltd may end up in bankruptcy, since the penalty amount is higher than the cash on its books. The telecom operator will alone have to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore in past dues that include licence fees and penalties to the department of telecommunications.
Central Bank: The public-sector bank on Tuesday said its board has approved allotting preferential shares to the government to raise  ₹3,353 crore equity capital. In a filing with stock exchanges, the lender said the board approval is subject to the nod of shareholders, regulators RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India and other statutory authorities.
Tata Chemicals: The company will announce its September quarter earnings today. Tata Global Beverages Ltd will also report its numbers for the second quarter. The companies are in the process of a demerger, where Tata Chemical’s consumer products business will be demerged into Tata Global Beverages’ and the entity with all mass consumption items will be named Tata Consumer Products.
HDFC Life Insurance: HDFC Standard Life has offered the company’s share at a price band of  ₹562-575 per share, seeking about $600 million or  ₹4,260 crore in the the placement of HDFC Life Insurance Company’s shares. There is an option to sell an additional $200 million of shares. Standard Life is looking to sell up to 3.76% stake or 7.58 crore shares in HDFC Life Insurance."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

India’s debt-burdened companies could get kicked out of MSCI Inc.’s benchmark index later this week.
Highly indebted companies including Vodafone Idea Ltd., Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd. are likely to be removed from the MSCI India Index, according to brokers.
Most of these companies have seen a sharp erosion in their market values in the wake of the yearlong crisis in India’s credit market. The troubled private lender Yes Bank Ltd. has slumped more than 60% this year, while Indiabulls was axed from the NSE Nifty 50 Index in September after the mortgage lender’s share value more than halved.
ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. and Siemens Ltd. are companies likely to be added to MSCI’s indexes, according to Morgan Stanley and Edelweiss. The insurer is up almost 60% this year, while Siemens rose to a record on Monday.

NEW DELHI :
Amid its ongoing probes into several high-profile cases of bank frauds, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday launched a massive crackdown at 169 places across India with alleged links to cases of financial crimes worth a total of  ₹7,200 crore.
The agency’s crackdown comes against the backdrop of its current probes against several financial and white-collar crimes, including the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and the ICICI Bank probe. Those questioned include top industry bankers.
With the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recording more than 6,800 cases of bank fraud amounting to  ₹71,500 crore in 2018-19 alone, the probe agency on Tuesday said that the searches were based on complaints by the State Bank of India (SBI), PNB, Andhra Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, Indian Overseas Bank, Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, Dena Bank, Punjab & Sind Bank, Central Bank of India, Union Bank of India, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Bank of Maharashtra, and Bank of India.
The 169 premises were spread across Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Dadra and Nagar Haveli.
A CBI official said the probe agency has registered around 42 cases related to bank frauds involving more than  ₹7,200 crore. “Investigations and searches are ongoing,"" the official said.
The agency began its anti-corruption drive earlier this year to probe cases of financial crimes in association with the vigilance officers of concerned government departments, ministries and organisations, with the action being in consonance with “the CBI mandate of anti-corruption work"", a person familiar with the development said.
The move comes nearly two years after the  ₹14,356 crore scam involving PNB became the focus of both the CBI and the enforcement directorate (ED), with a global dragnet in place to try and arrest diamantaires Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi. The CBI and ED are currently pushing for their extradition from the UK and Antigua respectively.
Quick on the heels of the PNB scam which broke in February 2018, the agency registered a  ₹1,394.43 crore bank fraud case against Hyderabad-based Totem Infrastructure Ltd on a complaint by state-run Union Bank of India. That came just days after it registered a case against Chennai-based Kanishk Gold and its promoters for allegedly duping SBI and 13 other banks of  ₹824.15 crore.
In the budget session of Parliament this year, the Lok Sabha was informed that RBI in 2018-19 registered 921 cases of financial fraud involving ATM, debit and credit cards, and internet banking, each involving amounts of  ₹1 lakh and above."

Mumbai: The BSE Sensex lost all its morning gains in Friday’s session after it hit a lifetime high of 40,688.27 earlier in the session. The index was at 40,576 at 2 p.m., down 74 points or 0.2%. The morning gains were led by auto and banking stocks. Hopes of trade pact between US-China lifted the sentiments.
Market participants seemed to ignore Moody’s cutting India’s rating to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ as the index touched new highs. The rating agency said its decision to change the outlook to negative reflects increasing risks that economic growth will remain materially lower than in the past, partly “reflecting lower government and policy effectiveness at addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses, leading to a gradual rise in the debt burden from already high levels.""

NEW DELHI :
Private banks were among the top gainers on the Nifty 50 in afternoon trade on Friday, while stocks of information technology companies were the biggest laggards on the index.

Moody's lowered nation's outlook to negative from stable, while retaining the issuer rating at Baa2. The rating agency said its decision to change the outlook to negative reflects increasing risks that economic growth will remain materially lower than in the past, partly reflecting lower government and policy effectiveness at addressing long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses, leading to a gradual rise in the debt burden from already high levels."
80,2019-11-11,ICICI,"Yes Bank was the top gainer among Nifty 50 companies in early deals, rising up nearly 3%Shares of Bank of Baroda traded 4% higher on the bank of robust financial performance in Q2 

New Delhi: Here is a list of top stocks that are buzzing in early trade on Monday:
Ashok Leyland: Shares slipped nearly 3% in early deals as the company on Friday reported a whopping 92.6% year-on-year decline in net profit to  ₹39 crore for the quarter-ended September. The Hinduja Group-led company had posted a net profit of  ₹528 crore in the year ago period. Chairman Dheeraj Hinduja said the company’s volumes witnessed a significant drop in the quarter.
ICICI Bank: Shares were up marginally as the private lender, after market hours on Friday, said there is no impact of downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service on ICICI Bank Ltd’s India ratings. Moody’s had announced a rating action on the medium-term note, or MTN, programme rating for the bank’s Bahrain branch to align with Bahrain's sovereign rating.
Yes Bank: The stock was the top gainer among Nifty 50 companies in early deals and traded up nearly 3% due to optimism over prospects of the private lender receiving offers from potential investors for fund raising. Separately, ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buying 12.95 million of the bank’s shares worth  ₹87 crore has also been supporting the bullish sentiment.
JSW Steel: Shares traded 1% higher as credit ratings agency India Ratings has reaffirmed its long-term issuer rating of IND AA for non-convertible debentures programme. However, the agency revised its outlook for the company’s long-term rating to negative from stable due to fall in per-tonne margins and its impact on the company’s credit profile in the current financial year.
Bank of Baroda: The stock traded 4% higher on the bank of robust financial performance in the September quarter. The bank, after market hours on Friday, reported a five-fold jump in net profit to  ₹736 crore for the quarter ended September due to higher other income, which was buoyed by trading gains of  ₹942 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal compared with  ₹138 crore a year ago.
Lupin: Shares rose more than 2% as the pharmaceutical company received US Food and Drug Administration approval for Zileuton extended-release tablets to market a generic equivalent of Zyflo CR extended-release tablets, 600 mg, of Chiesi USA, Inc. Lupin's Zileuton extended-release tablets are used for prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and children above 12 years of age.
IDBI Bank: Shares gained nearly 3% as the bank’s net loss narrowed to  ₹3,458.8 crore due to higher net interest income, other income and fall in provisions for bad loans. The state-owned lender had posted a net loss of  ₹3,602.5 crore a year ago. Earlier this year, Life Insurance Corporation acquired a 51% controlling stake in the bank, which now operates as the subsidiary of the insurer."

Mumbai: The infrastructure sector drove private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments in India in October, forming 43% of the overall deals worth $3.3 billion, said a report by the Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association and consulting firm EY.
Even though October investments were on a par with the same month last year, infrastructure deals, at $1.4 billion, jumped to 43% of overall deals from 6% a year earlier.
Despite a slower October, 2019 continues to be a marquee year for PE/VC investments with the January-October period witnessing investments worth $43.7 billion, 16.5% more than the $37.5 billion investments received in the whole of 2018.
The largest infrastructure deal in October saw Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Public Sector Pension Investment Board and National Investment and Infrastructure Fund invest $1.1 billion in GVK Airport Holdings Ltd, contributed to one-third of deal making by value during the month.
Besides infrastructure, financial services at $832 million and technology, at $278 million, were the other two large contributors to PE/VC investments.
Overall, there were 91 deals in October, 42% higher on a year-on-year basis. There were five large deals (of value greater than $100 million) worth $2.2 billion compared to seven large deals worth $2.7 billion in October 2018.
In terms of deal types, growth transactions were most preferred as $1.7 billion flowed to 16 such deals, 12% lower than $1.9 billion in October 2018. This was followed by start-up investments worth $717 million across 64 deals, compared to $281 million across 33 deals and buyouts at $500 million across five deals versus $941 million across five deals, on a year-on-year basis.
The exits, however, were slower as the month saw 14 PE/VC exits worth $960 million, 30% lower than the value of exits recorded in October 2018 at $1.4 billion.
Open market exits dominated in October with $878 million worth exits across eight deals, accounting for 91% of total exits by value. The largest exit during the month was Fairfax’s 9.9% stake sale in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Company Ltd in the open market for $732 million. There was no PE-backed initial public offering in October 2019, which dragged down the exit numbers."

MUMBAI :
Indian equity market ended higher on Thursday led by gains in financial services and IT sectors.

The government released CPI inflation data after market hours on Wednesday. Retail Inflation jumped to 4.62% in October from 3.99% in September due to a surge in food inflation.
Contrary to the rise in CPI inflation, wholesale prices based inflation, or WPI, eased further to 0.16% in October from 0.33% in September due to subdued prices of non-food articles and fall in prices of manufactured items, according to the government data released today.
BSE Sensex gained 170.42 points or 0.42% to close at 40,286.48, while the Nifty 50 index climbed up 31.65 points or 0.27% ending at 11,872.10 in today’s trade.

SpiceJet Ltd tumbled 5.94% and closed at  ₹106.95 after the company reported a consolidated net loss of  ₹461.2 crore for the quarter-ended September due to rise in total expenditure.

The other suitors are said to include both strategic and financial investors and a state-run oil and gas company. Despite the diversified nature of operations of Videocon Industries, all potential bidders are expected to submit a comprehensive resolution plan and not bid for assets or business verticals piecemeal. Videocon Industries owns a stake in the prized Ravva oil field in the Krishna-Godavari basin and has a consumer and home appliances business with four manufacturing plants. The company also owns prime commercial real estate in different parts of India and also has a telecom arm which is not operational.

73,2019-11-19,ICICI,"Bank looks to expand lending and capture the market vacated by NBFCsICICI Bank has approached at least 10 investment banks on the proposed capital raising

Mumbai: ICICI Bank Ltd plans to raise at least  ₹20,000 crore by selling shares to institutional investors, in the biggest such capital raising in India, as the nation’s largest private lender looks to expand lending and compete with rivals to fill in the void left by shadow lenders after a crisis engulfed the sector.
The Mumbai-based bank has approached at least 10 investment banks on the proposed capital raising, and it may soon give a formal mandate to some of them, two people familiar with the bank’s plans said on condition of anonymity.
“The bank may sell a 6-7% equity stake. The plan is to raise the entire money in a single tranche. At one point, the plan was to raise the money through issuance of ADRs (American depositary receipts) but now as the market seems to be stabilizing, the plan is to raise the capital in India,"" said one of the two people.
Bolstering capital base will help ICICI Bank support loan growth at a time non-bank financiers are finding it difficult to raise funds because of a crisis of confidence triggered by the unexpected payment defaults by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) last year. The resulting liquidity squeeze has given banks the opportunity to win back market share they had lost to non-banks earlier.
“Banks have been keen on raising working capital, especially to be able to capture the lending market in the infrastructure sector that has been vacated by NBFCs,"" a Mumbai-based banking analyst said on condition of anonymity.
“The market is ripe and has enough appetite for such a placement, and if the bank is able to raise this money, they should use the opportunity to do so and use the capital in phases.""
An ICICI Bank spokesperson denied that the lender is in the process of raising capital.
On 26 October, ICICI Bank reported a 28% drop in net profit to  ₹655 crore for the September quarter. Its asset quality improved in the September quarter with gross non-performing assets (NPAs) at 6.37% compared with 6.49% in June quarter and 8.54% in the year-ago period. The bank’s net NPA also improved to 1.6% as against 1.77% in Q1FY20.
Several private sector lenders, too, are in the process of augmenting growth capital. Yes Bank Ltd recently announced plans to raise $1.2 billion within this fiscal. A 22 September Mint report said Axis Bank Ltd has raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest qualified institutional placement (QIP). In July, the bank’s board had approved a proposal to raise up to  ₹18,000 crore through an issue of equity shares, depository receipts, or convertible securities.
In 2017, State Bank of India had raised  ₹15,000 crore in the country’s largest QIP till then.
Private sector banks are finalizing their capital-raising plans at a time when the country’s non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are unable to grow their lending business.
NBFCs typically raise funds either from banks or mutual funds. Banks typically finance up to 60% of NBFC’s fund needs while about 30-35% comes from fixed income mutual funds. In the last two-and-a-half years, NBFCs have been increasingly approaching mutual funds for their funding requirements because banks have tightened their lending to NBFCs as their own NPAs grew. NBFCs are also facing refinancing risks with their commercial papers and non-convertible debentures set to mature this fiscal."
72,2019-11-19,ICICI,"Cement maker has appointed JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to the dealLarge firms such as UltraTech, ACC and Ambuja saw their sales volume decline in Q2

Shree Cement Ltd, India’s third largest cement maker, is at an advanced stage of raising more than  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, two people aware of the development said.
“The money will be used for capex and debt reduction. They have been meeting investors for this purpose and are targeting to close this fundraise within this quarter,"" said one of the two people cited above. “They could raise anywhere between  ₹2000- ₹3000 crore depending on demand from investors.""
Shree Cement has hired JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to manage the QIP, the people said, requesting anonymity. QIP is a tool, through which listed companies can sell shares, debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
While e-mails written to Shree Cement and JM Financial remained unanswered, ICICI Securities declined to comment on the matter.
Cement producers in the country have been hit by a prolonged monsoon season and falling cement prices amid an ongoing demand slump. While other large cement producers such as UltraTech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd saw their sales volume decline in the September quarter, Shree Cement was an exception.
In the quarter ended 30 September, the Rajasthan-based cement maker’s sales volume grew marginally at 1.5% to 5.72 million tonnes and net realizations rose 9% to  ₹4,654 per tonne from a year earlier. The company’s profit also rose over five times to  ₹309 crore, compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal.
On 19 October, the company’s board had said that it planned to raise as much as  ₹3,000 crore equity, in one or more tranches, through QIPs. It planned to use these funds for inorganic growth opportunities that may come up over the next 12-18 months, according to a 22 October note by HDFC Securities.
“Markets have done well recently and we have seen a few QIPs getting closed with Bajaj Finance raising almost $1.2 billion. In this environment, companies are eager to re-look at equity deals and we may see some more QIPs hitting the market,"" said the first person.
As of October, five companies have raised  ₹17,930 crore via QIPs, exceeding the  ₹10,489 crore raised by 13 firms in the entire fiscal year 2018, according to primary market tracker Prime Database.
Recently, consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd mopped up  ₹8,500 crore through private placements to qualified institutional investors. Subscribed over five times its size, the QIP got interest from foreign institutional investors including BlackRock, Nomura and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.
In September, private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest QIP from domestic institutions and large foreign investors, including GIC, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Nomura and American investors T Rowe Price and BlackRock. In August, another private lender, Yes Bank Ltd also raised  ₹1,930.46 crore through a QIP."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

NEW DELHI :
From December 1, expect less traffic at toll plazas across highways in India but also get ready to pay double the toll tax if FASTag is missing from your vehicle. To promote seamless movement of vehicles and minimise traffic congestion at toll plazas, the ministry of road transport and highways has made it mandatory for all vehicles to have FASTags.
What is FASTag
Based on radio frequency identification (RFID) technology, FASTag is affixed on windscreen of vehicles. FASTag-affixed vehicles do not have to stop at toll gates as charges are deducted from the prepaid or bank account when the vehicle is moving. Drivers do not have to stop their vehicle to make transactions as the toll collection will be done electronically under the National Electronic Toll Collection (NETC) programme.
The new FASTag rule
From December 1, all lanes in all toll fee plazas on national highways across the country will turn into dedicated FASTag lanes.

If you are passing without FASTag, you will be charged double the fee.
One lane has been kept as hybrid where FASTags as well as other modes of payment will be accepted.
How to buy FASTags and recharge it
Besides select bank branches and point-of-sale at toll plazas of national highways, selected bank branches, FASTags can be bought online through e-commerce portal Amazon. After you buy it, you need to activate it by entering details in My FASTag mobile app. After that, you need to link the tag to an existing bank account for deduction of toll tax.
You can recharge your FASTag account using debit card, credit card, netbanking, etc. Otherwise, you can also link it directly to your bank account and thus
A cashback of 2.5% is being offered for 2019-20 in order to incentivise road users for FASTag use. According to the highways ministry, more than 6 million FASTags were issued till September, with overall cumulative ETC collection of over  ₹12,850 crore since inception."

HYDERABAD :
GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) on Sunday said it has introduced 'FASTag Parking' for its customers in line with the Central governments vision of 'One Nation One Tag FASTag' for quicker entry and exit from the airport. Said to be the country's first, FASTag Car Park was launched in collaboration with NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India), which would help passengers and visitors at the airport have quicker entry and exit from the airport car park zone, a press release from GMR said here.
Dedicated FASTag Lanes have been created at the entry and exit, which ensure zero waiting time.
The facility was initially started with ICICI FASTag and would be rolled out through other major banks gradually.
Non-FASTag vehicles would continue to use the existing parking system, it said.
Speaking about the initiative, airport CEO SGK Kishore said, ""We are glad to announce the introduction of India's first FASTag Parking system at the Hyderabad International Airport. This new parking system provides hassle-free and quick movement in the parking zone. It is also aligned with government of Indias efforts for digitalisation and cashless transactions.""
The FASTag solution is based on a simple-to-use reloadable electronic radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology tag which enables automatic deduction of applicable parking charges, while one drives through the car park without stopping for any cash transaction.

64,2019-11-22,ICICI,"He is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India IndexHis top picks include HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank Ltd

India’s banking sector may witness a turnaround, after recent rule changes put banks in a better position to get their money back from insolvent companies, according to Ridham Desai, managing director at Morgan Stanley India Co.
A Supreme Court ruling last week not only paved the way for ArcelorMittal’s purchase of Essar Steel India Ltd., an Indian steel mill, but also allowed banks to set the terms of the distribution of sale proceeds among creditors. The move to empower banks “has settled several disputes"" around India’s bankruptcy law introduced in 2016, Desai said at a conference in Singapore on Thursday.
“Last week’s judgment may well prove to be an inflection point for the sector,"" Desai said, adding that banks previously were not well-placed to recover loans. “I would be fairly optimistic of the banking sector in India.""
Indian lenders, which are saddled with some of the world’s worst bad-loan ratios, are expected to get a boost from increased regulatory oversight of the shadow banking sector as well, he added. The government last week introduced rules to help creditors recover loans due from large shadow lenders.
Meanwhile, authorities have also stepped up surveillance of non-banking financial companies of late, seizing control of another institution, Dewan Housing Finance Corp., which has total debt of about $12.5 billion.
The Mumbai-based analyst is overweight financials by two percentage points versus the MSCI India Index, with a preference for seven financial firms including HDFC Bank Ltd. and ICICI Bank Ltd. The NSE Nifty Bank Index, a gauge of the most liquid and large-cap banking stocks in the country, has risen 15% this year and is near a record high.
Furthermore, the government’s planned capital injection into public sector banks, which account for 65% of the industry, is “the biggest cyclical fix"" that will support the sector, according to Desai. In August, the Indian government announced a series of state-bank mergers and a capital injection of  ₹55,250 ($7.7 billion) -- its most sweeping bank overhaul in decades -- in a bid to revive the economy.
“You should see signs of a new credit cycle in the next 12 months,"" Desai said.

65,2019-11-23,ICICI,"On 20 November, RBI superseded the board of DHFL and appointed an administrator in its placeThe advisory panel comprises IDFC First’s Rajiv Lall, ICICI Pru’s N.S. Kannan and Amfi’s N.S. Venkatesh

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India, bolstering its role as a financial services regulator, set up a three-member advisory committee on Friday to assist the administrator it has appointed for Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) to ensure that the debt-laden company’s asset quality does not worsen any further.
On Wednesday, the RBI superseded DHFL’s board and said it will refer the mortgage lender to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
In a statement, the RBI said the advisory committee—comprising Rajiv Lall, non-executive chairman, IDFC First Bank Ltd, N.S. Kannan, managing director and CEO at ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd, and N.S. Venkatesh, chief executive of the Association of Mutual Funds in India—will work closely with DHFL administrator R. Subramaniakumar.
Subramaniakumar, the former managing director and chief executive of Indian Overseas Bank, will manage DHFL’s affairs once it is admitted to the NCLT under the revised Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) for financial service providers.
The central bank’s initiative seeks to secure the interests of creditors, including over 100,000 fixed deposit holders of DHFL, as a delay in resolution can lead to a rise in slippages and higher non-performing assets for the HFC, which stopped lending a few months ago.
While the 15 November change in IBC regulations mandated the appointment of an advisory committee within 45 days of the commencement of insolvency proceedings, the RBI, in this case, is trying to fast-track the process for a quick resolution.
The revised guidelines were part of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019.
The RBI is now set to move the NCLT for appointing the administrator as the insolvency resolution professional. Subsequently, the resolution professional will chair the meetings of the advisory committee once the insolvency process starts. The compensation for the members of the committee will be part of the costs of the insolvency process.
According to Karan Mitroo, partner of law firm Luthra and Luthra, financial services is a specialized field and its problems are industry-specific. “Hence, the committee members, who are adept in running financial services providers, have been appointed with the intent that their wisdom and experience is used to run the operations of the company as smoothly as possible.""
DHFL is the first non-bank lender to be referred to the NCLT, after the RBI superseded its board following concerns over poor governance practices and payment defaults.
The RBI sprang a surprise on DHFL’s lenders on Wednesday, when it superseded its board. In fact, four bankers told Mint, a majority of DHFL’s lenders were in a meeting at SBI Capital Markets’ office in Cuffe Parade in South Mumbai, when they came to know about the RBI’s move.
Under its new powers, the RBI can take over administration of privately-held financial services companies. It can also remove auditors, call for an audit of any group company and have a say on the compensation of the top management of an NBFC."

59,2019-11-26,ICICI,"Analysts expect Zudio to emerge as a big growth driver for Trent, although its current contribution to revenues is comparatively smallAt the end of FY19, Trent had 150 Westside stores and 40 Zudio stores

Shares of Trent Ltd have risen nearly 40% this fiscal year. The company is on an expansion mode and at the same time delivering in terms of financial performance. This is helpful, especially at a time when many consumer-oriented firms are feeling the heat from a demand slowdown. Trent primarily operates stores across four concepts— Westside, Zudio, Star and Landmark, with Westside as its flagship chain.
One factor that has helped Trent get the price-conscious Indian consumer’s attention is by making its products available at attractive price points, particularly at Westside and Zudio. In FY20 so far, both these formats have fired on growth.
For the six months ended 30 September, the company’s stand-alone revenue increased by 31% to  ₹1,585 crore from a year earlier. Analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd’s retail equity research said in a report on 8 November, “Revenues from the Westside format grew 23% year-on-year, driven by robust like-to-like sales growth of 13% in H1FY20."" Like-to-like sales is a parameter that measures growth from organically comparable stores. “Trent’s value fashion business under the ‘Zudio’ brand has seen exceptional ramp-up with revenues growing 2 times in H1FY20,"" said the broker. However, this is on a relatively smaller base.
At the end of FY19, Trent had 150 Westside stores and 40 Zudio stores.
Analysts expect Zudio to emerge as a big growth driver for Trent, although its current contribution to revenues is comparatively small.
According to Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd’s estimates, Zudio will see 70/80/100 store adds in FY20/21/22, taking its total store strength to 290 by FY22. The broker expects Zudio’s revenue to hit  ₹1,450 crore by FY22. “Thus, Zudio is expected to contribute 26% to Trent’s overall revenue; contribution toward Ebitda is also expected at similar level,"" the Motilal analysts said in a report on 22 November. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The company is adding stores in the Westside format as well. Strong execution on store additions will be a key factor to monitor for the stock, although the sharp appreciation in the share price does suggest that a good share of the optimism is baked into the valuations, capping near-term upsides. Nonetheless, if Trent continues to deliver strong numbers, valuations could well find support.
On the flip side, losses in the hypermarket format have some analysts worried. “Bloated losses in its joint venture (mainly Trent Hypermarket) remains a key concern,"" said ICICI analysts."

FASTag is an electronic toll collection device installed in vehicles to help drivers drive through toll plazas without having to stop to make physical payments. Ministry of Road Transport & Highways (MoRTH) for National Highways has issued a directive which states that from December 1 onwards, payments at toll plazas on National Highways will be accepted digitally through FASTag only. This consequentially eliminates the need for commuters to stop and make the payment in cash.
This Radio Frequency Identification Device (RFID) tag is affixed on the windscreen of the vehicle. It is an easy to use, reloadable tag which enables automatic deduction of toll charges and lets the vehicle pass through the toll plaza without stopping for cash transaction.
However, if you have not yet equipped your vehicle with the FASTag, you can still do so now. Apart from the 28,500 Point-of-Sale (PoS) terminals, FASTag may be purchased by visiting websites of different member banks such as SBI, ICICI Bank, Axis bank, Paytm Payment Banks, HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra, IDFC First Bank.

56,2019-11-27,ICICI,"The economy’s momentum continues to slow with 10 of the 16 high-frequency indicators tracked by the Mint Macro Tracker in the red as of October

The Indian economy’s report card continued to disappoint in October, with most indicators of economic activity flashing red, shows the latest edition of the Mint Macro Tracker.
The tracker, launched in October last year, provides a monthly state-of-the-economy report based on trends across 16 high-frequency economic indicators. In October, 10 of the 16 indicators were in red (below the five-year average trend). This was the fifth month in a row when half or more of the sixteen indicators were in red. Only five indicators were in green (above the five-year average trend) for the latest month, while one maintained the trend.
The latest reading shows a sharp deterioration from six months ago, when seven indicators were in red and seven in green. The deterioration looks even worse when compared to a year ago, when only six indicators were in red, while nine were in green.
All four variables of the consumer economy—passenger vehicle sales growth, broadband subscriber growth, tractor sales growth and domestic air passenger growth—were in red for the ninth successive month in October. The decline in passenger vehicle sales— which has come to represent the consumption slowdown-- was less severe in October compared to a month ago. In fact, it was the smallest decline in the last six months. However, that does not seem to have brought much cheer as other parts of the consumer economy remain subdued.
“Even as some indicators such as retail auto sales have somewhat improved, we are wary of trying to identify green shoots yet given the breadth of the slowdown, and with some key headwinds persisting,"" said an ICICI Securities Primary Dealership report dated November 13. “…Tighter credit conditions would continue to weigh on any demand revival, and this would also have negative spillovers,"" it said.
The consumption slowdown has also taken a toll on the producer economy, with all four indicators—Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) composite, core infrastructure sector growth, banks’ non-food credit growth, and rail freight traffic growth — in the red. The PMI composite index (which reflects private sector activity across manufacturing and services sectors) showed a decline (a reading below 50) for the second consecutive month in October. Core sector growth (an index of eight key industries) declined 5.2 percent in September, the latest month for which data is available. Non-food credit growth also fell to slowest rate in 23 months in September, the data shows. The weekly data on credit growth released by the central bank suggests that non-food credit growth continued to be tepid in October. This estimate for October is only a rough estimate based on comparisons of weekly figures since monthly figures have not been published yet.
“We believe bank lending conditions are likely to stay tight given still high NPA’s and risks from exposure to NBFC’s that continue to face difficulty in accessing credit in local markets,"" the afore-mentioned ICICI securities report said.
Earlier this month, the ratings agency, Moody’s Investors Service warned that a prolonged credit squeeze among India’s lenders may worsen, as it downgraded India’s outlook to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’. Since then, the central bank has stepped up efforts to stem the rot in the shadow banking sector, which has been at the heart of the credit squeeze in the economy over the past year. RBI has also been cutting rates since February, and is widely expected to continue to do so in the next monetary policy meeting on December 5 even as economists begin to question the efficacy of the rate cuts. The inflation overshoot in October to 4.6 percent, beyond the central bank’s medium term target of 4 percent, complicates matters further. The latest reading has raised the spectre of stagflation after a long time, and could limit rate cuts in future.
The only silver lining in India’s report card lies on the external front. In October, India’s trade balance (as a share of total trade) improved, while labour-intensive exports maintained above-average trend. Rising fund flows helped strengthen the exchange rate and India’s import cover also saw an improvement. As a result, India’s external metrics look less vulnerable than they did a couple of months ago. However, it is worth noting that the improvement in the trade balance has largely been on account of a reduction in imports rather than a pick-up in exports, which mirrors the weakening momentum of the domestic economy.
Given that several other emerging markets are also going through a tough phase, India’s relative attractiveness among emerging markets appears high, as these pages have highlighted earlier. However, it remains an open question how long the relative attractiveness remains, given the weakening domestic momentum."

54,2019-11-28,ICICI,"Sebi has allowed a settlement at  ₹28,68,650The order comes at a time when brokerage firms are facing increased scrutiny for lack of diligence and misusing client securities

MUMBAI :
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has allowed ICICI Securities to settle a case in which the brokerage had dealt with entities which had fraudulently acquired physical shares from dormant accounts and dematerialised them in accounts of bogus entities. An order published on the regulator’s website on Thursday showed it has allowed a settlement at  ₹28,68,650.
According to Sebi, certain entities were dematerializing and selling shares of dormant accounts using forged documents. An investigation found physical share certificates of 14 listed companies were fraudulently acquired in the names of 26 non-existing bogus entities, and ICICI Securities, India’s largest broking firm in terms of clients, had dealt with two of them.
“These shares were then dematted in the fraudulently opened demat accounts of these 26 non-existing bogus entities with different addresses, but using same or similar looking photographs at different points of time,"" the Sebi order said.
The order did not specify whether ICICI Securities facilitated any of these fraudulent transactions. However, Sebi charged the firm with lack of due-diligence in dealing with these two entities.
The case is also being investigated by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW), Mumbai.
“As these two entities were non-existing bogus entities, it was alleged that there was lack of diligence by the applicant (ICICI Securities) in dealing with them,"" Sebi said in its order.
The regulator’s order comes at a time when brokerage firms are facing increased scrutiny for lack of diligence and misusing client securities. Sebi is currently investigating several broking firms, starting with Karvy Stock Broking Ltd which is alleged to have misused client securities for other unauthorised purposes. Sebi and exchanges are examining a dozen more firms for unethical and fraudulent practices."
53,2019-11-28,ICICI,"Analysts say improving asset quality, progress in loan growth, net interest margin, insurance premium growth are the key value drivers working in favour of the ICICI BankMorgan Stanley on Wed took an 'overweight' view on the ICICI stock, which in market parlance signifies that a particular stock will outperform others in its sector

MUMBAI :
The ICICI Bank stock on Thursday hit its 52-week high of  ₹518.60 apiece on the BSE after global brokerage firm Morgan Stanley said in a report that India's second largest private lender can double its share price in the next couple of years.
Morgan Stanley on Wednesday took an 'overweight' view on the ICICI stock, which in market parlance signifies that a particular stock will outperform others in its sector or in the market.
""The stock has done well over the last 18 months, but at nearly 7.5 times FY21E core PPoP, valuation is still at a deep discount to private peers — and recent policy moves should provide a significant boost to multiples,"" Morgan Stanley said.
""Our new one-year target price is  ₹775 (about 55% upside) and in two years the stock could be worth  ₹1,000 (about 100% upside). We also raise our ADR target price to $21.50,"" the report added.
Among the factors that analysts say are working in favour of the bank is its improving asset quality, progress in loan growth, net interest margin (NIM) and insurance premium growth are the key value drivers for ICICI Bank.
Instead, a severe slowdown in the economy, slower-than-expected loan growth recovery and major volatility on news flow around the bank's top management are the key negatives.
ICICI Bank last month had reported a 27.94% decline in its standalone net profit for the second quarter of 2019-20, due to higher tax expenses. The bank's net profit in the second quarter declined to  ₹655 crore from  ₹909 crore in the year-ago quarter.
The lender's tax expense during the quarter under review rose to  ₹3,712 crore from  ₹347 crore reported for the corresponding quarter of last fiscal, on the back of one-time additional charge of  ₹2,920 crore due to re-measurement of accumulated deferred tax assets consequent to a reduction in marginal tax from 35% to 25%."
49,2019-12-02,ICICI,"Lender appoints ICICI Securities, IIFL Securities and IDFC Securities as advisersMove follows RBL Bank announcement that it would raise equity capital not exceeding  ₹3,500 cr

Mumbai: Private lender RBL Bank Ltd is looking to raise up to  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, three people aware of the development said, requesting anonymity.
“The bank has appointed ICICI Securities, IIFL Securities and IDFC Securities as advisers to the transaction. The roadshows have already happened in the US, Europe and Asia markets and the timing of the QIP launch will be decided soon,"" said one of the persons cited above. “The bank is in the process of negotiating with some marquee investors and may go for a preferential issue if the talks fructify.""
QIP is a tool used by listed companies to sell shares, debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer such as mutual funds and foreign institutions.
The development follows RBL Bank announcement to shareholders at its annual general meeting on 9 July that it would raise equity capital not exceeding  ₹3,500 crore. The bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 12.3% as of 30 September, falling from 13.7% in the last fiscal.
Between July-September, the bank’s asset quality also worsened as its gross non-performing loans jumped 95% to  ₹1,539 crore from  ₹789.21 crore in the same period last year. As a percentage of total loans, its gross bad loans ratio nearly doubled to 2.6% from 1.38% during the period while profit fell 73% to  ₹54 crore. That put the bank’s stock under pressure as it tanked from a 52-week high of  ₹716.40 on NSE in May this year to a 52-week low of  ₹230.55 on 23 October.
“The bank’s stock has not performed well and that has made raising equity capital quite difficult as the dilution would be much higher at its current price. It is most likely that the bank would do a preferential issue, along with a QIP for public market investors. But a full QIP is also possible if the investor interest remains weak,"" said the second of the three people cited above.
On 22 November, CNBC TV18 reported that RBL Bank was in talks with a strategic investor, Bajaj Holdings & Investment and two private equity firms- ChrysCapital and Blackstone, for the proposed share sale, which could help it raise about  ₹2,000 crore to shore up its capital base.
While IIFL did not respond to an emailed query, ICICI Securities and IDFC Securities declined to comment.
Responding to an emailed query, a spokesperson for RBL Bank said, “The query is speculative in nature and as a matter of policy, we do not comment on it.""
In 2017, the bank had raised  ₹1,680 crore of equity capital by selling 32.6 million shares for  ₹515 apiece on a preferential basis to its existing investors, UK’s development finance institution CDC Group Plc, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Steadview Capital Mauritius and Multiples Private Equity, among others.
The 76-year-old bank, which was historically concentrated in south-west Maharashtra and northern Karnataka, has grown to become a pan-India lender with a network of 346 branches and 394 ATMs, serving over 7.3 million customers.
As of October, eight companies have raised  ₹ 22,312.87 crore through QIPs, exceeding the  ₹16,587.43 crore raised by 25 firms in the full year 2018, according to primary market tracker Prime Database.
Recently, consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd mopped up  ₹8,500 crore through private placements to qualified institutional investors. Subscribed over five times its size, the QIP received interest from foreign institutional investors including BlackRock, Nomura and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund, GIC.
In September, private lender Axis Bank Ltd raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest QIP from domestic institutions and large foreign investors, including GIC, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Nomura, T Rowe Price and BlackRock. In August, another private lender, Yes Bank Ltd raised  ₹1,930.46 crore through a QIP. In 2017, State Bank of India had raised  ₹15,000 crore in the nation’s largest QIP."
52,2019-12-02,ICICI,"At 0926, shares of Bharti Airtel were up nearly 9% at  ₹480.80Reliance Industries Ltd—parent of Reliance Jio Infocomm--was nearly 4% higher at  ₹1609.50

NEW DELHI :
Shares of telecom companies jumped in early deals on Monday as India’s major private operators—Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Reliance Jio Infocomm—are set to hike tariffs this week.
At 0926, shares of Bharti Airtel were up nearly 9% at  ₹480.80, while those of Vodafone Idea soared 17.3%. Reliance Industries Ltd—parent of Reliance Jio Infocomm--was nearly 4% higher at  ₹1609.50. The BSE telecom index surged 7.3% to 1,197.65 points.
Analysts at ICICI Securities are bullish on both Airtel, Vodafone Idea and have a ‘buy’ rating on the stocks.
“We have incorporated the just-announced tariff hikes in our model and increased our EBITDA estimate for Bharti by 23% and 24% for FY21E and FY22E respectively. Consequently, we increase our target price to Rs550 (from Rs450), but we cut our EBITDA multiple for India business to 9x FY22E (from 11x FY22E, as our earlier multiple had option value of tariff increase, or a 2-player market, which is now included in the model). We move Voda Idea’s rating from ‘under review’ to BUY with a target price of Rs8. We still see AGR liability resolution as key for VIL’s long-term value creation. Bharti Airtel remains our preferred pick,"" the brokerage said in a report.
On Sunday, Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd said they will raise prices of their prepaid voice and data services, ending a protracted tariff war that dragged rates to the lowest in the world. The increases in most plans announced by the three operators are in the range of 15-47%. While the new tariffs for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be effective starting Tuesday, Reliance Jio’s revised tariffs will come into effect on 6 December.
The tariff hike by the three operators is the first of its kind in more than a decade after years of competition ensured prices of calls and data services hit rock bottom.
“Telecom sector was reeling under multiple problems such as low tariffs, regulatory issues including AGR liability, cash burn, stretched balance sheet. We believe the just-announced tariff hikes of 15-40% were much required and will likely remedy most of the problems of the industry,"" said ICICI Securities.
With the latest tariff hike, the brokerage firm also expects the blended average revenue per user (ARPU) to increase by 21%.
“We have tried to work out the increase in blended ARPU for Bharti and Voda Idea based on their Q2FY20 numbers. However, since the companies don’t disclose the breakup, our entire working is based on our assumptions. Our working shows Bharti’s blended ARPU increasing by 21% to Rs156 from Rs128 and Voda Idea’s too by 21% to Rs131 from Rs107,"" ICICI Securities added.
According to brokerage firm Emkay Global, based on tariff hikes, sector revenues/EBITDA “will increase by  ₹530 billion/Rs420 billion given no major SIM consolidation. Risk can be on bottom-of-the-pyramid consumer spending behavior after the steep hikes.""
""We think, (tariff hike) would boost revenue growth. However, operators face large payouts after the adverse SC decision on the AGR matter and would need government support to mitigate the burden. We continue to like Bharti Airtel"", said BNP Paribas in a 25 November note.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, already reeling under heavy debt, reported record losses in the September quarter because of an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators. On 24 October, the Supreme Court directed telcos to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, along with two others, have filed a plea in the Supreme Court to review the verdict.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is spectrum dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices, the companies that it acquired).
In a relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on 20 November approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments.
Jefferies India expect despite the price hike, additional government relief measures are important. The brokerage firm expect a moratorium on AGR dues for the next two years, aiding cash flows. A reduction in license fee (helps Bharti/VodaIdea's EBITDA by 5%/28%) and an extension of interconnect usage charges (IUC) are also likely."
51,2019-12-02,ICICI,"Chanda Kochhar's counsel sought permission to amend the petition in view of the reply filed by ICICI BankChanda Kochhar said the lender denied the remuneration agreed to her, though its board accepted her early retirement plea

MUMBAI :
The Bombay high court on Monday granted former ICICI Bank chief executive Chanda Kochhar time till 9 December to amend her petition challenging the termination of her service by the private sector lender.
Senior advocate Vikram Nankani, appearing on behalf of Kochhar, sought permission to amend the petition in view of the reply filed by ICICI Bank. On Monday, senior counsel Darius Khambata filed an affidavit on behalf of ICICI Bank saying the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had approved Kochhar’s termination post-facto. The bank also produced the RBI approval letter as part of its submission.
Following this, Kochhar’s counsel requested the court to allow his client to amend the petition, which had termed the termination of her services as a contravention of the law on the grounds that it did not have the previous approval of RBI. Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, requires prior approval of the central bank before terminating the services of the managing director of a bank.
She also said the lender had denied the agreed remuneration to her, although her plea for early retirement, with effect from 4 October 2018, was accepted by the board of directors of ICICI Bank.
Kochhar had moved the high court against ICICI Bank on 30 November. A committee led by former Supreme Court Justice B.N. Srikrishna was appointed to investigate the allegations of quid pro quo involving Videocon Industries, which had taken loans from ICICI Bank and subsequently invested the money in NuPower Renewables, a company founded by Chanda Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar.
While the panel indicted Chanda Kochhar, the board terminated her employment earlier this year after taking into consideration the enquiry committee report. The board also informed Kochhar that it has decided to treat her separation from the bank as ‘termination for cause’ under the internal policies, and also asked her to return the entire amount of  ₹7.42 crore paid to her in bonuses between April 2009 and March 2018."

Mumbai: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Tuesday gave Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) time till 10 December to pass an order in the plea filed by Bajaj Finance Ltd against the capital market regulator’s move to transfer pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
Sebi has estimated the total exposure of lenders to Karvy at  ₹2,800 crore, of which Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore as per a copy of the petition reviewed by Mint.
Bajaj Finance is aggrieved by the Sebi order, which prevents it from accessing its pledged shares. The firm claimed that it has the right to its pledged securities and that Sebi was wrong in returning the securities to the accounts of Karvy’s clients.
HDFC Bank Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd and some other lenders also joined Bajaj Finance on Tuesday in its plea against the Sebi move. An order in their pleas will be passed later. SAT asked Sebi to hear Bajaj Finance’s plea by Wednesday.
Early on Monday, the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE) and the BSE suspended Karvy’s trading licence for all segments due to non-compliance with the exchange’s and Sebi norms. Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) and MSEI also suspended the licence of the brokerage firm.\
This action follows the 22 November order by Sebi which had said the brokerage firm misused client securities and used it for other purposes. Karvy had sold clients securities and the proceeds were transferred to related party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd.
Sebi’s prompt action against Karvy has resulted in nearly 83,000 investors getting back their securities, which were illegally transferred by the brokerage firm to its own account and were even pledged without any authorisation.
With the latest transfer by National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL), nearly 90% investors have got back their securities and the remaining ones will get after clearing their dues.
Karvy took loans to the tune of  ₹600 crore by pledging securities worth more than  ₹2,300 crore of 95,000 clients with lenders. Of these, 95,000 clients, nearly 83,000 of them have got their securities.
On 20 November, Bajaj Finance issued a loan recall notice to Karvy and the pledges against the loan would have been invoked on 23 November. Sebi had on 22 November barred depositories from transferring securities from Karvy’s account except to beneficial owners or clients who had paid in full. The petition also says Karvy had given a false undertaking to Bajaj Finance that these securities belonged to the brokerage."
47,2019-12-03,ICICI,"Lenders move tribunal to recover over  ₹1,000 cr loans from the brokerageSebi’s 22 November order said Karvy had misused client securities, pledging them to raise money

Mumbai: India’s top two private banks, HDFC Bank Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd, on Tuesday fought to lay their hands on client shares that Karvy Stock Broking Ltd had pledged with them, seeking to recover  ₹1,000 crore they had lent to the brokerage.
The case will require the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) to address a core dilemma: who owns these shares — the client who bought the shares, or the lender who advanced money against them without verifying their actual ownership?
At Tuesday’s hearing, the lenders sought to quash a 22 November order by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which prevented them from accessing these shares. They also wanted SAT to set aside the National Securities Depository Ltd’s (NSDL) transfer of these securities to client accounts on Monday. Consequently, they have also made NSDL and the National Stock Exchange parties to the case.
The lenders said in their petitions that following the Sebi order, they had requested the regulator not to initiate any action on transferring these shares to clients as they had bona fide rights to them. The two banks told the tribunal that it was common industry practice to lend against pledged shares (LAS) and there was no reason to suspect Karvy’s claim that it owned these shares.
Sebi’s 22 November order said Karvy had misused client securities, pledging them to raise money, some of which was transferred to related-party businesses such as Karvy Realty Ltd. SAT will rule on the banks’ petition on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, while ruling on a Bajaj Finance Ltd plea of a similar nature, SAT asked Sebi to hear the lender’s representation and pass appropriate orders by 10 December and put a stop to any more transfer of securities to clients’ accounts. A petition by IndusInd Bank was also merged with the petitions by HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank. The brokerage firm owes the lender  ₹132.50 crore against pledged shares.
Mint reported on 3 December that NSDL had transferred securities worth  ₹2,013.77 crore to the accounts of 83,306 clients. Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. Bajaj Finance has an exposure of  ₹345 crore.
In its petition, HDFC Bank claimed that following the Sebi direction, the loan which was earlier secured by pledged shares had suddenly become unsecured as it cannot access those shares.
During the course of arguments, the lenders said LAS facilities are a common market practice and are routinely used by brokers for working capital and margin requirements. The lenders said their loan sanction letters specifically stated that pledged shares belonged to Karvy, its group companies or its promoters.
The Sebi counsel, however, said banks should have ascertained the ownership of these shares and conducted better due diligence. Counsel Rafique Dada said banks remained ignorant despite the Sebi circular of June 2019, which ruled that brokers cannot pledge clients’ securities and starting 1 October, brokers had to unwind such pledges.
HDFC Bank, however, countered that since the shares were from Karvy’s account, it believed that the broker was the owner of the securities and “there was no reason to enquire or ascertain whether these securities belonged to Karvy or any of its clients"".
ICICI Bank said in its petition that such an order without hearing the bankers is detrimental to its 800,000 public shareholders and banking customers. On 5 November, ICICI Bank had issued a notice to Karvy to return all the loans, failing which it would invoke the pledges for recovery.
The lenders also alleged that Sebi and NSDL did not respond to their requests on transfer of securities to clients’ accounts, which would leave them with almost no shares.
NSDL said that it complied with Sebi’s 22 November directions and transferred securities to the beneficial owners, which are the clients. In fact, the depository conducted a board meeting before taking a call as this was not a routine case, but one of alleged fraud."

42,2019-12-04,ICICI,"Large-cap indices are soaring but only a narrow sub-set of stocks is doing wellGiven the downturn in the economy it may become difficult for the stocks to maintain these levels

Large-cap funds have cornered a large proportion of the inflows into mutual fund schemes in the quarter ending 30 September 2019, according to a report from Morningstar that looked at domestic fund flows. The majority of the money went to three large-cap funds—Mirae Asset Large Cap, Axis Bluechip and ICICI Prudential Bluechip. Exchange-traded funds also saw an increase in the money flow during the quarter.
While some stocks in the large-cap space may be seen as overvalued and expensive given the divergence between the run-up in market prices and corporate earnings, it will continue to be a favoured space given the greater resilience these companies have during an economic slowdown. Also, foreign money primarily flows into index stocks, giving them greater liquidity-led momentum. If you are looking to invest in the large-cap space, then actively-managed funds and ETFs or index funds are your primary options. Which should you choose?
The debate between active and passive investing has been long and inconclusive. The principal argument for passive investment options like index funds and ETFs is the inability of actively-managed funds to consistently outperform the indices, post costs.
This is particularly true since capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has defined the portfolio composition of different categories of funds in terms of the exposure that funds can take to various segments of the market. Large-cap funds are required to hold at least 80% of their portfolio in the top 100 stocks by market capitalization. This gives very little leeway for a fund manager to beat the benchmark with a portfolio that looks different from the index in a significant manner.
While the under-performance may be true as a rule, the current situation in the large-cap stock space may have made large-cap funds a viable option for investors to consider vis-à-vis index funds and ETFs. Here’s why.
ETFs soar along with large-cap indices
Large-cap indices, such as the S&P BSE Sensex, are at all-time highs with the one-year forward price-earnings ratio close to the peak of the bull markets in January 2008. “The liquidity from the FII inflows which touched as much as $13 billion this year has powered the rally,"" said Arun Thukral, managing director and chief executive officer, Axis Securities. “Investors are looking at medium- to long-term perspective and the valuations may not look that expensive,"" he added.
The S&P BSE Sensex TRI gave returns of 14.4% in the last one year and returns from passively-managed funds are in line with this. But the rise in the index has been fuelled by a narrow sub-set of stocks which have become very expensive and now have a higher weightage in the indices.
Given the downturn in the economy it may become difficult for the stocks to maintain these levels, especially if money flows out from them, and they may see a steep correction and take the index funds and ETFs down with them.
But active funds can protect downside
“When you invest in companies at peak margins and peak multiples there is no margin for error,"" said Anish Tawakley, senior fund manager at ICICI Prudential Asset Management Co. Ltd. This is where large-cap funds may score over index funds.
Actively-managed funds can help provide downside protection. In other words, they fall less than the market because they have the flexibility to exit or reduce exposure to stocks that are seen as expensive and construct a portfolio of stocks and sectors that are fairly valued and have the potential to give better returns when the economy revives.
“The industry still has a solid three-decade record of generating alpha—despite some aberration, we believe that our markets still offer a strong case of decent alpha creation,"" said Neelesh Surana, chief investment officer, Mirae Asset Global Investments (I) Ltd.
In a rising market, passive investment strategies become hard to beat. But in volatile and declining markets, actively-managed funds are better positioned to generate risk-adjusted returns.
“We believe managed funds can bring value because there are mispricing opportunities in the market. They are better able to identify and avoid overvalued stocks and they have the opportunity to take some cash positions too,"" said Tawakley. “The value end of the market has been totally abandoned. There are reasonably healthy companies available at fair valuation and there are a lot of opportunities there,"" he added, highlighting the advantage of stock selection that actively-managed funds have currently.
Which one should you choose?
There are some large-cap funds that have beaten the much-watched indices like the Nifty and the Sensex even in this steep but narrow run-up in the markets. The Axis Bluechip and BNP Large Cap are among the funds that have out-run the index in this rally.
Before investors choose funds purely on the basis of this, it is important to understand the portfolio strategy better to know the risks in the funds. For example, the Axis Bluechip fund holds a high conviction portfolio of around 25 stocks, while the BNP fund holds 34 stocks as compared to around 50 stocks in more diversified portfolios. This increases the concentration risk in the portfolio and the impact on returns can be significant even if a few stocks end up underperforming.
Despite the underperformance of many diversified portfolios relative to the bellwether indices in the recent past, these are funds that are suitable for investors who are looking for lower risk exposure to equity markets. “In the last three years, the indices performance has been very concentrated. The ratio of stocks that performed well to those that didn’t would be 1:2. If performance is very concentrated then diversification works against mutual funds. But we don’t expect performance to be concentrated going forward,"" said Tawakley.
A combination of active and passive strategies may also work for investors. “The all-weather option for goal-based investment would be index funds where SIPs (systematic investment plans) will continue. To take advantage of a correction and participate in that part of the market where there is still value and which have catch-up to do, then an actively-managed fund is at an advantage at this stage,"" said Kalpesh Ashar, founder, Full Circle Financial Planners and Advisors.
As always, investors should look beyond immediate short-term performance and consider their comfort with the investment strategy of the fund while making investment choices."

Bank fixed deposits (FDs) continue to be popular investment products not just among senior citizens, who are looking for guaranteed income, but also among investors who can’t stomach risk. But over-exposure to FDs is not good, and you need to assess your asset allocation and goals to decide how much money you should park in them. For instance, saving for your child’s higher education that’s 15 years away through FDs may not be effective as the post-tax interest rate of an FD may not give you a real return (return that’s above the rate of inflation), but if you plan to take a holiday in two years, an FD can help. Before choosing an FD, you should compare the interest rates on offer. Here is a list of banks that offer the highest FD rates for deposits up to  ₹ 1 crore over various tenures.

43,2019-12-04,ICICI,"ICICI Bank remains a buy for all but one of the 57 brokerages compiled by BloombergJust over a year ago, Sandeep Bakhshi took over as CEO after Chanda Kochhar resigned

India’s top performing bank stock is getting more love from analysts even after its strong run of gains in 2019. ICICI Bank Ltd., with a 45% climb this year that’s the most among a gauge of the nation’s financial stocks, has a recommendation consensus of 4.87 on a Bloomberg scale where 5 is a unanimous buy. That’s close to its highest reading in at least a decade. The lender remains a buy for all but one of the 57 brokerages compiled by Bloomberg.
“The stock has done well, yet we think the scope for meaningful re-rating over the next 12-18 months is high,"" Anil Agarwal, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note on Tuesday, after attending the bank’s first analyst day in more than a decade.
The view comes amid a deteriorating economic environment where growth has slipped to the slowest pace in six years and the financial system continues to recover from a prolonged period of loan losses and a crisis at shadow banks.
ICICI Bank has also had its share of upheavals. Just over a year ago, Sandeep Bakhshi took over as chief executive officer after Chanda Kochhar resigned following allegations of corporate governance violations.
Here’s a roundup of brokerage views on why they think ICICI shares are a buy.
Nomura (Adarsh Parasrampuria)
One bank, one RoE target well entrenched; expect ROE of 16%-17% in next 12-18 months compared with bank’s guidance of 15% by 1QFY21
Bank can continue to grow in most types of retail loans as market share is only 8% of system’s assets in category
Estimate pre-provisioning operating profit, or PPoP, to record 19% CAGR over FY19-22
Expect re-rating to continue with improving quality of earnings and lower credit cost
Ambit (Pankaj Agarwal)
Digitization in retail banking to help improve PPoP and ROE by reducing operating expenditure, cost of acquisition
Linking top management incentives to overall performance of bank could lead to better performance
Bank can achieve 16.5% ROE by FY21; remains buy with price target of  ₹526
Citigroup (Manish Shukla)
Bank is picking up business from better-rated companies
Emphasis on shorter and medium-term loans
Reduced chances of big loans turning bad, diverse range of products to allow it to grow balance sheet
Share price offers a reasonable risk-return trade-off; business offers meaningful upside in medium term
ICICI Bank is top sector pick; Price target raised to  ₹600 from  ₹510.40
Morgan Stanley (Anil Agarwal)
Core PPoP likely to compound at above 20% for multiple years
Decline in credit cost to drive strong earnings, ROE expansion
Rated overweight with price target of  ₹775

45,2019-12-04,ICICI,"Corporate profits are tied to GDP figure and hence your equity mutual fund returns will also be several impacted by the slowdownInternational funds based out of India, invest in most of the world's major geographies including the USA, Europe, Japan, China and even Brazil

On 1st December, Kalpen Parekh, CEO of DSP Mutual Fund tweeted the allocation of his fresh investments since 2017 (of his personal money). In it, he mentioned that as much as 23% of his fresh investments were in funds investing outside India (fund of funds or FoFs). India’s July-September GDP growth has come in at a 6 year low of just 4.5%. Its nominal GDP growth was even more dire. At 6.1% India’s nominal GDP is the lowest in the past 20 years. Corporate profits are tied to this latter figure and hence your equity mutual fund returns will also be several impacted by the slowdown. The effect is strongest in mid and small caps which have more tied to the domestic economy and have fewer earnings from outside India. The average return of small cap funds in India over the past year is -0.86% and the average return of mid cap funds is 4.32%. This compares poorly to the 10.16% given by the more global facing large cap companies.
The latter however already trade at hefty valuations. However there is a set of mutual funds which is almost entirely insulated from the sharp fall in India’s GDP - international funds.
International funds based out of India, invest in most of the world's major geographies including the USA, Europe, Japan, China and even Brazil. Some are thematic, investing in commodities or mining company stocks from around the world. International funds which are denominated in rupees, can be purchased and sold like any mutual fund in India. They are not counted as foreign assets for tax purposes and investing in them is not subject to the $250,000 dollar limit under the RBI’s Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS). However their value will fluctuate as per the rupee’s movement against foreign currencies. For instance, a US fund will appreciate in value if the dollar rises against the rupee and vice versa. International funds are taxed in the same manner as debt funds. They are taxed at a 20% rate with indexation if the fund is held for more than 3 years. If held for 3 years or less, the funds are taxed at your slab rate. The following 3 international funds are part of the Mint 50 list of mutual funds. You can access the full list here.
1) Franklin India Feeder Franklin US Opportunities Fund
Launched in 2012, the fund has more than Rs1,000 crore of assets under management and has delivered a return of 17.13% since inception. As the name suggests, the fund ‘feeds’ into the Franklin US Opportunities Fund which in turn counts Amazon, Microsoft, Mastercard, Visa and Alphabet among its top holdings. The fund’s one year return is 21.9% return.
2. ICICI Prudential US Bluechip Equity
This fund launched in June 2012, has delivered 16.83% (CAGR) since inception. It invests directly in frontline US stocks such as Amazon, Intel, Kellog and Caterpillar rather than feeding into another fund. It’s one year return is 20.18%.
3. ICICI Prudential Global Stable Equity Fund
This fund is country agnostic, and suitable for those who are not sure which market to choose - US, Europe, Japan or emerging markets. It feeds into Nordea Global Stable Equity Fund. Its returns over the past 5 years at 8.14% CAGR have been modest.
Even if GDP growth in India revives, it will not always be the world’s fastest growing economy. Hence for diversification reasons alone, you should have some allocation to international funds. Financial planners recommend an allocation of upto 15%."

44,2019-12-05,ICICI,"The total estimated exposure of the four lenders to Karvy Stock Broking is  ₹1,400 croreKarvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore

MUMBAI :
The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) on Wednesday set 12 December as the deadline for markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to pass the final order in the pleas by ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and IndusInd Bank against its move transferring pledged shares to clients of the troubled Karvy Stock Broking Ltd.
The appellate body also ruled that it is “untenable"" for the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) to reverse the transfer of securities from clients’ accounts.
“After a due diligence by NSE and NSDL, securities have been transferred to the account of the clients. Therefore, further rights have been created/restored involving more than 80,000 investors. In this context, a prayer to recall the same or to retain the same as frozen accounts of those clients becomes untenable,"" SAT member C.K.G. Nair said in an order on Wednesday.
India’s top two private banks, HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank, on Tuesday fought to lay their hands on client shares that Karvy Stock Broking had pledged with them, seeking to recover  ₹1,000 crore they had lent the brokerage. IndusInd Bank had also joined the plea, claiming dues of  ₹132.50 crore.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore, Sebi’s lawyer told Mint. The total misuse of client securities in Karvy’s case is about  ₹2,800 crore.
The case had required SAT to address a core dilemma around who owns these shares—the client who bought the shares, or the lender who advanced money against a third-party pledge of these shares without verifying their actual ownership. At Tuesday’s hearing, the lenders sought the quashing of Sebi’s 22 November order preventing them from accessing these shares. They also wanted SAT to set aside NSDL’s transfer of securities worth  ₹2,013.77 crore. As per the SAT order, NSDL has transferred securities back into the accounts of 83,862 clients.
Consequently, the lenders had also made NSDL and the National Stock Exchange parties to the case. The lenders had argued in their petitions that following the Sebi order, they had requested the regulator not to initiate any action on transferring these shares to clients as they had bona fide rights to them.
The banks told the tribunal that it was common industry practice to lend against pledged shares and there was no reason to disbelieve Karvy’s claim that it owned these shares. The banks also argued that Sebi’s 22 November order had asked NSDL to maintain status quo.
Sebi, on the other hand, argued that its circular dated 20 June was very clear in asking brokers not to pledge client securities for funding purposes and to unwind such pledges by the end of September. In such a scenario, the lenders should have enhanced their due diligence."

MUMBAI :
Investors are starting to weigh the merits of rotating into small- and mid-sized Indian stocks after a few large companies drove a record-breaking rally in the main equity index.
“Leadership in India’s rally has been very narrow,"" Tim Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said last week in Mumbai. “Valuations are at the high end of the range, both in historical terms and relative valuation compared with the region as a whole.""
The S&P BSE Sensex has risen about 12% from a low in September, with three members — Reliance Industries Ltd., ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd. — accounting for 61% of all the gains. The broader market has lagged behind, leaving the valuation gap between smaller firms and the gauge at close to its widest in a decade.
“Many of India’s large caps are overvalued,"" said Sunil Singhania, founder of Mumbai-based Abakkus Asset Manager LLP. “Most of them are unlikely to grow at the rate expected of them."" Abakkus has about 75% of its $300 million in assets invested in small and medium-sized stocks. The firm earlier this year said some quality stocks are likely in a “bubble zone.""
Investors have taken shelter in some of the South Asian nation’s biggest companies amid a credit crunch and the slowest economic growth in six years. That’s added to an extended underperformance by small stocks that goes back to 2017.
Still, Chandresh Nigam, who oversees $14 billion of assets at Axis Asset Management Co. isn’t convinced there’s value in small caps. It is worth paying more for shares of high-quality businesses, he said in an interview last month.
Quality can be expensive, with the Sensex trading at 19 times 12-month blended forward earnings. That’s close to a level that’s proved the ceiling for gains in the past few years.
Yet, the bet has paid off for Axis, with the money manager’s largest equity fund beating 96% of peers in the last five years.
For market breadth to widen, economic outlook needs to improve. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predict the growth is set to return. High valuation has partly priced in the expected recovery, with the MSCI India Index trading at 1.2 standard deviations above its 10-year mean, they wrote in a note.
There are signs investors are warming up to mid-cap stocks. The Nifty Midcap 100 edged out the benchmark index since the start of October, rising 6.3% versus a 4.8% gain for the NSE Nifty 50 Index.
“Early signs point to a change in market undercurrent,"" Navneet Munot, chief investment officer at SBI Mutual Fund said in a note on Tuesday. “‘Value stocks’ have significantly outperformed ‘quality’ over the past two months."""
30,2019-12-09,ICICI,"Chanda Kochhar had on November 30 moved the Bombay High Court challenging ""termination"" of her employment by ICICI BankA division Bench of justices Ranjit More and SP Tavade allowed her to implead RBI and directed the apex bank to file its reply by December 16

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Monday sought responses from the Reserve Bank on a plea by Chanda Kochhar challenging her termination as the chief executive and managing director of ICICI Bank, months after she voluntarily left the second largest private sector lender.
The high-profile ex-banker had on November 30 moved the Bombay High Court challenging ""termination"" of her employment by ICICI Bank which also denied her remuneration and clawed back all the bonuses and stock options between April 2009 and March 2018 for her alleged role in granting out of turn loans worth  ₹3,250 crore to the Videocon Group which benefitted her husband Deepak Kochhar.
Her petition claimed that her termination on January 30, 2019, came months after the bank approved her voluntary resignation on October 5, 2018 and therefore the termination is ""illegal, untenable, and unsustainable in law.""
Kochhar landed in troubled late March 2018 when the Indian Express reported the details about her role in Videocon Group getting  ₹3,250 crore loan from ICICI Bank out of turn in 2012 which soon after invested 10 percent of the loan in Nupower, a company owned by her husband Deepak.
The High Court direction came after Kochhar filed an amended petition on Monday seeking to make RBI a party to the case. She was allowed to amend her first plea on December 2.
A division Bench of justices Ranjit More and SP Tavade allowed her to implead RBI and directed the apex bank to file its reply by December 16.
The court posted the matter for further hearing on December 18, Kochhar's lawyers Vikram Nankani and Sujay Kantawala said who also said Section 35B of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, requires prior RBI approval before terminating the services of a managing director of a bank.
Earlier, Kochhar had stated that ICICI Bank was under statutory obligation to obtain prior RBI approval to terminate her from service, and claimed that the bank did not seek any such approval.
However, ICICI Bank had claimed it had sought approval from RBI under section 35B (1)(b) of Banking Regulation Act for 'termination of her appointment.
Following this, Kochhar amended petition which claimed that the RBI gave the approval without ""due and proper application of mind"".
Her petition further claimed that RBI gave the go ahead to the bank, ""by mechanically accepting the malafide request of ICICI Bank, dated February 5, 2019,"" making the entire approval exercise as ""perverse, null, void, and thus of no effect whatsoever"".
The prior approval is mandatory and cannot be granted ex-post facto as it came as an ""after-thought"" Kochhar's amended petition claimed.
Meanwhile, ICICI Bank on Monday filed an additional reply, pleading the court to dismiss Kochhar's petition at ""the threshold as it is not maintainable.""
Bank's senior counsel Darius Khambata had on December 2 said RBI had approved Kochhar's termination post-facto and produced the RBI approval letter as part of its submission.
It can be noted that the scam came to light after one Deepak Gupta, an ICICI shareholder and activist wrote to the PMO and the finance ministry about her alleged role in the loan sanction and how this helped her family.
Kochhar's, promoted as the head of the bank in March 2009, troubles got confounded after the CBI launched a probe into these allegations by a  ₹3,250-crore loan to the Dhoot- led Videocon group in 2012 in return for a deal in NuPower and Supreme Energy, the clean-energy firms run by her husband.
Following this, the bank board first backed her but as more revelations of quid pro quo came in, appointed a panel headed by former judge BN Srikrishna in May 2018 which indicted her in its report submitted late January 2019.
Following the appointment of the Srikrishna panel, she was forced to take leave from the bank in June 2018 and on October 4, she resigned from the bank, a development that came after the Enforcement Directorate registered a money laundering case against Videocon Group and her husband.
But on January 30, 2019, the bank terminated her form service and also decided to take all the bonuses and stock options paid to her between April 2009 and March 2018. The bank also refused to release her other retirement benefits citing terminaiton of her services.

34,2019-12-09,ICICI,"Lenders have asked brokers to verify the ownership of securitiesSebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representation on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order

Mumbai: The Karvy Stock Broking debacle and the ensuing loss of securities underlying their secured credit have forced lenders, especially banks, to review their exposure to brokerage firms, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Fearing that more secured loans could turn unsecured if the loans are backed by client securities, these lenders have sent out letters to brokers to verify whether these securities belonged to them or to clients, these people said on condition of anonymity.
“We are taking a relook at the documentation and other risk management measures required to ensure that the loan against pledged shares is not misused, like in the case of Karvy,"" said the chief risk management officer of a private sector bank, one of the three people cited above.
Some banks have also begun a review of their exposure to smaller brokers and are considering reducing it by 10%, said the proprietor of a mid-sized brokerage and the second person cited above.
This follows a 22 November notification by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which barred Karvy Stock Broking Ltd from adding new clients or acting on behalf of clients, and ordered depositories to transfer securities only to their beneficial owners.
Karvy is accused of misusing client securities worth  ₹2,800 crore to secure loan facilities from lenders towards working capital. The brokerage also sold off client securities and transferred the proceeds to its real estate group company.
Following the Sebi directive to transfer securities only to beneficial owners, the National Securities Depository Ltd on 2 December transferred  ₹2,013 crore into the accounts of 83,862 Karvy clients, which is almost 90% of the affected clients.
Four lenders then approached the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) saying the shares were pledged with them and therefore they had the right over these shares.
On 4 December, SAT ruled that reversing these transfers was untenable, leaving the lenders with no securities to invoke the pledge.
Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore and HDFC Bank had granted the brokerage a loan facility of  ₹350 crore. IndusInd Bank has an exposure of  ₹132 crore. Another lender, Bajaj Finance Ltd, has an exposure of  ₹345 crore, and its plea has already been referred to Sebi for a relook. The total estimated exposure of these four lenders is  ₹1,400 crore.
The banks were required to file representations with Sebi for redressal of their lost shares. “At least three of the lenders sought that Sebi allow them more time to file representations,"" said a lawyer representing the lenders.
Sebi is expected to decide on the lenders’ representations on 10 and 12 December, as per the SAT order.
“We have received letters this week from bankers trying to verify that the securities belong to us and not to the clients,"" the second person said. “In the Karvy issue, Bajaj Finance had, in fact, relied on the brokerage firm’s assertion that securities belonged to it and not clients.""
While the banks have increased their due diligence on broker exposures, a Sebi official, the third person cited earlier, said this should have happened earlier.
The official said: “Sebi had issued a circular on 20 June this year, asking brokers to segregate their securities from client securities, and prohibited them from using client securities for funding purposes. Considering the changes in rules, the banks should have increased their due diligence earlier. Brokers were also required to unwind the pledges which used client securities, by the end of September, and many of them are yet to affect the same."""
32,2019-12-09,ICICI,"The recent run-up in its stock price has raised the 12-month trailing earnings to around 39 times earnings per shareSome of its specialty brands helped Pfizer command better pricing, particularly in vaccines, vitamins and cardiovascular segments

Investors are pricing in high growth from the domestic arm of global pharmaceutical behemoth Pfizer Inc. The Pfizer Ltd stock gained nearly 36% in the last two months against the Nifty Pharma Index’s 8% gain, but may have run ahead of the market.
Some of its brands have done well in the pharma market. In the past years, the company introduced several drug formulations from its parent.
Much of its growth in recent times, though, was due to a shift in its product mix and greater productivity of its brands. In the last four years, while its revenue growth has not been much, its Ebitda (earnings before, interest, tax depreciation and amortization) has improved considerably on better pricing power. The Ebitda margin nearly doubled from about 16% in FY15 to about 29% in the first half of FY19.
Some of its specialty brands helped Pfizer command better pricing, particularly in vaccines, vitamins and cardiovascular segments.
Its vitamin brands continue to grow in double digits. Of late, prices have been rationalized further, and it is expected to aid revenue growth. “Pfizer hiked prices by about 5% and expects price, volume and launches to have equal shares in revenue growth,"" said B&K Securities India Pvt. Ltd in a client note.
Investors are considering the firm’s low gearing and high return ratios favourably, which are factors that helped increase its valuations in recent times. “Pfizer India is a net debt-free company with healthy core return-on-equity of 30% in FY19. Strong brand recall, consistent product launches and acquisition of brands, volume growth in top brands and intermittent price hikes provide comfort on the financial front,"" said ICICI Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
However, competition through the government’s Jan Aushadhi programme continues. Besides, the growing generics pie could also impact revenues. The other issue is that some of its products, such as vaccines, are priced much higher than the competition.
Nevertheless, the recent run-up in its stock price has raised the 12-month trailing earnings to around 39 times earnings per share. Many of the triggers, such as a price hike, have already been factored in the valuation. However, note that competition is getting keener. All this does not provide much of a comfort."
29,2019-12-11,ICICI,"Stressed loans were 9% of book as of Sep quarter and to this, pain from telecom and Karvy fiasco can be addedWhat pleased investors was the focus on operating profit by the bank, which directly boosts return on equity (ROE)

The management of ICICI Bank Ltd made all the right noises at its analyst day last week, and the resulting exuberance is seen in the stock. Since then, the stock has risen over 3%, taking the total gain for 2019 so far to more than 50%. This is far higher than what the sectoral index or even close peers such as Axis Bank Ltd witnessed.
What pleased investors was the focus on operating profit by the bank, which directly boosts return on equity (ROE). Analysts believe that the lender would be able to achieve an ROE of 15% by the first quarter of FY21 and some expect it to even surpass this target. ROE for first half of FY20 was 4.7%. “While management continues to guide for just 15% ROEs by 1QFY21, we expect 16-17% in the next 12-18 months,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory Pvt. Ltd wrote in a note.
The confidence stems from the management’s pitch that the bank has infused granularity in its lending and has shifted focus from transaction-based banking. In other words, it has reduced concentration on borrowers and instead decided to cross-sell its products.
So far, so good. But the risks cannot be ignored. The biggest of them is getting growth in a slowing economy. Corporate loan growth hasn’t recovered and retail too is showing signs of slowing down. Excluding securitization deals, bank retail loan growth has decelerated to a five-year low, according to Crisil Ltd.
One side effect of a slowing economy is the risk of delays in loan repayments. While ICICI Bank has managed to hack through its bad loan pile, it cannot wish away fresh stress.
Stressed loans were around 9% of its book as of September quarter and to this, the pain from telecom and the latest fiasco involving Karvy Stock Broking Ltd can be added.
When it comes to income growth, a lot will depend on how much the bank gets to reduce its bad loans further.
The increase in target prices by brokerage firms stems from the positive message from the management on operating metric. A stable management, enviable distribution network and considerable heft on liabilities give ICICI Bank an edge over its peers. After the more than 50% gain this year, most of the positives appear priced into the stock.
From here on, it all comes to how ICICI Bank shines up its books through resolution and recovery. And here, it is not an outlier in the industry."
28,2019-12-11,ICICI,"The scheme was introduced in 2015 to mobilize idle gold lying with households and putting it to productive useYou can deposit gold for the short term (one to three years), medium term (five to seven years) or long term (12 to 15 years)

One of the major challenges that investors in physical gold face is safe storage. A common practice is to store the yellow metal in bank lockers for its safety. But are they really safe? Though the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) provides a cover of up to  ₹1 lakh for your bank deposits, there is no insurance for the contents kept in a bank locker.
One way to ensure the safety of your physical gold is depositing it under the government’s Gold Monetisation Scheme, which also gives a return on the deposits. But, ideally, you should submit gold that you don’t want to use in its current form.
How to subscribe
The scheme was introduced in 2015 to mobilize idle gold lying with households and putting it to productive use.
To register for the scheme, you are required to get your holdings evaluated by an authorized Purity Testing Centre (PTC), which can issue a certificate indicating the value of gold. You can deposit your gold at the same centre (Find a list of specified collection centres).
You then have to show the certificate issued by PTC at a designated bank branch, where you will need to open a savings account if you already don’t have one. The bank will open a deposit account equal to the value of gold mentioned in the certificate, and will credit the interest rate you earn on your deposits in the savings account.
Main features
You can deposit gold for the short term (one to three years), medium term (five to seven years) or long term (12 to 15 years). The interest rate you earn on your deposit depends on the tenure. You will earn 0.50% per annum over a one-year tenure; 0.55% per year for a tenure above one year and up to two years; and 0.60% per year for a tenure above two years and up to three years. In case of medium- and long-term deposits, you can earn up to 2.25% per annum.
If you receive the payment annually, you will get a simple interest (as on 31 March) on your deposits. If you receive it on maturity, the interest rate will be cumulative (compounding annually). You need to choose the mode of payment at the time of deposit.
Note that you can withdraw the physical gold you deposited only if you are investing for the short term, wherein you have the option of withdrawing gold or its value in rupees at the prevailing prices. In case of medium- and long-term deposit, you will be paid only in the form of rupees at prevailing prices, and cannot withdraw your physical gold.
The minimum gold deposit you can make is 30 grams in the form of raw gold—bars, coins and jewellery, excluding stones and other metals. However, remember that even if you take back physical gold, it will not come to you in the form in which you deposited it. Banks return your gold only in the form of coins or bars."

I am 25 years old and I earn  ₹22,000 per month. I want to invest in equity mutual funds. I am confused about the kind of mutual funds I should choose. If I decide to invest  ₹3,000, should I invest in one scheme or three schemes? Please advise.
—Omprakash Suman
It’s a great time to begin investing in equity. Starting out early means that even smaller amounts can grow substantially over the years. In equity funds, don’t be influenced by the one-, three- or five-year returns only. Look for other metrics as well like past returns, volatility and so on. Mix different fund types—large-, mid-, multi- and large-and-mid-cap. Also, mix fund styles such as growth-oriented and value-oriented. Don’t sell your fund if returns start to fall; understand why they are falling and know that equity is volatile in the short term and gives good returns only in the long term. To start with, go for funds with moderate risk—hybrid aggressive funds, large-cap index funds, or moderate multi-cap funds. Consider funds such as ICICI Prudential Equity and Debt, Kotak Standard Multicap or Mirae Asset Large Cap. For  ₹3,000, one scheme will be enough. Add schemes as your savings increase over time.
I want to invest  ₹45,000 per month via systematic investment plans (SIPs). I have a fixed deposit (FD) of  ₹5 lakh. What types of schemes shall I choose?
—Anirudh Trivedi
The funds that you should choose for your SIPs will depend significantly on the time frame of your investments (that is, how long you plan to invest in the SIP and when you are likely to need your money back), and your risk tolerance. If, like many investors, you are investing for the purpose of building wealth over the long term, and your risk profile is either unknown or moderate, then you can go with an equity-heavy portfolio—assuming that your time frame is at least five years and you would not need to stop the SIP or take the money out in the interim. If these hold true, then you can consider a portfolio that is 70-80% in equity funds (about  ₹32,000) and the remaining in debt funds. You have an FD, which can be part of your debt portfolio. Leave it there to be used for any emergency needs. In a year or so, your mutual fund portfolio will hopefully grow more than your FD investment.
Regarding schemes, you can consider investing  ₹8,000 each in ICICI Prudential Nifty Next 50 fund (large-cap, index-driven), Invesco India Growth Opportunities fund (a multi-cap fund) and Kotak Standard Multicap fund (another multi-cap fund). Finally, you should split the remaining  ₹8,000 between DSP Midcap fund and Franklin India Smaller Companies fund.
For the debt allocation, you can invest in Kotak Savings fund and L&T Ultra Short Term fund in equal portions.

NEW DELHI :
With NTPC and ONGC leading gains, Sensex surged 172.69 points to end the day at 40,412.57. Nifty, too, managed to cross 11,900 levels to end at 11,910.15, up 53.35 points, or 0.45%.
Yes Bank was the biggest loser in the Sensex pack. It ended the day at  ₹42.80, a 15.33% loss amid uncertainty about the proposed $2 billion fund raising plan. Macquarie Research said if the bank is unable to raise money in the next 6 months, it poses a ""grave danger"" to the financial system.
Kotak Bank rose 1.56%, IndusInd Bank 1.39%, ICICI Bank 0.84% while HDFC Bank was flat.
Rohit Singre, senior technical analyst at LKP Securities, said Nifty managed to close the day above 11,900 zone after a super volatile session and formed bullish candle on daily chart.
""After a subdued trade during most part of the day, market witnessed a sharp turnaround due to short covering in index heavyweights. Upcoming macro indicators like CPI inflation & IIP data are unlikely to paint a rosy picture which may reduce upside potential in the near term. On global front, FOMC meeting, UK election and US tariff deadline remain key events,"" Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has lowered India's economic growth forecast for FY2019 to 5.1 per cent on slowing job prospects, rural distress exacerbated by poor harvest and credit crunch.
India's CPI inflation data will be released tomorrow while the Federal Reserve will announce its policy decision today.
Global stock markets rose Wednesday following reports President Donald Trump's advisers were preparing for a possible delay in a weekend tariff hike on Chinese goods.
London and Frankfurt rose in early trading while Shanghai and Hong Kong closed higher. Tokyo declined.
Investors are looking ahead to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Wednesday on interest rates and a similar decision Thursday by the European Central Bank.
Both are expected to affirm a commitment to low rates to support economic growth."
25,2019-12-11,ICICI,"A merger with a bigger franchise would be better than the ongoing fund-raising charade

Yes Bank Ltd’s latest $2 billion rescue plan was perfect except for one minor detail: Most suitors for the beleaguered Indian lender aren’t the kind the board can really take to meet the regulator for tea. Yet in a five-hour meeting Tuesday, the directors decided to do exactly that. Jane Austen would have been proud of their desperation to marry off Yes.
Take Erwin Singh Braich, a mysterious Canadian tycoon offering to post three-fifths of the money together with a partner. Braich says he’s Canada’s richest man, but he “has no headquarters, no banker to manage his money, and is currently living in a three-star motel in the Canadian prairies"", write Bloomberg News reporters Natalie Obiko Pearson and Suvashree Ghosh.
Braich, they show, is also the subject of a 1999 involuntary bankruptcy—orchestrated, he claims, by opponents, including his brother — which remains undischarged with more than C$13 million ($10 million) in total liabilities. But Yes Bank believes his binding offer deserves to remain on the table, so there it will be.
Two other interested buyers — Hong Kong-based SPGP Holdings, bidding jointly with Braich, and London-based Citax Holdings Ltd —have previously shied away from putting up small sums to acquire Indian businesses in bankruptcy. In a note, Suresh Ganapathy, the Macquarie Capital Securities banking analyst in Mumbai, expressed “serious reservations regarding the quality of the board of directors who are willing to consider these kinds of investors to be large shareholders"". The board doesn’t express an iota of self-doubt. It’s “willing to favourably consider"" the $500 million offer by Citax, and decide on allotting shares in the next meeting of directors, Yes said. If those permissions materialize, they’ll show the Reserve Bank of India, the regulator, to be even more desperate than Yes.
As I’ve written before, Yes is skating on a thin layer of capital. And that’s scary. Confidence in India’s bad-loan-laden banking system is ebbing; depositors are seething over regulatory restrictions placed on accessing their own money in a failed cooperative bank. Yes, India’s fifth largest private sector bank, can’t be left adrift much longer. But RBI is so distracted fighting other fires that it’d rather not have to think about Yes.
If not now, when? It’s been nine months since former Deutsche Bank AG executive Ravneet Gill became chief executive with a mandate to clean up the bank, whose asset quality was destroyed by the previous owner-manager’s cavalier underwriting. It’s been seven months since RBI used special powers to appoint a former deputy governor as a director. But for all the chaperoning and assurances from Gill, especially about raising funds, the outlook is getting bleaker.
Gross non-performing loans jumped to 7.4% of total assets in September from 5% in June. Last month, the bank disclosed that the regulator had found its non-performing assets on 31 March to be $460 million higher than it had reported earlier. “This is the third year when RBI has identified a divergence in the bank’s reported financials,"" Moody’s Investors Service said, while lowering the bank’s credit rating by two levels to B2, deep into junk-bond territory.
That cut is bound to complicate the bank’s ability to attract fresh deposits from institutions at a time when current account and savings account deposits—the cheapest source of financing—plunged 14% from a year earlier in the September quarter. A $273 million share sale in August has shored up the tier-I equity ratio to 8.7%, but it’s a temporary reprieve. Yes has a quarter of its assets tied up as credit to shadow banks, realty, and engineering and construction firms, some of India’s most fund-starved industries. IDFC Securities Ltd estimates $7 billion of stressed loans at Yes. Assuming 65% eventually goes bad, the slippage would be more than the bank’s net worth. It’s perhaps time to work off that very assumption. Merging the bank with a bigger franchise such as ICICI Bank Ltd or Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd at a next-to-nil equity value would be a better option than continuing the ongoing fundraising charade. In other words, Yes, which has lost 87% of its market value since August 2018, needs an arranged match, brokered by RBI.
Braich, the Canadian suitor, said he loves the logo: “If it was called ‘No Bank,’ I wouldn’t have been interested."" Even if a joke, this is serious. The shock to India’s broken financial system risks being even bigger than the collapse of IL&FS Group in September 2018. The regulator must act before Yes Bank becomes, for all practical purposes, no bank at all. bloomberg"

20,2019-12-14,ICICI,"In case of unit-linked products, the revival period has been increased to three yearThe mandatory guarantee on pension Ulip segment will become optional from February 1

From allowing partial withdrawal to increasing revival period, life insurance products will witness a host of changes from next year. The new rules will be effective from February 1, 2020. To benefit customers, the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority of India (Irdai) has relaxed regulations for pension plans, Ulips and traditional life insurance plans.
Let's take a look at the changes:
1) In case of unit-linked products, the revival period has been increased to three years. For non-linked products the revival period will be five years. Earlier the revival period was two years. Revival period means the period from the date of first unpaid premium during which period the policyholder is entitled to revive the policy which was discontinued due to the nonpayment of premium.
2) From February 1, withdrawal limit in pension plans is all set to increase. The maximum withdrawal allowed at maturity will be 60% instead of the existing one-third of the corpus. However, in pension plans, withdrawal of one-third corpus is tax-free, not the entire 60%.
""With this new amendment, the regulator has made pension plans as per with the NPS products. This change will be beneficial for the customers and the insurance industry,"" said Sanjay Tiwari, Director, Strategy, Exide Life Insurance.
3) Irdai has also tweaked the norms for prematurely partial withdrawals. Customers will be allowed to make partial withdrawal of up to 25% once the lock-in period of five years ends. Partial withdrawal will be allowed for higher education, children's wedding or critical illness or for buying or construction of a residential property.
""Earlier the withdrawal was not allowed by the regulator. This is a welcome move by Irdai,"" Tiwari added.
4) The minimum life cover in Ulips will come down to seven times instead of the existing 10 times for those under the age of 45. 'Sum Assured' is a guaranteed amount that is payable in case of the policy holders' death.
5) The mandatory guarantee on pension Ulip segment will become optional from February 1. Earlier, Irdai made it mandatory for insurers to offer guarantee on pension Ulip plans. Now, the policyholders will have more flexible option o choose whether they want a guarantee or not."

FASTag came into force from Sunday across the national highways. The government has mandated FASTag for toll payments from December 15 onwards.
At a toll plaza, 75% lanes will be accepting FASTag whereas 25% 'hybrid lanes' will continue operating till the government enforces mandatory usage of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) based FASTag for all.
However, at every toll plaza pan India one hybrid lane will remain operative for the vehicles from both directions.
At Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza on National Highway 48, Sunil Agarwal, a commuter, said: ""Non-stop passing of cars at the toll plazas is helping us in saving our time and fuel. People should accept it positively.""
However, before plastic money comes into full force without exemption, the commuters queueing up in the cash lanes expressed concerns.
""We are facing trouble. The government has extended the deadline for another month. However, toll plazas are not opening enough gates for cash payment. Earlier we used to get daily passes but now money will be deducted each time we cross the toll. It's a trouble,"" said Rakesh Kashyap, a businessman who is yet to buy FASTag.
Hybrid lanes, which are yet to go cashless after the latest extended relaxation of FASTag for a month, are experiencing long queues resulting in a massive traffic jam at the Delhi-Faridabad toll plaza.
In addition, the government is offering incentives of 2.5 per cent cashback in FASTags till March 2020. However, cars without FASTag will be charged double the amount.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) would take further steps to avoid issues like the recent development involving Karvy Stock Broking, said a top securities market regulator official, here on Monday.
""We have taken some steps and will take more steps,"" said SEBI Chairman Ajay Tyagi.
The regulator had taken prompt action regarding regulatory issues arising from companies and broking firms, he said on the sidelines of an event.
The regulator would take steps to avoid a situation like the recent developments when Karvy Stock Broking pledged  ₹2,300 crore securities of over 95,000 clients with HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Bahah Finance and IndusInd Bank as collateral to raise money.
On the significance of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), he said it would have a positive impact on the market in five years.

16,2019-12-17,ICICI,"Since corporate credit has been on a slowing trajectory for the past few years, most banks have relied on smaller loans to grow their loan booksThe report cited above is based on interviews with 200 experts from the industry, ICICI Bank and Crisil’s expertise and data available 

The total size of retail loan book of Indian lenders is expected to double to  ₹96 trillion in five years, said a joint report by ICICI Bank and Crisil on Tuesday. The total size of retail loan book stood at  ₹22 trillion in FY14 and at  ₹48 trillion in FY19.
The growth in the loan book will come on the back of increased demand for private consumption (namely home, car, consumer durables, credit cards etc), willingness of consumers to take loans, increased availability of various consumer data, improved usage of data analytics and regulatory initiatives propelling growth in low cost housing loans and micro, small & medium enterprises (MSME) loans, according to the report.
Meanwhile, since corporate credit has been on a slowing trajectory for the past few years, most banks have relied on smaller loans to grow their loan books. RBI data showed that credit to industry grew 3.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to  ₹27.86 trillion on 25 October but since the beginning of this financial year, it was down 3.4% as well.
The report cited above is based on interviews with 200 experts from the retail loans industry, ICICI Bank and Crisil’s expertise and data from publicly available databases.
Credit cards and personal loans (both unsecured credit) with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23% and 22% between FY19 and FY24, respectively, will be the drivers of the retail loan growth, it said. The other high-growth area will be consumer durable loans at 21% CAGR, albeit on a low base of  ₹24,000 crore. The ICICI Bank-Crisil report assumes a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate of 6.5-7% over these five years for the loan growth prediction.
Anup Bagchi, executive director, ICICI Bank said the reason why these segments are going to grow at 22-23% is because customers typically start with unsecured products and then as they are able to put in equity, move to secured loans.
“In the initial period, people generally start with a credit card and personal loan. Whenever we would have started with our jobs, we would start with unsecured credit and it does not mean we are bad credit,"" said Bagchi when asked about concerns on the unsecured portfolio for all lenders growing faster than the rest of their book.
Meanwhile, digital lending – defined as cases where loans are sourced, underwritten, and sanctioned digitally – is estimated at Rs. 2.7 trillion as of March 2019. The report said digital lending, which accounts for 5.7% of the retail loans, is expected to move to 15.8% by FY24.
Amish Mehta, chief operating officer and president, Crisil said growth is expected to be higher in smaller cities outside the top 50 cities.
“The top five players are foreseen continuing their dominance of the market, across asset classes. For example, in housing loans, despite the market having over 100 players, the top five players alone have a cumulative market share of over 50%,"" said Mehta."
15,2019-12-17,ICICI,"A deep discount bond from a ‘safe’ issuer ticks all the boxes for the middle Indian investor

A granddad buys a bond for his grandchild. Nothing unusual except that there is no grandchild. His recently married offspring has zero plans for having a child in the near future. But the appeal of turning  ₹2,700 into  ₹1 lakh over 25 years was a compelling story in 1992. As it was in 1996 when ICICI Bank came to the market with its tranche of deep discount bonds (that do not pay periodic interest but accumulate it in the bond and return the principal plus accumulated and reinvested interest in the future) and another set of households rushed to buy and lock in their long-term returns. That was the buzz around the deep discount bonds in the 1990s when IDBI Ltd, ICICI Bank and others used this bond type to tap directly into the household savings. A deep discount bond from a “safe"" issuer ticks all the boxes for the middle Indian investor—it is safe, the period of investment is known, the return is better than a fixed deposit (FD) and the amount at the end of the period is a known number. You have to only see the success of the traditional insurance products (such as money-back and endowment) that give an effective return that is poorer than that of a bank deposit, to understand how deeply middle India craves safety, predictability of return and the promise of money-back when it is due.
Therefore, it should be no surprise that there is some excitement around the Bharat Bond ETF (exchange-traded fund) issue that is currently open for subscription. To understand the product simply, think that instead of buying one bond, you buy a basket of bonds. These bonds have the highest rating of safety of both interest and principal since they are issued by public sector undertakings (remember that the stock of a PSU does not come with the guarantee of a profit, but bond issues will have a very low probability of non-payment of what is due). The safety of the bond ratings have gone up after the market regulator put in new rules that make the rating agencies responsible for their ratings. This gives an added layer of safety. You will buy this basket of bonds at one shot through a mutual fund, either through an exchange-traded fund or a fund of funds. The structure of issue fixes the date on which you get your money back, the return is indicated and looks good post tax, though you can sell and buy midway through the holding period. It is better than a bank FD that gives you the same safety, but less than a managed bond fund that does not give you a certainty of return. For more on the bond issue, read these stories by Neil Borate and Sunita Abraham.
The Bharat Bond story is interesting for many reasons beyond finance. It saw a tiny private sector fund house punch way above its weight with an audacious bid and win. When Edelweiss Asset Management won the mandate from the government to create, launch and manage a PSU bond ETF, everybody was surprised— as a fund house with just less than  ₹12,000 crore of assets under management last year, Edelweiss AMC was not even a tenth of the largest fund house that managed over  ₹3 trillion at the end of December 2018. Other than the lowest cost (0.0005%, that works out to 50 paise on  ₹1 lakh of investment), it was their technical bid that swung the needle towards them. The technical bid accounted for 70% and the financial just 30%. India has come a long way from trusting only public sector or PSU asset managers (as when the National Pension System or NPS was launched) to choosing a small private firm to manage a PSU bond offering! One of the features that has been appreciated is the target maturity date option, along with the option to transact midway through the holding period. The fund house’s plans to launch bonds in subsequent years also makes it possible for a household to use these to “ladder"" their investments. One of the big risks with equity and debt funds for low-risk appetite investors is the uncertainty of the money they will get back. A target date fund allows a household to build a series of payouts in the future with a fair idea of what to expect on the maturity date. I would look at these bonds as an alternative for the  ₹1.41 trillion that goes every year into single-premium insurance plans that give lower returns, are inflexible and opaque. Compared to the high-commission insurance policies, these bonds will be far more liquid, flexible and will offer better returns. If the government includes these bonds under the Section 80C umbrella, the extra tax sweetener will swing the balance a bit more. Equity funds have a Section 80C tax break under the equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS) category, but debt funds do not have the same benefit. Maybe it is time for a debt product to have the tax benefit too. If that does happen, expect investor interest to spike.
The IDBI bond story ended sadly for the granddad since the bonds were “called"" back by IDBI, as were the bonds issued by ICICI Bank in the ’90s much before their maturity date since the lower interest rates made the bonds unviable. But then he’s moved on to mutual funds since and is all set to buy the bond ETF for his great grandchild. Whenever that kid of his now-grown-up-but-unmarried grandchild comes along!

14,2019-12-18,ICICI,"The RBI said NEFT, RTGS transfer charges should be waived off to push digital retail paymentsThe new rules come into effect from 1 January 2020

NEW DELHI :
After making National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) system 24x7, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has now instructed banks to make all online payments done through NEFT and RTGS free of cost for savings account holders. Several banks have already made it free while others have been asked to do so from next month.
""In order to give further impetus to digital retail payments, it has now been decided that member banks shall not levy any charges from their savings bank account holders for funds transfers done through NEFT system which are initiated online (viz. internet banking and/or mobile apps of the banks),"" the RBI said in a notification issued this week.
The new rules will come into effect from 1 January, 2020.
NEFT charges:
Earlier in July, the apex bank had removed all charges it imposes on banks for processing of NEFT and RTGS transactions. The RBI had also asked banks to pass on the benefits to its customers as well after which some banks like SBI and ICICI Bank had made online NEFT transfers free.
India's largest bank the State Bank of India (SBI) has not levying any transaction charges through IMPC, RTGS and NEFT for YONO, internet banking and mobile banking customers. Similarly, HDFC Bank imposes no charges on NEFT transactions.
According to an earlier RBI order, banks were not allowed to charge more than  ₹2.50 for funds transfer upto  ₹10,000,  ₹5 for transfers between  ₹10,001 to  ₹1 lakh and  ₹15 for transfers between  ₹1 lakh and above and  ₹25 for for transfers beyond  ₹2 lakh.
NEFT timings:
The RBI has now made NEFT transactions a round-the-clock process which works even during bank holidays. So now, you can transfer money 24x7 and across all 365 days of the year. Earlier, NEFT transfer timings were fixed from 8 am to 6:30 pm on bank working days."
13,2019-12-18,ICICI,"The central bank filed an affidavit in response to a petition filed by Kochhar last month, challenging her ousterThe RBI in its affidavit said there was no violation of Chanda Kochchar's fundamental rights

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) told the Bombay High Court on Wednesday that its decision to grant approval to ICICI Bank for termination of appointment of Chanda Kochhar as MD and CEO was fair and not arbitrary.
The central bank filed an affidavit in response to a petition filed by Kochhar last month, challenging her ouster as the chief executive and managing director of ICICI Bank months after she voluntarily left the private sector lender.
The bank, while terminating her employment, also denied her remuneration and rescinded the bonuses and stock options given to her from April 2009 to March 2018.
She was accused of playing a role in grant of out-of- turn loans of  ₹3,250 crore to Videocon Group, which allegedly benefited her husband, Deepak Kochhar.
Chanda Kochhar's lawyers Vikram Nankarni and Sujay Kantawalla argued that her termination came months after the bank had already accepted her voluntary resignation on October 5, 2018, and therefore the sacking was illegal.
The RBI in its affidavit said there was no violation of Kochchar's fundamental rights, and its decision to approve the termination of her services was devoid of any ""malafides or arbitrariness"".
While giving such approvals, the RBI does not sit in judgment over the legality of the action, it added.
""RBI does not get involved in employee-employee disputes,"" the affidavit said.
""It is not the function of RBI to micromanage the actions of the bank and substitute its commercial wisdom for that of the bank,"" the affidavit filed by Navin Nambiar, General Manager of RBI's Department of Regulation, said.
The central bank received a letter from ICICI Bank on February 2, 2019, informing that the bank's Board of Directors has considered the report submitted by the Justice Srikrishna committee and concluded that Kochhar was guilty and reconsidered her early retirement, the affidavit said.
ICICI Bank then sought regulatory approval from the RBI for Kochhar's termination, as required under section 35B (1) of the RBI Act, it said.
""The letter was carefully considered....The RBI vide its letter dated March 13, 2019, accorded its approval to ICICI and advised that the termination of appointment would be as of October 4, 2018, the last working day of the petitioner (Kochhar),"" the RBI said.
Both RBI counsel Venkatesh Dhond and ICICI Bank counsel Darius Khambata on Wednesday contended before a division bench of Justices R V More and S P Tavade that Kochhar's petition was not maintainable.

12,2019-12-19,ICICI,"The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorizationIn a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company

MUMBAI :
Non-bank lender Bajaj Finance Ltd on Thursday said that it has invoked shares of Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL), which were pledged by Karvy Stock Broking Ltd to raise funds from the lender.
In a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said that it has invoked 24 lakh pledged shares of KDMSL representing 10% equity stake in the company.
KDMSL, incorporated in 2008, is a Hyderabad-based step-down subsidiary of Karvy Stock Broking and provides business and knowledge process services. The company started off with back-office services and has over the years added various other services to its portfolio to cater to the banking, telecom, and e-commerce sectors.
“The shares of KDMSL were pledged with the company for securing the outstanding dues of Karvy Stock Broking Limited, the borrower company. The company has invoked the pledged shares of KDMSL for recovery of its dues,"" the stock exchange filing said.
Bajaj Finance is amongst the group of lenders with the largest exposure to Karvy Stock Broking, which raised money from the lenders by pledging shares belonging to its clients.
On 22 November, Sebi barred Karvy from acquiring new clients and from using power of attorney, thereby barring it from trading on behalf of clients, after the broker allegedly transferred clients’ money for other purposes and indulged in trade not authorized by them.
The market regulator held that Karvy had misused client securities by pledging them with various lenders without authorization.
These securities were used to raise funds from banks, some of the securities were sold off and the proceeds were transferred to its real estate arm – Karvy Realty Ltd.
Since then some of the lenders including Bajaj Finance have been engaged in a legal tussle over these pledged shares.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on 14 December declined to give any relief to the four lenders -Bajaj Finance Ltd, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Mint reported. The lenders had lost control over pledged shares after they were transferred by National Securities Depository Ltd into clients’ accounts.
The four lenders including Bajaj Finance, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank had extended  ₹345 crore,  ₹642 crore,  ₹208 crore and  ₹159 crore to the broking firm against pledge shares worth  ₹2873 crore as of 16 September 2019. These pledged shares came down to  ₹2319 crore in November 2019."

9,2019-12-21,ICICI,"This is the second time BoB has invited expressions of interest (EoI) to sell the propertyBoB had set a reserve price of  ₹530 crore for the property

Mumbai: Public sector lender Bank of Baroda (BoB) has invited fresh bids to sell the head office of erstwhile Dena Bank in the city’s Bandra Kurla Complex after its negotiations with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) and ICICI Bank, the two contenders for the property, failed to fructify, according to two people aware of the development.
This is the second time BoB has invited expressions of interest (EoI) to sell the property.
The last date for submitting fresh bids has been set for 6 January, 2020.
Following its merger with Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank in April this year, BoB has been wanting to sell away the office.
In its document seeking bids, BoB said it has invited offers from interested eligible parties as it intends to divest the commercial property.
In an earlier e-auction which was scheduled for 18 October, BoB had set a reserve price of  ₹530 crore for the property. The land area of the office is 2878.36 square meters and the built-up area for the property stands at 9953.73 square meters.
""Both LIC and ICICI Bank had participated in the earlier bid. However, talks with each of the entities failed due to a mismatch in the price expectation of the property,"" said one of the people mentioned above.
LIC and ICICI Bank have not responded to emails, seeking confirmation on the development till the time the story was published.
The reserve price for the property is too high and hence it would be difficult to negotiate a deal, said another person who did not want to be identified.
""In the earlier bid, the base price was kept at  ₹530 crore, which comes to around to  ₹50,259 per sq. ft. on built -up- area basis. It should ideally get price between  ₹30,000-32,000 per sq ft,"" the person said.
In September last year, the government decided to merge three banks—Bank of Baroda, Dena Bank and Vijaya Bank, to reduce the amount of capital it needs to pump into these lenders and help clean their balance sheets. The merger was effective 1 April."

It seems nothing comes without a twist. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) latest bond swapping programme, billed as India’s ‘Operation Twist’ is not without its twists and turns.
After the central bank announced the operation, long-tenor yields have come off by about 15 basis points. However, further lowering depends on the continuity of this measure.
It seems nothing comes without a twist. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI’s) latest bond swapping programme, billed as India’s ‘Operation Twist’ is not without its twists and turns.
After the central bank announced the operation, long-tenor yields have come off by about 15 basis points. However, further lowering depends on the continuity of this measure.
“If successful, the RBI may have to scale up its programme to sustain lower yields at the long-end of the curve, especially when concerns on additional borrowings continue,"" said Kotak Economic Research economists led by Upasna Bhardwaj.
Under ‘Operation Twist’, India’s central bank will buy long-term bonds worth  ₹10,000 crore and sell short-term ones of an equivalent amount. This is expected to lead to a flattening of the yield curve. Long-end rates are expected to come off, while short-term rates could rise.
But, this exercise is not without its risks at the short end of the curve. “While the far end of the curve may ease amid open market operation purchases, the short end of the curve may witness a sharp increase in yields amid already muted demand. This could further translate into higher money market rates and, hence, risks being counter-productive,"" added Kotak’s economists.
There could be some implications for the short-end corporate borrowers.
“Around 55-65% of corporate bond issuances were in the 1-5 year tenor over the last two years, where yields had come down more than the policy rates. Crucially, private corporates and NBFCs (non-banking finance companies) borrow at shorter tenors and PSUs (public sector units) dominate borrowing at longer tenors,"" said Prasanna A. and Abhishek Upadhyay of ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd in a report on 20 December.
To be sure, a section of analysts argued that there was ample liquidity in the economy, hence, the short-end yields may not get impacted as much.
Note that RBI resorted to this unusual measure after economic growth for the September quarter hit a six-year low of 4.5%. Moreover, it has already axed policy rates by 135 basis points so far this year since February and that has not yielded the desired results.
Some see it as a last resort to bring down the rates in the economy."
6,2019-12-23,ICICI,"Sensex is up about 16% this yearHowever, only three companies have accounted for 65% of all of the advance: Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank

India’s largest stocks are likely to be winners again in 2020, after propelling the benchmark equity index to its fourth straight annual gain. Analysts expect gains in the S&P BSE Sensex in the new year to be led by just a handful of big names, similar to 2019, as uncertainty around a slowing economy is likely to continue driving investors to the safety of quality stocks.
“Investor focus is unlikely to shift soon from the few high-quality names which continue to steadily grow faster than the economy,"" said Dipen Sheth, Mumbai-based head of institutional research at HDFC Securities Ltd. “The foreign flows, too, favor top players.""
Economic growth slowed to a more than six-year low of 4.5% in the July-September quarter. That hasn’t stopped the Sensex from climbing nearly 16% this year, to a succession of record highs to cap a fourth straight annual gain.
However, only three companies have accounted for 65% of all of the advance: Reliance Industries Ltd, ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd.
“We expect narrow market performance to continue, as economic uncertainty continues to push funds into the ‘safe’ stocks, resulting in higher market concentration,"" said Neelkanth Mishra, a Mumbai-based analyst at Credit Suisse.
Global Flows
A gush of cash from global funds has helped drive the record-breaking stock rally, as overseas investors bet the worst of the economic slowdown may have passed. Foreigners have pumped $14 billion into India’s stocks this year, the highest inflow since 2014.
“Global flows are likely to be supportive as well,"" Mishra said “A significant part of foreign portfolio investment holdings in India appears to be longer term in nature or benchmarked.""
Earnings Recovery
Earnings growth for India Inc. is another factor seen support stocks in the new year. A possible economic recovery, lower corporate tax rate, clean up of bad assets at banks, above average monsoon and accommodative central bank stance support the outlook.
“Growth has likely bottomed out,"" Timothy Moe, chief Asia Pacific equity strategist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in Mumbai this month. “We see it as one of the top three Asian markets for earnings growth next year.""
Moe said he expects profit growth to expand to 16% in 2020 from 12% this year. That’s his best earnings forecast for a country in the region next year, after South Korea. Among sectors that may drive this recovery are financials, consumer-oriented companies and industrials.
While earnings are improving, valuations have jumped. The Sensex is trading at 19 times 12-month forward earnings estimates, above its 10-year average of under 16 times.
Smaller stocks have lagged the overall market rally, with the NSE Midcap 100 Index down over 5% and the Nifty Smallcap 100 Index down nearly 12% year to date. Optimism around further government reforms and an economic recovery could help build a case for a catch-up by the broader market.
Valuations for mid-caps are reasonable and small-caps have bottomed out, said Jaideep Hansraj, chief executive officer at Kotak Securities Ltd.
""The small caps can show material outperformance, if the economy revives,"" he said.

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA.

5,2019-12-27,ICICI,"Move aimed at shielding lenders from non-bank risks, steering focus to boost credit growthBanks have asked the regulator for five years to implement the rule but they may get just three years

MUMBAI :
The Reserve Bank of India has asked lenders to cut their stakes in insurers to 30%, as the banking regulator attempts to shield banks from risks arising out of their non-banking businesses and steer focus to boosting credit growth in a slowing economy, four people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
RBI informed the bankers in a meeting last week that it will soon introduce rules to cap their holdings in an insurance company to 30%, the people said, requesting anonymity as the matter is confidential. The holding limit will be 50% for non-banking financial companies such as Housing Development Finance Corp. that have insurance units, they said. Banks have been told to await RBI’s official communication on the new rules.
The move is likely to have far-reaching impact not only on banks, which derive significant income from their insurance units, but also on the insurers themselves as their parent banks are major capital providers and distributors of insurance products. State Bank of India, ICICI Bank Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Bank will be among the lenders to be affected by the decision.
“The 30% capping rule is meant to safeguard banks from capital risks arising from non-core businesses. But the new RBI rule, which is likely to come into effect some time in fiscal 2021, will create a huge supply of equities in the market when the banks slash their stakes. It is to be seen if the market has an appetite to absorb such large amount of liquidity,"" said the first of the four people. The rule is likely to be implemented in a phased manner, the person added.
“RBI is asking us to rather use the money for credit growth. RBI is suggesting banks to increase Tier 1 networth,"" said the second person. “There should not be much of a problem as some of the insurance firms are listed. We (as a bank) have to give a roadmap to RBI as in when we will bring down stake to 30%. We have asked for five years but they (RBI) will not give five years. They may say three.""
Current regulatory norms mandate that a bank can hold a maximum of 50% in an insurance venture but the regulator may allow them to hold more on a case-to-case basis.
In the life insurance space, ICICI Bank owns 52.87% in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Co. Ltd; Kotak Mahindra Bank holds a 77% stake in Kotak Mahindra Life Insurance Co. Ltd; and State Bank of India owns 57.6% in SBI Life Insurance Co. Ltd. Home financier HDFC holds 51.47% in HDFC Standard Life Insurance Co. Ltd.
Among general insurers, HDFC holds 50.49% in HDFC Ergo General Insurance Co.; ICICI Bank holds a 55.86% stake in ICICI Lombard General Insurance Co. Ltd; Kotak Mahindra Bank holds 100% in Kotak Mahindra General Insurance; and State Bank of India holds 57.13% in SBI General Insurance Co. Ltd.
“Banks are the major distributors of financial products especially life insurance. Any reduction of stake by sponsor banks in these institutions may have negative impact on the distribution capabilities as well as general public perception about these institutions they enjoy because of parentage. This issue may impact the prospective investor sentiment also,"" said Ashutosh Mishra, head of research, Ashika Stock Broking.
In any insurance business, whenever capital infusion takes place, all promoters need to put in money as per the proportion of their shareholding. If even one of the promoters is unable to put in money as per their shareholding, the capital infusion process fails. This can stifle the growth of the insurer.
“RBI is concerned that such capital contributions commitments may hurt the bank and exposes it to higher risks. This is why RBI wants to cap bank’s holding in insurance firms,"" said the first person.
The second person said RBI doesn’t want banks to own insurance, asset management and NBFC businesses.
“Over a period of time, RBI wants to reduce the holding cap to 30% or below 10%,"" said the second person.
Insurance is a capital-guzzling business, which needs regular capital infusions as it grows. Mutual fund businesses also have been growing steadily but new norms related to penetration of AMCs into locations beyond top-15 cities, require additional growth capital.
The NBFC business has been shrinking after the IL&FS debacle last September and a subsequent liquidity crisis. Any turnaround in the NBFC business or even to keep the NBFC afloat, albeit with losses until the credit situation improves, will require a lot of capital.
In all these businesses, wherever banks are parent companies, capital outflow will be from the bank’s books, which will weaken the bank’s own core business.
While RBI plans to limit the holding of banks in insurance at 30%, in order to ensure that insurance companies do not face growth constraint due to the ceiling on bank’s holding, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India, or Irdai, last week proposed an increase in FDI in insurance from 49% to 74%. If this proposal is enacted in the Parliament, foreign joint venture partners in insurance will be able to infuse more capital in the company whenever growth plans are drafted.
To be sure, RBI has been attempting to recalibrate banks’ holding norms to safeguard them from external risks for some time. In May 2011, an RBI working group recommended a holding company structure for banks. It said all new banks and insurance companies will mandatorily need to operate under the financial holding company (FHC) framework and intermediate holding companies within the FHC should not be permitted.
Under the holdco norms, a bank had to unwind its shareholding in subsidiaries, and the existing shareholding of the bank in its units were to be transferred to the holdco.
According to the working group, the holdco was supposed to be regulated either by RBI itself or by a new regulator. The group had said it was necessary to put in place some limit on the expansion of non-banking businesses after the existing financial groups, dominated by banks, migrate to the holding company structure. However, the holdco proposal has now been scrapped due to its complexities, according to the three people cited above."

Come 2020, your National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) transactions will be free of cost. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has a gift for savings bank account holders. To promote digital transactions, RBI has directed banks not to charge savings account holders for NEFT with effect from 1st January 2020. ""In order to give further impetus to digital retail payments, it has now been decided that member banks shall not levy any charges from their savings bank account holders for funds transfers done through NEFT system which are initiated online (viz. internet banking and/or mobile apps of the banks). This directive is issued under Section 10 (2) read with Section 18 of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 (Act 51 of 2007) and shall be effective from January 1, 2020."" RBI had said in a notification dated 16 December.
Furthering Digital Payments – Waiver of Charges – National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) Systemhttps://t.co/yr0Y4prPNS
RBI recently announced that NEFT money transfer has now become 24X7 facility, which means you can transfer money round-the-clock. Now, this facility is also available during bank holidays. This will be extremely beneficial for large-value transactions which cannot be done through UPI or mmediate Payment Service (IMPS). The eventual waiver of charges will benefit small traders as well. NEFT money transfer timings were fixed from 8 am to 6.30 pm on working days, however NEFT money transfer facility was not available during holidays.
What is National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT)
The National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) is an electronic funds transfer system maintained by the RBI, to transfer funds from one bank account to another. Money transfer can be made by an individual or company to an individual or company's bank account with any bank that is a member of the NEFT scheme, according to the RBI .
Currently, some banks like State Bank of India (SBI) and ICICI Bank had made online NEFT transfers free.

3,2019-12-29,ICICI,"Banking, financial services, insurance and retail verticals will drag revenue growthRevenue growth of IT services companies in FY21 will decelerate to about 7.5%, according to ICICI Securities

BENGALURU :
Top Indian software services companies are expected to have a tough year in FY21 amid continued weakness in demand from the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail verticals.
“With continued challenges in the capital markets segment and large banks in US/Europe, and heightened volatility in the retail vertical, we clearly expect revenue growth to decelerate in FY21 to about 7.5% in constant currency terms for our large cap coverage,"" ICICI Securities said in a 15 December note. The BFSI sector has been relatively weak for the past few quarters. Tata Consultancy Services’ (TCS’) BFSI vertical witnessed slow single digit growth at 8% year-on-year for the quarter ended September.
For Infosys, BFSI revenue grew slightly higher at 10.3% year-on-year in constant currency terms, which is “pretty decent"", according to an equity analyst. However, he said that “one should also consider that this includes the impact of the Stater acquisition, which obviously boosts growth."" Infosys, which acquired 75% shareholding in ABN AMRO Bank’s wholly owned Stater NV in May, aims to strengthen its position in the mortgage services value chain.
“The financial services vertical continued its growth momentum aided by the recent Stater acquisition,"" U.B. Pravin Rao, chief operating officer, Infosys, said during the September quarter post-earnings call with investors.
“We expect performance in the vertical to be affected in the next couple of quarters driven by seasonality, sluggishness in capital markets and the European banking space. The recent reduction in interest rates in major geographies can have an impact on client revenues, which may also impact their IT spending,"" he said.
Harit Shah, a former equity analyst with Reliance Securities, corroborated Rao’s views. “BFSI spending is seeing some softness mainly in the capital markets segment. With interest rates at very low levels, the impact of trade wars likely to be felt, slowing gross domestic product growth, and overall macro challenges, it is likely that the BFSI spend will remain soft in the near term,"" Shah said.
Revenue from retail grew in single digits across TCS, Infosys, and Wipro at 4.8%, 1.1%, and 6.1%, respectively year-on-year on a constant currency basis for the September quarter. “Retail segment performance was muted as clients turned cautious because of an increase in perceived risks stemming from trade wars and geopolitical developments,"" Rao said about the Q2 earnings of Infosys.
Analysts believe retail will continue to be a drag in the coming quarters. “The IT companies’ commentaries have been soft on the retail sector because of factors such as the US consumer confidence index going down quarter on quarter. Also, the retail sector is creating pricing pressure for IT services firms, especially for the managed services which includes mandatory services such as application development and maintenance,"" said Anmol Garg, equity research analyst, Motilal Oswal Securities.
The digital business will follow the trend in 2019 and continue to drive growth for IT services companies as clients will invest in emerging technologies despite a flat budget. “The IT budget is expected to remain almost flat globally in 2020 for many organizations (based on a survey conducted in 991 organisations globally),"" said D.D. Mishra, senior director analyst, Gartner. However, he said that “net investment in certain areas such as analytics, data and information strategy, application support, and end user computing, across verticals is expected to increase.""
Banks will continue to invest in new technology as part of their digital transformation initiatives, according to a Deloitte Insights report. North American banks are expected to spend 40% of their total IT budget on new technologies in 2020, while European banks would spend about 29%. This number would increase to 48% and 33%, respectively for American and European banks in 2022."
2,2019-12-30,ICICI,"Lenders are also considering a move to sell minority stakes in the sister concerns of Karvy Stock BrokingICICI Bank on 20 Dec became the first lender to approach the Hyderabad DRT for recovery of dues

Mumbai: Lenders to Karvy Stock Broking Ltd have started exploring other avenues after failing to secure any relief from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on client shares pledged by the brokerage.
The options include filing pleas with the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) and Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI), and selling minority stakes in sister concerns of Karvy. A total of seven entities have lent more than  ₹1,400 crore to the brokerage against share collateral worth  ₹2,319 crore.
“Most of the lenders have decided against appealing Sebi’s decision as by now majority of shares have been transferred to client accounts and are out of their reach,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity. “In addition to shares, the lenders had taken other assets as collateral which can be used for recovery.""
On 22 November, Sebi barred Karvy from acquiring new clients and from using power of attorney, thereby preventing the company from trading on behalf of clients, after the broker allegedly transferred clients’ money for other purposes and indulged in trades that were not authorized by them. Karvy had, instead of pledging its own shares, pledged shares belonging to clients and used them to raise funds. These funds were then transferred to its sister concerns such as Karvy Realty Ltd.
ICICI Bank Ltd on 20 December became the first lender to approach the Hyderabad DRT for recovery of dues. If the broking firm does not deposit an equal amount of collateral with the tribunal by 5 January, assets of Karvy and its promoters can be attached. Other lenders that hold similar collaterals could also initiate similar recovery proceedings.
“At least three other lenders are also likely to approach DRT in the coming two weeks to recover their dues,"" said the person cited earlier.
Karvy Group’s former chairman and managing director, C. Parthasarathy, and director Rajat Parthasarathy have already been issued notices to submit their passports, restraining them from leaving the country during the case proceedings. They have also been asked to disclose their assets to the tribunal. Karvy owes ICICI Bank  ₹642 crore against a loan facility of  ₹700 crore. The amount was due in November but the brokerage missed the schedule. ICICI Bank could not invoke the pledged shares as they belonged to clients and Sebi through its 22 November order prevented their transfer except to beneficiary owners.
Another lender, Bajaj Finance Ltd, is pursuing recovery of its  ₹325 crore loan by invoking shares pledged with sister concerns. It had invoked shares of Karvy Data Management Services Ltd (KDMSL) on 19 December, which were pledged by Karvy to raise funds from the lender. In a stock exchange filing, Bajaj Finance said it has invoked 2.4 million pledged shares of KDMSL, representing a 10% equity stake in the company. Bajaj’s recovery was due on 23 November, just a day after Sebi passed its order.
HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and Axis Bank are the others that had lent to Karvy. HDFC Bank had extended a loan facility of  ₹350 crore to Karvy against shares and other collateral and IndusInd Bank has pending dues worth  ₹132.50 crore. Axis Bank is seeking to recover  ₹81 crore from Karvy.
Sebi is slated to decide on Axis Bank’s plea seeking ownership of pledged shares by 15 January. The markets regulator is, however, unlikely to deliver a verdict that would vary from its 13 December order issued following the representation by other lenders.
In the 13 December order, Sebi observed that all the pledged shares came from client accounts and the lenders did not exercise proper “due diligence"". While extending loans against shares, the banks failed to notice that the bulk of pledged shares did not come from the “proprietary account"" but from the “non-house"" account.
Karvy is accused of misusing client securities worth  ₹2,800 crore to secure loan facilities from lenders towards meeting working capital needs.
The brokerage also sold off client securities and transferred some of the proceeds to its real estate group company."

Indian stock markets ended flat in the penultimate session of the year. The Sensex ended 17 points lower at 41,558 while Nifty settled marginally higher at 12,260. Auto stocks were in the limelight today with the Nifty auto index logging 1.5% gain. Among the auto stocks, Tata Motors rose 4.3%, TVS Motor 3.53%, Ashok Leyland 2.8% while both M&M and Bosch Ltd logged nearly 1.5% gain.
The Nifty Bank index ended flat after hitting a record high of 32,613 during the session. 
Some selling pressure in TCS, SBI and ICICI Bank weighed. TCS fell 0.7%, SBI 0.9% and ICICI Bank 1%.
Broader market continued to show traction. The BSE midcap index today rose 0.29% while the smallcap index advanced 0.75%. 
""Market was range bound, premium valuation and lack of fresh triggers influenced investors to take cautious approach on heavyweights. But reasonable valuation of mid and small caps attracted inflows leading to outperformance in the broad market. We expect this polarized valuation not to sustain, there could be shift of money from the overvalued large caps to midcaps in 2020,"" said Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services.
Ajit Mishra, VP for research at Religare Broking, said he expects markets to remain range bound this week due to lack of any major domestic as well global triggers. 
""The market participants would keep a close watch on auto sales data. Recently, auto stocks have seen a decent run up in the recent past in anticipation of revival in volume growth. However, December has always been a soft month especially for the passenger vehicles and the two wheeler industry. Apart from this, movement in crude oil and currency would be actively tracked by traders,"" he added. 
Asian shares were mixed today as investors awaited updates on the signing of a trade deal between the US and China and kept a wary eye on North Korea. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has set an end-of-year deadline for the US to make major concessions to salvage a fragile nuclear diplomacy that hit a major setback at a summit meeting with President Donald Trump in Vietnam's capital Hanoi.

0,2019-12-30,ICICI,"Telangana HC notes that the DRT proceedings were ‘ex-parte’ in nature and thus prejudicial to KarvyKarvy says it has not defaulted in its payment obligations to ICICI Bank till Oct 2019, under the facility agreements

MUMBAI :
Karvy Stock Broking Ltd, which is embroiled in allegations of misuse of client securities, has got relief against debt recovery proceedings filed by ICICI Bank with the Telangana high court in an order last week staying the Debt Recovery Tribunal (DRT) proceedings.
The high court noted that the DRT proceedings were “ex-parte"" in nature and thus prejudicial to Karvy.
“The company has approached the honourable High Court of Telangana challenging the impugned order passed by the DRT. The honourable high court, having found the impugned order to be arbitrary and unreasonable, has stayed the operation of the impugned order, vide its order dated 24 December 2019,"" read an emailed statement from Karvy.
“The company has not defaulted in its payment obligations to ICICI Bank till October 2019, under the facility agreements,"" according to the emailed statement.
ICICI Bank Ltd had extended a loan of  ₹642 crore to the stock broking firm against a loan facility of  ₹700 crore against share pledges and other collateral.
The problem for the lender started when it was rendered incapable of invoking the pledge as on 22 November the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) passed an interim order against Karvy, where it restricted share transfer except to beneficiary owners. Sebi in the interim order found that the shares pledged by Karvy belonged to clients and thus these were transferred by the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) to the accounts of clients on 2 December.
ICICI Bank, along with three other lenders including Bajaj Finance Ltd, HDFC Bank, and IndusInd Bank, had then approached Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) for relief against the Sebi order and NSDL action as the lenders held bona fide pledges and thus were beneficiary owners of these shares. ICICI Bank had issued a letter to Karvy on 5 November to repay all the outstanding amounts availed by Karvy under the facility agreement, according to the court documents filed with SAT.
ICICI Bank had in its plea with DRT also sought that the promoters disclose their assets and that Karvy Group’s former chairman and managing director C. Parthasarathy and director Rajat Parthasarathy be restrained from leaving the country during the case proceedings.
However, the lenders were unable to get relief from SAT and Sebi. This led ICICI Bank to approach DRT for recovery of its loan amount by taking possession of the collateral especially as its call to repay outstanding amounts was not honoured by Karvy.
However, following the Telangana high court order, the prayers seeking disclosure of assets, and submission of passport by C. Parthasarathy and Rajat Parthasarathy also stand stayed.
The high court has also directed ICICI Bank to file a reply in the case by the end of January."
