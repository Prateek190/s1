209,2018-01-17,Wipro,"Four biggest IT stocks listed on NSE Infosys, TCS, Wipro, HCL Technologies rose between 4.1% and 5.9% on Tuesday, although part of that could be due to weakness in rupee

A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high.  
A rising tide may lift all boats, but to expect higher IT spending to benefit all Indian IT companies is clearly taking things too far. Morgan Stanley said in a 15 January note that “an improving global macro could spur tech spending, which could re-rate stocks"". The four biggest IT stocks listed on the National Stock Exchange rose between 4.1% and 5.9%, although part of that could be due to the weakness in the rupee, after the trade deficit for December came in at a three-year high. 
Ironically, the biggest gainer was the Wipro Ltd stock, on which Morgan Stanley still has an underweight rating with a target price of Rs290. Wipro shares rose to Rs334 apiece on Tuesday. Investors are taking the rising tide argument far too literally.
For that matter, even Morgan Stanley’s thesis is predicated upon the assumption that a turnaround in global IT spending will result in better times for the Indian IT sector. 
This isn’t necessarily the case. In recent years, multinational firms such as Accenture Plc and some small companies such as EPAM Systems Inc. and Globant SA have done far better than Indian IT firms, with spending patterns shifting towards new technologies at the expense of traditional services. 
Data collated by ISG, the world’s largest third-party outsourcing deal adviser, shows that Indian IT companies have lagged by a huge margin in the Americas region, despite high growth in overall deal flow. Growth in total deal flow tracked by ISG rose as much as 37% in Americas in the second half of 2017. 
“While the deal flow momentum in Americas was positive, the perplexing factor remains that for the top-4 Indian IT companies, growth in Americas has decelerated to 5% y-o-y in 2QFY18 (versus its near-term peak of 14% y-o-y)"", analysts at Nomura Research wrote in a note to clients. Results of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd for the December quarter show that the weakness in growth continues—the former reported growth of less than 3% year-on-year in the Americas region. In short, the tide was rising in America, but it didn’t really lift Indian IT companies with it. 
A 2018 outlook report by ISG suggests this trend might continue in 2018. “Traditional sourcing will continue to face pricing pressure (as clients look to do more with less)... Traditional sourcing momentum remains slow... deal flow grew 3% y-y in 2017 (and is estimated to grow 4% in 2018),"" Nomura’s analysts said in the note citing the ISG report. What ISG classifies as traditional sourcing is the bread and butter segment for Indian IT companies. 
The other category of deals ISG tracks is classified as “as-a-service sourcing"", which includes Software as a Service and Infrastructure as a Service. This can be used as a rough proxy for digital spending, a segment where Indian IT companies have been lagging. Even here, ISG has indicated that deal flow is expected to fall to 20% in 2018, compared to 36% in the previous year."
208,2018-01-20,Wipro,"Wipro made a one-time $49.7 million provision related to investments in UK's Carillion Plc, which has filed for bankruptcy

Bengaluru: The bankruptcy of Carillion Plc, one of British government’s largest contractors, hit Wipro Ltd’s December quarter profit as India’s third largest software firm made a one-time provision related to its investments and billed work done for the UK builder. 
Bengaluru: The bankruptcy of Carillion Plc, one of British government’s largest contractors, hit Wipro Ltd’s December quarter profit as India’s third largest software firm made a one-time provision related to its investments and billed work done for the UK builder.
Significantly, Wipro is poised to become the first large Indian information technology (IT) outsourcing company to end the current financial year with fewer employees than it started with, as its headcount fell by 2,928 in the April-December period.
Wipro did not report any sequential dollar revenue growth in the three months to December, even as revenue in constant currency terms inched up 0.9% to $2.01 billion, which met management’s earlier guidance but fell short of Street expectations.
Wipro now expects to grow at-best 3% in constant currency terms in the January-March period, which the management claims reflects the momentum it needs to end the current fiscal with industry-matching growth.
Net profit declined 10% to $303 million from $336 million in the September quarter on account of the company making a $49.7 million provision to deal with investments it made as part of its 10-year contract with Carillion, signed in 2014.
Consequently, operating margin declined 250 basis points to 14.8% from 17.3% at the end of the September quarter.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Stripped of this one-time provision, Wipro’s quarterly profit would have been up 5% sequentially at $352.7 million.
A Bloomberg survey of analysts had estimated a revenue of $2.14 billion (Rs13,684.3 crore) and a profit of $335.9 million (Rs2,144.4 crore). 
“Overall, I’m happy,"" Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala said in an interview. “Like I’ve said, we remain confident that beginning April, sequentially, our growth will be industry-matching or comparable to peers. We have resolved almost all company-specific issues and so we believe it’s just a matter of time before we start reporting industry-matching growth.""
Wipro’s third-quarter performance lagged its larger rival, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which posted a 1% sequential dollar revenue growth (1.3% in constant-currency terms) and Infosys Ltd managed a 1% dollar revenue growth (0.8% in constant currency terms).
Wipro’s energy and utilities vertical (which accounts for 12.4% of revenue) reported a 7.9% sequential decline. This was largely on account of Carillion going bankrupt and a few delays in decision-making by clients in Saudi Arabia. Still, Wipro’s clients in banking, financial services and insurance, or BFSI, who bring 28.5% of revenue, continued to affirm their faith in the firm, as the segment reported a 3.3% sequential increase.
“For now, the results, save for BFSI, does not have anything great. Communications vertical is still a soft spot. ENU (energy, natural resources and utilities) to remain volatile while we have not seen successive growth in healthcare and retail. So we have to wait until next quarter, by when the management will start reporting industry-matching growth,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity.
Wipro managing no dollar revenue growth in the third quarter, on the back of a 2.1% and a 0.9% increase in second and first quarters, respectively, means the firm has added $248.3 million in incremental revenue in April-December, 13% lower than the $285.6 million in new business in the same period of the last fiscal year.
For now, Neemuchwala maintained the firm’s organic growth remains higher in the current year than last year’s. Wipro added $358.2 million in new revenue in 2016-17 to report a 4.9% growth. In the current fiscal, the firm needs to add $377.5 million in incremental revenue to match that pace. This means Wipro will have to add $129.2 million in incremental revenue in the current fourth quarter to match last year’s growth.
For Wipro, revenue from digital offerings recorded a 46.1% growth to $505 million in the December quarter against $345.61 million in the June quarter of 2016, when the management first disclosed digital revenue. 
However, Wipro’s overall quarterly revenue inched up 4.3% to $2.01 billion from $1.93 billion in the same period. This was largely on account of a 4.55% decline in traditional business to $1.50 billion from $1.58 billion, according to a Mint analysis. One fallout of this shift is on the workforce. Wipro saw its workforce decrease by 1,206 people to 162,553 employees, after its headcount fell by 3,031 people in the second quarter."
207,2018-01-22,Wipro,"Just a matter of time before we start reporting industry-matching growth, says Wipro CEO Abidali Neemuchwala

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd’s chief executive officer (CEO) Abidali Neemuchwala says his nearly two-year effort to bring about a turnaround at India’s third largest information technology (IT) company is almost complete and it is just a matter of time before the Bengaluru-based firm starts reporting industry-matching growth.  
Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd’s chief executive officer (CEO) Abidali Neemuchwala says his nearly two-year effort to bring about a turnaround at India’s third largest information technology (IT) company is almost complete and it is just a matter of time before the Bengaluru-based firm starts reporting industry-matching growth. 
Significantly, Neemuchwala maintains fiscal year 2018-19 will be better than the current financial year, mirroring the optimism shared by Wipro’s larger rivals Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd. Mumbai-based TCS, which does not give out a quarterly or yearly growth target, expects to clock double-digit growth and Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said calendar year 2018 will be better than 2017.
“I feel pretty good with the step-by-step transformation we have undertaken… We are very confident (of starting to report sequential industry-matching growth from next fiscal). It’s just a matter of time because we have addressed all company-specific challenges,"" Neemuchwala said in an interview on Friday. 
“Every company will have some pockets which are soft. So do we… So communications vertical is one which is soft but it is because of macro issues or the environment. But I believe these soft pockets will not impact the overall growth of the company. So our guidance of 1-3% in constant currency terms (for January-March period) is our highest on organic basis in a long time, and this reflects the momentum we need,"" said Neemuchwala.
Wipro did not report any sequential dollar revenue growth in October-December although revenue inched up 0.9% in constant currency terms, which eliminate the effect of currency movements. However, Wipro added $248.3 million in incremental revenue in April-December, according to the management, reflecting initiatives leading to improved organic growth. 
Since joining Wipro as chief operating officer in April 2015, and then taking over as CEO on 1 February 2016, Neemuchwala, formerly with TCS, has taken a string of measures to improve Wipro’s ability to complete a project (delivery side of business) and also better its ability to sell solutions to newer customers (sales side). 
Neemuchwala has embarked upon what he describes as a six-pillar strategy, which includes focus on using automation tools, improving its ability to generate more revenue from existing clients, investing in newer technologies like cloud computing platforms and blockchain, and cutting reliance on sending Indians to other countries by hiring more locals in US and Europe. 
From undertaking an organizational change to restructuring the company’s business in India and West Asia, Neemuchwala has ensured stability among senior management ranks with only one senior executive departure in the past 23 months.
The firm has been the most aggressive among homegrown IT firms in acquisitions (spending $1.15 billion in buying six firms since April 2015) and making minority investments in start-ups (infusing more than $32 million in 13 start-ups and corporate venture firms) to make itself future-ready and offer newer solutions which help its clients run their business better.
Still, one fallout of the aggressive acquisition approach has been on the company’s profitability, which fell to 17.2% at the end of December quarter from 20.1% at the end of March 2016. For the December quarter, it fell to 14.8% as the company made a one-time provision related to its investments and billed work done for Carillion Plc., the British firm which went bust. 
Under Neemuchwala’s watch over the last seven full quarters as CEO, Wipro has managed to increase its quarterly revenue by 6.9% to $2.01 billion from $1.89 billion at the end of March 2016. Revenue from digital offerings or newer technologies recorded 46.1% growth to $505 million in the December quarter against $345.61 million in the June quarter of 2016, when the management first disclosed digital revenue.
Using more automation tools and profitability-related measures means Wipro’s headcount totalled 162,553 at December end against 156,831 at the end of March 2016. About 3,300 employees joined Wipro from the four acquisitions. So Wipro saw its workforce increase by 2,422 in 21 months. 
All these measures are now getting reflected, albeit in small ways. Wipro has increased the number of clients which bring more than $50 million in revenue every year by eight to 41 from 33 at the end of March 2016. The company now gets more business from banks: BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance) accounted for $573.7 million of the company’s total revenue in December quarter, a 20% jump from $478 million at the end of March 2016. One example is more business from Citigroup Inc., which brings at least $65 million in revenue every quarter as against $40 million at the end of March 2016, according to two company executives. 
Some analysts, understandably, are happy with the measures. 
“Abid is quietly creating a formidable machine to take on the industry—very aggressively pursuing some strategic clients in targeted verticals, with a strong focus on leveraging Holmes (artificial intelligence platform), its Designit acquisition and Topcoder (via Appirio). While the whole industry has been flat, Wipro has used this time strategically to focus very aggressively on digital, automation and crowdsourcing,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer (CEO) of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing research firm.
“Things are quietly bubbling at the firm. While its financial results of late have been flat along with most of the industry, I believe it is well positioned for a strong rebound as the industry picks up new momentum."" 
Investors too, appear to have faith in Wipro’s story. The stock jumped 32.24% in the last calendar year, higher than the 28% return delivered by the BSE’s benchmark Sensex and the 10.83% increase in the BSE IT index."
206,2018-01-22,Wipro,"Wipro, HCL Technologies and other IT firms said that they expect growth to pick up in the coming quarters, but it makes sense to wait and see if this materializes

Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, the third and fourth largest information technology (IT) services companies listed in India, reported results that were in line with Street estimates. Of course, HCL Technologies has been ahead of its peers and reported sequential growth of 3.3% in the December quarter, but as much as 1.5 percentage points of this might have come from inorganic contributions, according to an analyst at a multinational brokerage.  
Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, the third and fourth largest information technology (IT) services companies listed in India, reported results that were in line with Street estimates. Of course, HCL Technologies has been ahead of its peers and reported sequential growth of 3.3% in the December quarter, but as much as 1.5 percentage points of this might have come from inorganic contributions, according to an analyst at a multinational brokerage. 
Besides, it appears to have stepped up its strategy of buying growth by entering into intellectual property-related deals with International Business Machines Corp. (IBM). In fiscal 2016-17, the company reported cash outflows of $387 million on this count. In the first three quarters of this fiscal, outflows rose to $583 million. 
Adjusted for revenues from these deals and other acquisitions, year-on-year growth of the company wouldn’t be very different from the mid single-digit growth reported by peers Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. In reported terms, HCL’s revenue growth looks far more impressive at 13.9%. 
Growth at Wipro remains pedestrian at 0.9% in constant currency terms sequentially for the December quarter. The company expects growth to pick up to between 1% and 3% in the March quarter, which it says will bring it to industry-level growth rates. But a moot point is that growth in the seasonally strong June and September quarters matters far more. It remains to be seen if the company will grow in line with peers during those quarters. 
Both companies reported better growth compared to TCS and Infosys in the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment; although that has been the case for the past few quarters. For the industry as a whole, this segment continues to be lacklustre and is the primary reason overall growth has remained subdued. In HCL’s case, growth in infrastructure services remained subdued, although the company said it expects a pick-up in the coming quarters. This segment used to drive growth for the company until not too long ago.
All told, Wipro and HCL’s results give the impression, like TCS and Infosys’s, that growth remains sluggish for Indian IT firms. While most of these companies said they expect growth to pick up in the coming quarters, it makes sense to wait and see if this materializes. After all, even FY18 was expected to be a better year compared to FY17, although things haven’t turned out that way."
205,2018-02-07,Wipro,"Wipro appoints new leaders to head oil and gas practice and manufacturing and technology vertical, two segments which together bring 39% of company's total revenue

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd has entrusted its current head of manufacturing and technology practice to head the energy vertical, and created a new role for the head of oil and gas practice, marking the first management changes under chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala, who took over as boss of India’s third largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company in February 2016. 
Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd has entrusted its current head of manufacturing and technology practice to head the energy vertical, and created a new role for the head of oil and gas practice, marking the first management changes under chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala, who took over as boss of India’s third largest information technology (IT) outsourcing company in February 2016.
N.S. Balasubramanian, who heads the manufacturing and technology practice, Wipro’s second largest vertical, accounting for 22.7% or $457 million of company’s December quarter revenue, will take over as head of energy, natural resources, utilities and construction (ENU) business unit. Anand Padmanabhan, who in his decade-long leadership role as head of ENU has made it the largest practice among all homegrown IT companies, will take over as head of business development and strategic sales. Padmanabhan has been mandated to help Wipro win more large outsourcing contracts.
Both Balasubramanian and Padmanabhan hold the designation of president at the company, and report into Neemuchwala.
A spokesperson for Wipro confirmed these changes, which will be effective from 1 April 2018.
“Wipro Ltd has announced the organisational changes in line with its stated intent to rotate talent and provide diverse leadership opportunities that will give an impetus to its business strategy in the changing IT landscape,"" said a spokeswoman.
“Anand Padmanabhan (AP) will use his global experience to grow and drive localisation in ‘Leveraged Geographies’, which include Asia Pacific & Japan, Continental Europe, Canada, Middle East and Africa.""
Since joining Wipro as chief operating officer in April 2015, and then taking over as CEO on 1 February 2016, Neemuchwala, formerly with TCS, has not made any major changes to his senior leadership team or to executives who report to him. This is one reason why Wipro, save for one senior executive departure in the last two years, has managed to have a stable management team.
Still, a few analysts have also faulted Neemuchwala for his conservative approach of not bringing new leaders to head business units as possibly one reason behind the company’s slow pace of growth.
Neemuchwala has repeatedly tried to assuage any such concerns and for now maintains that beginning the financial year in April, Wipro will start reporting industry-matching growth. 
“Now, CEOs do things differently. Some CEOs come and say, look, I’m in a hurry and I have to make all the changes and bring people I know. Some CEOs say that this is a transformation journey, if you have the right people with learnability skills, you help them with a reskilling programme. You’ve got to give time to people to change and learn with the new environment,"" Neemuchwala told Mint last year on his approach of continuing with the same set of leaders. 
“I believe a stable leadership team with stable customer relationships is needed.""
Additionally, Wipro also appointed Deepak Acharaya as the general counsel and Global head, Legal, after the earlier head Inderpreet Sawhney left the company last summer to join rival Infosys Ltd. 
Wipro has split its manufacturing and technology business unit into two separate businesses that the management believes will help it improve focus. Ankur Prakash, who was one of the executives who joined Neemuchwala from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in 2015, and who is heading business for Latin America, has been given the additional responsibility of overseeing manufacturing practice. Nitin Parab will head the business from clients in the technology space."
204,2018-02-08,Wipro,"Cognizant, DXC Technology, Wipro and Tech Mahindra, which together employed 719,471 people on 1 January 2017, saw their workforce fall by 26,677 people to end the year with 692,794 people

Bengaluru: Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., DXC Technology Co., Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd have reported that their workforce has shrunk in 2017, an event that has no parallel in the two-decade history of the information technology industry in India.  
Bengaluru: Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., DXC Technology Co., Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd have reported that their workforce has shrunk in 2017, an event that has no parallel in the two-decade history of the information technology industry in India. 
Notwithstanding that fact, the companies have denied that they have laid off employees in this period.
These four firms, which together employed 719,471 people on 1 January 2017, saw their workforce fall by 26,677 people to end the year with 692,794 people (see table). Cognizant, Wipro and Tech Mahindra together saw a net decline of 3,677 people, after having added over 55,000 people in 2016. DXC, which was formed last year from the merger of Hewlett-Packard’s enterprise-services division with Computer Sciences Corp., reported the largest decline in workforce, dropping from 178,000 people in January to 155,000 by the end of September, the latest quarter for which numbers are available.
Although Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd have managed to increase their workforce, the number of people let go by the largest companies is higher than the decline in workforce suggests as they all continued to hire young engineers.
These seven largest companies employed 1,404,656 people at the end of December. That compares with the 1,408,823 they employed in January, a net decline of 4,167 in 2017, after having added more than 103,000 people in 2016.
Until 2017, not a single large IT outsourcing company has ever seen its headcount decline, and starting 1996, year after year, for more than two decades, all companies managed to keep adding to their workforce until the industry hit a perfect storm last year. 
These companies’ traditional approach of deploying armies of engineers to manage computers or offering customer support to clients and client-run businesses was getting commoditised and increasingly disrupted by the embrace of smart automation tools. Business from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud and Internet of Things—all of which is clubbed under the fuzzy word Digital—is on the rise, although it is still less than a fourth of total revenue at home-grown IT firms.
A fallout of this shift is that the world has become digital, and the IT outsourcing companies haven’t (at least, not enough), reflecting their under-preparedness in adapting to newer technologies. US President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies have also forced these companies to hire more Americans.
Since the industry now is the largest job creator, employing 3.9 million people, fewer jobs at the largest companies is worrying news not just for the companies but for the country as a whole.
Many experts feel that the industry will see a further reduction in headcount in the years ahead.
“The global IT and BPO services industry employs 16 million workers today. By 2022, our industry will employ 14.8 million—a likely decrease of 7.5% in total workers,"" Phil Fersht and Jamie Snowdon, analysts at US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm, wrote in a 3 February note. “This isn’t devastating news—we’ll lose this many people through natural attrition, but what this data signifies is this industry is now delivering more for less because of advantages in automation and artificial intelligence."""

Bengaluru: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting will reach the $1 billion revenue mark by March 2018, as the company’s China bets in particular continue to pay off and key brands in India perform well.  
Bengaluru: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting will reach the $1 billion revenue mark by March 2018, as the company’s China bets in particular continue to pay off and key brands in India perform well. 
“We continue to do well in south China. Both Guangdong and Hainan provinces are strong for us. Guangdong itself is about a $1 trillion province. It’s not a small place so if you do well there, you continue to do well (overall),"" Vineet Agrawal, Wipro Consumer Care’s chief executive officer said in an interview.
The personal care arm of Wipro Enterprises plans to step up its initiatives in the e-commerce segment by leveraging and learning from its investment in Happily Unmarried Marketing Pvt. Ltd.
The company generated about $911 million in revenue for the 2016-17 financial year. Wipro Consumer Care had originally expected to cross the $1 billion revenue mark a couple of years ago. But challenges ranging from currency fluctuations to policy changes like demonetisation have hurt business over the past two years, resulting in delays.
Over half of its revenue now comes from international markets, driven by China. Of the four global acquisitions that Wipro Consumer Care has done since 2007, three were of companies that had an existing presence in China.
Before it bought Singaporean consumer goods firm Unza Holdings Ltd for $246 million in 2007, the Wipro group company used to get about $10-12 million in revenue from China. In 2016-17, China accounted for around $75 million in revenue.
Buying Unza gave Wipro an entry into the personal wash and deodorant categories in Guangdong and Hainan. In 2016, Wipro bought Chinese fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firm Zhongshan Ma Er Daily Products Ltd, strengthening its hold in Guangdong.
Apart from China, Vietnam, Indonesia and India are the other fast-growing markets for the company, while more established and saturated markets like Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand clock slower growth rates.
In India, the company’s products range from personal care – including soap brands like Santoor and Chandrika—to home care products—like Safewash liquid detergents for clothes—and lighting solutions for home and commercial use."

Mumbai: IT firm Wipro Ltd on Wednesday said that it has signed a definitive agreement to sell its hosted data centre services business to US-based hybrid IT services provider Ensono Holdings for $405 million, the company said in a stock exchange filing.
As part of the deal, Wipro will be transferring eight data centres and over 900 employees of the hosted data centre services business to Ensono.
“The acquisition significantly expands Ensono’s geographic footprint and global service capabilities, taking the company one step closer to achieving its vision of helping clients harness the power of hybrid IT to transform their businesses on a global scale,"" said the statement.

The hosted data centre services business is one of three that became a part of Wipro when it acquired Infocrossing Inc. in 2007. The other two businesses—Medicare and Medicaid services in the health insurance space and enterprise resource planning implementation services—have been integrated with other Wipro businesses and are not part of this divestment.
“This partnership will enhance the global data centre footprint and expand the available talent pool which will give us economies of scale and allow us to offer end-to-end capabilities in the infrastructure space, better than ever before,"" said Kiran Desai, senior vice-president, Global Infrastructure Services, Wipro.
Jefferies Llc acted as an exclusive financial adviser to Ensono for this transaction, while Credit Suisse acted as the sole financial adviser to Wipro.
Ensono is a hybrid IT services provider engaged in providing complete mainframe and hybrid IT services to enterprises across industries. Through the acquisition, Ensono is doubling in size, diversifying its client portfolio and will see its annualized revenue rise to over $550 million, the statement said. 
“This is the third acquisition in less than three years for Ensono. This particular acquisition and partnership with Wipro substantially increases our ability to scale and service our growing client portfolio,"" said Ensono chief executive Jeff VonDeylen. 
Ensono is increasing its geographic presence by expanding data centre operations in Germany, the UK and US, as well as establishing an operational presence in India, VonDeylen added. 
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the quarter ending 30 June."

198,2018-04-04,Wipro,"Infosys, Wipro and TCS have dramatically reduced their H-1B visa filings and foreign nationals are exhibiting reluctance to make the jump to a US company

Bengaluru/Washington: India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas over the last three years, a US daily reported, reflecting these companies’ preparations to tackle the protectionist approach followed by the current US administration of President Donald Trump. 
Bengaluru/Washington: India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have reduced their dependence on H-1B visas over the last three years, a US daily reported, reflecting these companies’ preparations to tackle the protectionist approach followed by the current US administration of President Donald Trump.
According to data analysed from 2015 to 2017 by San Francisco Chronicle, Wipro saw a 52.4% drop in number of visa applications filed by the company over the three-year period while TCS reported a 18.3% decline and Infosys saw 38.1% reduction. Wipro applied for only 5,812 visa applications for engineers to work in the US in 2017, while TCS applied for 13,537 and Infosys filed for 20,587 applications, according to data gathered from US Department of Labour by the US daily.
This decline in number of visa applications mirrors the commentary from each of the IT firms. Wipro, for example, claims that over 55 percent of the 13,000 people employed by the company in the US are local American citizens.
“Indian consulting firms, which have been accused of flooding the system with applications, have dramatically reduced their filings. Foreign nationals are exhibiting new reluctance to make the jump to a US company,"" the paper said as the process for filing H-1B visa application for the 2019 fiscal beginning 1 October, started on 2 April.
Still, since the decline in number of applications made by Indian IT firms was most in the last year, the paper noted that the Trump administration’s hard-line anti-immigration stance is taking its toll.
The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise.
Envoy Global, a technology-oriented immigration services provider, reports that 26% of employers it surveyed have had to delay projects, and 22% of them have relocated work overseas as a result of the current uncertainties in the US immigration system, San Francisco Chronicle said.
The daily argued that study after study has shown that foreign-born workers are good for the US economy and good for US-born workers.
“When companies are allowed to hire the workers with the best skills for the job—regardless of where those workers happen to have been born—their increased competitiveness boosts all the industries around them,"" it said.
According to The Wall Street Journal, evidence suggests market demand for H-1B visas is ebbing. Daniel Culbertson, economist at Indeed Hiring Lab, says “searches related to the H-1B visa, as a share of all searches on Indeed.com, have consistently declined through 2017 and into 2018. In February 2018, searches for H-1B as a share of all searches on our site are down nine percent from the 2017...This also marks the thirteenth consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The decreased interest in H-1B related work from job seekers is a trend, not a temporary shift in preferences,"" he added.
The Wall Street Journal said corporations continue to struggle with a paradoxical labour market where 548,000 tech jobs remain open while unemployment in the technology sector hovers below full employment levels.
“There are lots of jobs, but not enough workers to fill them,"" it said."

193,2018-04-16,Wipro,"Core IT servicesbusiness seen falling apart as outsourcing firms Infosys, Wipro and TCS struggle to earn more from new solutions

Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd lowering its profitability outlook for the current financial year is a sign of worry for all companies, according to analysts and industry executives, who say that the core services business is falling apart even as companies struggle to earn more from offering newer solutions. 
Bengaluru: Infosys Ltd lowering its profitability outlook for the current financial year is a sign of worry for all companies, according to analysts and industry executives, who say that the core services business is falling apart even as companies struggle to earn more from offering newer solutions.
 Despite a favourable rupee-dollar movement and companies adding fewer employees, India’s three largest information technology (IT) firms, including Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd, have seen their profitability decline in the past five years.
Worryingly for investors, many believe that both TCS and Wipro could lower their profitability outlook for the current financial year.
TCS declares its earnings on 19 April, while Wipro reports its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on 25 April. 
“…(W)e do not think FY19 is a one-time event and represents a new normal,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 11 April. “Our read through is that margins will likely be under pressure for the IT services sector broadly, and is also evidenced by ACN’s (Accenture) margin performance/guidance in the February quarter.""
On Friday, Infosys, while declaring lukewarm full-year results, lowered its profitability outlook to 22-24% for 2018-19, as against 24-26% two years back.
Last month, Accenture Plc, while declaring its second-quarter earnings, reported an operating margin of 13.4%, narrowing 30 basis points from the year-ago period.
Three reasons explain this continued pressure on profitability.
Firstly, all IT outsourcing firms have seen an increase in wage bill on account of hiring locals in overseas markets, including the US and Europe.
Secondly, companies increasing the pace of acquiring companies focused on newer technologies means their overall profitability will remain challenged. A case in point is Wipro, which saw its operating margin fall by over 200 basis points after the company spent over $1 billion in buying five companies between April 2016 and December 2017.
Finally, intense pricing pressure on commoditized deals, which still account for over three-fourths of total revenues at these companies, is another reason. Digital, the fuzzy umbrella term, which each company uses to call revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things, still brings less than one-fourth of overall business.
“It is an absolutely cut-throat environment out there… Despite all companies offering digital technologies, the fact remains that 75-80% of business is still traditional work. All rebids are seeing up to 20% discounts being offered by IT vendors. So, even if you add digital on top of this, traditional or overall business is hardly growing and so profitability will remain under pressure,"" said an Wipro executive on the condition of anonymity.
Still, executives at IT firms say that it will be foolhardy to write off the sector.
“There are not many industries that can claim of having 22-23% profitability. So why should IT outsourcing be an exception? But for sure, a new normal is being scripted when most companies will see at least a 200-300 basis points decline in profitability in the next two-three years,"" said an executive at TCS. 
Infosys’s operating margin dropped to 24.7% at the end of March 2018 as against 26.3% at the end of March 2013. 
This despite a 18% favourable movement in currency (INR/USD was 54.54 for the year ended March 2013 as against 64.46 in the year ended March 2018.
“We believe INFY (Infosys) will have a very difficult time growing its operating margins over the next few years, given increased onsite mix from digital penetration as well as limited incremental utilization expansion. We are forecasting FY2018 margins of 23.2%,"" BMO analyst Bachman wrote in his note."
192,2018-04-19,Wipro,"Wipro Consumer Care is looking at acquisition in India and other developing markets in the spaces of home care and personal care, says CEO Vineet Agrawal

Mumbai: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting is scouting for personal and home care acquisitions in the Middle East, Indonesia, Vietnam, China and India, chief executive officer Vineet Agrawal said. 
Mumbai: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting is scouting for personal and home care acquisitions in the Middle East, Indonesia, Vietnam, China and India, chief executive officer Vineet Agrawal said.
The consumer care unit of Wipro Ltd making Santoor soaps and Yardley fragrances started as an oil crushing unity in the 1940s, and now earns more than half of its revenues from international operations.
“We are looking at acquisition in India and other developing markets in the spaces of home care and personal care,"" Agrawal told Mint. Wipro Consumer bought Singapore’s Unza Holdings Ltd in 2007; Yardley’s India and Middle East business in 2009, and its UK and Europe business in 2012. In 2012, it acquired Singaporean skincare company LD Waxson’s group, and in 2016, bought China-based Zhongshan Ma Er. In India, it has bought brands like Chandrika, Glucovita, Aramusk, Cleanray and North-West Switches. In November, it bought a significant minority stake in online consumer products firm Happily Unmarried Marketing Pvt. Ltd known for its Ustraa and Happily Unmarried range of products. 
Agrawal said in 2017-18, Wipro Consumer crossed $1 billion in revenue for the first time. The Rs6,600 crore revenue in 2017-18 compares with Rs59,402.30 crore ($911 million) the previous fiscal year. The like-to-like growth is 13% when adjusted for the goods and service tax which was introduced during the last fiscal. 
With domestic and international operations both doing well, operating profit margins too expanded by close to a percentage point, said Agrawal.
Globally, mergers and acquisitions are expected to pick up in 2018 after a slight dip in deal values in the last year, according to a 2018 consumer and retail M&A report by consulting firm ATKearney. 
Volume growth, a measure used to check whether people are buying more units or even whether more people are buying the brand registered a 10% growth during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year for India. For the full year, it was higher at 12%, said Agrawal. “Overall demand is not bad across India – urban and rural. It’s not the best of times nor the worst of times,"" said Agrawal. However, farmer distress is a reality in states like Maharashtra and Telangana, he added."
191,2018-04-23,Wipro,"That TCS stock is trading at about 20 times FY20 estimates, compared to 13-17 times of Infosys and Wipro, is justifiable due to its relatively better results in the past

Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) ended fiscal year 2018 (FY18) on a positive note, recording a sequential constant currency growth of 2% in the March quarter, higher than Street estimates of 1-1.5%. 
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) ended fiscal year 2018 (FY18) on a positive note, recording a sequential constant currency growth of 2% in the March quarter, higher than Street estimates of 1-1.5%.
The $100 million client segment has seen one addition and the other client buckets also saw noticeable additions. Cash conversion is strong. The contribution of digital business in the overall revenues continues to rise and operating margins have improved.
Further, the management is confident of carrying forward this positive momentum into FY19. It expects the margins to remain stable.
The company is seeing renewed traction in the UK and Europe. Industry-wise the management is confident about the retail business vertical gaining momentum in the rest of the fiscal year. Six industry verticals grew faster than the company average on a year-on-year scale.
The only business segment that is lagging is the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, which generates almost one-third of TCS’s revenues. Commentary on this segment remains cautious.
In a post results conference, the management said it is incrementally turning confident about the BFS vertical, though revenues are yet to reflect this. Growth in this segment remained flat or expanded just 0.4% on a sequential basis in constant currency terms. More clarity is expected in the June quarterly results.
Traction in this segment may well be crucial for the earnings upgrades, a necessity for the next leg of growth in the stock.
After trailing the benchmark indices in 2017, TCS along with the other information technology stocks began gaining traction this year. As Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities points out, the gains are driven more by expansion in valuation multiples and sector rotation than a growth recovery, which was modest until now.
The TCS stock is trading at about 20 times FY20 estimates compared to Infosys Ltd’s and Wipro Ltd’s 13-17 times. The valuation premium is partly justifiable due to TCS’s relatively better performance in the past."

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd, India’s third-biggest software services exporter by revenue, on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected fourth-quarter net profit, hurt by lower revenue from operations.
The IT firm said it expected revenue from IT services to be in a range of $2.02-$2.07 billion in the June quarter.
Net profit fell 20.3% to Rs1,803 crore ($269.99 million) in the three months ended 31 March, Bengaluru-headquartered Wipro said on Wednesday.
Analysts on average expected a profit of Rs2,132 crore, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Revenue from operations fell 1.6% to Rs13,769 crore, while revenue from its key IT services business rose 5.5% to $2.06 billion, in the range forecast by Wipro.

188,2018-04-25,Wipro,"Wipro's revenue outlook for current quarter dashes hopes it will turn the corner soon

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd on Wednesday reported fiscal-fourth quarter revenue growth that was in line with analysts estimates but the company said it does not expect any revenue growth in the current quarter, dashing hopes that India’s third largest information technology outsourcing company will turn the corner soon. 
Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd on Wednesday reported fiscal-fourth quarter revenue growth that was in line with analysts estimates but the company said it does not expect any revenue growth in the current quarter, dashing hopes that India’s third largest information technology outsourcing company will turn the corner soon.
Wipro managed a 2.9% growth in constant-currency terms in 2017-18, implying that for the second straight year, India’s three largest services firms, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, grew slower than industry body Nasscom’s estimates.
Tata Consultancy Services reported a 6.7% growth, while Infosys managed a 5.8% expansion in constant-currency terms, which was lower than Nasscom’s 7.8% growth estimate for the country’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry in 2017-18. 
Tata Consultancy Services , Infosys and Wipro grew slower than the Nasscom’s 8.6% growth estimate in 2016-17.
Significantly, Bengaluru-based Wipro became the first large information technology outsourcing company to end the year with fewer employees than it started with, its headcount falling by 1,654 employees in 2017-18. 
The company added 8,650 employees in 2016-17, underlining the challenges faced by the sector, which employed 3.7 million people.
Wipro’s dollar revenue improved 2.4% sequentially to $2.06 billion in the three months to March (1.1% rise in constant currency terms), after it had earlier outlined quarterly growth of at-best 3% in constant currency terms in the fourth quarter.
Net profit declined 8.6% to $277 million from $303 million in the preceding quarter, on account of the company making a one-time provision for two clients, including British contractor Carillion Plc and telecom operator Aircel, going bankrupt. 
A Bloomberg survey of 28 analysts had estimated Wipro to report revenue of $2.1 billion, or Rs13,924.2 crore, in the quarter. The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $321.47 million, or Rs2,127.5 crore, in the period.
“I’m disappointed,"" said Abidali Neemuchwala, chief executive officer, Wipro. “But then, this is on account of surprises and the pain in HPS (HealthPlan Services business) and you cannot really predict these surprises.""
At the heart of Wipro’s under-performance was the $200 million impact on company’s revenue, including getting $150 million less business from Healthplan Services that it bought in 2016, and the $50 million hit on account of two clients going bust. 
Wipro, which only gives a quarterly outlook, does not expect any growth in the current quarter, as the management has guided its revenue to be between a decline of 2% and at-best 0.2% growth in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter. 
Infosys expects revenue to grow 6-8% in constant currency terms (7-9% dollar revenue growth).
While Tata Consultancy Services does not give quarterly or yearly forecasts, the management has said it expects to clock a double digit growth in the current financial year. 
“Wipro has delivered an in-line revenue performance for the quarter, however, there was a significant miss on the EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins,"" said Sanjeev Hota, an analyst at brokerage Sharekhan Ltd. 
“Guidance for Q1FY19 was quite disappointing, with expectations of muted to negative sequential growth. Wipro has been struggling to report consistent growth due to ramping down of its accounts, challenges in industry pockets and continuing slippage in its traditional business,"" Hota added.
For 2017-18, Wipro reported 4.6% dollar revenue growth, lower than the 4.9% growth in 2016-17, to end with $8.06 billion in revenue.
Significantly, Tata Consultancy Services added $1.51 billion in incremental revenue in 2017-18, about twice the $731 million in new business done by Infosys, and more than four times the $355.7 million in new revenue added by Wipro.
Wipro shares were little changed at Rs287.20 on BSE at the close of trading on Wednesday, a day when the benchmark index, the Sensex, fell 0.33% to end at 34,501.27 points. Wipro announced its earnings after market hours."
187,2018-04-26,Wipro,"Wipro has had too many false starts and it is not yet clear when the growth rates will begin to move up

The key thing to watch for in Wipro’s March quarter results was whether it would live up to its aim of achieving the industry level growth rate by the end of March 2018. From that perspective, the results have been a major disappointment. The company’s constant currency IT services revenues increased 1.1% sequentially, lower than most analyst estimates. 
The key thing to watch for in Wipro’s March quarter results was whether it would live up to its aim of achieving the industry level growth rate by the end of March 2018. From that perspective, the results have been a major disappointment. The company’s constant currency IT services revenues increased 1.1% sequentially, lower than most analyst estimates.
Profitability trailed Street estimates by a wide margin as the company booked impairment loss at one of its acquisitions and made provisions for loss of revenues arising out of the insolvency of two of its customers. Adjusting for this, Wipro claims operating margins of 16%, which is nonetheless still lower than Street estimates of about 17%.
What’s worse is that guidance for the June quarter implies revenue contraction at the lower end and a minuscule 0.1% growth at the upper end of the guidance, on a sequential basis. Further, margins can remain soft in June quarter as well, as the company deals with the revenue loss due to the above-mentioned insolvencies of two of its customers and also tackles wage hikes.
In short, both the performance and the commentary is way off the growth convergence with the industry narrative (see chart).
Thankfully, investors have been taking the optimism with a dose of salt and the stock is pricing in the caution. It began trailing the broader markets beginning this year as the company flagged off the client-specific issues and its financial impact. But nobody is prepared for a drop in revenues in the June quarter. “Any guidance below 0%-2% constant currency growth (on a low base) for 1QFY19 will be disappointing,"" Nirmal Bang institutional equities had said in its results preview note.
The management expects the company to return to the growth path in the second quarter of the current financial year, thanks to strong order wins in the digital part of the business. “Our strong order bookings in the last two quarters provide us the right foundation to grow as we progress through the year,"" Abidali Z. Neemuchwala chief executive officer, Wipro said in a statement. Further, the management sees “building blocks"" forming for margin improvement in the rest of the fiscal year, aided by better client mining and business mix.
But investors may refuse to bite. The company has had too many false starts and it is not yet clear when the growth rates will begin to move up. “Given the kind of guidance, they (Wipro) are far away from what the industry is going to deliver,"" says Sanjeev Hota, associate vice president-research, Sharekhan.
To be fair though, as Abhishek Shindadkar, analyst at Equirus Securities Pvt. Ltd says, it would be churlish to expect Wipro to predict their clients going bankrupt. It is unfortunate for Wipro that these setbacks have come in a single quarter. But unfortunately, the net impact of all of this and the weak performance, adds Shindadkar, could be earnings cuts and further pressure on the stock—a far cry from its stellar run in 2017."

Mumbai: Shares of Wipro Ltd fell as much as 4.6% on Thursday as brokerage firms reduced its target price after the company reported lower-than-estimated March quarter earnings. 
The stock touched a low of Rs274.10 a share during the day. At 9.40am, the scrip was trading at Rs276.20 on BSE, down 4% from its previous close. So far this year, it has declined 11.7% while BSE IT index has risen 19.1% in the same period. 
The Bengaluru-based company also said that it does not expect any revenue growth in the current quarter, dashing hopes that India’s third largest information technology outsourcing company will turn the corner soon.
Kotak Institutional Equities has slashed FY20 constant currency revenues by 3-4% for Wipro. “The cut captures the additional information of slow pace of large deal ramp-ups and negative surprises in communications and India and Middle East businesses. A slower revenue has consequent impact on EBIT margins. we cut the same by 130-140 basis points (bps) for the next two years. Net result is 6-7% cut in FY2019-20 earnings per share (EPS) estimate,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to its investors
The brokerage firm has cut its target price to Rs280. “A weak portfolio of clients and business mix combined with a historical weakness of missing important strategic bets keep us cautious on Wipro,"" it added.
Wipro’s dollar revenue improved 2.4% sequentially to $2.06 billion in the three months to March (1.1% rise in constant currency terms). It had earlier outlined quarterly growth of at-best 3% in constant currency terms in the fourth quarter.
“Wipro continues to under-perform its peers in terms of growth. While management has alluded to strong order wins, conversion into revenue growth remains an issue. FY19E will be the 7th successive year of single digit dollar revenue growth for Wipro. Looking ahead, we would watch for improvement in Healthcare and Lifesciences and communications verticals,"" said Reliance Securities in a note to its investors.
The brokerage firm has retained its hold rating on the stock and revised its target price to Rs290 from Rs308 a share.
Wipro’s net profit in Q4 declined 8.6% to $277 million from $303 million in the preceding quarter, on account of the company making a one-time provision for two clients, including British contractor Carillion Plc and telecom operator Aircel, going bankrupt.
A Bloomberg survey of 28 analysts estimated Wipro to report revenue of $2.1 billion, or Rs13,924.2 crore, in the quarter. The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $321.47 million, or Rs2,127.5 crore, in the period.

184,2018-05-02,Wipro,"HCL expects its dollar revenue to grow by as much as 12.5% in the current fiscal, implying it will race past Wipro

Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd is set to surpass Wipro Ltd to become India’s third biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry in six years. 
Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd is set to surpass Wipro Ltd to become India’s third biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry in six years.
Billionaire Shiv Nadar-led HCL Technologies expects its dollar revenue to grow by as much as 12.5% in the current financial year, implying that the company will race past Azim Premji-led Wipro. 
HCL Technologies’s rise has come on the back of years of underperformance by Wipro. Until a few years ago, both companies used to generate significant business from managing data centres or offering infrastructure services to their clients. That revenue disappeared with the rise of cloud computing or offerings of computing power by the hour by firms such as Amazon Web Services.
To mitigate this, HCL Technologies has invested over $1.3 billion over the past two years in licensing intellectual properties (IPs) from companies and then building products around them for clients. This has proved financially lucrative for the company in the short run.
Noida-based HCL Technologies reported 2.5% sequential dollar revenue growth in the quarter ended March to end with $2.038 billion in revenue, a mere $24 million less than Wipro’s $2.062 billion.
Wipro does not provide full-year revenue forecast but expects its quarterly revenue to be between a decline of 2% and growth of 0.2% in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter. If Wipro manages to retain its revenue in constant currency terms and gains from favourable currency movements, it will mean reporting at best 1% dollar revenue growth, according to Mint’s calculations.
HCL Technologies does not provide a quarterly revenue outlook but the management expects dollar revenue to grow between 10.5% and 12.5% in 2018-19. Based on its full-year forecast, HCL Technologies expects its dollar revenue to grow between 2.4% and 3.2% in the April-June period, according to Mint’s calculations. HCL Technologies’s revenue in the June quarter will total $2.087 billion if the company grows at the lower end, or 2.4%, sequentially, which will be more than Wipro’s $2.082 billion in revenue at the end of the June quarter. 
Mint reported on 11 January that HCL Technologies may overtake Wipro in 2018-19. 
In 2012, Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. edged past Infosys Ltd in quarterly revenue. The Teaneck, New Jersey-based company, which has most of its employees in India, finally ended that year with more revenue than Bengaluru-based Infosys."
183,2018-05-06,Wipro,"Since the start of the year until 12 April, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%

Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one.  
Mumbai/Bengaluru: A less-than bullish commentary by managements of Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, and fewer analyst recommendations for buying their shares, have made many wonder if the current financial year will be better for the industry than the last one. 
In January, executives at India’s largest information technology (IT) outsourcing companies had exuded optimism that 2018-19 was going to be a better year. Investors bought into the story as shares of the four largest IT companies outperformed the Sensex until 12 April.
Since the start of the year until 12 April, a day before Infosys declared earnings, TCS shares gained 16.2%, Infosys 11.8% and HCL 13.5%, while Wipro lost 8.5%. During this time, BSE Sensex hardly posted any return, gaining 0.13%. 
However, two months into the current financial year, it appears many of these companies are grappling with unique challenges and that all of them will struggle to improve the growth reported in the last two years.
India’s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd has bucked this trend so far. The Mumbai-based company has been an outlier—its management reaffirmed that it should clock double-digit growth in the current year, leading to more brokerages putting a buy recommendation on the shares after it declared earnings on 19 April.
But fewer analysts are now bullish on Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies (See adjoining table) after the companies declared earnings than at the start of the year.
“Save for TCS, the question to be asked to IT companies is, where is the recovery,"" said the former CEO of one the largest IT firms. “Certainly, the growth outlook is not much better than last year. Even the management commentary is not cheerful as it sounded in January. So, what has really changed in the last four months?""
Infosys reported a 7.2% dollar revenue growth at 24.3% operating margin in the year ended March 2018. For the current year, the company expects to grow its dollar revenue between 7% and 9%, but at a lower operating margins band of between 22% and 24%, prompting some analysts to change their bullish outlook. 
Ditto for Wipro and HCL. 
Two client-related bankruptcies and the company’s planned restructuring in the Middle East and India is taking longer than chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala had anticipated dashed any hopes that Wipro will turn the corner soon. 
Wipro does not give a full-year revenue guidance but expects quarterly revenue to be between a decline of 2% and growth of 0.2% in constant currency terms in the April-June period from the preceding quarter.
HCL Technologies, which reported a 12.4% growth last year, expects to grow its dollar revenue between 10.5% and 12.5% in the current fiscal. However, management expects more than half of this incremental growth to come from acquisitions and because of business brought from the company’s many intellectual property (IP) partnerships.
Worryingly for investors, all these companies are not struggling for revenue growth alone as a few analysts like Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets have expressed scepticism on the profitability outlook for them."

New York: Indian IT services giant Wipro is “localising more"" in the US and more than half of its workforce in the country now consists of locals, the company’s chief strategy officer Rishad Premji said asserting that the firm is very committed to the US market. 
New York: Indian IT services giant Wipro is “localising more"" in the US and more than half of its workforce in the country now consists of locals, the company’s chief strategy officer Rishad Premji said asserting that the firm is very committed to the US market.
Premji, who is member of the board at Wipro, said Wipro currently has a workforce of over 14,000 employees in the US and 58% of those are locals. Under the Donald Trump administration, there is heightened scrutiny of the H1B work visa programme, which several lawmakers allege is being abused to replace Americans with foreign workers.
The H1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. 
The technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China. Since taking office, Trump has ordered an overhaul of the H1B visa programme to check visa fraud and abuse, and his administration has taken steps to tighten scrutiny of applications, adding to the uncertainty and anxiety of thousands of IT workers on the visas over their future.
“So we are not a 50-50 company. (The US) still remains one of our largest markets so it’s an area of big focus for growth and I think if you cannot win in the US market, you really won’t win globally,"" Premji said in an interview. 
Premji, who was in the city to address the Nasscom C-Summit last week, said Wipro is “very very committed"" to the US market. Premji is also the chairman of the Nasscom. “We are localizing more, we are hiring on a very structured basis from campus, which has been very very successful,"" he said.
In June last year, Wipro said in a press release that locals formed over 50% of its US workforce. In the first half of last year, Wipro had hired over 1,600 employees by “attracting and nurturing local talent to drive innovation and help transform clients’ businesses into digital enterprises"".
During the past decade, Wipro said it has invested over $2billion in the US, according to the company press release. The company has been focused on creating jobs in the US underscoring its strategy to “build a deep reservoir of local talent based out of centres close to its clients"".
During FY17, over 3,000 locals joined Wipro and the company would continue to recruit from top universities to build on the momentum of hiring locally in the United States, the press release had said. 
Premji added that Wipro has been hiring from campuses in the US for two years now and plans to scale that going forward. Wipro also continues to invest in centres in the US and as part of this, it had last year launched a multi-million dollar Silicon Valley Innovation Center in Mountain View, California.
Premji said Wipro also continues to invest from a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) perceptive in the US as well and a big focus for it is to help elevate the quality of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) talent in the US.
Wipro is working with certain universities that support programmes with teachers who can enhance their own STEM capabilities to then “produce better STEM-educated students in disadvantaged communities, Tier 2 and Tier 3 districts of the US,"" Premji said.
“We have a huge amount of commitment to this market, we want to be ingrained in the very natural fibre and fabric of this market and the communities in which we work and live and where our employees work and live,"" Premji said."

New York: Indian start-ups will see substantial growth over the next decade and many of them will turn into world-class companies to lead the next phase of building “brand India"" in a broader technology landscape, Wipro’s chief strategy officer Rishad Premji said in New York Monday.
Nasscom president Premji called for enhancing the lens beyond just thinking and looking at the IT services landscape but also to focus on other ecosystems of capabilities that are thriving in the country. He expressed optimism over the future of the start-up ecosystem in the country.
“India has over 5000 start-ups today. I think over the next 8-10 years that number will grow substantially and many of them will be world-class organisations with world-class products, creating world-class employability and value and recognition and be the next phase in many ways of continuing to build brand India from a broader technology landscape,"" Premji told PTI in an interview in New York.
“We should evolve our thinking just from the traditional IT services story to the broader technology story."" On the outlook for the Indian IT industry, Premji said he is “very hopeful."" He cited a report titled Perspective 2025: Shaping the Digital Revolution by Nasscom which said the Indian technology and services industry is on track to reach its goal of $200-225 billion in revenues by 2020 and may even touch $350 billion by 2025. 
Premji said this “implicitly suggests"" double digit growth over the next 7-8 years. “I am quite hopeful that if we do many things right, one of which is the skilling piece,"" he said. “There is huge opportunity for the industry not only to survive but to thrive over the next 8-10 years."" 
Premji noted that there is a dearth of technical talent everywhere in the world today and India is a large producer of technical talent, with a million engineers graduating every year in the country. “Even if you assume half of those are employable, there are still 500,000 engineers every year and if you can channelise them correctly, you are still a huge source of talent,"" he said. 
He asserted that talent still is a “big differentiator"" in the technology landscape, “So I am hugely optimistic and hugely hopeful in terms of the opportunities that lie ahead for the technology industry,"" in the country. 
With companies globally moving towards a new phase of digital transformation, Premji said the industry is sitting on the “cusp of transformation"", which is the digitalisation of organisations. “The year 2018-19 is a moment of some acceleration and pivot where customers are moving from experimentation and prototyping around digitalization to industrial scaling. That presents a huge amount of opportunity globally for technology service providers and certainly Indian service providers as well. All of us in the IT services industry globally are gearing up to participate in that opportunity,"" he said. 
Premji stressed that a major implication and enabler to participate in that opportunity is the right capability and talent. “So skilling is a big focus for all organisations,"" he said adding that companies must now reskill and up-skill existing workforce in the industry. “It is equally important that they then have the opportunity to demonstrate, enhance those skills through practical application. We have got to think very closely about the intersection between new-age technologies and their usefulness to business,"" he said, adding that innovating in technology on a standalone basis may not be useful to customers. 
Instead, how one can apply artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain to useful scenarios for business is of paramount importance now."
179,2018-05-31,Wipro,"Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, which is estimated to be $400 million business, expects its newest business division to become a $100 million business by March 2020

Bengaluru: Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, a business division of Wipro Enterprises Ltd, the privately held business by billionaire Azim Premji, has set up a new business division, called automation solutions, under which it will boost productivity of manufacturing companies in India, the Middle East and Africa by making up industrial robots in their facilities. 
Bengaluru: Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, a business division of Wipro Enterprises Ltd, the privately held business by billionaire Azim Premji, has set up a new business division, called automation solutions, under which it will boost productivity of manufacturing companies in India, the Middle East and Africa by making up industrial robots in their facilities.
Wipro Infrastructure Engineering was demerged from parent Wipro Ltd, the listed information technology (IT) outsourcing arm in 2013, and along with Wipro’s consumer care business clubbed under Wipro Enterprises. 
Wipro Infrastructure Engineering does not share its financials but is estimated to be a $400 million business division, offering solutions across four areas, including in hydraulic products, aerospace and defence, water treatment and additive manufacturing or 3D printing. 
The Bengaluru-based company expects automation solutions to become at least a $100 million business division by March 2020, according to a senior executive. 
“Initially, in the next 24 months, we will leverage our strength and offer solutions to tier-I and tier-II auto companies in India and then we will take these solutions to other countries in Asia and Middle East,"" said Pratik Kumar, chief executive officer, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering.
Put simply, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering wants to play a role of system integrator by implementing and managing industrial robotics manufacturers like Japanese robot maker Fanuc Corp or a German robot maker Kuka and make these robots work with humans and other non-robotic gear in a factory floor, such as cranes and conveyor belts.
Wipro will offer its automation solutions to companies which are in discrete manufacturing or firms that make individual items or those firms which make cars, airplanes, furniture and smartphones.
Globally, Swiss engineering giant ABB and American conglomerate GE have emerged as large system integrators even though India remains a relatively underpenetrated market.
Wipro estimates that the addressable market for system integrators for automation solutions in discrete manufacturing in India to be a $400-$450 million, which has grown over 17% annually over the last few years. 
“The government’s push towards Make In India Initiative, to my mind, will not happen only by setting up new factories or establishments. I believe it will also happen by making existing factories and assets more productive. And we believe with automation tools, manufacturing companies can get 25-30% productivity improvement,"" said Kumar, who joined Wipro in 1991.
“Let me say that I’ll be disappointed if we cannot become a $100 million business in this space in the next 18-24 months,"" said Kumar.
“Wipro is seeing a massive increase in demand for the production of new age industrial robots for automotive engineering. I see this as a logical move to keep WIN (Wipro Infrastructure Engineering) outside of Wipro mothership, as that company battles the headwinds of very tough competition and price erosion in certain IT services,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer (CEO) of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm. “But there is a dire need to bring the two areas together in a smart way as tech is proving the real differentiator in the car business—so how Premji managing the cross-pollination of resources and innovations between WIN and traditional Wipro will be critical.""
Kumar, who was the HR head at the IT firm before becoming the CEO of Wipro Infrastructure Engineering in 2014, admits that his firm’s latest foray will work with engineers at the listed IT company. 
For now, automation solutions has a team of 20 people and is headed by G. Sundararaman, who before joining Wipro worked at British construction equipment maker JCB and at the two-wheeler brand, Royal Enfield, owned by Eicher Motors Ltd."

175,2018-06-27,Wipro,"Apart from ICICI Bank and Mahindra, HDFC Bank, Vedanta and Tata Steel are the other most preferred stocks, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro are the least favoured

Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon. 
Mumbai: Utility vehicles maker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd is currently the most-preferred Sensex stock for analysts as they place their bets on improving demand in the rural sector on the back of a good monsoon.
Of the top five most preferred stocks, three are financials, with ICICI Bank being the second-most preferred stock, and most preferred financial stock despite being in the news for all the wrong reasons, as brokerages welcomed cheaper valuations coupled with steps to investigate alleged wrongdoing.
The analysis includes stocks which have the highest percentage of buys/outperform/add ratings from the Sensex pack of the total ratings for the respective stocks.
According to data from Bloomberg, Mahindra is the most preferred stock with 42, or 97.67% of analysts tracking the stock rating it a buy or outperform, and only one analyst or 2.33% of the total analysts rating the stock a hold or a neutral. There were no sell ratings on the stock.
Mahindra shares that started rallying on 21 February have gained 26.8% since then. Year to date, they are up 19.6% at  ₹  898.30, outperforming BSE’s benchmark 30-share Sensex which rose 4.21% during the period.
“Rural demand outlook remains positive, on expectations of normal monsoons and government spending in rural segment,"" Nomura said in a note on 30 May, while maintaining its buy rating and raising its target price to  ₹  1,049 from  ₹  965 earlier.
Nomura analysts pointed that Mahindra maintained its 8-10% tractor growth forecast for fiscal year 2019, with scope for upside risk, and the brokerage estimates 10% growth in fiscal year 2019 and 8% in fiscal year 2020.
“Revival of rural growth and volume recovery in UVs (utility vehicles) should help the stock re-rate, in our view,"" Nomura analysts added.
In the case of ICICI Bank, 48 analysts or 92.3% analysts rated the stock a buy or outperform, while three or 5.77% analysts had a hold, or one or 1.92% of total analysts rated it a sell. 
“Beyond the remedial measures around the current negative news flow, we maintain our Buy on ICICI Bank given gradual improvement in the operating environment coupled with the arrest of fresh NPL (non-performing loans) formation, and cheaper valuations,"" Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note on 18 June. Year to date, ICICI Bank shares have shed 8.28%.
On 18 June, ICICI Bank’s board said that CEO Chanda Kochhar, who is facing conflict-of-interest allegations, will go on leave until a committee investigating allegations of impropriety completes its work. In the interim, Sandeep Bakhshi—who has been appointed as the chief operating officer (COO)—will steer its businesses.
The Videocon group had secured $500 million in loans from a consortium of lenders led by ICICI Bank and 19 other banks in April 2012.
The whistleblower, Arvind Gupta, has alleged that the loans to Videocon group companies were approved by ICICI Bank after the group owner Venugopal Dhoot had invested in NuPower, where Kochhar’s husband Deepak Kochhar was a partner.

New Delhi: Wipro Ltd, India’s third largest IT company, has not explicitly mentioned US President Donald Trump’s policies as one of the risk factors for its business, according to its recent filing with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Last year, the Bengaluru-based IT company had explicitly named Trump’s policies as one the risk factors for its business. Wipro derives over half of the its IT services revenue from the Americas (including the US). 
New Delhi: Wipro Ltd, India’s third largest IT company, has not explicitly mentioned US President Donald Trump’s policies as one of the risk factors for its business, according to its recent filing with US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Last year, the Bengaluru-based IT company had explicitly named Trump’s policies as one the risk factors for its business. Wipro derives over half of the its IT services revenue from the Americas (including the US).
In a 28 June filing with the US SEC, Wipro said: “Political and economic factors, such as pending elections, changes in governments and revisions to government policies can affect our business. We are a global organization and are therefore vulnerable to multiple factors that are difficult to predict beyond our influence and control, including shifts and uncertainties in global trade and economic policies"".
“Changes in policies by governments in the countries where we operate in could affect our operating results due to changes in duties, tariffs or taxes, or limitations on currency or fund transfers, as well as government-imposed restrictions on producing certain products in, or shipping them to, specific countries,"" Wipro added in the filing.
Last year, in a June filing with the US SEC, Wipro had said: “On November 8, 2016, Mr. Donald J. Trump was elected the next president of the United States. As a candidate, President Trump and his administration expressed support for policies impacting existing trade agreements, like North America Free trade agreement (“NAFTA""), and proposed trade agreements, and promoting greater restrictions on free trade generally and significant increases on tariffs on goods imported into the United States.""
“Changes in US social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently operate could adversely affect our business,"" Wipro said in its filing last year.
Since becoming US President, Donald Trump has called for stricter immigration norms and a review of the H-1B visa programme. The Trump administration has also signalled its intent to rescind H-4 visa rule, which allows spouses of H-1B visa holders to work in the US.
Meanwhile, Wipro had earlier this week said that it has completed the divestment of its data centre business in Germany and the UK along with Wipro Data Centre and Cloud Services Inc. for a consideration of $399 million."

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd has promoted Rajan Kohli, the head of its digital business, to the rank of president, a move analysts said underscores the significance of new solution offerings in the revenue portfolio of the Bengaluru-based company.
Wipro, while elevating Kohli late last month, promoted four other executives to the rank of senior vice-president, according to an executive familiar with the development.
“Wipro Limited can confirm that Rajan Kohli has been promoted as president, digital, with immediate effect. He will continue to be the global head of Wipro Digital and report to chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala,"" said a spokesperson for Wipro.
Kohli is one of the eight presidents at the company, all of them reporting to Neemuchwala. 
The company’s chief operating officer, Bhanumurthy Ballapuram; chief human resources officer Saurabh Govil; and the recently appointed head of strategic sales, Anand Padmanabhan, are presidents. 
Shaji Farooq, the company’s head of banking and financial services unit; N.S. Bala, the head of energy, natural resources and utilities division; Srini Pallia, the head of consumer business unit; and Milan Rao, the head of the communications business, are also presidents. 
Kohli, who took over as head of Wipro Digital in March 2015, has steered it to become a $2 billion business for the company, making the growth of the digital business one of the few success stories at the company. 
“Rajan has led the efforts to bring Wipro Digital from zero to $2 billion in a quick three years. We have seen him help clients bridge the gap in not only digital technology but also understanding the digital business models required for success,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “This is recognition of not only Rajan’s efforts to grow $2 billion in Digital but also the importance of Digital in the revenue mix for Wipro,"" said Wang.
Over the last few years, Wipro, which ended with $8.06 billion in revenue last year, has struggled for growth and lagged behind its rivals. Noida-based HCL Technologies Ltd is poised to surpass Wipro to become India’s third-biggest software services provider in the current quarter, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion IT outsourcing industry in six years."
172,2018-07-09,Wipro,"Tech Mahindra CEO C.P. Gurnani's salary consists has a large component of stock options, which pegs  his remuneration significantly higher than peers at TCS, Infosys and Wipro

Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees. 
Bengaluru: Tech Mahindra’s chief executive officer C.P. Gurnani earned  ₹  146.19 crore in remuneration in 2017-18, bringing his total earnings over the last five years to  ₹ 510 crore. The numbers have rekindled debate among analysts and observers on compensation for the CEO of India’s fifth largest software services company and how it compares with the median salary of its other employees.
Significantly, Gurnani’s  ₹ 510 crore in earnings is about 24% more than the combined earnings of  ₹ 387.92 crore of nine CEOs at the four largest IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, over the last five years, according to a Mint analysis.
Tech Mahindra’s vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar who retires this year, earned  ₹ 363.13 crore during this period, making the total payout by the company to two of its senior-most executives to  ₹ 873.16 crore over the last five years.
Gurnani and Nayyar’s annual salary has a large component of stock options exercised during the last four years and for this reason, their compensation is higher than their peers.
Tech Mahindra defended the high compensation to its two executives, saying the grant of shares to Gurnani and Nayyar is tied to the company’s performance, with the company having clocked the fastest compound annual growth since 2013.
“The grant of shares for the executives including MD (managing director) & CEO is based on performance parameters and is decided by the Nomination and Remuneration committee, consisting of non-executive and independent directors,""said a spokeswoman for Tech Mahindra. 
“If one looks at the last five years of growth, Tech Mahindra has been the fastest-growing company amongst the top five and the stock has been one of the best performers amongst peer group,"" said the spokeswoman.
Although this is correct, Tech Mahindra’s performance—both revenue and profitability—is not significantly better than its four larger rivals. 
Again, as Tech Mahindra is much smaller than TCS or Infosys, it is only expected of the firm to grow faster. 
Sample this: Tech Mahindra reported a 9.6% dollar revenue growth to end with $4.77 billion in revenue in 2017-18 as against TCS’s 8.6% growth to end with $19.1 billion in revenue last year. 
TCS’s $4.97 billion revenue in the January-March period is more than Tech Mahindra’s $4.77 billion sales for the entire year. 
Still, TCS chief executive Rajesh Gopinathan earned  ₹ 12.49 crore, as against Gurnani’s  ₹ 146.19 crore last year. 
Vishal Sikka, Infosys’s former US-based CEO, who faced criticism over higher salary from some of the software services company’s founders, earned  ₹ 111.32 crore over three years.
“Capitalism is still trying to find a comfortable home in India and it is such instances of high, excessive compensation which in a democracy likes ours gives capitalism a bad name,"" said Gurcharan Das, author and former chief executive officer of Procter & Gamble India. 
“The fact is that flaunting wealth is distasteful and imprudent in our country. The last thing you want is the government to get involved in fixing salaries, but one should not forget that it is these examples of inequality that has partially contributed to leaders like Donald Trump getting elected in the US because it bothers a lot of people. The board of Tech Mahindra and Anand Mahindra (chairman of Tech Mahindra) should use self-restraint and make sure that there is no resentment among employees in Tech Mahindra,"" Das said.
Gurnani, 59, joined Tech Mahindra in 2004, and took over as chief executive officer in August 2012. 
Tech Mahindra, which was founded in 1986 and went public in 2006, allotted shares to Gurnani in 2006-07 and again in 2010-11."
171,2018-07-20,Wipro,"Wipro's first-quarter net profit rises 11% to $307.55 million from $277 million in the preceding three months

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd on Friday reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts expectations, as net profit rose 11% to $307.55 million from $277 million in the preceding three months, primarily on account of gains made from divestment of one of its businesses. 
Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd on Friday reported first-quarter earnings that beat analysts expectations, as net profit rose 11% to $307.55 million from $277 million in the preceding three months, primarily on account of gains made from divestment of one of its businesses.
India’s third biggest software services exporter guided for revenue to grow at best 2.3% in the current quarter, leading some analysts to believe that while Wipro’s sequential growth is improving, it is still far from turning the corner. 
Bengaluru-based Wipro’s dollar revenue declined 1.7% (improved 0.1% in constant currency terms) to $2.03 billion in the quarter ended 30 June from the preceding three months, after it had earlier outlined quarterly growth of at best 0.2% in constant currency terms. Wipro, which gives only quarterly growth outlook, expects to grow its revenue between 0.3% and 2.3% in constant currency terms in the July-September period from the preceding quarter.
A Bloomberg survey of 21 analysts had forecast Wipro to report revenue of $2.04 billion, or  ₹ 13,983.1 crore, in the quarter. The analysts estimated the company to report a net profit of $287.75 million, or  ₹ 1,968.5 crore, in the period. “I’m happy with our performance in this quarter,"" Wipro chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala told Mint. “Remember, we had said in the fourth quarter that our revenue could de-grow by 2% and would be at best flat. So based on the excellent execution by our team, we have managed to start on a fairly good note.""
Wipro’s revenue from clients in the banking and financial services industry, which accounts for 30% of its overall revenue, improved 3% sequentially in constant currency terms. US and Latin America, which bring about 55% of company’s business, grew 2.9%. 
Still, Wipro’s performance in the first quarter pales before that of its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which declared a strong first quarter earnings, reporting a 4.1% sequential constant currency growth at 25% operating margins. 
“Q1 beat and in-line Q2 guidance should assuage investor concerns. QoQ growth trajectory should improve for the rest of FY19, though YoY trends will remain subdued,"" Diviya Nagarajan, an analyst at UBS Securities, wrote in a note after the company declared its results. Wipro managed a 2.9% growth in constant-currency terms in 2017-18, while TCS reported a 6.7% growth and Infosys managed a 5.8% expansion in constant-currency terms—lower than industry association Nasscom’s 7.8% growth estimate for the country’s $167 billion information technology outsourcing industry in 2017-18. 
Infosys expects revenue to grow 6-8% in constant currency terms in this current financial year while at TCS, which does not give quarterly or yearly forecasts, the management has said it expects to clock double digit growth in the current financial year.
Wipro’s operating margin was 17.2% for the June quarter compared to 14.4% in the March quarter. This higher profitability was on account of gains made by Wipro selling its data centre business. Outside of this gain, the operating margin was 15.6%.
“I feel very good with the kind of progress we have made as I have repeatedly said in the past that we are making the company future-ready by investing in digital and making acquisitions. The only areas that are still an issue are the restructuring business in India and Middle East and our business of Health Plan Services,"" said Neemuchwala."

Bengaluru: India’s third-biggest software services exporter, Wipro Ltd, said on Friday it would buy US-based Alight Solutions’ India operations for $117 million in cash.
Wipro said it would buy Alight HR Services India Pvt Ltd, which is Alight Solutions’ captive operations in India.
The deal is expected to be completed in the quarter ending September. 
Wipro today reported a 2% rise in first-quarter net profit, beating estimates, helped by higher revenue from its Banking, Financial Services and Insurance business (BFSI)."
169,2018-07-23,Wipro,"Starting next year, Wipro is assured of at least $140 million in revenue, a shot in the arm for Abidali Neemuchwala, who since taking over as chief executive officer in February 2016 has been trying to put the Bengaluru-based company back on the growth path

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd has won a $1 billion contract, the biggest such order in four years, from Alight Solutions, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc, according to two people familiar with the development. 
Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd has won a $1 billion contract, the biggest such order in four years, from Alight Solutions, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc, according to two people familiar with the development.
As part of the deal, Wipro is expected to get at least $70 million in additional revenue in the current financial year. 
Starting next year, Wipro is assured of at least $140 million in revenue, a shot in the arm for Abidali Neemuchwala, who since taking over as chief executive officer in February 2016 has been trying to put the Bengaluru-based company back on the growth path.
For now, Wipro and Alight are in final stages of closing this partnership, and the duration of the contract could be extended beyond seven years, depending on the final negotiations currently underway between the two firms, an industry expert, one of the two people cited above, said on condition of anonymity. 
A seven-year partnership with $140 million in annual revenue will translate into $980 million over the duration of the contract, a shade less than the $1.1 billion order Wipro won from Canadian logistics firm ATCO in June 2014.
Wipro has not included the new business from this deal in its at-best 2.3% constant currency sequential growth forecast for the three months ending 30 September. 
“It is a very strategic deal... there are very few companies which offer this full suite of services, under which company’s IT infrastructure is offered, and offerings through BPS and application services is given. Cloud enablement, company’s consulting practice and deployment of Holmes platform will be also seen,"" said the second person, on condition of anonymity. 
Wipro declined to comment but according to the industry expert cited above, the company may disclose this contract in September. 
“We are still finalizing the strategic partnership with Alight and we have no further comments,"" said a spokesman for Wipro.
Typically, IT firms take 15-18 months to close outsourcing contracts valued at more than $1 billion, and work on this entire IT outsourcing deal was completed under Neemuchwala’s watch.
Since December last year, Wipro’s larger rival, and Neemuchwala’s former employer, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has won three such multi-year mega-deals, which together bring in over $5.6 billion in revenue. This has made the TCS management confident of clocking a double-digit growth in the current financial year.
“Assuming Wipro passes on productivity gains, the net annual revenue accretion would be in the ballpark of $140 million per annum. Wipro will pay $117 million for this deal. This deal is not part of the revenue growth guidance for the September 2018 quarter,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts Kawaljeet Saluja and Jaykumar Doshi wrote in a 20 July note.
Although Wipro does not give a full-year growth outlook, this mega order win assures it of a better performance than last year, when it added $355.7 million in incremental revenue to end with 4.6% dollar revenue growth.
Wipro’s deal win is also significant because most outsourcing deals are shrinking both in value and duration, as firms ranging from banks to retailers cut their budgets to maintain back-end technology and plough the savings into work that can help them improve business operations."

Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister H.D.Kumaraswamy on Tuesday met Azim Premji, chairman of Wipro Ltd, to propose a partnership to jointly combat issues like air pollution in Bengaluru and the state. 
The efforts to reach out to corporate leaders to collaborate on various developmental programmes aiming not just for increased Public Private Partnership (PPP) but also help Kumaraswamy led Janata Dal (Secular) shed its anti-urban image. 
“On this occasion he (Premji) also showed keen interest on partnering with the Government to implement programs on zero budget farming as they did in Andhra Pradesh,"" the chief minister’s office said in a statement.
Premji, who has invested billions of dollars of his personal wealth towards education and other philanthropic activities has partnered with the Education Department of the state including development initiatives on the process of development, the CMO said. 
Kumaraswamy has already met with other industry leaders including Infosys co-founder N.R.Narayana Murthy and Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar Shaw among others to collaborate on various projects across the state, attract fresh investments and draw up grand plans for Bengaluru, whose image has taken a beating in recent years over piling up of garbage, pothole laden roads, frothing lakes and crumbling infrastructure among other problems. 
The CMO also issued a statement on Tuesday that Taiwanese industrial house, M/s.Wistron Technologies, will be investing Rs.3000 crore in Narasapura industrial area of Kolar, about 70 kilometers from Bengaluru. 
Kumaraswamy has sought a proposal for grant of land and also suggested that the company set up a mobile repair and technology facility in the area as technicians in these field are in demand.
Kumaraswamy has been trying to attract fresh investments to the state as it would help achieve the ambitious target of providing 1 crore jobs over five years, as proposed by the common minimum programme (CMP) of the coalition government. 
The Congress-JD(S) combine has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the centre over its unfulfilled promise of providing 2 crore jobs per year after it came to power in 2014."

166,2018-07-27,Wipro,"Q1 results declared Friday showed HCL Technologies's revenue totalled $2.05 billion, more than Wipro's $2.03 billion

Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd surpassed Wipro Ltd to become India’s third biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion IT outsourcing industry in six years. 
Bengaluru: HCL Technologies Ltd surpassed Wipro Ltd to become India’s third biggest software services provider in the three months to 30 June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the country’s $167 billion IT outsourcing industry in six years.
On Friday, Noida-based HCL Technologies said its dollar revenue rose 0.8% to $2.05 billion in the quarter from the proceeding three months. Bengaluru-based Wipro’s dollar revenue declined 1.7% sequentially to $2.03 billion in the first quarter. 
Last year, Wipro’s full-year revenue totalled $8.06 billion, about $220 million more than HCL Technologies’ $7.84 billion. However, billionaire Shiv Nadar-led HCL Technologies expects its dollar revenue to grow by as much as 10.4% in the current fiscal year, implying that it expects to end FY19 with $8.65 billion in revenue."
165,2018-07-30,Wipro,"For the first time, business growth from managing technology infrastructure of customers was less than half of the overall revenue at both HCL Technologies and Wipro in the past two years

Bengaluru: The rise in cloud computing in the early years of this decade has started hurting the growth of some of the largest software services companies in India, as for the first time, business growth from managing technology infrastructure of customers was less than half of the overall revenue at both HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd in the past two years. 
Bengaluru: The rise in cloud computing in the early years of this decade has started hurting the growth of some of the largest software services companies in India, as for the first time, business growth from managing technology infrastructure of customers was less than half of the overall revenue at both HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd in the past two years.
This development portends an ominous sign for the country’s third and fourth largest software services companies and is in contrast to the performance of market leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), which maintains that it has not seen any cannibalization in revenue as more companies look to migrate workloads to the cloud.
India’s $167 billion software services outsourcing industry generates much of the revenue from deploying software engineers for infrastructure maintenance services, or IMS, or to write and maintain code for applications (application development and maintenance) or even offer customer support (BPO).
Since the turn of the century, the IMS business for most companies has grown on a par with or faster than the company’s overall growth in revenue.
Still, a bigger challenge for some companies such as HCL Technologies is that at least half of the total IMS revenue still comes from legacy work of establishing data centre business, even as most Fortune 1000 companies are looking to replace their own data centres with public cloud services.
HCL Technologies, India’s third-largest software services provider, saw its IMS business grow 10.5% between April-June 2016 and April-June 2018, less than half of the pace of its overall growth, according to an analysis by Mint.
Ditto for Wipro. The Bengaluru-based firm saw its IMS business grow 3%, against overall revenue growth of 6.4% in the same period.
“As most clients embrace cloud, we are seeing some softness in the infra business. About half of our total IMS business is data centre business,"" HCL president and chief executive C. Vijayakumar said in an interview last week.
Both TCS and Infosys, the No. 1 and No. 2 IT services firms, respectively, have stopped disclosing revenue from service offerings, but Mumbai-based TCS maintains that it has historically stayed away from setting up data centres and maintaining only infrastructure needs of its clients.
“If you are in the business of setting up data centres and leveraging your balance sheet, then yes, when customers move to cloud, you’ll be affected,"" TCS’s chief operating officer N. Ganapathy Subramaniam said earlier this month.
“As long as you are not in the capex-driven business of data centres, it is actually a huge uptick and not cannibalization,"" said Subramaniam. TCS, he said, has “generally stayed away from capital-intensive data centre business and our business through this is very, very small"". 
“We don’t go and leverage our balance sheet to set up huge data centres. So when you are moving applications into the cloud, that whole application transformation, migration, building applications around it, is an add-on business,"" said Subramaniam.
An analyst at a Mumbai-based brokerage said “cloud is clearly impacting overall growth and this can be seen from weak organic growth for these companies"".
“There is more pain for the companies as overall digital revenue is still less than a third, while the business from data centres remains vulnerable,"" said the analyst, who declined to be named.
The rise of Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing unit of Amazon.com Inc., and Microsoft Azure has led to most Fortune 1000 companies looking to move applications from servers stationed traditionally in their offices to a cloud computing platform. This has made most Indian firms stitch partnerships with these public cloud computing firms, but at the expense of letting go of money earned by offering thousands of engineers to work from a central facility that houses thousands of computers, which in turn was set up by software services companies.
Consequently, cloud computing firms are witnessing scorching growth: 12 years after it was founded in 2006, AWS is already bigger than India’s largest software services company, TCS, as AWS’s revenue totalled $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis)."

162,2018-08-31,Wipro,"Exit marks the second senior exec departure since Neemuchwala took over as CEO

New Delhi: Wipro Ltd’s healthcare and life sciences division head Jeffrey Heenan Jalil has resigned, the second senior executive to exit the Bengaluru-based information technology (IT) outsourcing company since Abidali Neemuchwala took over as chief executive officer (CEO) in February 2016. 
New Delhi: Wipro Ltd’s healthcare and life sciences division head Jeffrey Heenan Jalil has resigned, the second senior executive to exit the Bengaluru-based information technology (IT) outsourcing company since Abidali Neemuchwala took over as chief executive officer (CEO) in February 2016.
Wipro has appointed an interim head to oversee the $1.1 billion healthcare business division even as the firm looks for a successor to Jalil, according to an executive familiar with the development. 
Clients from the healthcare and life sciences business accounted for 14.1% or $1.13 billion of Wipro’s $8.06 billion revenue last year.
Jalil, a senior vice president who joined Wipro in May 2007, is believed to have put in his papers earlier this month, according to the executive mentioned above. 
A spokesperson for Wipro confirmed Jalil has left the company, but did not give a reason for his exit.
“Jeffrey Heenan Jalil, global head, health strategic business unit, has decided to pursue a career outside Wipro,"" the spokesperson told Mint. 
“Mohd Ehteshamul Haque, senior vice president and vertical head for healthcare & services has taken over as the interim head of the health strategic business unit,"" the spokesperson said.
Over the last few years, Wipro has managed to retain almost all of its senior management leaders after former Tata Consultancy Services Ltd veteran Neemuchwala succeeded former CEO T.K. Kurien. Until Jalil’s exit, Wipro had seen only its former chief business officer, Satishchandra Doreswamy, leave in March 2016. 
Still, despite a relatively smooth CEO transition, Wipro has struggled for growth, largely on account of under-performance by its large industry verticals, like its healthcare segment. 
Over the last three years, Wipro’s revenue growth has been lower than industry body Nasscom’s growth forecast for the industry. 
Noida-based HCL Technologies Ltd surpassed Wipro to become India’s third-biggest software services provider in the quarter ended June, marking the first change in the pecking order of the $167 billion Indian IT outsourcing industry in six years.
In 2016, Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services, a Florida, US-based technology firm, as the company expected to scale up revenue from its clients in healthcare. 
The acquisition of HealthPlan, which reported $223 million in revenue in 2015, was then estimated by analysts to bring over $60 million in quarterly revenue for the company.
However, revenue from Wipro’s healthcare unit had increased by just $51 million to $271.55 million at the end of June 2018 from $220.6 million in December 2015.
During this time, Wipro’s overall quarterly revenue improved 10.2% to $2.03 billion from $1.84 billion. 
For this reason, some analysts believe that CEO Neemuchwala is now looking at making changes in business segments which have lagged.
“Clearly, the weakness in the healthcare business unit is symptomatic of the company’s overall under-performance and I won’t be surprised to learn if Jeff resigned because he would have realised that Wipro was looking to replace him with someone else to lead the unit,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on condition of anonymity. 
“Finally, it’s the CEO who is held accountable for a company’s growth. So it is only expected that Neemuchwala, now in his third year as CEO, is finally cracking the whip and taking these decisions,"" he said"
161,2018-09-03,Wipro,"Under the $1.6 billion, 10-year outsourcing contract, Wipro will provide a comprehensive suite of solutions services to the US-based Alight Solutions

New Delhi: Wipro Ltd has won its largest information technology (IT) outsourcing contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc. Starting next year, Wipro is assured of at least $150 million in annual revenue, a shot in the arm for Abidali Neemuchwala, who since taking over as chief executive officer in February 2016 has been trying to put Wipro back on the growth path. 
New Delhi: Wipro Ltd has won its largest information technology (IT) outsourcing contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc. Starting next year, Wipro is assured of at least $150 million in annual revenue, a shot in the arm for Abidali Neemuchwala, who since taking over as chief executive officer in February 2016 has been trying to put Wipro back on the growth path.
Mint first reported about the mega deal (more than $1 billion) win by Wipro in its edition dated 23 July, when the two companies were in final stages of closing the deal.
“For now, Wipro and Alight are in final stages of closing this partnership, and the duration of the contract could be extended beyond seven years, depending on the final negotiations currently underway between the two firms,"" the Mint report said.
A 10-year partnership with $150-$160 million in annual revenue will translate into $1.5-1.6 billion over the duration of the contract, more than the $1.1 billion order Wipro won from Canadian logistics firm ATCO in June 2014.
“We are delighted to be chosen by Alight as their long-term strategic partner in their enterprise transformation journey to bring digital experiences and offerings to employees and employers globally,"" said Neemuchwala. “This is a testimony to the capabilities we have built through our strategic investments in Wipro Digital, cloud platforms and cognitive platform Wipro Holmes.""
Wipro’s deal win is also significant because most outsourcing deals are shrinking both in value and duration, as firms ranging from banks to retailers cut their budgets to maintain back-end technology and plough the savings into work that can help them improve business operations.
“It is a very strategic deal...there are very few companies which offer this full suite of services, under which company’s IT infrastructure is offered, and offerings through BPS and application services is given. Cloud enablement, company’s consulting practice and deployment of Holmes platform will be also seen,"" a Wipro executive, on condition of anonymity, told Mint earlier.
Typically, IT firms take 15-18 months to close outsourcing contracts valued at more than $1 billion, and work on this entire IT outsourcing deal was completed under Neemuchwala’s watch.
Since December last year, Wipro’s larger rival, and Neemuchwala’s former employer, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) has won three such multi-year mega-deals, which together bring in over $5.6 billion in revenue. This has made the TCS management confident of achieving double-digit growth in the current financial year.
Wipro has not included the new business from this deal in its at-best 2.3% constant currency sequential growth forecast for the three months ending 30 September.
“This deal is not part of the revenue growth guidance for the September 2018 quarter,"" Kotak Institutional Equities analysts Kawaljeet Saluja and Jaykumar Doshi wrote in a 20 July note.
“This large IT deal win suggests that Wipro will surely grow faster than in the past two years, and this is heartening as this means that many of the measures taken by CEO to bring back the company to industry-matching growth have started paying,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. “However, Wipro needs to win more such large deals before any convincing call on if the company has turned the corner can be taken.""
Although Wipro does not give a full-year growth outlook, this mega order win assures it of a better performance than last year, when it added $355.7 million in incremental revenue to end with 4.6% dollar revenue growth. Wipro ended with $8.06 billion in revenue last year."

New Delhi: An innocuous statement in a press release by Wipro Ltd sheds some light on how the Bengaluru-based company managed to win its largest information technology (IT) outsourcing contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years, from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc. “FCM Consulting facilitated the transaction between the two organizations,"" reads the last line of the press release dated 20 July, shared after Wipro and Alight announced a long-term “strategic partnership"". 
New Delhi: An innocuous statement in a press release by Wipro Ltd sheds some light on how the Bengaluru-based company managed to win its largest information technology (IT) outsourcing contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years, from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc. “FCM Consulting facilitated the transaction between the two organizations,"" reads the last line of the press release dated 20 July, shared after Wipro and Alight announced a long-term “strategic partnership"".
FCM Consulting is a privately held firm, which Mitchell Habib founded in 2014, after spending 25 years at General Electric Co., Citigroup Inc. and Nielsen Holdings Plc. FCM, like other advisory or sourcing firms like ISG or HfS Research, helps Fortune 500 companies select the right IT vendor to offer solutions to help companies run their business better.
Significantly, it underscores how relationships, like in any facet of life, work in IT outsourcing industry as Wipro’s chief executive officer (CEO) Abidali Neemuchwala found a friend in an executive, with whom his friendship has only strengthened over the last decade.
During the last decade, while Habib was in charge of selecting the IT vendor, each of the three companies awarded mega (more than $1 billion in value) outsourcing IT work to Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
Understandably, Habib, who rarely engages with the media, said in an interview last year that he has done more business with Natarajan Chandrasekaran when he was CEO of TCS.
“Chandra and I have done more than $4 billion in business in over a decade we have known (each other),"" Habib said January last year, a few days after Chandrasekaran was named chairman of Tata Sons Ltd.
Neemuchwala and Habib’s friendship started when TCS in 2008 won a $2.5 billion over nine-and-a-half years from Citigroup. Then, Habib was chief information officer of Citigroup’s North American Consumer business while Neemuchwala was the head of back office services (BPS) business of TCS.
An email sent to Habib and Wipro seeking comment went unanswered.
“Both Abid and Mitch share an excellent rapport,"" said an executive from Wipro, on condition of anonymity. “Advisory firms like FCM, based on solution offering of a company, help bring clarity when a client is evaluating more than one vendor.""
Neemuchwala steered the team at TCS’s BPS division for seven years before he quit the Mumbai-based firm to take up the role of chief operating officer at Wipro in 2015.
At Wipro, the entire work, right from assembling the team before a formal request for proposal was submitted and then following up with executives at Alight was led by Neemuchwala, according to two company executives.
To be sure, Wipro’s own solution offerings and its acquisition of cloud services firm Appirio Inc. helped the company as much. Industry executives claim that Appirio has one of the strongest Salesforce practice, which only helped Wipro edge past rivals as the work at Alight required a better software to manage customer data (CRM or customer-relationship management software).
“A company wants to be sure that there will not be any issues in work when it is awarding a mega deal of this size. So, when someone has worked with a leader, who is now the CEO of a company for long, there is confidence in the company and it helps,"" said the second executive of Wipro.
“It’s a great time to be an analyst or consultant,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research company. “Deals are becoming more complex. There is a lot more trust, business strategy and change management being included in these relationships now than ever before,"" said Fersht.

New Delhi: The top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous fiscal, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record the fastest growth in three years. The turnaround in the pace of hiring at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions, the slowest pace since the offshore outsourcing boom started at the turn of the century. 
New Delhi: The top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this fiscal, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous fiscal, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record the fastest growth in three years. The turnaround in the pace of hiring at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd in the June quarter follows a year of tepid employee additions, the slowest pace since the offshore outsourcing boom started at the turn of the century.
Analysts attribute the reversal of fortunes for the sector to three reasons. First, companies are looking to spend more on outsourcing technology work. Second, Fortune 1000 companies are using data analytics platforms offered by information technology (IT) vendors to run their business better. This, in turn, is translating into more work for the outsourcing companies, for now. And third, companies are increasing their spending on digital technologies. The increased spending has led to more contracts valued at over $1 billion.
For instance, Mumbai-based TCS has won three mega deals since December, bringing in a combined $5.6 billion in revenue. Last week, Bengaluru-based Wipro won its largest contract valued at $1.6 billion.
“The early legs of any transformation are always challenging, and this we have seen in the last two years when all companies struggled for growth,"" an executive at Cognizant said on condition of anonymity. “For all the five companies, digital is now a fourth of total revenue. So, without getting into the debate of digital definition, the heartening thing is that quality of revenue is only improving.""
Although all IT firms are moving away from a people-led model to a platform-based business approach, hiring by the largest IT firms continues to be a dominant indicator of their prospects. The five firms together employed 1.17 million at the end of the June quarter.
“Growth is back,"" a senior executive at TCS said on condition of anonymity. “Companies were always spending more on digital in the past. But now, what we are seeing is that if the traditional business can be done efficiently and if you have solution offerings like data analytics and AI (artificial intelligence) platforms, you will be able to differentiate from others.""
“To us (TCS), the question of digital offsetting the loss in traditional is not relevant because there is enough and more work available and hiring is just one indicator,"" said the executive cited above.
The June quarter net additions of the five firms is the highest in at least two years. They added 26,565 people to their workforce in the three months ended 30 June 2016. 
Although TCS does not provide a growth outlook, it is expected to cross 10% growth this fiscal. It managed an 8.6% dollar revenue growth to end last year with $19.09 billion in revenue. Ditto for Wipro, which ended last year with $8.06 billion in revenue. It expects to get at least $80 million or 1% growth this fiscal from the $1.6 billion contract.
“I’m not sure with this ‘little upswing’ we are seeing but the mood is definitely more bullish over the last couple of months,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing research firm. His caution finds support from some industry executives.
“The biggest downside risk to this growth story is the uncertainty in the many of the first-of-its kind of projects,"" said the Cognizant executive cited before. “The work in areas like IP (intellectual property) platforms runs the risk of IP infringement cases. You are offering data analytics solutions when debate on data privacy is gaining traction. The promised benefits from automation will be tested. So, any incidental issue and this can blow up, making many clients hold back on spending in these areas."""
157,2018-09-14,Wipro,"Among IT stocks, TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Tech Mahindra are up 20-53%, while Wipro is up 3%

Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday. 
Technology stocks have raced ahead of benchmark indices in 2018 after lagging them last year, as the Indian rupee weakens and the economic engines in the West roar back to life. An economic boom in developed nations implies greater outsourcing business for India’s information technology (IT) companies. Also, since these companies earn mostly in dollars, a weak rupee means greater revenues. The US economy grew 4.2% in the second quarter, while jobless claims hit a 49-year-low last week. Meanwhile, the rupee has slipped 11.51% against the dollar in 2018, touching a record low of 72.92 on Wednesday.
In the year so far, the BSE IT index has gained nearly 40%, outpacing gains in the benchmark Sensex index which has gained around 10%. In 2017, even as the Sensex rose 27.91%, the BSE IT index gained only 10.83%, as revenues grew slower at large IT services companies. This is the best performance of the BSE IT index in the last five years. In 2016, it had slipped 8%, gained 4.26% in 2015, was up 17.6% in 2014 and jumped 55.24% in 2013.
According to Arun Thukral, MD & CEO of Axis Securities, the improving US economy has changed sentiments toward IT sector, which draws a large chunk of its business from the US. “Better profitability of US companies (a part of which could come from tax cuts) would mean better business prospects for Indian IT services. Similarly, Europe is also limping back to stability following the economic revival of the financial crisis-hit peripheral economies. This improvement in the business prospects of Indian IT companies has led to the re-rating of the IT sector in general,"" he added.
Among IT stocks, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd are up 20-53% while Wipro Ltd is up 3%. 
Thukral believes Indian IT firms have witnessed a revival of growth on the back of increased technology investments from clients in the US and Europe. “But these investments are in newer areas such as digital and cloud at the cost of traditional outsourcing, where budgets are shrinking. Hence, we like Indian IT companies who are increasing their revenue share from digital and cloud business,"" he added.
According to a Kotak Institutional Equities note dated 10 September, a 1% rupee depreciation aids earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin of IT firms by 20-30 basis points (bps) and net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 2-3%. It has upgraded FY2019-21 earnings per share (EPS) by 0-7% but slashed its US dollar revenue growth assumptions due to cross-currency headwinds, stating FY2019 EPS will be influenced by hedges, and all companies will receive an earnings boost in the subsequent year. 
According to Kotak, even though the rupee has weakened, its impact on immediate earnings will be decided by hedging. Kotak said Infosys has minuscule cash flow hedges of $300 million; TCS hedges but through options, meaning it will realize the benefit of rupee depreciation unless the company has entered into range barrier options with the rupee depreciating beyond the range; Mindtree hedges only the monetary assets and does not have any cash flow hedges; and Tech Mahindra has hedged 70-90% of net cash inflow over the next 12-months. Wipro, HCL Technologies, Mphasis and Hexaware, it said, have hedged aggressively. “Infosys, TCS and Mindtree do not have meaningful cash flow hedges and will benefit immediately from Indian rupee depreciation,"" the Kotak note said. 
According to a Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd report, a weak rupee boosts net profits and operating margins of the entire IT sector; however, the impact on individual company earnings will be determined by three aspects -- the share of dollar revenue among all currencies; the extent of onsite-offshore revenue mix that will determine the net exposure after natural hedge; and the hedging policy in terms of duration and proportion of the net exposures hedged.
However, it added that had the rupee weakened similarly against all currencies, the impact would have been felt on the majority of the revenues. In the calendar year so far, the rupee has fallen 11.51% against the dollar, 8.03% against the pound and only 8.27% against the euro. 
“Bottoming cyclical pressures and improved capital allocation are factors that will feed into the valuation multiples favourably. Currency keeps earnings growth ticking further,"" Motilal said in its note on 10 September. 
However, Nomura said Indian Tier 1 IT valuations are at a 20% premium to that of multinational corporations (MNCs) and 15-25% discount to Tier 2 IT and challengers. “Indian Tier-1 IT, after progressively showing lower market share gains over the past three years, has lost market share to MNCs. Also, FY19 guidance suggests a weaker year, with Cognizant and HCL Tech guiding for slower organic growth in FY19 versus FY18, Infosys likely to grow near the lower end of guidance (similar to FY18) and Wipro expected to grow low-single digits for FY19, on our estimates. The only exception is TCS, where we expect growth to accelerate in FY19,"" it said in a note on 6 September."

New Delhi: Ankur Prakash, Wipro Ltd’s vice-president, manufacturing strategic business unit and Latin America, has resigned, marking the second senior management exit in as many months at the information technology (IT) company. Wipro’s healthcare and life sciences head Jeffrey Heenan Jalil put in his papers last month. 
New Delhi: Ankur Prakash, Wipro Ltd’s vice-president, manufacturing strategic business unit and Latin America, has resigned, marking the second senior management exit in as many months at the information technology (IT) company. Wipro’s healthcare and life sciences head Jeffrey Heenan Jalil put in his papers last month.
Wipro has entrusted Anand Padmanabhan, president and global head of strategic sales and geographies, with additional responsibility of overseeing the Latin American business. Communications head and president Milan Rao has been asked to oversee manufacturing.
Prakash, who was vice-president and chief operating officer for Latin America at Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, was one of eight executives from Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, or TCS, to join Wipro after Abidali Neemuchwala took over as Wipro’s chief operating officer in April 2015. Subsequently, in February 2016, Neemuchwala was elevated as chief executive officer and executive director. 
Wipro’s manufacturing division—which clubs together the services offered to clients in the manufacturing space—posted revenues of $701 million, or 8.7% of its total income of $8.06 billion, in 2017-18.
Under Neemuchwala’s watch, Wipro’s senior leadership team had not witnessed any major change in management, barring the exit of Satishchandra Doreswamy, then chief business officer, in March 2016. 
Wipro recently appointed Harmeet Chauhan as the head of its industry and engineering services (IES) division. In April, the company set up IES, which comprises the $564 million product engineering services business, IoT practice and industry 4.0 vertical. 
A Wipro spokesperson confirmed the developments. “Ankur Prakash has resigned from the company after deciding to take a career break."" 
“Harmeet Chauhan has joined as senior vice-president and global head of IES. He comes with over 20 years of experience across products and engineering services, and, until recently, was a member of Aricent’s executive team as president , software and internet. He will report to Abidali Z. Neemuchwala,"" the spokesperson added."

New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd. 
New Delhi: Accenture Plc reported 13.5% growth and added $4.72 billion in incremental revenue in the financial year ended August 2018, a shade lower than the combined $4.78 billion new revenue of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp, Infosys Ltd, Wipro Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd.
Accenture’s scorching growth pace was underpinned by the firm’s aggressive acquisition strategy and the firm generating more business from technology areas that are seeing faster growth: digital, the fuzzy umbrella term which each company uses to classify revenue generated from areas generally classified as social, mobile, analytics, cloud computing and Internet of Things.
Accenture claims that its new business, which comprises digital, cloud computing and cyber security, totalled $23 billion, or about 60% of its full-year revenue. Along with its strong consulting practice, Accenture managed to end the year with $39.57 billion in revenue.
Homegrown IT firms, for now, say that digital accounts for between 22% and 25% of their business.
Last year, Accenture spent $660 million in buying companies, less than the $1.8 billion it spent to buy companies in 2016-17. However, Accenture has again upped its acquisition spend in 2018-19.
“This year, we would expect to spend up to $1.5 billion, consistent with our capital allocation strategy. As always, given the right opportunities and the right circumstances, we could certainly spend more than that,"" Accenture’s Chief Financial Officer David Rowland told analysts after the company declared its earnings.
Accenture added 34,309 employees last year to take its total workforce to 459,178 people. Cognizant and the four big Indian IT firms added only 13,772 employees in 2017-18.
“We believe Accenture’s execution is best in class among IT service providers in our coverage. We think digital will continue to help drive strong revenue growth with slow and steady margin expansion over time,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 27 September.
Accenture firm follows a September-August financial year. Indian IT firms follow an April-March financial year while Nasdaq-listed Cognizant follows a January-December financial year.
Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies, considerably more than the $1.58 billion spent by TCS, Infosys and Wipro put together, since 1 April 2014.
Only twice earlier have two companies added more than $2 billion in new business in a year, according to a Mint analysis. In 2015, Cognizant had added $2.15 billion in incremental revenue, while Mumbai-based TCS added $2 billion in new business in the year ended March 2015.
In July, Mint reported that Accenture was on its way to script history by adding incremental revenue that would be about the new revenue generated by the five firms together. Save for Noida-based HCL Technologies, all IT companies reported single-digit growth in the year ended March 2018.
Still, homegrown IT firms expect better growth in the current financial year. TCS does not issue annual or quarterly guidance, but the management expects to report double-digit growth in the current financial year. Hiring for all the firms has also seen encouraging signs, as the top five software services providers operating in India added 24,047 people in the first quarter of this financial year, compared with the 13,772 net additions in the previous year, leading many experts to believe that the industry is set to record its fastest growth in three years."

 New Delhi: Wipro Ltd on Wednesday posted second-quarter revenue growth that beat analyst estimates even as the company’s divestment of some businesses in the past to make itself future-ready has taken some sheen off the financial performance in the first half of this financial year.  
 New Delhi: Wipro Ltd on Wednesday posted second-quarter revenue growth that beat analyst estimates even as the company’s divestment of some businesses in the past to make itself future-ready has taken some sheen off the financial performance in the first half of this financial year. 
Bengaluru-based Wipro’s dollar revenue improved 0.72% sequentially to $2.04 billion in the quarter ended 30 September. Revenue grew 1.37% on a year-over-year basis. In constant currency terms, revenue rose 1.6% on a sequential basis. Since the earlier quarters had business from data centre operations, which Wipro did not have in the July-September quarter, its sequential growth in revenue both in constant and in dollar terms was higher at 2.8% and 1.9% respectively. Wipro has outlined an at-best 1.3% growth in constant currency terms in the October-December period from the preceding quarter. The lower growth is primarily because the company has decided to carve out some business from its India geography. 
Adjusting for this business, the company’s growth outlook is at-best 3% this quarter. 
A Bloomberg survey of 25 analysts had forecast Wipro to post revenue of $1.96 billion, or  ₹ 14,483.5 crore, in the September quarter. They estimated the company to post a profit of $288.91 million, or  ₹ 2,130.1 crore, in the period. Wipro posted a net profit of  ₹ 1,889 crore during the quarter, missing estimates.
“I’m very happy with our performance in this quarter,"" Wipro chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala told Mint. “Four of our SBUs (strategic business units) reported a more than 4% growth (in constant currency terms). So, overall, we are focused on execution to do better in the second half of the year"".
Wipro’s revenue from clients in the banking and financial services industry, which comprises 30.7% of its overall revenue, improved 4.4% sequentially in constant currency terms. 
US and Latin America, which bring about 55% of business, grew 3.7%.
Still, Wipro’s performance in the second quarter pales in comparison to its larger rival Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, both of which reported a 3.2% sequential dollar revenue growth. India’s third largest IT services firm, HCL Technologies Ltd, reported a 2.1% dollar revenue growth on Tuesday.
Infosys expects revenue to grow 6-8% in constant currency terms this financial year. At TCS, which does not give quarterly or yearly forecasts, the management has said it expects to clock double-digit growth in this financial year. 
HCL Technologies too expects to clock in at-least a 10.5% revenue growth this year. Wipro’s revenue growth, for now, appears will not be significantly higher than last year’s 2.9% rise.“It has been a good quarter from Wipro. The company has been divesting and restructuring its business, and so it is eating into the revenue for the year. But like the management has said, the company is on a transformational journey and this will help them in long-term,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, on the condition of anonymity. 
“The company needs to deliver at least three consecutive quarters of good growth before a firm call on turning the corner can be taken"".
Wipro’s operating margin was 14.6% in the September quarter but this was due to a one-time payment to a customer. Excluding the payment, operating margin was 18.1% last quarter.
“I feel very good with the kind of progress we have made as I have repeatedly said in the past that we are making the company future-ready by divesting businesses like data centre, investing in digital and making acquisitions. The only area where we have an issue is our healthcare business but we have put in a team to lead the business and we remain confident that we are progressing well,"" said Neemuchwala.
Wipro shares were unchanged at  ₹ 309.15 on the BSE at the close of trading on a day when the benchmark Sensex gained 0.55% to end at 34,033.96 The results were issued after market hours."

Notwithstanding a subdued financial performance, Wipro shares gained 9% after the first quarter results were announced in July. The Sensex and the BSE IT index during the time were down 5-7%. The gains, which came after a period of underperformance, were driven by positive management commentary and a large order win. The September quarter (Q2) results should reaffirm the investor’s faith. 
Notwithstanding a subdued financial performance, Wipro shares gained 9% after the first quarter results were announced in July. The Sensex and the BSE IT index during the time were down 5-7%. The gains, which came after a period of underperformance, were driven by positive management commentary and a large order win. The September quarter (Q2) results should reaffirm the investor’s faith.
Even excluding the large order, Q2 has seen one of the highest order bookings in recent times. The management claims a robust order pipeline. Constant currency revenues are up 5.1% from a year ago, significantly higher than the growth rates it reported in recent quarters (see chart). On a sequential basis, revenues were up 2.8%, higher than Street estimates and the company’s guidance.
Better execution and revenue accretion from a large deal win helped the company. Reported margins were hit by a loss emanating from a settlement with one of its customers, but net utilization levels perked up to 85.5% yielding higher efficiencies.
In the business segments, revenue growth rates in banking, financial services and insurance, which generates over a quarter of Wipro’s revenues, improved to 16% from 14.4% in Q1. Revenue deceleration at the troubled healthcare, manufacturing and utilities segments eased.
The performance should aid the stock, which is trading at a considerable discount to its larger peers TCS Ltd and Infosys Ltd. But much depends on how the company navigates near-term headwinds. The revenue guidance for the quarter ending 31 December translates to a sequential growth of 1-3%. Business in technology is expected to be weighed down by furloughs. Momentum in healthcare, too, depends on enrolments in US healthcare policies. 
But the near-term pain should not blind investors to medium-term prospects, argue analysts at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. They expect the strong deal pipeline to help Wipro match or exceed average peer growth rate next year. “Our recent interaction with Wipro chief operating officer and industry sources suggest a strong pipeline for Wipro, and we expect this to lead to growth as good or better than peers in FY20,"" it said in a note."

New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd. 
New Delhi: The planned rollout of 5G or fifth-generation wireless technology by telecom companies globally offers at least $10 billion business over the next six years for India’s information technology (IT) services companies, according to a Mumbai-based brokerage firm. This new technology spend by telecom firms on software and services could bring over $1.1 billion in incremental revenue over the next three years for country’s five largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Tech Mahindra Ltd.
This development is significant as telecom firms over the last two years had held back their spend on technology, leading to tepid growth at telecom verticals for all IT firms. A new gusher of money should further boost growth for the five largest IT firms, which share among themselves about 30% of homegrown IT companies’ business from telecom companies. 
“The impending rollout of 5G networks by telecom service providers (TSPs) globally could translate to a USD 10bn incremental market opportunity – implying a 1 ppt addition to the overall industry CAGR – over 2019-25 for the Indian IT companies, on our conservative estimates,"" Pankaj Kapoor, director of India IT services and software equity research at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd, wrote in a note dated 29 October.
Homegrown IT firms got $5.4 in business during 2014-16 when telecom companies set up the 4G infrastructure and Kapoor of JM Financial estimates a higher spend of over $10 billion, although over a much longer period of six years.
The world’s largest telecom firms are looking to give a face-lift to the current 4G infrastructure as newer technologies allow them to send billions of bits of data a second, higher than the current hundreds of millions of bits of data. This, in addition to letting a consumer download a movie in seconds, also allows autonomous cars and industrial equipment to work better as they need this network of ultra-fast speeds for relaying data sets.
For now, executives at some of the largest IT firms remain optimistic on the new technology spend and maintain that much of the incremental revenue will come in from the second half of the next financial year. 
A big reason behind the optimism of Indian IT companies from this rollout of 5G infrastructure by telecom firms are some of the recent mega-IT contracts awarded to set up hardware. In July, US-based T-Mobile awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Nokia to supply 5G network gear. This was followed by T-Mobile awarding another $3.5 billion contract to Ericsson in September, under which Ericsson will offer both hardware and software to the US telecom major.
“All telecom firms first set up the hardware and software and then work for the services needed to run them. Now the contracts may not be this large but then with newer technologies needed for 5G, many of us (Indian IT firms) have the chance to offer IoT (Internet of Things) platforms, data analytics solutions and other work as part of managing the network,"" said an executive at Mumbai-based TCS. The executive did not want to be named as he is not authorized to talk to the media. 
“Recent commentaries by major operators indicate selective commercial launches could start as early as 2019, though a wider global coverage is likely to be spread over 2020-22… The biggest commercial use-case of 5G is likely to be around narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) that could open an additional market for Indian ER&D/IT services players. While the timing of project flows is difficult to predict, conservatively, we see a meaningful financial impact of 5G on Indian IT companies only from 2HFY20,"" wrote Kapoor in the note."

Stith, who headed IBM’s healthcare and life sciences business in the US, is the third top external hire by chief executive officer Abidali Neemuchwala. His hiring is also Wipro’s third top-level management change in 2018.
Since taking over as CEO in 2016, Neemuchwala has hired Christophe Martinoli as the head of Continental Europe and Harmeet Chauhan as head of Industrial and Engineering Services business division.
Clients from the healthcare and life sciences business accounted for 14.1% or $1.13 billion of Wipro’s $8.06 billion revenue last year.
A spokesperson for Wipro confirmed the development.
“Wipro Ltd can confirm the appointment of Bill Stith as Senior Vice President and Global Head of Health strategic business unit,"" the spokesperson said.
Wipro’s former head of healthcare and life sciences division, Jeffrey Heenan Jalil resigned in August, prompting the company to appoint an interim head, Mohd Ehteshamul Haque.
One of the reasons behind Wipro’s under-performance over the last few years has been the company’s inability to get more business from clients in the healthcare space.
Wipro spent $460 million to buy HealthPlan Services (HPS) in February 2016, hoping it will help scale up revenue after former US President Barack Obama introduced a policy to provide affordable healthcare to uninsured Americans under Affordable Care Act law, or Obamacare.
However, Obamacare was repealed by US President Donald Trump, dashing expectations of any incremental revenue growth for companies like Wipro.
Wipro expected that its acquisition of HealthPlan Services, which reported $223 million in revenue in 2015, will shore up business from its healthcare division.
However, revenue from Wipro’s healthcare unit increased by only $40.6 million to $261.2 million at the end of September 2018 from $220.6 million in December 2015.
During this time, Wipro’s overall quarterly revenue improved 10.9% to $2.04 billion from $1.84 billion.
“Our healthcare business division has a large component of the HealthPlan Services acquisition which focused on Affordable Care Act (ACA). Now, that got repealed. Because of this, we had an over $130 million of annual run rate decline. We are making investments in other areas in our healthcare business and are also in the process of appointing new leaders to turn around this business and we remain hopeful in the coming quarters, this (healthcare vertical) will start to report good growth,"" Neemuchwala said in an interview last month. 
Wipro also appointed Sanjeev Singh as head of its state-run enterprises India business. Singh was formerly the CEO of Aegis for India and Sri Lanka."

Managers of BSE’s Sensex are reversing a portfolio decision they made 15 years ago. Back in November 2003, HCL Technologies Ltd was excluded from the index and replaced by Wipro Ltd. The positions are now being swapped, with Wipro getting the boot, and HCL Tech being welcomed into the index of 30 large-cap stocks. 
Managers of BSE’s Sensex are reversing a portfolio decision they made 15 years ago. Back in November 2003, HCL Technologies Ltd was excluded from the index and replaced by Wipro Ltd. The positions are now being swapped, with Wipro getting the boot, and HCL Tech being welcomed into the index of 30 large-cap stocks.
How has the long Wipro short HCL Tech position done in the past 15 years? Terribly, considering that HCL Tech shares have rallied by 17 times during this period, while those of Wipro have risen only four times. Even without considering a short position on HCL Tech, a decision to buy Wipro would have resulted in huge losses on a relative basis.
This column has pointed out earlier that stocks that are discarded from Sensex and Nifty deliver far greater returns compared to those that are added to the index. That’s because managers of these indices follow a so-called momentum style of investing, where stocks that have done well in the recent past are included in the index, while laggards are dropped. As a result, the additions are coming in at relatively higher valuations, while the discards may well be good value picks.
Undoubtedly, this contrarian investment strategy would have resulted in huge gains, in the case of a long HCL Tech short Wipro position 15 years ago. By that logic, does it make sense to now buy Wipro and sell HCL Tech? Hardly anyone is betting on that—Wipro continues to struggle for growth, and brokerage firms such as Kotak and Nomura continue to prefer HCL Tech over Wipro even now. But given how the above-mentioned contrarian indicator has done in the past, who knows what lies ahead in the next 15 years."

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has shortlisted six major IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Wipro Ltd and IBM India, to set up a wide-based digital Public Credit Registry for capturing details of all borrowers and wilful defaulters.
The proposed Public Credit Registry will also include data from entities like capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the corporate affairs ministry, Goods and Service Tax Network (GSTN) and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) to enable banks and financial institutions to get a 360-degree profile of the existing as well as prospective borrowers on a real-time basis.
“Consequent to the publication of expression of interest (EOI) on October 27, 2018, the Reserve Bank had received responses from several vendors for implementation of end-end solution for Public Credit Registry,"" the central bank has said. After evaluating the responses of the interested vendors, the RBI said it has been decided to shortlist the six firms.
The other three shortlisted vendors are: Capgemini Technology Services India, Dun & Bradstreet Information Services India, and Mindtree Ltd.
The RBI would soon seek request for proposal from the six vendors.
In June this year, RBI had announced to set up a Public Credit Registry for India to address information asymmetry, foster access to credit and strengthen the credit culture in the economy.
Earlier, a high-level task force was constituted by RBI to review the current availability of information on credit, the adequacy of the existing information utilities, and to identify gaps that could be filled by a PCR.
“In essence, Public Credit Registry will be a digital registry of authenticated granular credit information and will work as a financial information infrastructure providing access to various stakeholders and enrich the existing credit information ecosystem,"" according to the EOI document issued in October.
The Public Credit Registry would be the single point of mandatory reporting for all material events for each loan, notwithstanding any threshold in the loan amount or type of borrower.
Currently, there are multiple granular credit information repositories in India, with each having somewhat distinct objectives and coverage.
Within the RBI, CRILC is a borrower-level supervisory dataset that keeps record of loans of  ₹ 5 crore and above.
Also, there are four privately owned credit information companies (CICs) operating in India. RBI has mandated all its regulated entities to submit credit information individually to all four CICs.
According to the EOI, the proposed solution should allow easy integration with ancillary information sources, such as the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Sebi, GSTN, CERSAI, utility billers, Central Fraud Registry and Wilful Defaulter/Caution/Suit Filed Lists.
Besides, borrowers would also be able to access their own credit information and seek corrections to the credit information reported on them.
Setting up of the Public Credit Registry assumes significance amid rising bad loans in the financial system. The non-performing assets in the banking system stand at about  ₹ 10 trillion."
145,2019-01-02,Wipro,"Tech firms, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro, generated more revenue than ever before from standalone outsourcing deals signed in 2018

New Delhi: The twin trends of outsourcing larger technology contracts and Fortune 1000 companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors have led analysts and information technology executives to suggest that the sector could grow faster in the year starting 1 April. 
New Delhi: The twin trends of outsourcing larger technology contracts and Fortune 1000 companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors have led analysts and information technology executives to suggest that the sector could grow faster in the year starting 1 April.
These trends are the third positive development for India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector, after the first six months of the current fiscal saw IT firms adding more employees and raising salaries of some of them by as much as 40%.
“Digital spend is industrializing a little bit, moving from pilots and PoC (proof of concepts) to big spends. That should look well overall for the industry, so I am quite optimistic,"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interaction with Mint last month. “The other interesting and exciting thing is, again at broad basis, the return of larger deals.""
The ability of IT companies to offer solutions through mobility and data crunching platforms that allows their clients, from Citigroup Inc. to Walmart Inc., to do their business more efficiently saw the technology vendors generating more revenue from stand-alone deals signed in 2018 than ever before.
This development is one reason for improved growth at some of the largest companies, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS).
The largest IT services companies, including TCS, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, shared this optimism when they briefed analysts at an event organized by outsourcing research firm HFS Research in New York on 12 and 13 December.
“[M]anagement shared that 50% of the value of new deals are coming from 25% of the new signings, which implies that contracts are longer in duration with increasing complexity,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a 17 December note.
Bachman made the observation after speaking with the management of Genpact, the New York-based business process and technology management firm, at the HFS event.
For close to a decade, outsourcing deals shrank as tech work became commoditized. An added challenge for IT firms was the rise of in-sourcing, which saw several large clients setting up their own technology units or captives to do the tech work.
However, 2018 saw this change, according to three executives from TCS, Cognizant and Wipro.
“Several service providers discussed clients that have taken work in-house out of frustration with service providers, but have experienced difficulty in implementing new technologies without external help. As a result, clients are returning to service providers with more realistic expectations,"" Bachman wrote in the note.
“I do not see a huge rush to captives—the big issue is talent shortages in higher value areas, such as digital, AI (artificial intelligence), analytics, machine learning, etc. No one wants to hire those internally—the talent is too expensive and hard to retain,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive officer of HFS Research. “Hence, we are witnessing a resurgence in services based on higher-value services and deeper, more consultative partnering.""
“In a nutshell what we are witnessing is the shift from ‘outsourcing’ to ‘real value partnering’ and the winning providers are those who can convert to the latter with smart talent and operating model investments,"" said Fersht.
TCS, Infosys and Wipro declined to comment as all three are in a quiet period ahead of declaring their December quarter results.
Since December last year, Mumbai-based TCS and Bengaluru-based Wipro have won four multi-year mega deals, which will together generate over $7.2 billion in revenue.
“A lot of deals, beyond the four mega deals, have seen integrated traditional offerings like infrastructure maintenance and BPO, along with deployment of data analytics platforms and some level of automation. This means that a resulting contract is of larger value than a pure-play traditional work,"" an executive at TCS said on the condition of anonymity."
144,2019-01-04,Wipro,"Digital accounts for less than a third of overall revenue of Indian IT companies, including TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Any slowdown in the US economy will hurt their growth

New Delhi: Concerns about a slowdown in US economy poses the biggest risk to India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry as experts fear Fortune 1000 companies may cut spending on technology, hurting Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. Demand for digital services, which includes data crunching and artificial intelligence (AI) powered platforms, is still linked to the overall health of an economy, they say. 
New Delhi: Concerns about a slowdown in US economy poses the biggest risk to India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing industry as experts fear Fortune 1000 companies may cut spending on technology, hurting Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd. Demand for digital services, which includes data crunching and artificial intelligence (AI) powered platforms, is still linked to the overall health of an economy, they say.
For this reason, analysts will be closely monitoring management commentary from homegrown IT firms on the growth outlook for the companies when they report earnings starting next week. Mumbai-based TCS kicks off the earnings season, when it reports its results on 10 January, followed by Infosys a day later and Wipro on 18 January.
“If the economies of the world are going to suddenly change in terms of their performance, it will certainly have a bearing on enterprises and, as a consequence, on technology companies. I can see that correlation translate at some level,"" Nasscom chairman Rishad Premji said in an interaction with Mint last month. “So, if the question is ‘if economies of the world are not doing well, will corporations continue to spend on digital?’ I would submit no. So, for now, there’s no decoupling (between economic growth and performance of IT firms)."" (read more)
Over the last two months, many economists and brokerages have flagged that the US will slow down in 2019.
Economists at Morgan Stanley expect a 2.3% growth in the current year from an estimated 2.9% growth in 2018.
US accounts for bulk of business, between 55% and 70% for the five largest companies, including TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies Ltd, Wipro and Tech Mahindra.
A weak growth could derail the uptick witnessed in the IT outsourcing industry in the past 12 months, an uptick in larger technology contracts getting outsourced and most companies awarding work that was earlier done internally to its vendors. The first six months of the current fiscal saw Indian IT companies adding more employees and raising salaries of some of them by as much as 40%.
“We need to wait and see how all of this impact the client budgets (technology spend) in the coming two-three months,"" a Wipro executive said on the condition of anonymity, as the company is in a silent period ahead of its earnings.
Digital accounts for less than a third of overall revenue at each of these companies, and that explains why any slowdown in the US will hurt growth at these companies.
“We believe a key question for Accenture, and the rest of our IT services coverage, is how defensive is its business model in the face of slowing global GDP, or even a recession,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a 20 December note. Bachman maintains that “consulting projects would be “aggressively cut in a recession"".
Bachman made the observation after Accenture Plc declared its results. At least two analysts quizzed the management on the impact of a macroeconomic slowdown on company’s growth during the management’s post-earnings interaction with analysts.
“[W]hen it’s raining hard, either you watch the rain or you build an umbrella. At Accenture, we decided to build an umbrella. And what the umbrella is made of, if you will, probably seven key elements which I truly believe are making Accenture more resilient and more durable across different cycles,"" said Pierre Nanterme, chief executive officer, Accenture on 20 December.
Accenture claims that over 60% of its business comes from newer technologies and digital and maintains that the firm will be a beneficiary.
“[I]n Brazil, they say how are you (Accenture) growing double-digits in Brazil, with terrible economic conditions? Because in Brazil, we are the number one. We are the market leader. And when times are tough, you remember the flight to quality. I would use the same comparison which is flight to leadership. When times are tough, clients are going to the leader with all the characteristics we have and the values,"" said Nanterme.
On Thursday, share prices of TCS and Infosys fell 1.39% and 0.26%, respectively, while that of Wipro rose 0.09% on the BSE. The benchmark Sensex lost 1.05%, or 377.81 points, to end the day at 35,513.71."

The board will also consider a proposal for issue of bonus shares at the meeting.

If Wipro announces a bonus issue, it will be second such move by the Bengaluru-headquartered IT services company in two years. In 2017, Wipro had announced a 1:1 bonus issue.
Cash-rich Indian IT companies have been returning cash in their books to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Also in 2017, Wipro had carried out an  ₹ 11,000 crore share buyback programme.
When a company announces bonus issue, the number of outstanding shares goes up as investors get extra shares. The face value of a company’s share does not change but it increases the liquidity of shares in the market. Bonus issues may also result in higher dividends for investors because of higher number of shares. Analysts say that bonus issuance signals that the company may increase its profitability to justify expanded equity base.
Infosys, which announced Q3 earnings last week, had also approved an  ₹ 8,260-crore share buyback, the second in less than 13 months’ time. Infosys also declared a special dividend of  ₹ 4 per share. Last year, Infosys had also approved 1:1 bonus issue to celebrate 25 years of stock market listing.

Shares of Wipro Ltd gained over 10% last week after the company said its board will consider a bonus issue of equity shares. The board eventually approved a 1:3 bonus issue, and what’s more, its earnings exceeded Street estimates. The constant currency revenue growth of 7% year-on-year indicates continued recovery. Revenue grew 5.1% in Q2 and 2.4% in Q1 from a year ago.
But the 0-2% revenue growth forecast for the current quarter caught the Street off guard. This can temper expectations. The subdued guidance comes in the backdrop of strong revenue growth commentaries by larger rivals.
Encouraged by robust deal wins and order pipeline, both Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd have guided for strong growth momentum in the current quarter, with the latter even revising its FY19 growth guidance upwards by a percentage point.
Wipro is also seeing a good deal flow. According to the management, the order pipeline is strong. “The management is confident of growth recovery on the back of a) continued traction in BFSI and digital; b) robust demand environment especially for digital transformation and enterprise scale modernization services, c) steady progress in client mining,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note. BFSI is banking, financial services and insurance.
But recovery is not broad-based yet. The sectors which are on the recovery path—financial services, consumer and energy—continue to see acceleration. The laggards—healthcare and manufacturing—have continued to languish. The saving grace is that they account for only a fifth of Wipro’s revenue, although even then, they have been a drag on overall growth.
The uneven recovery is clouding the near-term outlook. Revenue growth in the healthcare segment is directly correlated to enrolments, which have been low. Similarly, performance in the manufacturing vertical is likely to be volatile due to restructuring.
So, even as the company delivered healthy execution and margin improvement for the second consecutive quarter, the subdued growth outlook is constraining earnings expectations. While the Wipro stock trades at a discount to larger peers, lacklustre growth is proving to be a handicap.
“Despite some improvement, Wipro continues to underperform other top-tier IT services companies on growth and valuation at 15x FY20E P/E is expensive by comparison (vis-à-vis growth expectations), keeping us on the sidelines,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note."

136,2019-01-23,Wipro,"Since each firm defines ‘digital’ differently, analysts are in a quandary when they try to compare firmsAnalysts cite three main reasons behind this divergence in RPE and digital share of business

NEW DELHI :
India’s top technology companies have seen the contribution of digital revenues—value added services that they say are more lucrative—surge over the past three years, but a key productivity metric, revenue per employee, suggests that digital may not be all that it’s cracked up to be.
Revenue per employee (RPE) has not improved much at three of the largest companies, with only Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. and Wipro Ltd reporting a significant increase.
Cognizant remains an outlier, as the Nasdaq-listed firm saw its RPE rise by 16% since December 2016, while Wipro’s RPE improved 7% since June 2016, according to a Mint analysis.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd saw their RPE improve 1.13% and 1.4%, respectively, since the companies first started disclosing their share of digital revenue.
It’s not just companies based out of India, Accenture Plc, the leader in digital services, raised its share of digital business to 60% at the end of November quarter from 17% for the year ended August 2014.
However, its RPE on an annual run-rate basis declined by 6.8% to $91,415 from $98,083.5 during the same period. Accenture follows a September-August financial year.
Analysts cite three main reasons behind this divergence in RPE and digital share of business. First, since each company defines “digital"" differently, they are in a quandary when they try to draw comparisons between firms.
Accenture clubs revenue from platforms, internet of things, cloud computing, cyber security and Accenture interactive under what the company calls digital and new. Cognizant does not include business from platforms under digital, while Wipro, unlike TCS and Infosys, does not count business from consulting as part of digital.
“How companies count digital revenue is not consistent,"" said Ray Wang, founder, Constellation Research.
Second, possible price cuts for their services and more offshoring. “Price cuts and different companies changing the mix of onshore-offshore work is a big reason behind these divergent RPE numbers,"" a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage said on condition of anonymity.
A possible third reason behind Accenture’s decline in RPE as against an improvement at home-grown IT firms could possibly be explained by different approaches followed by these companies: Accenture has bought digital piece by acquiring companies while Indian firms have tried to build it.
“The answer is simple—top digital talent demands higher salaries and Accenture has acquired 36 digital agencies, while their nearest rival, Cognizant, has bought 10. In addition, Accenture dominates in digital design, where most staff has to be onshore—and hence more expensive—while the Indian majors focus much more on the IT integration pieces,"" said Phil Fersht, chief executive of US-based HfS Research.
Email queries to Accenture, TCS and Infosys went unanswered. Cognizant declined to comment as the company is in a quiet period ahead of declaring its fourth-quarter earnings next month. A Wipro spokesperson declined to comment. “We expect that (RPE to improve),"" Wipro’s chief operating officer, Bhanumurthy B.M. had said in an interview last week after the company declared its third-quarter earnings."

134,2019-01-25,Wipro,"Finding a successor to CEO Francisco D’Souza, improving growth figures are the two key challenges ahead for firmCognizant has had only four CEOs so far, while Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone

NEW DELHI :
For a quarter of a century since it was set up in 1994, Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. has followed a simple mantra: capitalize on the opportunity emerging out of every crisis.
“Frank (CEO Francisco D’Souza) often says never miss a crisis, it’s an opportunity,"" said Ramakrishnan Chandrasekaran, executive vice-chairman, Cognizant India.
This approach is best exemplified by the company’s performance during the financial meltdown of 2008. Cognizant’s revenue grew 16% in 2009 and 40% in 2010; Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd could only manage single-digit growth.
“Unlike some Indian firms, Cognizant increased its investments in business. From hiring more sales executives to even doing some work pro bono for clients, Cognizant realized that all this will help the company in future,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a foreign brokerage, requesting anonymity.
Cognizant, which started as a software services arm of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. with 175 employees in 1994, will end 2018 with over $16 billion in revenues. The Nasdaq-listed firm completes 25 years on 26 January. TCS completed 50 years last year.
Cognizant is envied by its Indian rivals for its scorching pace of growth. Beginning 2010, it has been adding over $1 billion in incremental revenue every year. In other words, in the 12 years ended December 2018, Cognizant has added $14.66 billion in revenue, or the combined numbers of what Wipro and Tech Mahindra Ltd could achieve.
“Cognizant had a challenger strategy,"" said Ray Wang, founder, Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm. “The key was that they had less rules, less bureaucracy to do the right thing, and that led to explosive growth.""
Four things underline Cognizant’s steroid-charged growth.
First, the company’s super-aggressive sales culture as the firm always had more people managing its large accounts. Second, Cognizant’s senior management comprises more people from outside the firm, unlike the insular approach followed by homegrown companies. “We are truly an MNC,"" said R. Ramkumar, executive director, Cognizant India. “We had a CEO who operated out of the US, the next one operated out of India, and the one after him out of the US. If you were to look at the next 25 years, this one aspect of being a global organization with a global mindset and a global leadership positions us well to thrive in the digital era,"" said Ramkumar, who joined Cognizant from TCS in 1998. Third, stability at the top. Since inception, Cognizant has had only four CEOs. Srini Raju and Lakshmi Narayanan were based out of India, while Kumar Mahadeva and current boss D’Souza are based out of US. Both Infosys and Wipro have had at least four bosses in the last decade alone.
Finally, the company has gained from its focus on fewer countries and industry segments. In 2017, the US accounted for three-fourths of its total revenue, while business from banking, financial services and insurance and healthcare accounted for 38.1% and 28.8%, respectively.
Still, 25 years later, Cognizant again finds itself at a crossroads.
The IT major’s growth fell to single digit for the first time in 2016, when activist investor Elliott Management Corp. pushed the management to focus on improving profitability rather than its growth-at-all costs approach. 2018 will be the third straight year of Cognizant reporting single-digit growth.
Understandably, a few analysts such as HSBC analyst Yogesh Aggarwal, have said in the past that Elliott’s decision was nothing short of “destructive activism"".
A bigger challenge ahead for the company is to find the successor to CEO D’Souza, and the board is evaluating both internal and external candidates. D’Souza is expected to step down sometime this year.
“Cognizant has been a good story,"" said former Infosys CFO V. Balakrishnan. “Their USP has, however, been to grow higher than Indian firms. The Elliott chapter was a distraction for the company, and it needs to be seen if the company can get back its old DNA.""
Amazon, which was also founded in 1994, set up its cloud services business, Amazon Web Services, in 2006. AWS’s revenue now stands at $21 billion (on trailing 12 months basis), more than TCS.
For now, Chandrasekaran won’t admit if Cognizant, like its Indian peers, lacked the foresight to invest in cloud computing business. “The good thing is that we were able to scale our business. The bad thing was we didn’t focus on path-breaking innovations, but in the future you will see a lot more path-breaking innovations,"" said Chandrasekaran.

HCL Technologies Ltd on Tuesday reported a 4.9% sequential increase in its dollar revenue for the October-December quarter, the fastest among the large companies in India’s $167 billion information technology (IT) outsourcing sector.
HCL Tech’s dollar revenue improved sequentially to $2.2 billion in the quarter, while revenue grew 10.8% year-on-year (y-o-y).
In constant currency terms, the company’s revenue rose 5.6% on a sequential basis.
Net profit was at $364 million in the December quarter when compared with $357 million in the September quarter.
However, its operating margin fell 30 basis points from 19.9% to 19.6% in the quarter under consideration, on account of rising wages. One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
A Bloomberg survey of 29 analysts had forecast revenue of $2.18 billion, or  ₹15,514.1 crore, besides profit of $357.54 million, or  ₹2,541 crore, for the December quarter.
Noida-based HCL Tech’s performance in the October-December quarter was better than its Bengaluru-based rivals, Infosys Ltd and Wipro Ltd, which reported 2.2% and 1.8% sequential dollar revenue growth, respectively. Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, which does more business than Infosys and Wipro put together, reported 0.67% growth.
For now, HCL Tech’s growth continues to be driven by higher business from its infrastructure management services unit, besides revenue from its acquisition strategy.
HCL Tech expects its full-year revenue for 2018-19 to grow at the upper-end of its guidance of 9.5-11.5%. Mumbai-based TCS, which does not provide a growth outlook, is expected to grow over 11%, while Infosys expects at-best 9% growth.
Industry body Nasscom expects revenue for the industry to grow between 7% and 9% in constant currency terms.
“I’m very happy with the outstanding performance delivered by us during this quarter,"" said HCL Technologies chief executive officer C. Vijayakumar.
“For now, we see healthy demand and we don’t see any impact on our client spends from either the continued shutdown in the US or any macroeconomic slowdown.""
“HCL Tech delivered impressive revenues growth for the quarter with 5.9% constant currency growth, however, margins perHformance was a tad below estimates,"" said Sanjeev Hota, an analyst with brokerage Sharekhan Ltd.
The brokerage, however, said it continues to have concerns over the company’s $1.8 billion acquisition of eight software products from IBM, which was announced last month.
On Tuesday, HCL shares rose 1.24% to  ₹988.1 on the BSE even as the benchmark Sensex slipped 64 points, or 0.18%, to end the day at 35,592.5 points. HCL Q3 results were announced after market hours."
132,2019-01-30,Wipro,"Trust can become an important factor, and a catalyst in improving learning outcomes

The thick sal forest had only one large clearing in miles, which housed the school. The school had closed for the day, but some children were lingering around, playing in the yard in the winter afternoon’s fading sunlight. Through the iron grille of the window, I could see right up to the edge of the misty playground where the wall of trees began. Kiran Deo Singh was narrating his life as a teacher. As he went from his college days, to his first year in a school, and then to how he found an anchor as an elderly retired teacher, all the lingering children left, disappearing into the wall of trees.
A boy and a girl, probably 8 and 6, visibly siblings, returned to the playground from the forest. They came running into the room. Singh gave them the glucose biscuit packet that he had opened for me, and asked them why they had come back. The girl was eating three biscuits at once. The boy replied: “Abba door desh me hain, aaj raat ko nahi aayenge (father has gone to some distant place, he won’t return tonight)."" They went out and started singing loudly just outside the room. Singh continued the story of his life.
In a few minutes, we finished the conversation, ready to leave. The children were still playing outside. I asked him about them. The story of Afzal and Anjum is unremarkably common, but for them it is their life. Their mother passed away, and their father is a daily wage labourer. He is a caring father, but has to go where work takes him. Once in a while it is so far that he can’t reach home the same night. Their extended family lives in another village. The neighbours are fine people and help within their meagre means. However, the children prefer going with Singh to his house on such days.
“So will you take them home with you?"" I asked. He replied in the affirmative, while locking the doors. “How many times does this happen?"" One lock was giving trouble, so with some delay he replied: “Once in a while."" I got into my car, while Anjum and Afzal were squabbling about who will sit right behind Singh on the bike. They came to some agreement and left, as we too left.
The cold was biting even at noon, held to the ground by the thick forest. It was another school, in another clearing, two days later. The dull sunlight outside was better than the inside of the dark freezing rooms. It was a large gathering of about 50 people sitting in a circle, on durries, on the ground. There were teachers, principals and other education officials from across that area. I had reached a bit late and a place was kept for me next to the officer, who was clearly the boss. I noticed Singh, with his heavyweight boxers’ height and build, at the far end of the circle.
Without looking at anyone else, the officer started speaking to me. He rattled off his heroic efforts in this remote district. After 10 minutes he turned to the group and gave them a five-minute rapid-fire speech on their duties and told them how those who wouldn’t improve their schools would be taken to task. Then he left. After his departure the meeting came to life.
The discussion was without artifice. Quickly dividing the group was one matter, with opposing beliefs—all children can learn versus not all children can learn. The second group, which was in majority, explained their belief by saying the children of the poor just don’t have the capacity to learn. The other side said that it was all about trust; if you believed that all children can learn, then they will. They had a punchy back-up argument. They took the example of the officer who had departed. If he were to trust that they would do a good job, most of them would do much better than they were doing today. That was a statement that none of them would refute.
These are all oft-used arguments in groups of teachers. Like the others, this discussion, too, tapered to a stalemate. Some found validation, a few may have even moved a bit, but it hadn’t really changed anything. Till Singh spoke up.
“Pyaar to karke dekho,"" he said. Try loving them. If you love them you will know that there is no difference between children. If you love them, all challenges will be trivial. If you love them, it will change you, and that is why they will blossom. This was a different battlefield. Not even the most hardened cynic was able to argue that children should not be loved. They may not do it, but they knew not how to oppose this. Some had a glow of insight on their faces, a few from gaining that insight, some others from hearing Singh articulate so clearly what they knew.
I was saying farewell to Singh when I asked him about Afzal and Anjum. They were still at his home. Singh spoke to their father the day we had met. He was getting five more days of work at twice the standard wage rate, but the place was so far that he couldn’t commute daily. So Singh told him to stay there, work and earn, while the children would stay with him. How many times does this happen, I asked. Once in a while, he said. “Mere hee bachche hain""—they are like my children.
My father is 80 today. He has dedicated his life to education, about which he once said, “the heart of the matter in education is that it is a matter of the heart"". He could have said that about life. I wish more people would listen to him or Singh, “Pyaar to karke dekho.""

130,2019-02-05,Wipro,"Wipro Ventures’ fundings underscore IT firm’s success in tapping startup ecosystemWipro has done a better job at M&As and investments than its peers, including Infosys, say analysts

NEW DELHI :
Wipro Ventures has deployed $65 million, or two-thirds of its corpus, in 18 startups since it was set up in 2015 and has helped its parent, Wipro Ltd, win more than 100 deals, underscoring the early success of the software services company in tapping into the disruptive startup ecosystem.
Of its total investments, 14 are in the US, three in Israel and one in India—in Pune-based big data start-up Altizon Systems Pvt. Ltd.
“As of date, we have committed more than $65 million in capital,"" said Venu Pemmaraju, a managing partner at Wipro Ventures.
Both Pemmaraju, formerly a senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and the other managing partner, Biplab Adhya, are based out of California. They report to Rishad Premji, the elder son of billionaire, philanthropist and Wipro chairman Azim Premji.
“Since 2015, we have had more than 100 wins in conjunction with the startups we have invested in,"" said Adhya.
Wipro Ventures’ investments have allowed Wipro to offer new-age technology solutions in engagements with some of the firm’s 1,132 customers, and win contracts, highlighting how large information technology (IT) companies are keeping pace with the latest technologies.
In the last few years, Wipro’s revenue growth has lagged its larger rivals, including Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd. At the end of the June quarter, HCL Technologies Ltd edged past Wipro to become India’s third-largest IT firm.
Wipro Ventures’ performance, however, has been one of the few bright spots in the Wipro story.
Infosys, which also set up a $500 million corporate venture arm, Infosys Innovation Fund, in 2015, has invested in only eight startups so far. Infosys divested its stake in ANSR Consulting Holdings Inc. in December 2017.
Rishad Premji, who is Wipro’s chief strategy officer and director, also oversees the company’s mergers and acquisitions.
Over the last four years, Wipro has been second only to Noida-based HCL in acquisitions, having spent $1.17 billion in acquiring six companies including Denmark-based design firm Designit and US-based cloud computing firm Appirio Inc.
Understandably, many analysts maintain that Wipro has done a better job at mergers and acquisitions and investments than its peers, including Infosys.
“Wipro has done a better job of M&A than most IT services firms to date,"" said Ray Wang, founder of Constellation Research, a technology research and advisory firm.
“We measure both the financial health of the companies and the strategic value to Wipro and the startups. Our baseline investment strategy is still the same—invest into early- to mid-stage enterprise software companies that have exhibited initial product-market fit, deployed their solution at a handful of enterprise customers and put mechanisms in place to engage with a global technology services provider,"" said Pemmaraju.
“That said, each deal is different and one size doesn’t fit all. So we do modify our evaluation criteria accordingly,"" said Adhya."

Mumbai: Charity may begin at home but to take the big leap of not just donating a few bucks but your life to a social cause is a critical decision. It may require you to make the transition from a comfortably seated, high-paying job to a non-profit one.
The couple Rahul Aggarwal, 36, and Ridhi, 35, also felt a little pressure from their families when they left their jobs in 2012 to work at a charitable organisation. “We were on an attractive growth path, but we were sure of our aspirations to do something for rural education,"" said Aggarwal. The couple joined Krishnamurti Foundation School to understand the education situation in India. “My wife and I are conservative investors, so all our money was in fixed deposits. We were getting some meagre interest from it. But, the need to invest in other instruments did not arise,"" he added.
“For us, it was not about our risk appetite or how conservative we were when it came to choosing or expanding our portfolios. Since our organisation was at a very nascent stage, we wanted to devote all the time to it and not think about where to invest,"" said Aggarwal. He said that they could manage their expenses because they cut down on lifestyle expenses. “We also do not intend to leave a huge lump sum for our son because we believe the child should be able to fend for himself."" The couple then went on to set up Swatantra Talim, a non-profit NGO, in 2013 which focuses rural children education. “To keep our expenses in check, we only take the number of projects that we can afford in a year. We have around 1,000 children and we do not take in more than that,"" said Aggarwal, adding that a lot of their peers, corporate contacts chipped in look at their credentials. “CSR initiatives with Wipro also helped us a lot,"" he added.
Aggarwal and Ridhi park most of their money in bank accounts and organisation fixed deposits. “We cut our coat according to our cloth and hence are running our NGO with minimal financial glitches,"" said Aggarwal.
For most people, working for a cause comes a little late in life. Anand Vasudevan, 53, who has worked as an equity researcher, now works as a consultant for an NGO-Cuddles Foundation, a Mumbai based organisation which provides nutritional support to cancer affected children. “I was working in the corporate space for at least 27 years and I wanted to make a difference to the society,"" he said. He quit his job in December 2017 and moved to Cuddles Foundation after that.
“I have planned my investments on a long term basis all throughout my career,"" said Vasudevan. He has invested in mutual funds, both equity and debt and a small portion in fixed deposits for short-term needs. “When it comes to insurance, I use it as a protection instrument.""
He hired a financial advisor after he quit his job. “I wanted to devote my time to the NGO and various other activities. The help of a financial advisor was useful,"" he said. His portfolio was structured, keeping in mind that his income needs were taken care of, said Vishal Dhawan, founder, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors. “He could focus on his work as we monitor his portfolio,"" he said.
Planning the transition
According to Shyam Sunder, founder of Peak Alpha Financial Services Private Ltd, planning for this transition is to achieve financial independence, manage cash flows and provide liquidity. “In terms of financial independence, the goal is to create a portfolio that has a proper balance between safety and growth,"" he said. “Instruments for safety would include fixed deposits and debt funds while for growth, look at stocks and equity funds. In terms of cash flows, you should replace the income that the family needs by using a combination of annuities and systematic withdrawals from mutual funds,"" said Sunder. In terms of liquidity, one must make sure they have some funds that can be liquidated at very short notice for sudden emergencies, he added.
“You should keep three years of emergency savings in a liquid fund,"" said Dilshad Billimoria, director, Dilzer Consultants Private Ltd., an investment advisory firm. For the initial corpus required to start the NGO, park your money in ultra-short term funds if you plan to begin in three years and hybrid funds if you plan to begin in five years, she said."
128,2019-02-11,Wipro,"The top five IT firms added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 millionAnalysts say that there is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue

New Delhi: India’s top 10 information technology (IT) companies added 114,390 engineers to their workforce in 2018, a more than four-fold increase from the previous year. While the numbers are the best in five years, few are predicting a similar showing in 2019.
Much of the jobs added in 2018 may have been because of increased hiring in the US under pressure from the Donald Trump administration and customers outsourcing large contracts on the condition that the vendors absorb some of their employees, two human resources (HR) executives said.
Although none of the companies disclosed details of hiring in the US or the number of employees absorbed from clients, the HR executives claimed that at least half of the net hiring made by companies in 2018 is on account of one of these two reasons.
The top five IT firms—Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Cognizant Technology Services Corp., Infosys Ltd, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd—added 99,010 employees last year to take their workforce to about 1.23 million as against an addition of 19,360 people in 2017, according to an analysis by Mint.
The rest of the top 10—Tech Mahindra Ltd, Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd, Mindtree Ltd, Cyient Ltd and Zensar Ltd—added just 15,380 engineers compared with 2,796 in the previous year.
India’s $167 billion software services industry employed 3.7 million people at the end of December and the 10 largest companies accounted for 38% of them.
Some experts say last year’s jump looks more like a temporary recovery as the industry undergoes a structural change from a people-led model to a platform-based approach.
“I see the global economy slowing this year, and IT hiring will slow with it. Plus, the emerging IT services models will ultimately require fewer people to support it with smarter automation and the use of platforms,"" said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based HfS Research, an outsourcing-research firm.
For now, stable macroeconomic growth in both the US and Europe has made more companies across industries spend more on outsourcing technology work, resulting in higher demand for services offered by IT outsourcing companies.
Unsurprisingly, a few analysts expect the sector to grow at faster pace in 2019 than in the recent past.
“(A)nnual growth rates in CC (constant currency) slowed in CY (calender year) 2017 by ~250bps (basis points) y/y across the Indian IT services industry, and improved in CY18 by ~90bps across the industry. Based on current Street estimates, we expect the Indian IT services industry revenue growth rates to continue to re-accelerate in CY19 at 9.3% y/y growth,"" Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 6 February.
Mumbai-based TCS is expected to grow its revenue by more than 11% in constant currency terms while Infosys expects full-year revenue to grow, at best, 9% in the year ending 31 March.
A large number of big IT outsourcing contracts have seen some employees of clients join the workforce of technology vendors.
For instance, 9,000 of the 13,514 people added by Wipro in 2018 joined from Alight Solutions as part of an outsourcing contract. Wipro won a $1.6 billion deal from Alight Solutions LLC, the former benefits administration and human-resources outsourcing business of Aon Plc in September last year.
Infosys’s contract with Verizon and TCS’s two mega contracts—the over $2 billion, 10-year contract from Transamerica Life Insurance Co. and $1.36 billion over 10 years from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc—also saw the two IT firms absorb employees from their clients. The Transamerica contract alone added 2,200 employees to TCS’s workforce, which totalled 417,929 at the end of December.
Not many expect IT firms to add as many people in 2019 as they added last year.
“There is no structural change to conclude that the pace of hiring will continue. The industry is going through a change and faces the same pressure from automation. Of course, we will continue to hire in the US. But overall hiring depends on client budgets, which in turn is tied to macroeconomic growth,"" an executive at Wipro said on the condition of anonymity.
“Talent in areas such as algorithm development and automation is increasingly scarce and expensive, which will stifle resources and put increased pressure on services firms to train junior or mid-level staff at a faster pace than ever. I predict hiring will slow in the second half of 2019 and not pick up aggressively until early 2021,"" said Fersht of HfS Research."
127,2019-02-12,Wipro,"After Infosys vs Wipro, N.R. Narayana Murthy and Azim Premji find themselves in another duel: Catamaran Ventures vs PremjiInvestN.R. Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures is now mulling whether it should continue to back startups

New Delhi: Infosys Ltd’s founder N.R. Narayana Murthy and Wipro Ltd’s chairman Azim Premji battled for supremacy in India’s information technology (IT) outsourcing industry for more than three decades.
Murthy, 72 and Premji, 73, find themselves in another duel, as the two billionaire septuagenarians’ financial and strategy skills are put to the test while they oversee their family offices, Catamaran Ventures Llp and PremjiInvest, respectively.
A decade after Murthy set up Catamaran in 2009, the venture capital fund continues to wrestle with how to find the best playbook.
Catamaran is now mulling whether it should continue to back startups and make any new investments in the sector, said two executives familiar with the matter. Instead, the company plans to focus on investing in listed companies, the executives said, requesting anonymity.
The potential revamp of investment strategy by Catamaran tracks the appointment last month of Abishek Laxminarayan as chief executive. His appointment follows the exit of Arjun Narayanswamy who took over as CEO of Soroco, a Boston-based artificial intelligence-focused firm.
Incidentally, Soroco was founded by Rohan Murty, son of Narayana Murthy, in 2014.
“In December, a review of the portfolio was undertaken by NRN and it was decided that Catamaran will not make any fresh investments in startups,"" said an executive familiar with the discussions. The executive did not want to be named as the discussions are private.
“The (Catamaran) fund will wait to get an exit from its current investments. The focus will now be to look at investing more in listed firms,"" the executive said.
Murthy and Narayanswamy did not respond to emails seeking comment. 
PremjiInvest declined to comment.
Mint could not independently ascertain the total investments made by Catamaran since it was founded in 2009. However, Catamaran’s performance pales in comparison to PremjiInvest, the family office of Azim Premji.
Since it was set up in 2006, PremjiInvest has become India’s largest family office, managing about $5 billion of assets, said a third executive familiar with the matter. PremjiInvest backs about two-dozen startups and also owns equity stakes in about 40 listed companies.
One of the executives attributed the performance of the two funds to the varied approaches adopted by Murthy and Premji.
Murthy started Catamaran with an initial corpus of $120 million as against Premji who wrote a $1 billion cheque.
Secondly, PremjiInvest did not limit its investments to only India and backs both startups and listed companies in the US.
Finally, PremjiInvest is bigger in terms of manpower, employing about 40, as against Catamaran, which has half-a-dozen people.
“Premji got a professional in Prakash (Parthasarathy) to set up and run the fund, and Prakash managed to build it to this size where because of the size, most private deals come to PremjiInvest. This is something which Murthy could not do because he relied on a team of youngsters who had recently graduated from college to run the firm,"" said the first executive cited above.
Catamaran currently has investments in seven startups, including education-technology focused startup Ace Creative Learning Pvt. Ltd, ad-tech firm Vyoma Media, Acko General Insurance, medical diagnosis firm Achira Labs, Healthspring Community Medical Centres, Innoviti Payment Solutions and Threadsol, a startup that offers enterprise material management technology to garment manufacturers. Catamaran exited from Hector Beverages Pvt. Ltd, which makes traditional drinks under the Paper Boat brand, and sold its stake in Manipal Global Education Services in 2013.
Catamaran has investments in seven listed firms, including a 3.83% stake in Vesuvius India Ltd, 2.46% in Garware Technical Fibres Ltd, 2.65% in Ambika Cotton Mills Ltd and 1.07% in Nesco Ltd. Catamaran also has less than 1% in Wabco India Ltd, S.H. Kelkar and Co. Ltd and SKF India Ltd.
In addition, Catamaran has a joint venture with Amazon.com Inc.—Cloudtail India Pvt. Ltd, the largest seller on Amazon India’s platform.
The joint venture partnership changed with Murthy’s firm now owning 76% in the JV as against 51% earlier after India changed the rules in December last year, limiting foreign e-commerce firms from owning a controlling stake in an entity which also sells on the market place."

New Delhi: Siddhartha Lal, managing director and chief executive of Eicher Motors Ltd, was named the EY Entrepreneur of the Year 2018, for engineering the operational and financial turnaround of the company and reviving the Royal Enfield brand, while Wipro Ltd chairman Azim Premji was honoured with the Lifetime Achievement award.
“Siddhartha Lal has led an impressive transformation at Eicher Motors since he took over the reins in 2006, helping the company resurrect the Royal Enfield motorcycle brand in India and establishing it as a global brand icon,"" said EY.
Eicher Motors is the market leader in the middleweight premium motorcycle segment in India.
Premji was awarded for putting the Indian IT industry on the global map and contributing to society as a philanthropist.
“In the 20-year journey of the Entrepreneur Of The Year Program in India, we have seen Indian entrepreneurs make an invaluable contribution to propelling our country forward. The winners of this year are no different. They come from both traditional and new-age businesses, but what is common to them is how they have transformed companies or their industries, or even created new markets where none existed,"" said Rajiv Memani, chairman and regional managing partner of EY India."
125,2019-02-13,Wipro,"Persistent Systems has named IBM's Christopher O'Connor as CEO in place of Anand DeshpandeChristopher O'Connor is the second outsider within a week to lead an IT firm after Cognizant

New Delhi: When IBM’s Christopher O’Connor was named as the chief executive officer (CEO) of a Pune-based software services company on Monday, he became the second outsider within a week to lead an IT services company after Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.
Persistent Systems announced on Monday that Anand Deshpande, founder, chairman and managing director (MD), will transfer his CEO responsibilities to O’Connor over the next three quarters.
His appointment means six of India’s 11 largest IT services firms have hired external candidates as their CEOs in the last three years, underscoring the insider versus outsider debate in an industry that is facing business disruptions from newer technologies.
Until August 2015, five of these six companies, save for Infosys Ltd, had an internal candidate as their CEO.
Last week, New Jersey-based Cognizant, which has most of its employees in India, named Brian Humphries, currently CEO of Vodafone Business, as the successor to founder and CEO Francisco D’Souza.
Larsen & Toubro Infotech Ltd (LTI) first hired former Infosys executive Sanjay Jalona as CEO in August 2015, which was followed by Zensar Technologies Ltd, Wipro Ltd and Infosys all appointing an external candidate to steer their firms.
Incidentally, the decision by Infosys to appoint former Capgemini SE executive Salil Parekh as CEO in January 2018 followed the failure of the company’s earlier decision to entrust former SAP executive board member Vishal Sikka to lead the firm. Sikka left Infosys three years after taking over in August 2014.
At least one expert attributes this trend to most companies not having enough leaders to take on the top job. “If you include the examples of NIIT Technologies, Hexaware and ITC Infotech, then the number of companies total nine,"" said Navnit Singh, chairman and regional MD, Korn Ferry India, an executive search firm.
Former Infosys executive Sudip Singh took over as CEO at ITC Infotech on 1 February while NIIT appointed former Genpact executive Sudhir Singh to the top post in January last year. Hexaware appointed former HCL Technologies executive R. Srikrishna as its CEO in July 2014.
“Clearly the boards of these companies were looking for a kind of game-changer and did not want an internal candidate, who they believed is too seeped into a company’s working style. So, a company getting an outsider as a CEO is a reflection that they don’t have internal candidates,"" said Singh. “But you have to give credit to all these leaders as these companies are on a roll, despite the disruptions facing the industry.""
Age is another factor— most external hires are young. Cognizant’s new boss Brian Humphries, at 45, is the youngest. Sanjay Jalona was 46 when he was hired by LTI while Abidali Neemuchwala was 48 when he got the top job at Wipro.
“Competing companies with identical business models seek strikingly different attributes in their CEO. CEO selection inevitably carries uncertainty,"" JPMorgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George wrote in a note dated 8 February.
George clubbed the hiring of outsiders as CEO under three categories. Companies that have consistently done well prefer to promote internal leaders to take on the top job, and this decision also carries the least uncertainty. TCS elevating chief financial officer Rajesh Gopinathan to CEO in 2017 is one such example.
Others, such as Infosys, Wipro, LTI and Zensar, appointed their new chiefs from within the IT industry, an indicator that they want a departure from current working styles, though they are still wary of bringing in a rank outsider, George said in his note.
Cognizant’s move to appoint Humphries, who is from the telecom sector, comes with an additional risk compared with other IT firms that have hired CEOs from within the industry. George, however, wrote that Humphries, because of having worked across finance, strategy and operations across the US, UK, Europe, and South Africa, is a “good"" choice."

123,2019-02-19,Wipro,"Reliance Industries, HCL Technologies, Wipro and JSW Steel are among the firms that haven't yet split the CMD postA third of the firms that have not complied with the rule so far are public sector enterprises or state-run banks

New Delhi: More than two-thirds of India’s top publicly-traded companies have separated the positions of chairman and managing director (CMD), although the deadline to comply with the rules is more than 13 months away.
That leaves just 156 of the BSE 500 companies to still untangle the role of CMD as of 15 February, compared with 291 in July last year, according to Prime Database, a primary market research tracking firm.
The idea behind the separation of the two positions is to bolster corporate governance. The separation of powers, according to some experts, increases the effectiveness of the board’s oversight role.
A third of the companies that have not complied with the rule so far are public sector enterprises or state-run banks. Although companies still have time to meet the April 2020 deadline, most firms, save for some family-run and government-controlled firms, have started the process of splitting the two positions.
India’s most valuable company, Reliance Industries Ltd, the country’s third and fourth largest information technology services firms, HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd, respectively, and JSW Steel Ltd are among the companies that need to comply with the new rules.
The four, along with 90 of India’s largest publicly traded companies, have members of the promoter group holding both the chairman and MD titles.
“Promoters still appear to be looking at how else they can retain maximum power over their firms and so a perceived reluctance on their part to split the titles,"" said the head of a proxy advisory firm, on condition of anonymity.
But most companies have initiated efforts to comply with the rules. One of the most recent examples is Persistent Systems Ltd, a software services company based in Pune. Chairman and MD Anand Deshpande last week decided to relinquish his role as MD. Christopher O’Connor will take over as chief executive on 26 February. “The transition will take at least six months. So we decided to start the process a year in advance,"" said Deshpande. At Persistent, Deshpande will transfer his CEO responsibilities to O’Connor, who joins the company on 25 February, over the next three quarters.
Persistent and Tata Coffee Ltd are some of the 135 companies that have, over the past seven months, separated the CMD role. This was after the Securities and Exchange Board of India approved many of the recommendations made by a 25-member panel led by Uday Kotak, chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank.
One of these recommendations was the contentious issue of a company splitting the role of CMD.
More companies of the remaining 156 in the list could split the CMD roles during the annual general meetings later this year. “I expect that during the July-August period when most companies hold their AGMs (annual general meetings), more companies will put this proposal of splitting the role of chairman and managing director before their shareholders,"" said Shriram Subramanian, founder and MD of proxy advisory firm InGovern Research."

NEW DELHI :
Wipro Sunday said it has received approval from majority of its shareholders for the issue of bonus shares and increase in authorised share capital.
In a separate filing, the company said its the board of directors has fixed March 7, 2019, as the record sate to determine eligible shareholders entitled to receive the bonus equity shares (including stock dividend on American depository share).
In January, Wipro's board had approved an issue of bonus shares wherein shareholders will get one bonus share for every three shares held by them.
In a regulatory filing, Wipro said the ""resolutions have been approved by members with requisite majority and shall be deemed to have been passed on February 22, 2019, being the last date of receipt of postal ballot forms/e-voting"".
Consequently, the company's authorised share capital stands increased from  ₹1,126.50 crore to  ₹2,526.50 crore by creation of additional 700 crore equity shares of  ₹2 each, it added.
The filing said the 98.82% votes cast were in favour of increasing the authorised share capital, and 99.81 per cent votes cast were in favour of offering bonus shares.
In its January filing, Wipro had said the company had an aggregate amount of  ₹46,847.9 crore as on December 2018 in free reserves, securities premium account and capital redemption reserve account.

Wipro later fixed March 7, 2019 as the record date to determine eligible shareholders entitled to receive the bonus equity shares.
The bonus equity shares will be issued out of free reserves and/or the securities premium account or the capital redemption reserve and/or the capital redemption reserve account of the company available as at December 31, 2018.
Post-bonus, the paid-up equity share capital is expected to be around  ₹1206.68 crore, consisting of 603.34 crore equity shares of  ₹2 each, Wipro said in the January filing.
In the same filing, Wipro had also said that as on December 31, 2018, the company had an aggregate amount of  ₹46,847 crore in free reserves, securities premium account and capital redemption reserve account.
In the December quarter, Wipro posted fiscal third-quarter (Q3 2018-19) revenue growth that was in line with analysts’ estimates. Wipro’s dollar revenue improved 1.8% sequentially to $2.04 billion in the quarter ended 31 December. Revenue grew 3.7% on a year-on-year basis. In constant currency terms, revenue rose 2.4% on a sequential basis.
Net profit totaled $366 million in Q3 compared to $260 million at the end of the September quarter (Q2 2018-19). Better operational efficiency helped the firm as the operating margin improved to 19.8%, compared to 18.1% in Q2.

Wipro Ltd witnessed a huge block deal today in which around 26.70 million shares or 0.4% stake of the company changed hands, Bloomberg reported. However, details of the buyers and sellers were not immediately known.
At 9.30 am, Wipro shares were trading 3.2% lower at  ₹260 while India's benchmark index Sensex was down 0.11% at 36,683 points. Intraday, Wipro shares hit a low of  ₹256 a share, falling as much as 4.76%, its sharpest decline since 14 January.
BloombergQuint had earlier reported that the promoters of the Bengaluru-based company would sell 0.4% stake in the company later in the day.
""Billionaire Azim Premji is expected to sell up to 0.44% stake in Wipro owned through his philanthropic trust,"" BloombergQuint reported, citing people familiar with the development.
The Azim Premji Trust is part of the promoter group that owns 74.3% in the company.
""The term sheet has a greenshoe option allowing a total sale of 0.44% or up to 26.7 million shares. The terms indicate the shares will be sold between  ₹255.4 and 260.8 apiece. That implies a discount of 3% to 5% to Thursday’s closing price,"" the report said."

MUMBAI :
Azim Premji, India’s second-richest man, on Wednesday gave away 34% of his shares in Wipro Ltd to charitable causes, confirming his status as the most philanthropic Indian.
The shares given away by Premji—a man known for his frugal ways—are valued at about $7.5 billion.
With the latest contribution, the total value of funds committed by the billionaire to Azim Premji Foundation’s philanthropic activities is  ₹1.45 trillion ($21 billion). This includes a 67% economic ownership of Wipro, the foundation said on Wednesday.
Premji inherited his father’s vegetable oil company and transformed it into a global software powerhouse. One of the world’s richest men, Premji still flies economy class, avoids costly cars and ostentatious displays of wealth.
In terms of philanthropic contributions in the country, Premji is ahead of others by a distance. Although India has seen a rise in individual donations of late, contributions of  ₹10 crore or more account for more than half of individual philanthropy and Premji’s donations alone account for more than 80% of this.
The Premji foundation, set up in 2001, works to improve access to primary education in India, including some of its most disadvantaged parts. Premji’s philanthropic initiatives also help in improving the lives of street children and the disabled. The foundation also runs the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru.
“Azim Premji’s philanthropic activities have an overarching vision to contribute to developing a just, equitable, humane and sustainable society in India. To enable this vision, the Azim Premji Foundation works directly in education and supports other not-for-profits working in some specific areas through multi-year financial grants,"" the foundation said in a press statement.
India’s super wealthy households, or those with a net worth of over $50 million in India, are expected to double in both volume and wealth from 160,600 households with a total net worth of  ₹1.53 trillion in 2017, to 330,400 households with a combined net worth of  ₹3.52 trillion in 2022. But a vast majority of them inherit their wealth and prefer to leave their money to family."
118,2019-03-18,Wipro,"The two trusts earned  ₹11,357 cr by way of dividends, share sales and buybacks in the last nine yearsAzim Premji’s trusts received bonus shares issued by Wipro in June 2010, June 2017 and March 2019

NEW DELHI :
Billionaire Azim Premji’s two philanthropic trusts earned  ₹11,357 crore ($1.65 billion) over the past nine years by way of dividends, share sales and buybacks, becoming one of the richest and largest charitable trusts in India.
The earnings of the two trusts—Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives Pvt. Ltd or APPI (earlier called Azim Premji Foundation) and Azim Premji Trusts or APT—go into the Azim Premji Endowment Fund. The fund, which releases money for all philanthropic work done by the two trusts, is now valued at  ₹1.45 trillion or $21 billion, making it one of the largest private endowments in the world.
Between March 2010 and March 2018, the fund received  ₹2,100 crore in dividends from Wipro Ltd, according to Mint research. It received  ₹1,494 crore by selling Wipro shares in March 2010, March 2012, and earlier this month. It also received  ₹1,963 crore and  ₹5,800 crore, respectively, when it sold shares back to Wipro under the company’s two share buybacks in July 2016 and December 2017.
The trusts also received bonus shares issued by Wipro in June 2010, June 2017 and March 2019.
It is not clear how much of the  ₹11,357 crore earned by the endowment has been spent over the past nine years. A spokesperson for APPI declined to comment.
The value of the endowment fund has surged over the last four years: from $5 billion at the end of January 2015 to $21 billion as of 13 March 2019.
Premji set up the foundation in 2001 to help train teachers so that students could be taught better in government schools. An initial endowment of Wipro shares worth $125 million was given to the foundation. Eight years later, in the quarter ended September 2009, the foundation was first classified as one of the 11 promoter entities. It then held 0.5% of the promoter’s 79.68% ownership in Wipro.
Over the next decade, Premji donated Wipro shares worth nearly $12 billion in a staggered manner to the endowment. This includes last week’s announcement, where he made the country’s single-largest donation, transferring economic ownership of 34% of his shares in Wipro worth $7.5 billion to APPI and APT.
During this time, even as the foundation scaled up its presence in more than 40 districts across six states, the philanthropic arm also started giving grants to non-government organisations and founded the Azim Premji University.
Premji’s philanthropic entities are run by Anurag Behar, co-chief executive officer of the foundation, along with Dileep Ranjekar.
The endowment now owns 14% of the promoter’s shareholding in Wipro and also has economic ownership or the right to receive all money earned from 53% of promoter shares.
This means the endowment gets money earned from 67% of promoter shares in Wipro, leaving Premji, wife Yasmeen Premji, and two sons, Rishad and Tariq, with monetary gains from only 7% of their 74% equity in Wipro.
What is driving Premji’s philanthropy?
A media-averse Premji (Wednesday’s press release did not even have his statement) won’t answer for now.
According to an executive who spoke on condition of anonymity, Premji was a tad irritable when he was briefed about the flood of congratulatory messages on social media platforms after his largest donation.
“What’s all the fuss about,"" remarked Premji, in line with his nature of acting without fanfare, the executive said.
A better guide to understand Premji’s approach towards philanthropy is a letter he wrote in 2013 when he became the first Indian to sign the Giving Pledge, a campaign started by Warren Buffett with Bill and Melinda Gates to get the wealthy across the globe to give back most of their wealth to charity.
“I became convinced that markets, public systems and philanthropic initiatives all had a significant role to play if the country was to have inclusive development, and that we needed to work purposefully towards establishing a more humane, equitable and ethical society for all our citizens,"" Premji wrote in a letter dated 19 February 2013.
Rishad Premji, who is on the board of Wipro and is also the company’s chief strategy officer, shares his father’s vision.
“We collectively as a family very much share a passion and focus on philanthropy,"" Rishad said in an interview in 2017. “We all feel very unfairly privileged and we feel it is our responsibility to partake and contribute."""
117,2019-03-19,Wipro,"Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and Azim Premji Trust will receive benefits from 14% in Wipro and potentially from another 53% of Azim Premji’s total stake in the firmThe two trusts have stayed away from voting on any resolutions pertaining to Wipro and also can’t nominate members to the board

New Delhi: Billionaire Azim Premji’s two charities have been made partners in three companies that hold his 56% stake in Wipro Ltd, allowing the trusts to receive monetary gains from the shares even as Premji can retain the voting rights, a person aware of the development said.
The two charitable trusts—Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives Pvt. Ltd (APPI) and Azim Premji Trust (APT)—have, however, stayed away from voting on any resolutions pertaining to Wipro. The trusts also can’t nominate members to Wipro’s board, the executive said, requesting anonymity.
After last week’s transfer of 34% of economic ownership of Wipro shares to the charitable trusts, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and Azim Premji Trust, will not only own and get economic benefits from 14% in the company, but will also stand to earn money from an additional 53% of Premji and his family’s total 74.29% stake in the company.
“Our approach is a simple one. The trust focuses on funding philanthropic initiatives. The board and management of the company focuses on the company operations,"" said K.R. Lakshminarayan, chief endowment officer at Azim Premji Foundation.
Premji, along with his wife, Yasmeen, and two sons, Rishad Premji and Tariq Premji, holds 4.22% in Wipro. Three partnership firms—Hasham Traders, Prazim Traders and Zash Traders—together own 56.03%; Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives, earlier called Azim Premji Foundation, and Azim Premji Trust hold 0.34% and 13.67%, respectively. The remaining 0.2% is held by Hasham Investment and Trading Co.
Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and Azim Premji Trust, since being inducted as partners of the three partnership firms, will receive all monetary benefits accruing from 53% of Wipro’s shares, while Premji will retain the remaining 3% shares held by these partnership firms.
This means Premji and his family will get dividends and any other economic benefits from only 7% of shares in Wipro, while 67% of the proceeds will go to the Azim Premji Endowment fund, the corpus of which swelled to $21 billion as of 13 March.
A spokesperson for Azim Premji Trust declined to comment on the change.
Premji’s approach of separating legal and economic ownership of shares donated by him to trusts is probably the first-of-its-kind structure in corporate India.
“Corporate governance in India enters a new era with Mr Premji’s magnanimous action of transferring a significant portion of his beneficial interest in Wipro shares,"" said Shankar Jaganathan, founder of CimplyFive Corporate Secretarial Services, a tech solutions provider for compliance standards.
“This move has the potential to impact governance practices in Indian companies by getting the investors and regulators to give equal importance to the intent of the promoters as they give to their actions,"" said Jaganathan, who has authored the book, Corporate Disclosures: The Origin of Financial and Business Reporting.
Tata Trusts, which owns 66% in Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the Tata group, earns dividends and retains right to nominate as many as three directors to the holding company’s board. Additionally, Tata Trusts can also appoint the chairman of the group holding company.

However, while Premji is the chairman of both Wipro and the two trusts, Ratan Tata is the chairman of Tata Trusts and Natarajan Chandrasekaran the chairman of Tata Sons.
More than three dozen companies, including Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd and GMR Infrastructure Ltd, have set up trusts as part of their promoter group of shareholders. But most of these trusts have been founded primarily with an eye on succession planning and also to save from any potential inheritance tax."

New Delhi: HCL Technologies Ltd expects to generate $1.3 billion in revenue over the next seven years from its contract with Xerox Corp., the US printer and photocopier giant. Noida-based HCL Tech, which last year surpassed Wipro Ltd to become India’s third largest IT company, said on Tuesday that the deal marks the renewal of the company’s engagement with Xerox, which had first awarded a 10-year contract in 2009. HCL Tech did not, however, disclose the financial details of the earlier contract.
“This expanded partnership is a testament to the strong Xerox-HCL relationship that has grown through multiple collaborations over the past 10 years,"" said C. Vijayakumar, chief executive officer of HCL Technologies.
Under the terms of the contract, HCL Tech will help Xerox in administrative and support functions, according to a statement released by the company.
As part of this contract, HCL will absorb some employees from Xerox.
HCL Tech’s latest deal win is the second mega deal win for the company in the last four years. It had bagged $1.6 billion, five-year contract, from Swedish auto maker Volvo AB in October 2015.
Significantly, HCL Tech’s contract with Xerox is the fifth multi-year mega deal won by Indian IT firms in the last 15 months. The other four contracts have brought in at least $7.2 billion in revenue.
In December 2017, India’s largest IT firm Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) signed a $2.25 billion, eight-year contract with Nielsen, a TV ratings measurement firm, and followed it up with an over $2 billion, 10-year contract with a unit of Dutch insurer Aegon NV in January 2018. Last June, TCS won a third mega deal worth $1.36 billion, for over 10 years, from a unit of British insurer Prudential Plc.
In September, Wipro won its largest contract, valued at $1.6 billion over 10 years from Alight Solutions Llc, the former benefits administration and HR outsourcing business of Aon Plc.
HCL Tech, which ended with $7.84 billion in revenue last year, expects at-best 9.9% dollar revenue growth in the current financial year, implying that it expects to end FY19 with $8.6 billion in revenue.
On Wednesday, HCL Tech shares rose 0.45% to  ₹1,039.25 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex ended the dayflat at 38,386.75 points.

113,2019-04-05,Wipro,"How a bunch of entrepreneurs built Mindtree over two decades but forgot to fence it against a hostile takeover by L&T

New Delhi: Late one Sunday evening in March this year, V.G. Siddhartha, who was in Mumbai, texted Mindtree Ltd’s executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan in Bengaluru about his decision to sell 20.3% shares the founder of the Café Coffee Day had held for close to two decades in the information technology (IT) outsourcing company to Larsen and Toubro Ltd (L&T). An agitated Natarajan, who knew that the company risked an ownership change, spoke to his friend and another co-founder Subroto Bagchi, who was in Bhubaneswar, more than 1,700km from Mumbai.
Three years ago, Bagchi had relinquished his role as executive chairman of the firm to devote time to his new calling as chairman of Odisha Skill Development Authority.
Though immersed in his new role, Bagchi hadn’t forgotten Mindtree. After all he, along with nine other friends, had set up the company on 18 August 1999.
“An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall,"" Bagchi tweeted at 8.37pm on 17 March.
An imminent threat of hostile takeover of Mindtree has made me to resign from the Government to be able to go, save the company. I must protect the Tree from people who have arrived with bulldozers & saw chains to cut it down so that in its place, they can build a shopping mall.
Seven minutes later, he tweeted again.
“Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset"" to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return.""
Mindtree has not been designed as an “asset to be bought & sold. It is a national resource. It has a unique culture that humanizes the idea of business. It sets the standards of corporate governance. I need to be there in its time of difficulty. Hence the hard decision to return
Over the next 48 hours, the three co-founders, including Natarajan, Bagchi and chief executive Rostow Ravanan, played the emotive card to express their unhappiness over what was India’s first hostile takeover bid in the IT services sector.
Not everyone was impressed. “Quite clearly, the bulldozer tweet and the decision to cast L&T as a villain is something the founders could have avoided. This is not how business leaders run,"" said an executive at a large IT firm, requesting anonymity.
But Natarajan, Bagchi and Co. aren’t cast in the same mould as other business leaders. To understand their present woes, one needs to go back to the beginning.
A brief history of the Tree
Fifteen years before the country was witness to the startup frenzy of 2014, Mindtree was set up by 10 friends, who came from Wipro Ltd, Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. and Lucent Technologies in 1999. Ashok Soota, who was then the vice-chairman of Wipro’s IT services business, had started discussions with Siddhartha, the firm’s first investor. After another two rounds of meetings, Soota was convinced, and told Azim Premji, Wipro’s charismatic chairman, about his decision to leave the company in February that year.
Over the next five-and-a-half months, a period which also witnessed the first dotcom boom in India, eight other co-founders joined Soota. Siddhartha and venture capital firm Walden Software put in about $8 million, while Soota and his eight friends came up with $1.4 million.
Finally, on the morning of 19 August, the nine co-founders, led by Soota, who was appointed as chairman and managing director, announced Mindtree to the world at a press conference in Bengaluru. A get together in the evening at Taj Residency was attended by over 100 guests, including Premji and Nandan Nilekani of Infosys Ltd.
S. Janakiraman, who was Wipro’s global head of research and development at the time and who would join in October as the 10th co-founder, was understandably missing from the party.
Mindtree, which raised $9.5 million, was valued at $40 million in 1999. The 10 co-founders, together, owned 75% of the new company while Siddhartha and Walden Software, which exited in 2012, owned the remaining 25% shares.
In 1999, Wipro’s IT services business was a tad over $100 million while Infosys had ended the financial year with $120 million in revenue. In 2001, Capital Group invested $10 million while an additional $4.4 million was put in by Franklin Templeton (Siddhartha got them into the company), Soota, Siddhartha and Walden. By now the firm’s valuation had jumped to $80 million. Six years later, Mindtree, after having raised over $24 million, went public in February 2007.
Mindtree, like many of the other IT vendors, deploys engineers to do software testing, manage IT infrastructure and write codes for applications that eventually help its clients, from Microsoft Corp. to Southwest Airlines Co. run their business. It wasn’t a unique proposition but investors still liked the IT story and its shares were subscribed 110 times.
Now, the company’s founders owned about 35.46%, a number that would progressively go down even as they focused on building a unique work culture incorporating some of the best practices from companies such as Infosys and Wipro.
Indeed, Mindtree’s two-decade journey is full of moments that can be the stuff of business school curriculums. One such instance shows how the firm won an account. A month after he had joined Mindtree as head of marketing, Joseph King arrived in Mindtree’s US office early one morning and made a direct call to Larry Kinder, the chief information officer (CIO) of Avis, the car rental firm.
“The IT business is all about relationships. So Joe came into the office early and called directly because he realized that was the only time he could connect with him as the receptionists would not have come in at that hour,"" Soota recounted in an interview.
Kinder took the call, liked the story, gave Mindtree executives an appointment and finally agreed to give them business, which over a three-year period became a $7 million account.
“I was employee no. 7 in the US and I joined Mindtree on 4 October 1999,"" said Joseph King, who now heads marketing and communications for Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) in the US. “I remember speaking to the Avis CIO in November 1999 and we started our engagement there in early 2000.""
However, the company also had its fair share of near-death experiences. The dotcom crash in 2000 was the first, followed quickly by the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. “The second round of funding, led by Capital Group, got closed in the first week of September 2001, days before 9/11,"" said Janakiraman. “Post 9/11, it was a different world and imagine what would have happened had there been any delay.""
The financial crisis in 2008 was another. The company’s failed move to make mobile handsets, after it paid $8 million to buy Kyocera Wireless’s India R&D unit in 2009, only to shelve it later, was yet another. This failed attempt was too big a setback for Soota, who was spearheading this move. He decided to leave the company in 2011 and subsequently sold his 11.6% shares to Siddhartha, whose ownership increased to 20.32%.
Finally, Mindtree’s long restructuring exercise, which saw the firm hire management consulting major Bain and Co. in 2013, was another phase when both growth and profitability took a hit.
But Mindtree steered through each of these setbacks. Four reasons essentially explain how Mindtree survived many of the challenges it faced.
During the dot-com crisis, when almost 198 of the 200 companies that were set up in 1999 crashed, Mindtree had enough money to steer through the stress. “We survived because we had taken a lot of money and we still had money when the dot-com crash happened,"" said Soota.
Second, the decision to include engineering business helped the firm diversify with an alternative revenue stream.
Third, during the dot-com crash and then again during the financial crisis of 2008, the senior management, led by the founders, agreed to take salary cuts. Salaries of senior management were cut by 20-25% while mid-level managers agreed to a 10% cut. Finally, there was the excellent rapport between the founding team and the key investors, the two VCs in Walden Software and Siddhartha.
Betrayal or Bailout
So when the crunch came in 2018, why did Siddhartha choose to sell his crucial 20.32% stake in Mindtree at  ₹980 a share to L&T, even though the founders had repeatedly expressed their reservations to him about India’s largest engineering and construction company which had in the past, too, made overtures for a stake sale? After all, just two weeks before L&T’s announcement on 18 March, another global private equity firm had agreed to buy the shares at  ₹975, in a deal that was acceptable to Mindtree founders.
Siddhartha was forced to sell his shares because of a sudden liquidity squeeze in the lending markets, triggered by defaults in payments by Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd in August. It led to his lenders calling in  ₹3,000 crore of loans given to him against his entire holding in Mindtree which had been pledged. 
With repayment deadlines fast approaching, he needed to monetize his holding in Mindtree at the earliest. However, none of the dozen-odd private equity firms, sovereign funds and long-term funds which were interested in buying his shares was okay with a complex deal. This was because for any sale to take place, the potential buyer needed to pay for the unpledging of the shares before buying them or at least agreeing to an arrangement wherein the shares stayed with the banks even while the transaction to sell them was underway. A deal just couldn’t happen as none of them was willing to pay unless the shares were transferred.
“They could have tried to get Infosys’s founders, including (N.R. Narayana) Murthy, (S.D.) Shibulal, and Krish (Senapathy Gopalakrishnan) to pick up some shares,"" said a former Infosys executive. “They would not have risked losing control of their firm. But the founders (Mindtree) thought nothing will happen to them.""
Natarajan does not comment on why the firm could not have got a friendly investor from an existing IT firm to buy Siddhartha’s shares, saying the founders did everything they could. It is also possible that at this moment of crisis, they missed Soota’s contacts and astuteness.
“Ashok was clearly the captain,"" said Janakiraman. “He was more like a father-figure to all of us and helped us stay sane as we sorted through each of the episodes.""
So did Mindtree miss Soota during this period? “Possibly,"" said Janakiraman.
“Absolutely not,"" Natarajan said, adding that the founders did everything possible to fend off the hostile takeover bid.

What is clear is that their inability to buy the shares of the five co-founders who exited the company over the years, in the process leaving the current founders with just 13.32%, cost them dearly—perhaps even their control over the company. Thus, when Soota exited in 2010, he sold his substantial 11.61% stake to Siddhartha. Ditto for Kalyan Banerjee and Anjan Lahiri, who together sold 2.06% in the open market.
Looking ahead
Even as Mindtree’s four independent directors evaluate the unsolicited offer by L&T, it appears a given that L&T will eventually get to own Mindtree.
L&T’s two listed technology firms, L&T Infotech Ltd and L&T Technology Services Ltd ended with $1.13 billion and $580.4 million in revenue, respectively, in the year ended March 2018. The company has said it intends to keep Mindtree, which ended with $846.8 million last year, separate for now. However, most analysts like JP Morgan Chase and Co. analyst Viju George expect parent L&T to combine the three entities once they, together, cross $5 billion in revenue. This will take at least three years, provided two of the three companies clock a 15% annual growth.
ALSO READ | A culture shock awaits Mindtree employees under L&T
Will combining the three firms be enough to compete against the large IT firms? Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) will end the current year with more than $20 billion in revenue while Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp., which follows January-December as the financial year, is expected to end with over $17 billion. Bengaluru-based Infosys will end with over $11 billion while HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro Ltd will end with more than $8 billion each.
Clearly, L&T’s consolidated IT business will still lack enough firepower to compete against the big boys of the industry. At best, it will be competing with Tech Mahindra Ltd, GlobalLogic and other mid-tier IT firms.
ALSO READ | Mindtree battle enters final decisive phase
The downside risk is in the cultural mismatch. Mindtree’s informal culture, where many employees call members of the founding team by their first names is in contrast with command-and-control and top-down management at L&T.
For now, Mindtree founders don’t have many options other than to delay the inevitable and negotiate for a smooth transition. Management guru Peter Drucker best described it as: “Many problems cannot be solved; they have to be survived."" Ironically, Bagchi often recounted this to employees in the past when the company was faced with challenging times."
112,2019-04-05,Wipro,"Custodian of Enemy Property for India offloaded more than 4.43 crore shares of the companyThe proceeds would add to the government's disinvestment kitty

New Delhi: The government has sold enemy shares worth around  ₹1,150 crore in IT major Wipro to Life Insurance Corporation and two other state-owned insurers.
The Custodian of Enemy Property for India offloaded more than 4.43 crore shares of the company at a price of  ₹258.90 apiece, according to block deal data available with stock exchange BSE.
Apart from Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), General Insurance Corporation and The New India Assurance Corporation have bought the shares.
At the price of  ₹258.90 per share, the the total value of the stocks sold amounts to nearly  ₹1,150 crore, as per the data that was available on the exchange on Thursday.
The proceeds would add to the government's disinvestment kitty.
More than 3.86 crore enemy shares were purchased by LIC.
Generally, enemy property refers to the assets left behind by people who migrated to Pakistan or China and are no longer citizens of India.
The Custodian of Enemy Property for India is an entity of the central government which looks after enemy property and shares.
Last November, the government approved a mechanism for sale of enemy shares in companies.
The sale would help in monetisation of movable enemy property lying dormant for decades and the proceeds would be used for development and social welfare programmes, an official statement had said in November 2018.
According to Enemy Property Act, 1968, ""enemy property"" refers to any property belonging to, held or managed on behalf of an enemy, an enemy subject or an enemy firm.
""Sale proceeds are to be deposited as disinvestment proceeds in the government account maintained by the Ministry of Finance,"" the statement had said.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management has been authorised to sell the shares.The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet, will lead to monetisation of movable enemy property lying dormant for decades and the proceeds will be used for development and social welfare programmes, an official statement said.

111,2019-04-06,Wipro,"Azim Premji would not ask his team to do anything that he himself would not do

The more I learn about Azim Premji, the more I admire him. Over the past 39 years, I have had the chance to see multiple layers in him unfold one by one. Simplicity is an integral part of his DNA that has remained unchanged from the first day I saw him. His fondness for street food illustrates his preference for functionality over ornamentation. During our roadshow for the New York Stock Exchange listing in 2000, he had no second thoughts about stopping at a street stall in Singapore to have crabs, or, in Mumbai, asking for vada pav when he was asked for his lunch preference at the Morgan Stanley office. Premji is the embodiment of simple living and high thinking.
Over the years, as he grew Wipro’s business from a team of a few hundreds to tens of thousands and lakhs, his work style epitomized his respect for people. He would not ask his team to do anything that he himself would not do. As the then chief financial officer, I saw how diligently he prepared for meetings at close quarters. Once, when we were staying together in his house at Mumbai, at 10pm, he handed over a heavy box file of background papers that he was studying for the meeting the following day. As I took it, he asked me to return it to him at 5 the next morning as he wanted to look at it once more before the meeting. Up before sunrise each day and working till midnight on most days, he set an example for his team to follow. A keen listener who asked insightful questions, he never directed or instructed his team, a manifestation of his deep respect for people.
Premji is not easily influenced by external opinions, irrespective of how loud, frequent, or popular it is. From the time he took over Wipro in the 1960s, he would buy Wipro shares with the Wipro dividend he received every year, until the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s regulation stopped him from doing so in the 1990s. His conviction in Wipro was too strong to even contemplate diversifying his portfolio. A man of deep conviction, Premji does what he believes in. We can see this same conviction when he turned his attention to philanthropy.
Premji is not just a man with a good heart, but a successful businessman engaging in philanthropy. After a year of research, he zeroed in on the idea that if you give a man a fish, you feed him for an hour, but if you teach him fishing, you feed him for a lifetime. This led him to focus on education, more specifically, primary education. To ensure that there is no duplication, he has focused on improving government schools, institutions that touch the largest number of children but will not have his name inscribed in any of them.
In 21st century India, where aspirations run high, role models play a key role in how society evolves. Not just Premji, but his entire family—his wife Yasmeen, children Rishad and Tariq, and daughter-in-law Aditi—need to be admired for this decision. It’s a family epitomizing simple living and high thinking. Premji is not just a role model, but a purushottam, a model human being, worthy of emulation.
Suresh Senapaty is former CFO, Wipro Ltd."
110,2019-04-06,Wipro,"Azim Premji Foundation was able to dream of a long-term vision of change because the Wipro founder enabled it to do so

It all began with a simple idea, with Azim Premji exploring the option of starting a liberal arts school in 1997. The seed has now grown into a big tree of around 2,000 people, and has field presence in 50 districts across six Indian states and a university dedicated to education and development domains.
When we discussed the idea, I realized, deep down, that Premji had a big discomfort with the state of affairs in our society. Somewhere he felt that “a different education"" was the solution. The restlessness in him was about the serious inequity in our society. There were several triggers: the windfall benefits that a small proportion of IT employees was receiving through stock options, the opulent style of living that the TV soaps were depicting through their serials, and no signs of change in living conditions of the vast population.
On Premji’s advice, I prepared a white paper on philanthropy, listing down several problems that the country faced and recommending areas where he could contribute through his foundation. Before preparing the white paper, knowing his non-emotional nature, it was important for me to understand the driving spirit behind his thinking. So, I asked him a question: “When your car stops at the signal and a seven-year-old stands outside the window with a three-year-old baby in her arms, does your heart go out for that girl?"" His response was very honest. He said: “My heart may not go out for the girl, but that does not, in any manner, reduce the intensity of what I want to do for our society!""
After many internal and external discussions, from among many alternatives, we chose education as the domain to work in. Premji was convinced that education was the only fundamental and non-violent way to bring about lasting social change. Even within the education domain, his thought was to begin with primary education. His logic was clear: “You must wear the undergarment before wearing the shirt.""
After the establishment of Azim Premji Foundation and after it was decided that I would lead the foundation as its founding chief executive officer (CEO), Premji introduced me to Jack Welch, the legendary CEO of General Electric, during a dinner hosted at Premji’s residence. “He is my CEO for the foundation. I am very passionate about the foundation and am willing to commit half my wealth to it,"" he told Welch. This was in 2001.
We were able to dream of a massive, long-term vision of social and educational change across the nation, only because Premji enabled us to do so. Funds were never a constraint for the Azim Premji Foundation. Recruiting competent talent has been the key constraint, especially since our nation never invested in developing talent with deep understanding of society and education.
Most people would not be able to understand what it takes for a “businessman"", who is used to measuring results each quarter, to appreciate and accept the inordinately long cycle time for social and educational change.
Dileep Ranjekar is CEO, Azim Premji Foundation."
109,2019-04-09,Wipro,"Companies in the IT and banking sectors are expected to report decent numbersConsumption slowdown, especially in rural India, may weigh on automobile and FMCG earnings

Corporate earnings have been a constant source of disappointment for many quarters now. However, the tide seems to be turning. Bloomberg’s one-year forward consensus estimates for the Nifty’s earnings per share (EPS) are heading north (see chart).
The optimism is driven by the improving health of banks and expanding liquidity conditions. However, the ongoing consumption slowdown and subdued global growth cannot be ignored. In such a scenario, apart from the revenue and profit figures, investors should focus on cues about whether these estimates will sustain.
Automobiles: Tepid demand leading to high inventories can hit the earnings of auto companies. A watch on the demand outlook is, thus, essential. Investors will want to know the production strategies given that BS VI emission norms will be implemented from 1 April 2020. Concerns related to Brexit continue to haunt Tata Motors. Hence, investors would want to keep a watch on the commentary on Jaguar Land Rover.
Aviation: Financial woes at Jet Airways (India) Ltd pushed up airfares for metro routes during the quarter. IndiGo (InterGlobe Aviation Ltd) and SpiceJet Ltd are expected to gain. However, higher yields can be counter-balanced by a decline in the passenger load factor. In February, domestic passenger growth registered its slowest monthly gain in over five years.
Banks, NBFCs: Public sector banks’ recapitalization ratios will be watched. Commentary on unrecognized stresses in corporate loans, and the pace of bad loan resolution through the insolvency framework are crucial. Market share gain for banks from NBFCs is another important indicator. For NBFCs, the key parameters are asset-liability management, the liquidity outlook and the cost of funds.
Cement: March is a strong quarter for the sector. However, government-driven demand could have been impacted by the forthcoming general election. Choppy price trends make commentary on overall pricing important. As input costs ease, the outlook on margins is key. 
FMCG: Commentary on volume growth of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms is crucial after worries of a consumption slowdown have surfaced. Easing input costs make the outlook regarding margin growth important. Investors will be keen to know if ad spend will be trimmed.
Information technology: Usually, the March quarter is weak for the IT sector as customers are into their budgeting term. This time, however, the execution of recently-won deals would aid performance. Revenue guidance for fiscal year 2020 along with deal pipeline will be closely watched. Also, the outlook on the banking and financial services vertical, considering weak global macro conditions, is important. The impact of new stringent US H-1B visa norms on sub-contracting costs and hiring plans too will be crucial.
Real estate: Investors will want to know how the transition to new accounting standards and the new goods and services tax regime have impacted the sector. Buyers may have delayed purchases because of the latter. Launch pipelines and inventory data should be watched. Other vital cues will come from real estate pricing strategies and how debt levels are moving."

Corporate earnings for the March quarter and elections are expected to be key drivers of equity markets in this truncated week. Indian markets are shut for trading on Wednesday and Friday. Most analysts expect volatility in the markets is likely to continue till general elections are over.
Jimeet Modi, Founder and CEO, SAMCO Securities & StockNote, said the current corrective phase in the markets has just begun and it may last till the middle of May, however, the undertone of the market will not be weak. ""The amount of price correction would be difficult to estimate but the markets will take their own time till May to correct. The markets are witnessing a whipsaw phase where neither the bulls nor the bears could make headway during the week. This is typically a corrective phase which the markets are undergoing after witnessing a strong rally. Statistically, similar such corrections in the past have taken around a month’s time.""
As India is set to see a new government post elections, analysts and investors will be keenly watching out for commentary and guidance by companies, which are expected to be indicative of economic and business growth. The surge in crude oil prices in the January-March period is expected to further delay a recovery in corporate earnings.
While private banks, cement and utilities, which have been a drag on earnings, are likely to post good numbers, the performance of former champions such as metals, auto, retail, and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) is likely to moderate in Q4FY19, Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a 5 April note.
Major companies that will declare Q4 earnings this week are Reliance Industries, Wipro, HDFC Bank, RBL Bank, Mindtree and ICICI Lombard General Insurance.
This week investors are likely to react to TCS and Infosys stocks as the IT majors announced their March quarter earnings after market hours on Friday. Infosys reported a mixed bag in Q4FY19, with margins below expectations even as revenue was in-line. For the full year FY19, Infosys has posted 9% revenue growth in constant currency terms versus a guidance of 8.5- 9% and EBIT margin of 22.8% versus guidance of 22-24%. It has provided 7.5-9.5% growth guidance and has lowered its margin guidance by 100 basis points (bps) to 21-23% for FY20 – both lower than the street’s expectations. Analysts believe that lower-than-expected growth and margin guidance may lead to a cut in street’s earnings estimates.
“We believe Infosys is being conservative in terms of its revenue guidance for FY19, given that YoY constant currency growth was 11.7% in Q4FY19, with robust order wins also reflecting underlying revenue strength,"" Reliance Securities Ltd said.
TCS ended FY19 with full-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth of 11.4% YoY, EBIT margin of 25.6% and net income growth of 22.5% YoY.
Meanwhile, in the primary markets diagnostics chain Metropolis Healthcare Ltd will make its stock market debut on Monday.

Software services exporter Wipro Ltd today reported a 38% rise in fourth-quarter profit, helped by a strong performance from its banking, financial services and insurance segment. Wipro's net profit rose to  ₹2,484 crore in the three months to March 31, from  ₹1,803 crore in the same period a year earlier. Revenue from its mainstay IT services business grew 11.1%, driving the Bengaluru-based company's total revenue to  ₹15,038 crore  ₹13,824 crore last year.

Wipro also announced  ₹10,500 crore share buyback at a price of  ₹325, joining the growing ranks of IT firms returning surplus cash to their shareholders. Wipro's shares today closed 2.5% lower at  ₹281, ahead of the earnings announcement.
Cash-rich Indian IT companies have been returning cash in their books to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. In 2017, Wipro had carried out an  ₹11,000 crore share buyback programme. Share buybacks improve earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders while also supporting share price during periods of sluggish market conditions.
Infosys had earlier this year approved an  ₹8,260-crore share buyback. TCS, India’s biggest IT services exporter, had also carried out a  ₹16,000 crore share buyback last year.
Outlook for the quarter ending June 30, 2019
Wipro expects revenue from its IT services business to be in the range of $2,046 million to $2,087 million. ""This translates into a sequential growth of -1.0% to 1.0% excluding the impact of the divestment of our Workday and Cornerstone On Demand business which was concluded in the quarter ended March 31, 2019,"" the company said.

104,2019-04-16,Wipro,"Almost three in four banks in Asia Pacific anticipate that fraud in their country will increase in 2019, said a new report by FICOCybersecurity continues to be a major issue in India with 76.3% of organizations hit by cyber attacks in the last year, a global survey from security firm Sophos corroborated

Bengaluru/New Delhi: On Tuesday, Indian IT service company Wipro Ltd. confirmed reports about a phishing attack on its IT systems even as it hired an independent forensic firm to assist with the investigation. The breach was first reported by cybersecurity portal, KrebsOnSecurity, after it was brought to their attention by two sources on the condition of anonymity.
Only a day earlier, a researcher John Page revealed that hackers can use an unpatched exploit in Internet Explorer (IE) to both spy on Windows users and steal their local data . In fact, email accounts across Microsoft’s Outlook, Hotmail and MSN services were left vulnerable for almost three months (1 January to 28 March) even as Microsoft said that only a “limited"" number of people had their accounts compromised in the breach.
Wipro and Microsoft are only cases in point. The world over, individuals, companies and governments are being increasingly targeted as we get more digital with a rise in smartphones and more connected devices underscoring the internet of things (IoT) trend. India is no exception cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in India with 76% organizations hit by online attacks in the last year, as compared to 68% incidents across the globe, according to a global survey from security firm Sophos early last month.
The survey added that 97% IT managers admitted that security expertise is one of the greatest issues in India, and while 92% Indian IT managers wish they had a stronger team in place to properly detect, investigate and respond to security incidents, 89% believe cyber security recruitment is a challenge.
Almost three in four banks in Asia Pacific anticipate that fraud in their country will increase in 2019, said a new report by FICO on Tuesday. Of specific concern are transactions completed when neither the card nor the cardholder is physically present (card-not-present or CNP fraud), as well as cards taken out by criminals under false identities (application fraud), the report added.
Cybersecurity continues to be a major issue in India with 76.3% of organizations hit by cyber attacks in the last year, as compared to 68% organizations hit across the globe, a global survey from security firm Sophos corroborated. The report found that on an average, Indian organizations that investigate one or more potential security incidents each month spend 48 days a year (four days a month) investigating them.
On 13 March, security firm Seqrite--the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies--said that in the second half of 2018, it detected close to 50 million threats targeting enterprises. This translates to around 186 detections every minute. These detections included known and unknown threats such as cryptojacking, ransomware, trojans, exploits, worms, infectors, potentially unwanted applications (PUAs), and adware. Further, commercial spyware programs called 'Stalkerware' are background-running apps installed on phones, which can be used to monitor and track device activity.
Newer threats become more prominent, as older threats evolve. Researchers at Seqrite detected more than 15,000 cryptojacking hits a day on average, totalling to more than 2.76 million detections. Further, with more than 2,000 detections on a daily basis, ransomware remained one of the most persistent threats deployed by cybercriminals.
The IT/ITeS industry was highlighted as the most targeted sector in the 'Seqrite Threat Report H2 2018', accounting for 27.83% of the total malware detections. Professional services followed close on its heels with a detection share of 24.43%, while manufacturing (17.70%) and education (11.08%) were also identified as at-risk industries.
Malware authors, according to the report, will leverage generic loopholes in data-intensive sectors such as healthcare, BFSI, and cloud services to sell well-organized APT attack vectors to prospective threat actors. There is also the possibility of advanced persistent threats (APTs) being deployed against specific nation-states, large organizations, government agencies, law enforcement systems, etc., the report concluded.
To be sure, it's not that companies are ignoring the issue. While Wipro has hired an independentn 13 March, Infosys said it plans to open a new Cyber Defence Center in Bucharest ""this summer"". The Center will provide cybersecurity services to help European and global clients progress on their digital transformation journey. Services include cyber forensics, ethical hacking, security analytics, threat detection and response.
Healthcare companies are another major concern area. Through new software, companies have developed voice tools capable of handling patient information covered under the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
According to Adam Levin, Founder of CyberScout and author of ""Swiped"", ""Alexa is now making house calls and a treasure trove of medical data is being stored by this virtual assistant with major privacy and security implications. PHI or Protected Healthcare Information is a prime target for hackers who can use the data in a host of identity theft schemes or sell it on the dark web. There have already been reports of Alexa going rogue and recording private conversations and then sharing that information with contacts. What if the device shared confidential medical data?"" These new technical advances may make our lives easier, acknowledges Levin but cautions that as we see a greater pivot to privacy with GDPR and the fact that breaches have become third certainty in life, ""convenience should never trump consumer privacy and security"".
As cybercriminals employ automation and machine learning to propagate attacks, security organizations need to do the same to combat these advanced methods, experts suggest.
“While detection and response are integral components of cybersecurity defense, the current model of disjointed standalone products leaves organizations with blind spots and conflicting data,"" said Lee Klarich, chief product officer at Palo Alto Networks. He concluded, “We believe the only way to solve this is with best-in-class prevention, combined with the ability to normalize and analyze data at scale from as many sources as possible, applying AI and machine learning to automatically detect and quickly respond to threats."""

The Bengaluru-based company was responding to a Reuters query after cyber security blog KrebsOnSecurity said Wipro's systems had been breached and were being used to launch attacks against some of its clients.
KrebsOnSecurity, citing anonymous sources, said Wipro's systems were being used to target at least a dozen customer systems.
""We detected a potentially abnormal activity in a few employee accounts on our network due to an advanced phishing campaign,"" Wipro said in an emailed statement.
The company also said it had retained an independent forensic firm to assist in the investigation. Wipro did not say which clients, if any, had been compromised.
Wipro is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results later in the day. Larger rivals Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd kicked off the Indian corporate results season on Friday, saying they expect continued strong growth in the new financial year after posting strong fourth-quarter numbers.

105,2019-04-17,Wipro,"Wipro says hired an independent forensic firm to assist with the investigation into the hacking, without giving out any detailsThe Wipro data breach was first reported by cybersecurity portal KrebsOnSecurity

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd’s admission on Tuesday that it is investigating a phishing attack on its computer systems is the latest high-profile cyber attack on a big technology firm. It won’t be the last.
The software services company confirmed a report by KrebsOnSecurity on the attack and said it has hired an independent forensics firm to assist with the investigation. The report had said attackers had used Wipro’s employee accounts to target its customers over several months.
“We identified and isolated those employee accounts, and already took remedies; we have also shared intelligence with partners for preventing such incidents. We also informed a handful of our customers, as a standard practice,"" a Wipro spokesperson said. “We will continue to monitor our infrastructure.""
A day earlier, security researcher John Page had shown that hackers can use an unpatched exploit in the Internet Explorer browser to both spy on Windows users and steal data from their computers. In fact, email accounts across Microsoft’s Outlook, Hotmail and MSN services remained vulnerable for almost three months from 1 January to 28 March, even as Microsoft said that only a “limited"" number of people had their accounts compromised in the breach.
As the world gets increasingly online, individuals, companies and governments are becoming hot targets for hackers. Wipro and Microsoft are simply cases in point.
In India alone, 76% organizations were hit by online attacks in the last year, compared to 68% across the globe, according to a survey by security firm Sophos released early last month. The survey added that 97% of IT managers admitted that security expertise is one of the greatest issues in India. It also found that, on an average, Indian organizations that investigate one or more potential security incidents each month spend 48 days a year (four days a month) investigating them.
The Wipro spokesperson said that the company received 4.8 million alerts from its cybersecurity team on potential breaches in its systems in the last fiscal year.
On 13 March, security firm Seqrite, the enterprise arm of Quick Heal Technologies, said it detected close to 50 million threats targeting enterprises in the second half of 2018. This translates to around 186 detections every minute. These detections included known and unknown threats such as crypto-jacking, ransomware, trojans, exploits, worms, infectors, potentially unwanted applications and ad-ware. Further, commercial spyware programmes called stalkerware run in the background on phones; these can be used to monitor and track device activity.
Seqrite researchers identified the IT/ITeS (IT-enabled services) industry as the most targeted sector, accounting for 27.8% of all malware detections. The professional services sector was second with a detection share of 24.4%, while manufacturing (17.7%) and education (11.1%) were also identified as at-risk industries.
Malware creators, according to the report, can leverage loopholes in data-intensive sectors such as healthcare, financial services and cloud services. There’s also the possibility of advanced persistent threats being deployed against specific nation-states, large organizations, government agencies and law enforcement systems, the report concluded.
To be sure, it’s not that companies are ignoring the issue. While Wipro has hired an independent forensics firm to investigate the reported breach, Infosys has said it is planning to open a cyber defence centre in Bucharest “this summer"".
Newer threats, meanwhile, continue to emerge. Seqrite researchers detected more than 15,000 crypto-jacking hits a day on an average, totalling over 2.76 million detections. In crypto-jacking, hackers use compromised computers to mine cryptocurrency. Further, with more than 2,000 detections on a daily basis, ransomware—used by hackers to block a victim’s access to accounts in exchange for payment—remained one of the most persistent threats deployed by cybercriminals.
Healthcare companies are major concern. Through new software, companies have developed voice tools capable of handling patient information covered under the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
Adam Levin, founder of cybersecurity firm CyberScout and author of Swiped, said in a 10 April press release: “Alexa is now making house calls and a treasure trove of medical data is being stored by this virtual assistant with major privacy and security implications. PHI or protected healthcare information is a prime target for hackers who can use the data in a host of identity theft schemes or sell it on the dark web. There have already been reports of Alexa going rogue and recording private conversations and then sharing that information with contacts. What if the device shared confidential medical data?""
These new technical advances may make our lives easier, acknowledges Levin, but cautions that as we see a greater pivot to privacy with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and the fact that breaches have become a certainty, “convenience should never trump consumer privacy and security"".
As cybercriminals employ automation and machine learning to propagate attacks, security organizations need to do the same to combat these advanced methods, say experts.

101,2019-04-17,Wipro,"Wipro’s revenue growth in Q4 has slowed after just two quarters of acceleration even as TCS and Infosys surged aheadWipro’s guidance of a -1% to 1% revenue growth on a sequential basis in Q1 FY20 provides limited confidence

Mumbai: Just when it was thought Wipro Ltd had recovered from its growth problems, its March quarter (Q4) results have once again raised uncomfortable questions about revenue growth.
Revenue growth slowed just two quarters after acceleration. The sequential constant currency revenue growth stood at just 1% in Q4. In the previous two quarters it grew in the range of 2-3%. This is in contrast to the revenue acceleration theme investors are banking on.
Year-on-year growth rate declined marginally last quarter, unlike its peers, where growth rates had increased last quarter. As was the case with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, Wipro said it is seeing strong deal momentum and has a healthy pipeline, which should help it deliver better FY20 than FY19. However, mere 5.4% growth in FY19 means the bar is not high. TCS and Infosys clocked 11.4% and 9% growth, respectively, in FY19.
Worse, Wipro’s guidance of a -1% to 1% revenue growth on a sequential basis in the June quarter provides limited confidence. The guidance of revenue contraction in a worst-case scenario goes against the strong deal momentum commentary.
According to the management, some large projects it has won require time to ramp-up. Besides, the healthcare and manufacturing business verticals, which generate a fifth of Wipro’s revenue, are struggling for growth and are impacting overall growth rates.
The management says it is focusing on earnings accretive business and is selectively participating in traditional contracts. This is leading to better quality earnings reflective in margin improvement (FY19 vs FY18) and cash flow generation. But as one analyst with a domestic broking house points out, the margin improvement is coming on a lower base vis-à-vis larger peers TCS and Infosys. And, in any case, the depreciation in the rupee has aided profitability for most IT firms in FY19.
In any case, margin improvement can only take earnings so far. Ultimately, revenue needs to grow at decent rates for investors to be impressed. Wipro’s key business verticals show uneven recovery, with growth largely being driven by the banking financial services and consumer business units. Three business verticals—healthcare, manufacturing, technology—saw a year- on-year fall in revenues in constant currency terms last quarter.
At 16 times estimated FY20 earnings, Wipro is trading at a discount to TCS and Infosys’s price-earnings multiple of 22 times and 19 times, respectively, reflecting subdued expectations on the Street. The widening gap in revenue growth rates may further deepen the valuation discount. And as if this wasn’t enough, Wipro has also reported issues related to cybersecurity. If the matter isn’t contained quickly enough to the satisfaction of clients, it may well have the potential to derail growth further."
102,2019-04-17,Wipro,"Wipro gave a disappointing revenue outlook of -1% to 1.0% for the first quarter of FY20Wipro’s net profit, in dollar terms, fell to $359.1 mn in Q4 from $366 mn at the end of Q3

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd posted better-than-expected revenue growth for the fiscal fourth-quarter but offered a disappointing revenue growth outlook of -1% to 1.0% for the June quarter.
Wipro, India’s fourth largest IT services company by revenue, also announced a bonus of one free share for every three shares held by shareholders. The Wipro board also approved a  ₹10,500 crore buyback plan under which it will acquire up to 323 million shares at  ₹325 apiece.
Wipro’s dollar revenue improved 9% year-on-year (y-o-y) to $2.2 billion in the quarter ended 31 March. Revenue grew 7% on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
A Bloomberg survey of 31 analysts had forecast revenue of $2.18 billion, or  ₹15,069.40 crore, in the March quarter. They also forecast a profit of $359.31 million, or  ₹2,489.20 crore.
In dollar terms, Wipro’s net profit declined to $359.1 million in the fourth quarter from $366 million at the end of the third quarter. Consequently, the company’s operating margin fell to 19% in Q4 from 19.8% in Q3. In constant currency terms, Wipro managed a 7.5% y-o-y growth in Q4 revenue although it fell 1% sequentially.
“Our rigour in execution and focus on improved quality of revenues has resulted in operating margins expansion of 1.8% for the year (in constant currency). The announcement to buy back equity shares is part of our philosophy to deliver efficient returns to shareholders,"" said Jatin Dalal, senior vice-president and chief financial officer at Wipro.
In rupee terms, Wipro’s revenue for the fourth quarter of FY19 rose to  ₹15,000.63 crore, from  ₹13,768.86 crore a year earlier. Revenue in the last financial year grew 7.5% to  ₹58,584.5 crore from  ₹54,487.1 crore.
Wipro’s net profit in rupee terms jumped 38% to  ₹2,483.3 crore for the fourth quarter from  ₹1,802.8 crore a year earlier. For the full year ended 31 March, net profit increased 12% to  ₹9,003.1 crore.
Wipro’s revenue from clients in banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI), comprised 31.5% of overall revenue, compared to 28.7% in the same period a year earlier, in constant currency terms. US and Europe accounted for majority of the revenues in Q4.
Sanjoy Sen, senior research fellow—strategy and governance, Loughborough University, UK, said the fourth quarter results “continue the positive note of this quarterly season following TCS and Infosys"".
“This is hardly a coincidence. On the contrary, this is the dividend from the long investments made in acquiring capabilities to address the digitally disruptive world that their clients operate in. It is just that these digital transformation initiatives at their clients are at a peak, with the added realisation that the scarce resource to deliver resides in Indian IT companies. However, organizations such as Wipro must keep up their focus on operational excellence and cost management to ensure that the top line growth hits the bottom line and is not eroded away by increasing global and domestic costs,"" Sen said.
The results were declared after market hours. On Tuesday, Wipro lost 2.45% to close at  ₹281.1 apiece underperforming a 0.95% gain in the benchmark Sensex which closed at 39,275.64 points. The BSE IT Index gained 0.05% to 15,590.77 points.
Wipro’s buyback programme is its second in about 15 months and the third since 2016. It had undertaken a  ₹2,500 crore programme in 2016, and another  ₹11,000 crore buyback offer in November-December 2017.
The buyback was proposed to be made from the existing shareholders of the company through a tender offer route in accordance with the provisions, Wipro chief executive officer and executive director Abidali Neemuchwala said."

        The board of IT major Wipro on Tuesday approved a  ₹10,500 crore share buyback programme, its third in four years. In 2017, Wipro had undertaken a  ₹11,000 crore buyback and in 2016, a  ₹2,500 crore programme. A share buyback is a process through which a company purchases equity from its shareholders, usually at a price near to or higher than the prevailing market price. When a company buys back equity, it reduces its outstanding shares in the market.
Here are 5 things to know about Wipro’s latest buyback offer:
Under the buyback, Wipro proposes to buy up to 32.30 crore shares for an aggregate amount not exceeding  ₹10,500 crore, at a price of  ₹325. This constitutes 5.35% of the total paid-up equity share capital of the company

Analysts say that the share buyback programme will provide a cushion to the stock price. “Wipro has cash of  ₹32,900 crore as on FY19. Buyback will provide a cushion to stock price in near term. However due to muted revenue growth as compared to peers, Wipro will remain an underperformer,” domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a note. The brokerage has a “Hold” recommendation on the stock. Another brokerage Reliance Securities has a ""Hold"" on Wipro with a target price of  ₹300. ""Owing to the buyback, EPS (earnings per share) will rise by 5% while RoE (return on equity) will rise by 150bps in FY20E.

99,2019-04-19,Wipro,"Brands such as Swiggy and KFC are running campaigns to remind young voters to exercise their voting rightsWhile digital dominates the poll awareness narrative, firms such as Wipro are making a big splash on conventional ad mediums

New Delhi: With the poll season in full swing, brands are being socially responsible and creating campaigns around the importance of voting.
A campaign by luggage brand Samsonite, which has got more than two million views on YouTube, features a young man visiting his hometown Dehradun albeit for a day. As he drives through the familiar roads and reconnects with old friends, he seems in a hurry to reach somewhere. The camera zooms onto a polling booth to show that he’s gone home just to cast his vote.
The viral Ek din ki chutti (one-day leave) campaign, subtly delivers the message to millions of young Indians to take a day off and go home to vote.
“The Samsonite campaign is a smart example of bringing a social message and product together but there are multiple brand categories that will not work like that,"" said Naresh Gupta, strategy head and managing partner at advertising agency Bang In The Middle.
A clutch of brands such as DB Corp. Ltd-owned radio brand 94.3 My FM, food delivery startup Swiggy, movie ticket booking platform BookMyShow, and KFC India are running various campaigns to remind young voters to exercise their voting rights.
“Brands need to be part of the cultural narrative and they need to have a point of view on what’s happening in the country. Creating such campaigns makes a brand sensitive, responsible, and relevant in people’s lives,"" said Dheeraj Sinha, the India managing director and chief strategy officer of Leo Burnett, South Asia.
A majority of election awareness campaigns are digital and GIFs and microsites, long- and short-form videos, in particular, have emerged as the go-to choice for brands. Flipkart is running the “Equals Day"" video featuring citizens across ages, regions, and economic backgrounds finding a common thread in the form of the right to vote. Automotive lubricant brand Castrol Activ is urging young riders to ensure they drive one voter as a pillion rider to the polling booth this election in a digital video campaign.
“Digital lends itself beautifully to any long- or short-format videos which most of the current elections campaigns are made of. Facebook and YouTube continue to be the two most leveraged platforms because they offer the highest reach but this election we have seen brands leveraging over-the-top (OTT) platforms such as Hotstar to capture the attention of millennials as well,"" said Gopa Kumar, chief operating officer, Isobar, a Dentsu Aegis Network-owned digital agency. Companies such as Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting are, however, making a big splash on conventional advertising mediums. Santoor, a beauty brand from the company’s stable, is running a 360-degree campaign, Young dikho, Young socho on television, print, and digital to motivate first-time voters to be responsible and cast their vote.
“This campaign aims to educate the youth on this relevant and important issue. This will also help Santoor connect better with our consumers. Casting votes is an important activity in a democracy. We felt through Santoor we should motivate youth and first-time voters to cast their vote and fulfil their duty,"" said Anil Chugh, president, consumer care business, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting."

NEW DELHI :
Wipro Ltd on Friday said that the recently reported cyber attack on few of its employee accounts have had no impact on the company's “ongoing critical business.""
In a filing to the exchanges, the IT services major said that upon learning of the attack it initiated standard operating procedure and investigated the incident, identified and isolated the employee accounts which were impacted, took remedial steps to contain the incident and mitigate any potential effects of the incident.
“The company also informed the handful of customers where the affected employees are engaged,"" Wipro said.
It said that used its industry leading cyber security practices and partner ecosystem for remedial steps and shared this intelligence with its partners to develop the AntiVirus signatures.
“The same has been applied to our enterprise systems. We are collaborating with our partner ecosystem to collect and monitor advanced threat intelligence for enhancing our security posture. We continue to monitor our enterprise infrastructure at heightened level of alertness operations,"" it said.

97,2019-04-24,Wipro,"Out of the 36 companies that made share buyback offers since April 2018, just about a third have seen a full acceptance ratioNine of the 33 share buybacks where returns were calculated likely lost money for participating shareholders

Mumbai: Investors looking to make a quick buck through share buybacks will have to watch for a few telltale signs. Since April 2018, Indian companies have bought back shares worth  ₹47,696 crore. Besides, last week, Wipro Ltd announced a  ₹10,500 crore buyback.
Share buyback prices are typically higher than market prices when announcements are made. This arbitrage opportunity is driving investors to purchase these stocks in the market and tender them in buyback offers. More so because the market regulator has prescribed a minimal allocation in buybacks to small shareholders.
But shareholders looking to gain from the arbitrage opportunity may not be making money in all buybacks. An analysis by HDFC Securities Ltd shows that nine of the 33 share buybacks where returns were calculated likely lost money for participating shareholders. The losses ranged from -0.2% to -38.5% on an absolute basis.
So what can go wrong with a share buyback? Two important factors influence shareholder returns in share buybacks. Typically, the first and most important is the acceptance ratio. The acceptance ratio is the number of shares that are finally accepted as a percentage of the total that are tendered back to the company.
HDFC Securities research shows that since April 2018, just about 12 in 36 companies accepted 100% of the shares tendered back in an open offer. This is for the companies where the acceptance ratio is available. About 14 companies accepted up to 50% (see chart).
If the acceptance ratio is not 100%, investors looking for quick gains in the market may have to sell the remaining shares in the market at a lower price. This hits investor returns. Typically, shares fall post the completion of a buyback.
Hence, more often investor returns depends on the acceptance ratio. “Once a company announces a buyback, investors buy shares in anticipation of tendering in the offer and making money on the arbitrage available. If a large number of people participate, this tends to reduce the acceptance ratio and the expected returns,"" says Deepak Jasani, head of retail research at HDFC Securities.
Besides, in larger buybacks, the acceptance ratio can be higher. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd’s  ₹16,000 crore buyback last year saw a 100% acceptance ratio.
“If the buyback size is large and where the number of shareholders are low, there is a possibility of a better acceptance ratio and decent returns,"" adds Jasani.
Of course, the final acceptance ratio cannot be known in advance, only after the buyback exercise is over.
But one thing is for certain: if the acceptance ratio is less than 100%, investors who bought in the market may have to sell at a lower rate in the market. And that could lower returns or even result in losses."

Bengaluru: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting on Monday said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Splash Corp., Philippines’s largest personal care company. Splash, which clocked $80 million revenue last year, owns brands including SkinWhite, Maxi-peel and Vitress.
The transaction strengthens Wipro’s consumer care portfolio in personal care and strengthens its South-East Asian market footprint. The transaction value was not disclosed.
“This acquisition enables us to grow Wipro brands in the Philippines market by leveraging Splash’s distribution strength across market segments. Splash’s brands can be expanded further to other international markets where Wipro has a strong footprint and brands have latent equity. Splash brands are not only strong in the Philippines, but also have tremendous equity in multiple international markets such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Hong Kong, the Middle East and Nigeria,"" Nagender Arya, regional director (East Asia, Africa and Europe), Wipro Consumer Care, said in a statement.
This is Wipro’s 11th consumer business acquisition, and the ninth in the personal care segment. The company has made five acquisitions in the Indian market in the consumer line business.
Wipro Consumer’s Santoor, Chandrika, Glucovita, North West and Wipro Smartlite are leading brands in India. Enchanteur, Safi, Bio-essence and Romano are market leaders in ASEAN countries. It also holds a minority stake in consumer products firm, Happily Unmarried Marketing Pvt. Ltd, for its range of Ustraa personal care products.
Wipro’s other overseas consumer acquisitions include the UK’s Yardley, Singapore-based personal care company LD Waxson Unza Holdings and China’s Zhongshan.
“We are confident that with Wipro’s marketing expertise and its international distribution network, we will significantly expand our geographical presence and take our brands to new heights,"" said Rolando B. Hortaleza, chief executive, Splash Corp.
In India, the top seven best-selling personal care categories include cosmetics, fragrance, men’s grooming, skin care, bath and shower, haircare and oral care. Out of them, specialized categories, such as cosmetics, fragrance, men’s grooming and skincare, are set to overtake the growth of generic categories. By 2020, these specialized categories will contribute 40-45% to the overall market by 2022, according to a 2018 report by market research firm RedSeer Consulting.
“Some of Wipro’s competitors in the consumer space, such as Marico and Emami, have also made several overseas acquisitions. The Wipro acquisition, although might be a company from Philippines, it strengthens the India portfolio directly…because they (Wipro and competitors) believe that since they already have experience developing consumer products in India, acquired brands can be scaled faster in the Indian market,"" said Harminder Sahni, managing director at Wazir Advisors."

Hyderabad/San Francisco: Over the past year, a team of as many as 260 contract workers in Hyderabad, India has ploughed through millions of Facebook Inc photos, status updates and other content posted since 2014.
The workers categorize items according to five ""dimensions,"" as Facebook calls them.
These include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author's intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?
The work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.
Details of the effort were provided by multiple employees at outsourcing firm Wipro Ltd over several months. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation by the Indian firm. Facebook later confirmed many details of the project. Wipro declined to comment and referred all questions to Facebook.

Many projects are aimed at ""training"" the software that determines what appears in users' news feeds and powers the artificial intelligence underlying many other features.
The labeling efforts have not previously been reported.
""It's a core part of what you need,"" said Nipun Mathur, the director of product management for AI at Facebook. ""I don't see the need going away.""
The content labeling program could raise new privacy issues for Facebook, according to legal experts consulted by Reuters. The company is facing regulatory investigations worldwide over an unrelated set of alleged privacy abuses involving the sharing of user data with business partners.
The Wipro workers said they gain a window into lives as they view a vacation photo or a post memorializing a deceased family member. Facebook acknowledged that some posts, including screenshots and those with comments, may include user names.
The company said its legal and privacy teams must sign off on all labeling efforts, adding that it recently introduced an auditing system ""to ensure that privacy expectations are being followed and parameters in place are working as expected.""
But one former Facebook privacy manager, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed unease about users' posts being scrutinized without their explicit permission. The European Union's year-old General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has strict rules about how companies gather and use personal data and in many cases requires specific consent.
""One of the key pieces of GDPR is purpose limitation,"" said John Kennedy, a partner at law firm Wiggin and Dana who has worked on outsourcing, privacy and AI.
If the purpose is looking at posts to improve the precision of services, that should be stated explicitly, Kennedy said. Using an outside vendor for the work could also require consent, he said.
It remains unclear exactly how GDPR will be interpreted and whether regulators and consumers would see Facebook's internal labeling practices as problematic. Europe's top data privacy official declined to comment on possible concerns.
A Facebook spokeswoman said: ""We make it clear in our data policy that we use the information people provide to Facebook to improve their experience and that we might work with service providers to help in this process.""
U.S. Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat and leading critic of social media, told Reuters in a statement that large platforms increasingly are ""taking more and more data from users, for wider and more far-reaching uses, without any corresponding compensation to the user.""
Warner said he is drafting legislation that would require Facebook to ""disclose the value of users' data, and tell users exactly how their data is being monetized.""
The project
Human-powered content labeling, also referred to as ""data annotation,"" is a growth industry as companies seek to harness data for AI training and other purposes.
Self-driving car companies such as Alphabet Inc's Waymo have labelers identify traffic lights and pedestrians in videos to fortify their AI. Voice assistant developers including Amazon.com Inc have people annotate customer audio to improve AI's ability to decipher speech.
Facebook launched the Wipro project in April last year. The Indian firm received a $4 million contract and formed a team of about 260 labelers, according to the workers. Last year, the work consisted of analyzing posts from the prior five years.
After completing that, the team in December was cut to about 30 and shifted to labeling each month posts from the prior month. Work is expected to last through at least the end of 2019, they said.
Facebook confirmed the staffing changes but declined to comment on financial details.
The company said its analysis is ongoing so it could not provide any findings from the labeling or resulting product decisions. It has not told labelers the purpose or results of the project, and the workers said all they have inferred from their limited view is that selfies are increasingly popular.
The Wipro labelers and Facebook said the posts are a random sampling of text-based status updates, shared links, event posts, Stories feature uploads, videos and photos, including user-posted screenshots of chats on Facebook's various messaging apps. The posts come from Facebook and Instagram users globally, in languages including English, Hindi and Arabic.
Each item goes to two labelers to check accuracy, and a third if they disagree, Facebook said. Workers said they see on average 700 items per day. Facebook said the target average is lower.
Facebook confirmed labelers in Timisoara, Romania and Manila, the Philippines are involved in the same project.
Among Facebook's other labeling projects, one worker in Hyderabad for outsourcing vendor Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp said he and at least 500 colleagues look for sensitive topics or profane language in Facebook videos.
The aim is to train an automated Facebook tool that enables advertisers to avoid sponsoring videos that are, for example, adult or political, Facebook said. Cognizant did not respond to a request for comment.
Another application of labeling involved the social network's Marketplace shopping feature, where it automated category recommendations for new listings by first having labelers and product experts categorize some existing listings, Facebook's Mathur said.
Private posts
Facebook users are not offered the chance to opt out of their data being labeled.
At Wipro, the posts being examined include not only public posts but also those that are shared privately to a limited set of a user's friends. That ensures the sample reflects the range of activity on Facebook and Instagram, said Karen Courington, director of product support operations at Facebook.
Facebook's data policy does not explicitly mention manual analysis.
""We provide information and content to vendors and service providers who support our business, such as by providing technical infrastructure services, analyzing how our products are used, providing customer service, facilitating payments or conducting surveys,"" the policy states.
Europe's GDPR also requires companies delete user data upon request. Facebook said it has technology to routinely sync labeled posts with both deletion requests and changes to content privacy settings.
Facebook and other companies are testing techniques to curtail the need for outsourced labeling, in part to analyze more data faster and cheaper. For instance, AI training data for news feed rankings and photo descriptions for the blind came from hashtags on Instagram posts, Facebook's Mathur said.
""We try to minimize the amount of things we send out,"" he said.

Facebook Inc has thousands of content labelers around the world who categorize content with the aim of creating large datasets that can be more readily analyzed by humans and software.
One project at outsourcing vendor Wipro Ltd in Hyderabad, India, has seen as many as 260 workers over the last year look through a random selection of user-posted images, videos and status updates since 2014.
Facebook said the project aims to uncover how usage of its flagship social media service has evolved, potentially informing decisions about new products.
Facebook provided the five questions, or ""dimensions"" as the company calls them, that the Wipro labelers must address about each piece of content shown to them.
A selection of possible answers were provided by Facebook and labelers. Where no answer was deemed suitable, it was marked ""not applicable"".
The dimensions and some of the answers are:
* What is being shown in the post? Self, building, landmarks, food, animals, adult, teenager, nature
* What is the occasion of the post? An everyday place or activity, a positive major life event, a negative major life event
* Is there an expressive element? Thought, opinion, feelings
* Why did the author make the post? To plan an activity, update others about one's life, entertain others with something funny, inspire others, share something spiritual
* What is the setting of the post? Home, work, school, sporting event, outdoors, transit.

Hyderabad: Over the past year, a team of as many as 260 contract workers in Hyderabad, India has ploughed through millions of Facebook Inc photos, status updates and other content posted since 2014.
The workers categorize items according to five ""dimensions,"" as Facebook calls them.
These include the subject of the post - is it food, for example, or a selfie or an animal? What is the occasion - an everyday activity or major life event? And what is the author's intention - to plan an event, to inspire, to make a joke?
The work is aimed at understanding how the types of things users post on its services are changing, Facebook said. That can help the company develop new features, potentially increasing usage and ad revenue.

90,2019-05-08,Wipro,"US has complained that PCR will limit PCBs’ access to data, hinder their ability to operate optimallyInstead, it wants India to create a PCR to provide regulators with data to perform supervisory duties

The US administration has objected to the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) move to create a new public credit registry (PCR), on the grounds that the non-profit credit information company will be anti-competitive for private credit bureaus (PCBs). The PCR is planned as a repository of loan information of individuals and corporate borrowers to curb bad loans.
A PCR will help banks distinguish between good and bad borrowers and accordingly offer attractive interest rates to good borrowers and lend to bad borrowers at higher interest rates.
The move is based on the recommendations of a task force set up in 2017, headed by Y.M. Deosthalee. The committee submitted its report in April 2018 and the central bank made it public in June last year.
In October last year, the RBI had invited expressions of interest (EOI) for developing the registry from companies with a turnover of more than  ₹100 crore in the last three years. It has shortlisted six major technology companies, including TCS, Wipro and IBM India.
Four PCBs are operating in India, of which TransUnion CIBIL Ltd and Equifax Credit Information Services Pvt. Ltd are US-owned companies. The other two PCBs are Experian Credit Information Co. of India Pvt. Ltd and CRIF High Mark.
A government official with knowledge of the matter said the US has complained that the PCR will limit PCBs’ access to data and hinder their scope and ability to operate optimally in the country. Instead, it wants India to create a PCR to provide regulators with data to perform supervisory duties. However, India in its response to the US has said that its concerns are misplaced and PCR will not affect the functioning of PCBs in India. The official said India has informed the US that PCBs will have access to the PCR data as required to carry out their mandate and as decided by the RBI.
“Private credit bureaus will have to focus on and generate value from analytics, rather than from the unique access to data enshrined by regulation. A PCR, limited to regulatory and supervisory usage only, will not be a ‘public’ credit registry in the true sense of the term and defeat the purpose of democratization of credit information,"" the official said under condition of anonymity.
RBI deputy governor Viral Acharya had said in January this year that globally, PCBs and PCRs both operate in the same space. “PCBs can be legislatively authorized to receive credit data. However, being for-profit enterprises, they may focus primarily on those data segments around which it is most profitable to build a business model. Indeed, it is found internationally that a PCR, being a non-profit enterprise, is able to ensure much better data coverage than PCBs,"" he added.
The PCR is proposed to cover all regulated financial entities in phases and in this way get a 360-degree view of borrowers. It will facilitate linkages with related ancillary information systems outside the banking system including corporate filings, tax systems (including the goods and services tax network or GSTN), and utility payments.
“The PCR will have to be backed and governed by a comprehensive Public Credit Registry Act to be brought in consultation with the government. It will have to follow the latest privacy guidelines based on a laid down consent framework,"" Acharya said.
At present, institutions that report credit information to PCBs include all scheduled commercial banks and cooperative banks, non-banking financial companies, housing finance companies, state financial corporations, all India financial institutions, and credit card companies.
The US has also raised objection to the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill that mandates that either the personal data or at least a copy of it needs to be stored on a server located in India. The US has complained that the proposal would harm companies that rely on cross-border data flows to conduct business, including small and medium-sized enterprises.
The US suggested that India allow companies to transfer data across borders when they certify to binding international codes of conduct, such as the APEC Cross-Border Privacy Rules System. India has informed the US that the draft bill is under consideration and will evolve over time."
89,2019-05-20,Wipro,"India’s IT service firms have various options as they rework their delivery models around tight US norms

There are many weapons used in a trade war. The two used most often are complaints to the World Trade Organization or unilateral changes in tariffs against a trading partner, as we have seen with the US and China. Non-tariff trade barriers are often more potent and can be used with relative stealth. One such non-tariff barrier, often used on people-centric industries, is a restriction of the free movement of labour. India still gets about 70% of US H-1B visas issued each year. US consulates in India have considerable latitude. They can act on Washington’s orders to tighten up the H-1B regime without any drastic change in US immigration laws. Other similar “work permit"" rules in countries such as Australia, Singapore and the UK also vary over time.
I spoke recently with Viju George of JP Morgan, a veteran information technology (IT) sector analyst, whose insights I respect. George has strong data to back his conclusions. His analysis of the H-1B situation reveals that the rejection rate of H-1B visas has sharply increased for Indian IT since 2015. The rejection rates as of April 2019 of H-1B visas filed for by Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Cognizant have risen to 35%, 33% and 39%, respectively, versus 2%, 4% and 4% in 2015. The visa rejection rate for India’s TWITCH providers (TCS, Wipro, Infosys, Tech Mahindra, Cognizant and HCL Technologies) between September 2018 and April 2019 has spiked to 36%. This is astoundingly high, nine times higher than 2015’s rejection rate of approximately 4%.
Tier-I Indian IT firms are not alone in facing such H-1B denial rates. The authorities have also applied the whip to global IT services firms operating in India such as IBM, Accenture and Deloitte. It appears that the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) authorities are judging the offshore/on-site IT Services business model as taking undue advantage of H-1B visas, regardless of the firm’s heritage.
What is most alarming is that the acceptance rate of applications for extensions from people who are already working on H-1Bs in the US is also sharply declining. It is harder to substitute on-site H-1B resources already working at a client site with local resources at short notice. This is to say nothing of the human costs that affect workers who are suddenly uprooted from the US and have to relocate to India with their families. The US is no longer seen as a plum posting by senior IT services employees.
Big Tech players such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and Intel have far lower denial rates. These are still in single-digit percentages. In absolute terms, they are receiving increasing approvals. Captives such as Walmart and Goldman Sachs also have very low denial rates. Clearly, the USCIS does not view such players as “unfair"" H-1B users. According to George, many of their applicants hold US Masters’ degrees and command much higher pay packets than their IT Services counterparts—more than a 50% premium. Also, while about 70% of Big Tech employees applying for H-1Bs have Masters’ degrees, the picture for IT Services employees is inverted. Only 30% of them have Masters’ degrees. It appears that both lower pay and applicants without higher degrees are frowned upon by the USCIS.
US wages have been stagnant for more than a decade. Inflation has also been low, but real wage appreciation is largely absent. The current administration’s desire to push up middle-class wages, since it is this class that votes in large numbers, may be driving its current approach. However, tech, which has near zero unemployment, is probably the wrong sector to choose. Such knee-jerk methods are ineffectual and will end up hurting the US economy in the long run.
The question is whether these rejection rates are high enough to impact the bottom line or delivery operations of IT services firms. As is evident from several providers’ earnings announcements, George sees an impact on costs already but not yet on operations. Yet, if rejection rates continue to rise, can India’s IT players manage the operational risks that go with interrupted service delivery to customers? George’s analysis suggests that such risks will manifest themselves if rejection rates for H1B visa extensions approaches 45%. At the current rate, he says we will hit this point in less than two years.
How, then, can providers mitigate the operational risks if visa denial rates keep rising? Apart from increasing local hiring at higher costs, IT services firms have to structurally change their delivery methodologies to cope with visa pressures. Methods such as location-independent Agile development, extreme offshoring, and automation with bots are some of these.
Such a structural change will take time to play out. For example, location-independent Agile, a new-age delivery system, can be revolutionary since its development today needs team members playing multiple, parallel roles, which is more easily accomplished when they are co-located. Another method is extreme offshoring, where more than 90% of resources sit offshore. Predictable, longer-term annuity engagements are more amenable to this method. Third, the use of bots, instead of human employees, can reduce the reliance on visas for people.
There is increasing buy-in from clients for new delivery models if their execution is satisfactory. Firms have just started on this journey and the results will take time. That said, I have seen the industry face structural problems before, dust itself off and carry on.

Dear Wiproites,
I am very pleased to announce that Rishad Premji will take over as the Executive Chairman of Wipro Limited with effect from July 31, 2019.
Rishad brings to this role new ways of thinking, experience, and competence that will lead Wipro to greater heights. He has been an integral part of the leadership team since 2007, most recently as Chief Strategy Officer, and has an intimate understanding of our company – from operations to strategy. He has a deep knowledge of the global technology industry and was until recently the Chairman of the trade body NASSCOM, where he helped chart the course of India’s $170 billion software industry in this era of digital transformation. His diverse and cross-industry experiences give him the benefit of a broad view of global business. He is firmly rooted in the values that are the bedrock of the company -- his commitment to the Spirit of Wipro is absolute.
Rishad will continue to serve on the Board of the Azim Premji Foundation, the philanthropic organization, which now owns 67% of the economic interest of Wipro Limited. Thus, in his new role, he will also represent the largest stakeholder of Wipro.
I am also pleased to announce that Abidali Neemuchwala will be the Managing Director of Wipro Limited from July 31, 2019, while continuing to be the Chief Executive Officer. I have full confidence in Abid to lead our great company. Rishad and Abid make an excellent leadership team and I think this will be a great strength for Wipro.
I will continue to serve on the Board of Wipro Limited while dedicating most of my time and energy to the philanthropic efforts of the Foundation. I will remain the Chairman of Wipro Enterprises Limited which includes our Consumer Care and Infrastructure Engineering Businesses, and the Wipro-GE Healthcare joint venture, with total revenues of approximately USD 2 billion. I will also continue to Chair the Board of Wipro-GE Healthcare.
Leading Wipro from 1966 till now has been the greatest privilege of my life. It has been an extraordinary journey – growing from being a small vegetable oil company to the diverse global business that we are today. It is the deep commitment and hard work of Wiproites across generations that has helped shape the organisation of today. Wipro is an exemplar of a successful, ethical and a socially responsible organisation. I want to thank all of you as well as all my colleagues from the past for their contribution and dedication.
Wipro will continually transform to scale new heights as the world changes while remaining firmly committed to its values. Rishad and Abid will lead this transformation along with all of you. I am confident that the future of Wipro will far outshine anything that we have done before.
I wish you all the best.

The greatest strength of Wipro is our people. I know this since I have been an intrinsic part of our team for the last twelve years and have had a chance to work and engage with many of you. Our commitment and continued focus on our clients powered by deep technology prowess is at the heart of our success. Humble in success and resilient in adversity is our character. Unflinching commitment to our values, always unyielding on integrity, is at our core. It is my privilege to be part of such a team.
I congratulate Abid on taking over as the Managing Director of Wipro Ltd, along with his role as the Chief Executive Officer of the company. Over the past four years, Abid and I have worked closely together, and I have a lot of respect for his strong strategic and operational depth and his sincerity in leading our company. I believe that our very strong working relationship, along with the leadership team will be a great asset for our company.
Mr. Premji will continue to serve on our Board of Directors. He will invest his time and energy for the philanthropic causes of the Azim Premji Foundation but will always be available for counsel.
Over the past 53 years, Mr. Premji has led and built Wipro from a tiny business in Amalner to this globally successful and admired organization that we are today. But his contribution and achievements go beyond the success of Wipro. He is among the global pioneers of the IT industry. He has reshaped the world of Indian business, demonstrating that success can be achieved with unflinching commitment to integrity. Wipro’s inordinate success deeply touched his social conscience, inspiring him to dedicate the major part of his personal wealth to philanthropy, in the hope of serving and touching the lives of some of the most disadvantaged people in India.
Mr. Premji has demonstrated that a successful business can be built on an ethical foundation and driven by social purpose. As he retires, leaving this great legacy in our hands – there is only one way to thank him and express our gratitude – we must continually take Wipro to newer heights. We must chart new paths and win new frontiers, while consolidating our strongholds, and do all this with a continuing and absolute commitment to our values – to the Spirit of Wipro.
I look forward to this exciting journey with you – the future is brighter than ever before.
With gratitude,
Rishad"
83,2019-06-06,Wipro,"He'll be more remembered for his philanthropic contributions and sharing of wealthMany will remember him for creating a great IT company from scratch to a $25-billion behemoth

Today, Wipro announced that Azim Hashim Premji will retire as executive chairman from the company and his son Rishad will take over that role. It is truly an end of an era not only for Wipro but for the whole Indian IT industry.
Coming from a middle-class family and converting a vegetable oil company into an IT behemoth is an extraordinary effort reserved for a few talented and gifted individuals. Premji achieved that feat with lots of grace and dignity. Many will remember him for creating a great IT company from scratch to a $25-billion behemoth (in market cap). But, to me, he will be more remembered for his philanthropic contributions and sharing of wealth. By transferring more than  ₹50,000 crore to philanthropic activities, he set a huge benchmark for future generations to follow.
I remember Premji visiting Infosys' campus during the mid-’90s and we were on a campus tour. I shook his hands and told him that I will not wash my hand at least for a week as I just shook hands with a billionaire. He felt so embarrassed by that statement that he quickly changed the topic. He lives a very simple life and is easily accessible to all.
His simple lifestyle starting from owning a Toyota Corolla to traveling by autos in Bangalore roads to traveling by economy class on flights were well-known folk stories in the industry. Even though Infosys and Wipro were fierce competitors in the marketplace there was always healthy mutual respect between the companies.
I believe he will be more remembered for his philanthropic work and contribution. With so much inequality in society and at a time when capitalism is looked with more distrust, we need role models like him to make it more acceptable to society. Compassionate capitalism is the need of the hour and he is a living example of that. I hope the young billionaires of the country follow his footstep.

82,2019-06-07,Wipro,"The 73-year-old IT czar has donated two-thirds of his wealth, worth $21 billion, to charitable causesPremji is credited with scaling up Wipro from a $2 mn revenue firm to an $11 bn conglomerate

NEW DELHI :
Azim Premji’s greatest legacy, according to business historians, may not be that he created a large information technology (IT) services company. This, despite the fact that he scaled up Wipro Ltd from a fledgling $2-million revenue company in 1966 to over an $11 billion diversified business conglomerate, largely comprising of software services and consumer care by the end of March 2019.
Compassionate capitalism is what Premji’s 53-year stint at Wipro can be best described as he has donated two-thirds of his wealth, worth $21 billion to charitable causes.
To be sure, Premji had decided to give more than half of his wealth to charitable causes, 12 years before he signed the Giving Pledge in 2013.
But how would Premji describe his stint at the company?
 Click here to view the enlarged graphic
“Leading Wipro from 1966 till now has been the greatest privilege of my life. It has been an extraordinary journey—growing from being a small vegetable oil company to the diverse global business that we are today,"" Azim Premji wrote in a letter to employees on Thursday. “I want to thank all of you as well as all my colleagues from the past for their contribution and dedication.""
In a piece in Mint earlier this year, Dileep Ranjekar, CEO of Azim Premji Foundation, recalled Premji telling General Electric CEO and philanthropist Jack Welch in 2001, “I am very passionate about the foundation and am willing to commit half my wealth to it.""
“To make capitalism acceptable in a country like India, one should be able to create and share the wealth and I believe Mr. Premji would always be remembered for the latter part more. I hope the young billionaires follow him as a role model and help in making capitalism much more acceptable in a country like ours,"" said V. Balakrishnan, a former chief financial officer at Infosys.
Another hallmark of Premji’s stint has been his ability to retain people. Despite Wipro seeing departures of many executives, including Ashok Soota, chairman of Happiest Minds, and many founders of Mindtree Ltd, Premji has been able to retain many senior leaders. At least a dozen senior leaders have stayed at Wipro for over two decades, according to Mint’s analysis. This includes Suresh Senapaty, a former chief financial officer of Wipro, and currently, a board member on Wipro Enterprises and Wipro GE Healthcare, Wipro Consumer Care chief executive Vineet Agrawal and Dileep Ranjekar, CEO of Azim Premji Foundation.
“One legacy is that he (Premji) created an organization that ran his business with the highest standards of corporate governance and integrity. A second and which I think is a bigger legacy is his ability to nurture and develop leaders with entrepreneurial traits,"" said Soota.
When it comes to business, however, Premji may not be ascribed the most successful business leader.
Sample this. At the end of 2003, Wipro ended with $625 million in revenue, a tad behind $754 million in revenue reported by Infosys Ltd and $1.04 billion in revenue reported by Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. However, over the next 16 years, the gap between Wipro and its rivals has only widened, with Nodia-based HCL Technologies Ltd, even edging past Wipro to become the third largest IT services firm last fiscal year.
Since 2013, Wipro has managed to grow more than 7% in a year only once, and this has only widened the gap with its peers.
At the heart of Wipro’s underperformance has been what many call is poor execution by the company.
Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy Services ended with $20.91 billion in revenue in the year ended March 2019, almost twice the size of Infosys, which ended with $11.8 billion and far ahead of Wipro, which ended with $8.12 billion.
For now, Wipro continues to be in the midst of business restructuring and the company is still far away from turning the corner.
Still, some executives like Soota believe that it will be unfair to judge Premji on the performance of Wipro’s IT business.
“In consumer care, Wipro’s Santoor is now a bigger brand than Lux. However, in IT business, despite being a late entrant, Wipro until 1999 was the second largest IT firm (behind TCS). It subsequently slipped and is now behind two companies (Infosys and HCL Technologies Ltd). I believe he (Premji) should have never run the company after Vivek Paul left. This is because his biggest strength is not in implementing but in value addition. Or, rather allowing people to make decisions. So I will not hold it against him because actually he was not running the company himself but allowing people to run it,"" said Soota."
81,2019-06-07,Wipro,"Azim Premji’s greatest legacy is laying the benchmark for philanthropy and showing the way for corporate India to give backWipro announced that chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala will also be the managing director

New Delhi: Wipro Ltd’s chairman, Azim Premji, on Thursday announced that effective 31 July he will step down from his current role at the company he led for more than half a century and devote more time to his philanthropic activities.
His elder son, Rishad Premji, chief strategy officer of the company, will be the executive chairman of Wipro, India’s fourth-largest information technology (IT) services company.
Azim Premji will continue as non-executive director and founder chairman.
During his time as chairman, 73-year-old Azim Premji, often considered the conscience-keeper of India’s hugely successful IT services industry, steered Wipro from a fledgling company with just $2 million in sales in 1966 to over $11 billion in diversified business, largely software services and consumer products.
“It has been a long and satisfying journey for me. As I look into the future, I plan to devote more time to focus on our philanthropic activities. I have great confidence and trust in Rishad’s leadership to steer Wipro in its next phase of growth,"" Azim Premji said in a statement.
While his success in steering Wipro, competing with the likes of Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd, is open to debate, few will question his greatest legacy to India’s business culture, that of laying the benchmark for philanthropy and showing the way for corporate India to give back to society.
Often known to be frugal in his spending and austere in his lifestyle, Azim Premji donated two-thirds of his wealth worth $21 billion to charitable causes. As is his wont, he did so with minimum fuss and fanfare.
“He has been most successful in creating a very successful IT company. However, his greatest legacy that he has passed on to the corporate world is philanthropy. He does not throw his wealth around and has shown that wealth does not always have to go to the family and can be given to a charitable cause,"" said Anu Aga, chairperson of Thermax Ltd, a capital goods maker.
Wipro, which was earlier known as Western India Products Ltd, was founded by Azim Premji’s father, Mohamed Hasham Premji, in 1945. However, his father’s untimely death in 1966 forced Azim Premji to drop out of Stanford University to take over the reins of the company. In what can be described as his tenacity and a hallmark of his greatness, Azim Premji completed his bachelors of science degree in electrical engineering from Stanford 34 years later in 2000.
Over the next two decades, he steered the group from its vegetable oils business into a behemoth, comprising its flagship $8.5 billion IT services company and an over $2 billion privately-held consumer care and infrastructure engineering company.
Typical of his commitment to the company and its employees, Azim Premji’s statement added: “I wish to thank generations of Wiproites and their families for their contribution towards building our company to what it is today. I am grateful to our clients, partners, and other stakeholders who have reposed trust and confidence in us.""
Simultaneously, Wipro announced that chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala will also be the managing director of the company, thereby separating the positions of chairman and managing director as required by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
Rishad, who has thus far been chief strategy officer, has his task cut out. Wipro has lagged behind rivals such as Infosys and HCL Technologies.
Infosys, which ended with $11.8 billion in revenue last year, added $860 million in incremental revenue in the year ended 31 March. Noida-based HCL added $794 million in new business to end with $8.63 billion.
In comparison, Wipro, which is in the midst of a business restructuring, added $60.1 million in new business to end with $8.12 billion in revenue from its IT services business.
Tata Consultancy Services Ltd added $1.82 billion in revenue to end with $20.91 billion in revenue last year.
“Rishad Premji has impeccable credentials and has had wide-ranging professional experience as chief strategy officer of Wipro,"" said Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, chairperson and managing director of Biocon Ltd. “He has demonstrated impressive leadership, including as chairman of Nasscom. A worthy successor who has the potential to steer Wipro to the next level."""
80,2019-06-09,Wipro,"While most people work for money, it’s said, capitalists make money work for them. But the big aim of Wipro’s Azim Premji, now set to retire, was to make money work for everybody

We have been avalanched with anecdotes about Azim H. Premji ever since he announced his retirement as chairman and managing director of Wipro Ltd. Next month, he will make way for his son, Rishad Premji, to take over as executive chairman, and for the company’s CEO Abidali Z. Neemuchwala to succeed him as managing director. Online tributes to the 73-year-old seem choked with emotion, each offering testimony to his remarkable leadership. Over a career spanning 53 years, he led the transformation of a small vegetable oil firm into a bustling $8.5-billion information technology major. In doing so, he led not just an audacious mission to diversify operations, harmonize divergences, cross-fertilize ideas—from soap to software and, believe it or not, even vice-versa—and maximize profits, he led hearts and minds by the force of his conviction in the values he espoused. Apart from the clarity of his strategic vision, he is held in high esteem today for his integrity, compassion and emphasis on ethics. For all his success, as colleagues and associates testify, modesty attends whatever he says and does. By all accounts, he was profoundly embarrassed to find his name on top of the Forbes list of Indian billionaires for a few years at the turn of the millennium. That he is India’s biggest philanthropist now should surprise nobody.
Premji may have inherited Wipro, but his success was self-made. He had just begun his twenties when he had to drop out of Stanford University and take over his family firm in 1966. Moving into information technology (IT) in the early 1980s was the company’s big break, of course, the start of a dream run that saw the company enlisted on the New York Stock Exchange by 2000, the year he finally got his graduate degree from Stanford. Resolutely defiant of the Western market wisdom of sticking to a field of “core competence"", he was already a legend by then. Not that he never faced criticism. Some sniped that Wipro was too closely held to be a paragon of wealth sharing. Others carped that his all but complete control over Wipro made talent retention harder, which they said would render it uncompetitive. It lost some senior executives, but kept growing; and once Premji began to give his wealth away for causes nobody could argue against, his critics fell silent. Wealth was to be generated not just for shareholders, he held, but for the upliftment of the needy.
The focus of Premji’s philanthropy is education, a sector he chose because it has the greatest potential to improve the lives of Indians at large and the underprivileged in particular. The Azim Premji Foundation, which he set up, has been working since 2000 towards that end, more than a decade before he took a cue from Warren Buffett and Bill Gates and publicly pledged to give away at least half his wealth. Earlier this year, he made a multibillion dollar endowment that made news across the world: In all, his philanthropic trusts are now the economic beneficiaries of two-thirds of Wipro’s entire equity, worth over $17 billion in market value. Crucially, year after year, the bulk of the company’s dividends will be used to achieve the goal of a well-educated country. Sure, Premji retains the voting rights of those shares, but that’s exactly how those whose lives have been touched by his largesse would probably want it."

77,2019-06-18,Wipro,"Premji, the billionaire philanthropist, wants to devote more time to charitable causes through his foundationA board reconstitution will be the least of worries for Rishad, who will work to put Wipro back on the growth path

Wipro Ltd’s lead independent director Narayanan Vaghul and chairman of the board’s nomination and remuneration panel Ashok Ganguly will retire next month, said a Wipro executive familiar with the development, marking an end to their more than two-decade-long stint with India’s fourth-largest information technology services company.
Both Vaghul and Ganguly were re-appointed for a three-year term in 2016, which ends on 31 July, when Azim Premji too will step down from his role as executive chairman and managing director, after having led the Bengaluru-based company for more than half a century.
Premji, the billionaire philanthropist, wants to devote more time to charitable causes through his foundation, to which he has given two-thirds of his wealth totalling $21 billion.
Premji, who turns 74 in July, will continue as a non-executive director and founder chairman as his elder son Rishad Premji takes over as chairman at Wipro, which was founded in 1945.
Still, a board reconstitution will be the least of worries for Rishad, who will work to put Wipro back on the growth path.
In January, Wipro had appointed former chairperson of State Bank of India Ltd Arundhati Bhattacharya as an independent director. It had also reappointed independent director Ireena Vittal for a five-year term last October, ensuring the company need not find a replacement for both Vaghul and Ganguly, said the executive cited above.
Wipro’s eleven-member board comprises three executive members, including Azim Premji, Rishad Premji, and chief executive Abidali Neemuchwala, besides eight independent directors. The current term of the six other directors continues till 2021.
A Wipro spokesperson said the company “does not comment on speculation"". “Any such decision will be taken by the Board of Directors of Wipro Limited based on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee and will be communicated to the stock exchanges,"" the person added.
Vaghul, 83, first served as nominee director of ICICI Bank Ltd in the mid-80s when Wipro took a loan from the private lender and was first appointed as an independent director in June 1997. Ganguly, who turns 84 in July, joined the board in 1999. 
“Wipro does not need to find a replacement immediately for both the outgoing directors as it inducted former Bhattacharya and extended the term of another director. This also means that other than M.K. Sharma(independent director), Wipro will have a young board, and gives enough time for Rishad to constitute the board in future,"" said a Mumbai-based analyst at a domestic brokerage, requesting anonymity."

Bengaluru: The United States' plans to cap H1-B work visas, used by Indian IT firms to send employees there, would imply a ""further crunch"" for businesses to access skilled workforce, industry lobby group Nasscom said on Thursday.
The United States told India it is considering caps on H-1B visas for nations that force foreign companies to store data locally days ahead of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to New Delhi, Reuters reported on Wednesday citing three sources with knowledge of the matter.
The warning comes as trade tensions between the United States and India have resulted in tit-for-tat tariff actions in recent weeks. From Sunday, India imposed higher tariffs on some U.S. goods, days after Washington withdrew a key trade privilege for New Delhi.
The $150 billion Indian IT sector uses the work visas to fly engineers and developers to service clients, including software giants such as Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc in the U.S., their biggest market.
If Washington made it more difficult to hire advanced tech workers, it would only weaken the U.S. companies that depend on them to help fill their skill gaps and put jobs at risk, Nasscom said in an emailed statement.
However, the lobby group, which counts Wipro Ltd Chairman Rishad Premji and Infosys Ltd Chief Operating Officer U.B. Pravin Rao among its governing members, said it awaited clarity from official sources on the matter.
""The American companies themselves need Indian talent, so if there is a cap on these visas, this will impact U.S. companies also and hurt their business interests,"" said Sudheer Guntupalli, an analyst with Ambit Capital in Mumbai.
""Clearly this seems to be a retaliatory measure from the U.S. government.""
Shares of sector heavyweights Infosys fell as much as 2.13% on Thursday, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) lost 2.12% and Wipro fell over 3% in early trade, following the report, before recouping losses later in the day.
Infosys and Wipro did not comment on the matter, while TCS did not immediately respond to requests for their views on the report."

Mumbai: Shares of Indian information technology companies fell on early Thursday after a Reuters’ report said the US has told India that it was considering caps on H-1B work visas for countries that force foreign companies to store data locally. Indian software companies are among the largest recipients of the H-1B work visas.
Shares of Wipro Ltd fell 4%, while Tata Consultancy Services Ltd declined 2%, Infosys Ltd were down 1%, Tech Mahindra Ltd fell 1.5%, and HCL Technologies Ltd eased 0.5%. The BSE IT Index fell 0.7%.
The plan to restrict the popular H-1B visa programme, under which skilled foreign workers are brought to the US each year, comes days ahead of the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's visit to New Delhi.
The warning also comes after India recently tariffs on import of 29 US products. India decided to impose the long pending retaliatory tariffs on US products after Washington last week withdrew duty-free benefits for Indian exporters.

74,2019-06-21,Wipro,"Light fidelity, which uses light waves instead of radio waves to provide an internet connection, is promising to make significant inroads by reducing network congestion around the globeWipro Lighting has begun offering Li-Fi to Indian customers in partnership with PureLifi Scotland

BENGALURU :
An increasingly connected world celebrated Wi-Fi Day on Thursday, mindful that it’s actually Li-Fi that’s making the waves.
Light fidelity, which uses light waves instead of radio waves to provide an internet connection, is promising to make significant inroads by reducing network congestion around the globe, including in India.
For instance, Wipro Lighting, a unit of Wipro’s consumer care business, has begun offering this technology to Indian customers in partnership with PureLifi Scotland. “We are offering LiFi (data through light) solutions for significantly greater security and safety and ultra fast data transmission rates to deliver unprecedented low latency and reliability. This is to complement and enhance existing cellular and Wi-Fi networks,"" said Anuj Dhir, vice-president and business head of Wipro Lighting.
In August 2018, PureLiFi deployed its Li-Fi solutions at Kyle Academy secondary school in Ayr, Scotland. The project was conducted in collaboration with Edinburgh University and is being overseen by the Scottish Futures Trust, which supports the Scottish government’s digital strategy. PureLiFi and the LiFi Research and Development Centre at Edinburgh University provided the resources for the execution of the pilot with hands-on support and subsequent testing.
The installation of PureLiFi’s LiFi-XC system comprised eight LiFi-enabled LED light bulbs in the ceiling. Students were given access to LiFi-XC stations that plug into their laptops enabling high-speed connectivity through the lights. Kyle Academy was the first school globally to pilot the technology in the classroom.
This June, at the International Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, Air France, Latecoere and Ubisoft showcased their Li-Fi technology using light to transmit data and ran an in-flight video game tournament showcasing this technology.
On 19 June, Signify announced that the launch of a new range of Li-Fi systems that includes the world’s fastest and most reliable Li-Fi systems commercially available. The range, branded Trulifi, leverages existing and future professional luminaires. Instead of using radio signals (such as Wi-Fi, 4G/5G, Bluetooth, etc.), Trulifi uses light waves to enable highly reliable, secure two-way wireless communications at speeds far above most conventional workplace wireless technologies.
The term Li-Fi was coined by Prof. Harald Haas, founder and chief scientist of pureLiFi, and also a professor of mobile communications at Edinburgh University. Li-Fi is a category of Optical Wireless Communications (OWC), which includes infrared and ultra-violet communications as well as visible light. However, Li-Fi is unique in that the same light energy used for illumination may also be used for communication.
LiFi comprises multiple light bulbs to form a wireless network. When an electrical current is applied to a LED light bulb, a stream of light (photons) is emitted from the bulb. As explained on the Purli-Fi website, LED bulbs are semiconductor devices, which means that the brightness of the light flowing through them can be changed at extremely high speeds. This allows one to send a signal by modulating the light at different rates. The signal can then be received by a detector which interprets the changes in light intensity (the signal) as data. The intensity modulation cannot be seen by the human eye, and thus communication is just as seamless as other radio systems, allowing the users to be connected where there is Li-Fi enabled light. Using this technique, data can be transmitted from an LED light bulb at high speeds.
Signify’s Trulifi, for instance, uses optical wireless transceiver technology built, or retrofitted, into Philips Luminaires, which means customers do not have to rip and replace their existing lighting infrastructure. The new range, according to a company statement, provides wireless connectivity at speeds up to 150 megabits per second (mbps) over large spaces such as meeting rooms and office floors, and allows for a seamless handover between each Trulifi-enabled luminaire. The speed is fast enough to stream simultaneously 30 1080p HDTV movies. A USB-access key, plugged into a laptop, is needed to receive the LiFi signal and acts as an emitter to send data back to the luminaire.
“Trulifi underlines our strategy to unlock the potential of light to address new high-growth markets,"" said Olivia Qiu, Chief Innovation Officer at Signify.
There are compelling reasons to use Li-Fi in conjunction with Wi-Fi. For one, with the increasing number of internet-connected devices in classrooms, installing Li-Fi alongside Wi-Fi can provide additional bandwidth to reduce network congestion, enabling students to stream educational videos and download resources with seamless connectivity. Second, Li-Fi has the capability to support big data, and technologies like augmented reality, virtual reality, machine learning, artificial intelligence, according to Prof. Haas.
Moreover, while there is 300 gigahertz of radio spectrum, there is 300 terahertz of visible light spectrum. If you add infrared spectrum to the visible light spectrum, it will be 2,600 times larger than the entire radio spectrum, Haas said at Mint’s flagship technology conference in 2017, adding that this spectrum is free."

Hotels in Chennai are rationing water for guests amid searing heat while companies limit showers as the city of 4.6 million faces its worst shortage in years.
All four reservoirs that supply Chennai, known as the Detroit of South Asia for its flourishing automobile industry, have run dry this summer, largely because of poor monsoon rains last year.
Chennai is one of 21 cities that a government think-tank warned last year could run out of ground water by 2020. This year's monsoon is delayed, further compounding problems across a swath of western and central India.
Employees in Chennai-based companies such as Fiat Chrysler, TCS, Wipro and Cognizant said they had been asked to cut back on water use in canteens and restrooms.
US-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTS), which employs thousands in the city, said it had cut down on water at its canteen and gym.
""We have also switched to biodegradable plates in all our cafeterias, temporarily closed shower facilities in our gyms, and minimised the washing of utensils in our campuses by our cafeteria vendors,"" CTS said in a statement.
Water storage levels in the city's four major reservoirs were one-hundredth of what they were this time last year - and at a mere 0.2% of capacity, according to state government data.
Chennai is entirely dependent on the northeast monsoon which begins in October. The last three months of 2018 received lower than average rainfall, with the deficit rising to as much as 80 percent in the month of December, according to India's weather office.
Ananda, a small hotel in southern Chennai, had a notice at its entrance warning of a water shortage.
""It's not just us, all the hotels run the risk of shutting down because there's hardly enough water,"" said P. Chandrasekhar, a supervisor at the hotel.
State authorities said they had stepped up water supplies to the city each year. ""In 2017, we were supplying 450 million litres of water. Now we are supplying 525 million litres per day,"" S. P. Velumani, the minister for municipal administration, said.

72,2019-06-24,Wipro,"The inside story of how Wipro’s founder meticulously put in place the plan to give away his fortune to charity

India’s most generous citizen is no accidental philanthropist. Azim Premji isn’t the kind of man who gets up one day and stricken by conscience, decides to give away a part of his wealth to charity. The giving away of his fortune was as carefully thought through as the making of it. Indeed, Premji rarely does anything unplanned. This is a man whose calendar is filled months in advance. Even the idea in 2001 of setting up a charitable foundation, which is now backed by an endowment valued at $21 billion making it among the five largest endowments across the world, took over six months of discussions with executives who would be running it.
The outcome was the Premji Foundation which today trains thousands of teachers across 50 districts in six states, such that students can be taught better in government schools. Its impact cuts across domain, straddling pedagogy, education policy besides of course the mechanics of philanthropy and is the reason why Nandan Nilekani, chairman, Infosys Ltd. calls him “a giant figure"".

Modest beginning
It started with an initial endowment of Wipro shares worth $125 million to the foundation in 2001. But that modest beginning was preceded by years of planning, vitally making the money that he would eventually gift. Before the first act of giving, Premji, a businessman known for his austere lifestyle and equally severe business style which includes worrying about the money being spent on tissue paper used in the company’s bathrooms, grew Wipro from a company with just $2 million in sales in 1966 into a $11 billion giant corporation selling software services to the world and consumer products to Indian customers.
The company he inherited, Western India Vegetable Products Ltd, was founded by his father Mohamed Hasham Premji in 1945, and was listed on BSE (then Bombay Stock Exchange) the very next year. Hasham Premji ran the company until his death in 1966 whereupon Azim, who was in the second year of engineering at Stanford University, came back to take over its reins. At that point the family owned about 50% stake in Wipro.
Back then, it was a different India, one in which business was arbitrary and wholly dependent on government largesse. In 1977, the then socialist-leaning Janata Party government of Morarji Desai sent International Business Machines packing as New Delhi believed the company was dumping old machines in the country. Fledgling companies like HCL Technologies Ltd and Wipro saw an opportunity in the vacuum that was created and quickly got into assembling and marketing IT hardware.
Western India Vegetable Products Limited’s name was also changed to Wipro Products the same year. “The company has been issued a letter of intent for the manufacture of microprocessor based system mini computers and is taking necessary steps for effective implementation of the project,"" reads a statement from Wipro Products Ltd’s annual report for the year 1980. That year its total revenue was just  ₹43.1 crore, up from  ₹7.2 crore a decade earlier in 1970.
The making of a billionaire
It was only by the end of 1982 that Wipro started the manufacturing and marketing of microprocessor- based computer systems and Wipro Products was renamed to Wipro Ltd. Next year, in 1983, Wipro reconstituted this Information Technology Division into a wholly-owned subsidiary.
Premji, according to executives who have worked with him, had little knowledge of the IT business. To best understand this business, he decided to learn from the people who he hired to run and build the business. It’s a trait that’s come to define the man who executives say is in perennial learning mode. “At that time of my joining and even for many years after that, Premji used to sit in the interviews of all new recruits,"" said Mindtree executive chairman Krishnakumar Natarajan, who joined Wipro in 1981 as a fresh engineering graduate and worked there till 1999. “I believe this was because he focused on building talent and at the same time, he realized he could understand the IT business""
The Y2K bug fear at the turn of the century presented a perfect opportunity for companies like Wipro to start deploying armies of engineers to help global companies rewrite computer code and maintain the IT infrastructure in case of the feared catastrophe. Business surged and with Premji continuing to increase his personal holding in Wipro from the dividend he got from his shareholding, by 2000 his 75% holding in the company helped him emerge as the richest Indian with a fortune of $30 billion.
By the end of 2002, Premji held almost 84% shares in Wipro, up from 50% when he took over the company as managing director in 1966. Later, the market regulator capped promoter holding at 75% and Premji, over the years, had to bring down his ownership.
The philanthropist
That’s also the time that the man, who prefers to live a short walk through-the-woods away from the Wipro office in Bengaluru’s distant Sarjapur, started his next innings which would see him emerge 16 years later as the one of world’s foremost philanthropist.
Even as he diluted his holding for regulatory purposes, he also transferred some shares to the Trust or the Foundation he had set up in 2001. All told, between 2001 and 2019, Premji donated Wipro shares worth nearly $12 billion in a staggered manner to the endowment. This includes the announcement made by Premji earlier this year, where he made the country’s single-largest donation, transferring economic ownership of 34% of his shares in Wipro worth $7.5 billion to Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and Azim Premji Trust.
Premji had taken his time to announce his intent, but the desire to do give back to society, had always been there. It was fired by the spirit of his mother, Gulbanoo M.H. Hasham Premji, a trained doctor who spent a lifetime helping set up a children’s orthopaedic hospital at Haji Ali in Bombay, even while she served as chairperson of Wipro after the death of her husband in August 1966.
“Amongst the key influences on him were his mother’s example of having set up and run a charitable hospital for children for 50 years, and Mahatma Gandhi’s idea of trusteeship of wealth,"" said Anurag Behar, chief executive officer of Azim Premji Foundation. “He actively started thinking of philanthropy in 1999-00 including setting up the Foundation""
Among the four areas initially discussed between founder CEO of the Trust Dileep Ranjekar and Azim Premji were education, nutrition, healthcare and some initiatives in governance as possible areas of work. Primary education was finally selected as the Foundation’s focus of work because it was a critical factor that significantly impacted other issues in the country. “We saw education as the most important method and process for empowerment of people, clearly there were other important areas of work possible, however this very fundamental nature of education was the determining criteria,"" said Behar.
An early realization that for philanthropy to be meaningful it had to bring about large-scale change or at least initiate the process of transformation, guided Premji’s vision and he refused to “cut out cheques"" merely to appease his conscience, said an executive, on the condition of anonymity. This single-minded approach to philanthropy is no different from his approach to business. Over the years, he has rarely agreed to serve on boards of companies, or take up other assignments, according to former chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty, since Premji believed that the business needed all his time and energies.
The future
The endowment now owns 14% of the promoter’s shareholding in Wipro and also has economic ownership or the right to receive all money earned from 53% of promoter shares. This means the endowment gets money earned from 67% of promoter shares in Wipro, leaving Premji, his wife Yasmeen Premji, and two sons, Rishad and Tariq, with monetary gains from only 7% of their 74% equity in Wipro.
“Azim Premji’s commitment to philanthropy, which began with the cause of education for disadvantaged children, has been a strong message to corporations and businessmen. His recent commitment will contribute towards meeting his vision of inclusive development,"" said Ratan Tata, Chairman Emeritus, Tata Sons.
Today, the foundation is training teachers in government schools even as another philanthropic arm has started giving grants to non-government organizations and founded the Azim Premji University. Premji’s philanthropic entities are run by Anurag Behar, co-chief executive officer of the foundation, along with Dileep Ranjekar. Now they will have his undivided attention, a huge benefit that comes with attendant alarms for he is known to be unrelenting in his questioning and often drills down to the basics of every transaction. He is also completely hands-on, often visiting schools in remote locations to get a first hand feel for the subject. Annual treks have kept him fit for his 73 years.
As he prepares to step down as chairman of the company he’s steered for over 50 years and devote himself wholly to his other passion, Premji has prepared meticulously and assiduously. The Foundation has now been functioning for 18 years, has an excellent, handpicked team in place, is adequately funded and is bulletproofed against any fall in the fortunes of Wipro.
In conclusion
The two philanthropic trusts, Azim Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and Azim Premji Trust, earned  ₹11,357 crore ($1.65 billion) over the past nine years by way of dividends, share sales and buybacks, becoming one of the richest and largest charitable trusts in India.
Simply put, even while it owns 67% economic interest of Wipro’s stock and in turn gets the dividends that accrue from this holding, its primary source continues to be returns from Azim Premji’s family office, Premji Invest which has between $5 billion and $7 billion in funds under management, having delivered returns upwards of 30% over the last two years.
Premji has over the years put in place this carefully crafted cushion to ensure the business of the philanthropy isn’t dependent on the fortunes of Wipro. In the future, the core aim of the foundation which is to use education as a force multiplier to create a more just society will just get magnified.
“He has been most successful in creating a very successful IT company. However, his greatest legacy he has passed on to the corporate world is philanthropy. He does not throw his wealth around and has a very simple living and has shown that the wealth does not always have to go to the family and can be given to the charitable cause,"" said Anu Aga, chairperson, Thermax, the Pune-based engineering firm.
From selling vegetable oils to changing the way millions of children are taught in , Azim Premji has always been an exemplar for business and society.
While India may find a few more entrepreneurs to emulate his feats in business, his philanthropic endeavors are unique and truly special. In redefining philanthropy by putting his money where his heart is, Premji has shown the way for billionaires not just in India but across the world."
71,2019-06-26,Wipro,"Premji has always made a clear distinction between his personal wealth and that of Wipro

The handshake was firm, the voice soft but steely: “Thank you for covering us."" It was typical of the man, a few words and no beating around the bush. It was the first time I was meeting Azim Premji, India’s most famous philanthropist, and it was for a story in Business Today, the magazine that paid my bills those days. Aptly, the story about Wipro was titled The Ethical Corporation. The meeting was in his office in Mumbai, some years before he moved to Bengaluru.
I was told before the meeting that he had been in a foul mood and his corporate communications manager informed me it was over the small matter of a staffer fudging a train bill. For Premji, though, this was no small matter. Integrity was an article of faith for him. Working for a media house where it was equally valued, it wasn’t as difficult for me to understand this then as it is in today’s more muddied times.
Significantly, his gratitude for the coverage was expressed even before the story had appeared. After it did, I got a call from Ashok Soota, who was then the president of Wipro Infotech. He said he didn’t agree with some of the issues I had raised about the company’s strategy and would like to discuss those with me on my next trip to Bangalore, but it was what he said next that amazed me. “Thanks for pointing out our deficiencies. For the good things we have our ad agency,"" were his parting words. In today’s business environment, with armies of image managers zealously guarding corporate reputations, such a remark would be unthinkable. However, that’s the culture Wipro and its great rival across the street, Infosys Ltd., fostered in the early 1990s.
Wipro went on to spawn a whole host of entrepreneurs. Each of these former Wipro managers upheld that same value system.
Companies that tolerate minor misdemeanours within are also those that perpetrate major frauds without. A tolerance for minor acts of corruption comes from a culture that perceives market manipulation as a legitimate business strategy. Enough companies doing that under the benign or even complicit watch of governments makes for the crony capitalism that we have seen in India over the years. Corruption distorts markets and leads to unproductive and wasteful deployment of resources. It may serve the interests of one tycoon or his companies, but it grievously hurts the whole market economy system on which capitalism rests. Premji’s lifelong battle against corruption in all its forms needs to be seen against this backdrop.
I have met Premji only one more time after that, at an India economic summit in the capital, and it occasions another great story about him, one that adds a few more brush strokes to our sketch of this enigmatic man. He could come across as unreasonable, as when Kingfisher upgraded his seat on a flight from Bangalore to Delhi. For the newly minted airline, it was a minor coup having him on board, and the upgrade was a natural move. For Premji, who insisted on travelling economy class, this was unacceptable, and as he thought one of his own executives was responsible, he gave her an earful. After he was told that she had nothing to do with it, he went off on a long walk, presumably to work his temper off. Other executives have talked about how he can be demanding and even unreasonable on such issues, but each of them says that’s because he genuinely believes the company’s money belongs to its shareholders and needs to be spent wisely.
It is noteworthy that, over the years, his philanthropy hasn’t ever been targeted by critics and investors and that is because he has always made a clear distinction between his personal wealth and that of Wipro. In that, he has been true to the letter and spirit of Milton Friedman’s dictum that a business isn’t about charity. Friedman elaborated: “The corporation is an instrument of the stockholders who own it. If the corporation makes a contribution, it prevents the individual stockholder from himself deciding how he should dispose of his funds."" That’s the reason why Premji worked hard over the years to keep upping his stake in the company, mostly by using his dividends to buy more stock.
The consolidation of his shareholding was meant to ensure that when the right moment came, his munificence could be meaningful.
Now that he has fulfilled his pledge and given away $21 billion to the Azim Premji Foundation, it is with the intention of doing something significant about the appalling standards of teaching in government schools across the country.
Some years ago, Business Insider worked with Wealth X, a company that researches and collates data of ultra high-net worth individuals, to develop a Generosity Index, defined as the ratio of lifetime donations made by billionaires to their current net worth. That methodology would rank Premji among the top philanthropists in the world today.
It is this sheer scale of Premji’s giving that places him in a different orbit, but what’s more important is that it helps restore some of capitalism’s lost sheen.
Millennials are increasingly rejecting capitalism without a clear idea of what should succeed it and this is markedly so in the US, the home of capitalism. By earning his billions fairly and then giving them away generously for a cause as worthy as education, Premji has shown us the enlightened face of capitalism.

70,2019-06-26,Wipro,"While the CEO will oversee M&As, the CFO will handle Wipro VenturesRishad Premji is set to take over as Wipro chairman on 31 July after his father Azim Premji steps down

With Rishad Premji set to become the chairman of Wipro Ltd on 31 July, India’s fourth-largest software services company has split his current role among three executives.
Chief executive officer and executive director Abidali Z. Neemuchwala who will also be re-designated as CEO and managing director will oversee mergers and acquisitions while chief financial officer Jatin Dalal will handle Wipro Ventures, the company’s $100 million corporate venture arm. Government relations will be handled by Wipro’s general counsel, Deepak Acharya.
Earlier this month, billionaire and philanthropist Azim Premji decided to step down from his current role at the company he led for more than half a century to devote more time to his charity work.
Azim Premji will continue as a non-executive director and founder chairman while Rishad will be the executive chairman.
Rishad has been so far overseeing corporate strategy, which includes M&A, Wipro Ventures, and relations with investors and the government.
A spokesperson for Wipro confirmed the changes.
“Subsequent to the appointment of Rishad Premji as Executive Chairman, effective 31 July 2019 subject to shareholder approval, his current roles and responsibilities will be aligned,"" said the spokesperson.
Rishad set up Wipro Ventures in 2015 and, under his watch, Wipro Ventures has deployed $65 million, or two-thirds of its corpus, in 18 startups and has helped its parent in more than 100 deals, underscoring the early success of the software services company in tapping into the disruptive startup ecosystem. Wipro Ventures is jointly managed by Venu Pemmaraju, formerly a senior investment manager at Intel Capital, and Wipro executive Biplab Adhya.
Both Pemmaraju and Adhya are based out of California and will now report to CFO Dalal.
A Harvard Business School alumnus, Rishad, 41, worked with GE Capital for four years and then with Bain and Co. in London for two years before returning to India to work with Wipro in 2007. Over the last 13 years, Rishad has worked across multiple departments in the company before being inducted to the board in 2015.
Other changes are also in line. Mint reported last week that Wipro’s lead independent director Narayanan Vaghul and chairman of the board’s nomination and remuneration panel Ashok Ganguly will retire next month, marking an end to their stints of more than two decades each. Both Vaghul and Ganguly were re-appointed for a three-year term in 2016, which ends on 31 July.
The changes come at a time when Wipro is trying to return to the growth pedestal. Wipro, which managed a 0.74% dollar growth in revenue in the year ended 31 March 2019 at $8.12 billion, has not reported double-digit growth in revenue in the last seven years.
The company posted a 13.1% revenue growth during the financial year 2011-12."

Singapore/Mumbai: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Hindustan Unilever Ltd. are among at least 100 Indian companies that may need to sell shares worth billions of dollars after the government proposed to raise the minimum public shareholding.
Companies must increase shares held by the public to a minimum 35% from 25% at present, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in her maiden budget, asking the market regulator to “mull"" the proposal.
The rule may result in equity sales of about  ₹3.9 trillion ($57 billion), creating a supply overhang on the market that’s trading near a life-time high, according to analysts including Centrum Broking Pvt. The proposal may have another side-effect: it could prompt domestic units of multinationals, who don’t rely on local funding, to delist from exchanges.
“The detail to watch out for is the time allowed to meet this new rule,"" said Rajiv Singh, who heads broking at Karvy Stock Broking Ltd. “This will mostly impact multinationals and state companies, but in the long term, it will help get more retail money in equities."" There are at least 40 state companies with public holding lower than 35%, he said.
Adequate liquidity
This isn’t the first time the government has forced founders to reduce their holdings to boost liquidity. In June 2010, the regulator gave companies three years to a ensure a minimum public float of at least 25%. That spurred share sales of at least $1 billion in June 2013 alone from companies including property developer DLF Ltd. and JSW Energy Ltd.
Exchanges globally have also introduced free-float rules to ensure liquidity for investors in a publicly traded stock. And index compilers such as MSCI Inc. take into account the percentage of shares available to investors when determining a stock’s representation in stock gauges.
“Timing and applicability need to be closely evaluated -- we don’t want this to be another forced sale,' said Vivek Gupta, partner and national head at KPMG in India.
Shares in Wipro Ltd. slumped 4.2%, the most since March 8. Coal India Ltd. slipped 3.7% and TCS ended 3.6% lower on Friday.
Budget highlights here"
68,2019-07-08,Wipro,"The Nifty IT index fell 2.5% on Friday after the budget was announced, double the rate at which the Nifty 500 index fellConstraining the outlook are growing headwinds for the financial services, a large business vertical for Indian IT

Mumbai: The Union budget dealt a painful blow to investors in Indian information technology (IT) stocks by imposing a tax on buyback of shares. IT companies have increasingly resorted to buybacks to return cash to shareholders, since they were more tax efficient. The new 20% tax has put a spanner in the works.
Considering that a high rate of cash return in recent years had propped up IT stocks, it isn’t surprising that investors are disappointed. The Nifty IT index fell 2.5% on Friday after the budget was announced, double the rate at which the broad Nifty 500 index fell. And that wasn’t all. The finance minister also said the government would propose to markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India that minimum public shareholding in listed companies be increased to 35% from the current 25% threshold. If implemented, this would require large stock sales by companies such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd, where promoter holding is above the threshold.
With these twin setbacks, the focus would necessarily shift to the financial performance of IT companies. And the picture here is not pretty. While revenue growth has steadied for some companies, margin woes continue.
Indian companies are adversely placed, with utilization levels already at optimal levels and talent crunch leading to higher wage costs, said Ashish Chopra, senior group vice president-institutional research (technology) at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd.
“(Profit) margin will likely decline across companies on a year-on-year comparison,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a June quarter results preview note. “While the reasons for decline will vary across companies, the broad factors are localization and increase in cost structure in the US, investments in digital and large deal-transition costs. Expect moderation in earnings assumptions ahead.""
As the chart shows, margins of IT companies have fallen in the past five years, across large-sized and mid-sized firms.
While normally, the annual depreciation in the rupee took care of cost inflation, this hasn’t been the case in recent years. Companies have struggled on the margins front because of multiple factors such as pricing pressure in the traditional IT services business, where they had a large exposure; higher on-site costs due to US visa restrictions; and a relatively low scale of operations in the upcoming digital services space.
While margins are under pressure, it’s not as if revenues are growing at an impressive pace either. No company is talking about a better FY20 when compared with FY19, barring a few who are coming from a low base, said Chopra.
Constraining the outlook are growing headwinds for financial services, a large business vertical for Indian IT. The uncertain global economic environment is undermining the recovery.
“Banking (and) financial services firms continue to face challenges from slowing global growth, a low interest rate environment, escalation of trade tensions and Brexit uncertainty,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. “We expect demand in the financial services vertical to moderate through the course of FY2020E.""
The growing spends on new-age technologies will help the firms mitigate the impact of the sluggishness in the banking and financial services sector to some extent. “We also expect Indian IT outsourcing firms to continue to get a good share of the spending on new technology,"" said Ravi Menon, an analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
But since overall earnings growth expectations are unexciting—earnings are likely to grow by about 10% on average in the next two fiscals for large IT firms—there isn’t much reason to get excited about IT stocks. In the past, investors were drawn to these counters because of the generous cash return policy. But the buyback tax has upset the cart.
Kotak’s analysts said buybacks for firms with a post-tax yield on cash of 5% would be earnings per share (EPS) accretive if they are done at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of less than 20 times. The hurdle rate now rises considerably, with EPS accretion guaranteed only when the buyback is done at a P/E multiple of less than 16.7 times. With large IT stocks trading at higher valuations, gone are the days of buybacks providing a boost to EPS and return ratios."
67,2019-07-09,Wipro,"More than 70 companies completed  ₹354.6 billion of share buybacks in the first half of 2019The proposed tax may affect share purchases worth  ₹100 billion that are in progress

The decision by India’s government to impose a tax on stock buybacks puts the brakes on what could have been another great year for share repurchases.
More than 70 companies, including software exporter Wipro Ltd., announced or completed  ₹354.6 billion ($5.2 billion) of share buybacks in the first half of 2019, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s about two thirds of the  ₹546 billion of such transactions for all of 2018, which was the most in at least six years, the data show.
“In the last three years, buybacks had supported the rally in stocks and helped improve the earnings per share for companies,"" said Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “That opportunity is now closed. Companies would now have to move back to distributing dividends, where the tax liability is lower.""
Taxing Times
The proposed tax may affect share purchases worth  ₹100 billion that are in progress. Infosys Ltd., India’s second-largest provider of IT services, has until Sept. 19 to complete buying back 82.6 billion rupees of its own stock, while Adani SEZ & Ports Ltd. is looking to repurchase shares worth 19.6 billion rupees, according to exchange filings.
Shares of Infosys extended two weeks of losses on Monday, while those of Adani SEZ closed at the lowest price since May 22.
Companies have been using buybacks as a more tax-efficient way to return excess cash to shareholders in addition to dividends, which attract a levy of 15%. India’s top five software exporters have returned a combined 867 billion rupees over the past three years via this route, according to Jefferies.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman closed the window Friday by announcing a 20% tax on stock repurchases. The trigger for the levy to kick in depends on when the company actually pays the money for the shares tendered, said Mehul Bheda, a partner and tax consultant at Dhruva Advisors in Mumbai.
“The tax saving on the buyback has been substantially reduced,"" he said.

New Delhi/Bengaluru: Azim Hasham Premji and Wipro Ltd — both born in 1945 — bid a farewell of sorts to each other on Tuesday.
The man who turned Wipro from a little-known producer of edible oils with just $2 million in sales in 1966 to over $8.5 billion in sales in the year ended 31 March, attended the last annual meeting of the company as executive chairman on Tuesday after steering it for more than half a century. He will devote his time to philanthropic activities after he retires on 30 July.
The mood at the company’s 73rd annual general meeting was sombre. Known for being frugal in his spending and austere in his lifestyle, Premji went about the day’s proceedings clinically, asking Wipro’s company secretary, M. Sanaulla Khan, or “Sana"" as he calls him, if the meeting had the requisite quorum. Sana replied in the affirmative.
He told the company’s shareholders that son Rishad Premji, chief strategy officer and member of the board, would take over as executive chairman from 31 July.
“He (Rishad) has been an integral part of the leadership team since 2007, and has a deep understanding of the company, its business strategy, its culture and its heritage. He is also completely committed to the values, which form the bedrock of Wipro,"" Premji said.
Premji expressed confidence that Wipro will be able to far outshine anything that has been done before.
“To lead in this time of rapid change, we have sharpened our strategy into four pillars based on what our clients need —business re-imagination, engineering transformation and modernization, connected intelligence and trust,"" he said.
“In order to build the capabilities that are needed to deliver these strategies, we have been investing significantly in four areas—digital, cloud, engineering services and cyber security,"" he added.
Premji’s principled and unwavering approach towards ethics, and attention to detail, transformed Western India Vegetable Products Ltd into Wipro, now India’s fourth largest software services firm.
Premji stands tall in India’s short list of philanthropists. In a country where giving is for others to do, the total value of funds committed by the Padma Vibhushan awardee to philanthropic activities is a staggering  ₹1.45 trillion ($21 billion). This includes a 67% economic ownership of Wipro."

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are expected to be flattish while global peers remained under pressure. Asian shares drifted lower on Wednesday after a lacklustre performance by Wall Street, while the dollar got a lift from robust the US retail data and a Brexit-driven dive in the pound.
Oil prices also took a spill on hints US tensions with Iran could be easing and as data showed stockpiles fell by less than expected last week. Early action was muted with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan off 0.18%. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.3% and South Korea 0.8%.
A surprisingly strong reading on US retail sales released overnight had outweighed weakness in industrial production for the June quarter and boosted the dollar.
The Dow eased 0.09%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.34% and the Nasdaq 0.43%. Not helping the mood was a threat from US President Donald Trump to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods.
In the domestic market, shares of Wipro, Yes Bank and Mindtree likely to see some momentum as the companies are expected to release their June quarter earnings on Wednesday. Kotak Instituional Equities expects constant-currency revenue growth of 0.4% and cross-currency headwind of 65 basis points (bps) for Wipro in June quarter. ""Revenue growth expectation is within Wipro’s guidance of revenue decline of 1% to revenue growth of 1% for the June 2019 quarter,"" it said.
Shares of the IndiGo is also likely to draw some attention as the board of InterGlobe Aviation Ltd will consider a proposal to induct new directors at its board meeting slated for Friday, according to a Mint report.
In currency markets, sterling was the star for all the wrong reasons. It slid 0.9% overnight to 27-month lows amid fears the UK could tumble out of the European Union with no trade deal to soften the blow.
The pound was last at $1.2409, a big come-down from its March peaks of $1.3383. The dollar was a major beneficiary at 97.381 on a basket of currencies, having risen 0.5% overnight. The euro fell back to $1.1210, while the dollar firmed to 108.27 yen.
The dollar’s gains tarnished gold a little, with the precious metal easing to $1,403.57 per ounce from a high above $1,418 on Tuesday.
Oil prices tried to steady in early trade after falling more than 3% overnight. Brent crude futures edged up 17 cents to $64.52, while US crude was flat at $57.62 a barrel.

NEW DELHI :
IT services major Wipro today reported a 12.6% year-on-year jump in Q1 profit to  ₹2,388 crore, boosted by robust demand from its key financial clients. Wipro said its June quarter consolidated net profit was  ₹2,388 crore as compared to  ₹2,121 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.
The market consensus forecast for the quarter was  ₹2,324 crore.
Wipro said its June quarter's consolidated revenue stood at  ₹14,716 crore as against  ₹13,978 crore last year, an increase of 5.3% on a year-on-year basis. Wipro reported a growth in its banking, financial services and insurance business.
Wipro shares closed 0.15% lower at  ₹259.70 today on the BSE.
Wipro chairman Azim Premji, who will retire as the company's head this month-end, had yesterday told company shareholders that the future of the IT firm would far outshine ""anything that we have done before"".
From July 31, 2019, Abidali Neemuchwala will be Wipro's new managing director, in addition to being the Chief Executive Officer.

60,2019-07-18,Wipro,"Wipro continues to struggle for growth even in a seasonally strong period for the industryInvestors are, however, cheering thefirm’s commitment to its generous cash return policy

Mumbai: Wipro Ltd shares rose 4% to Rs270 on Thursday, making it the biggest gainer among Nifty 50 stocks. The reasons for the increase in valuations are not to be found in the company’s quarterly results, reported post markets hours on Wednesday. After all, revenues fell 0.7% sequentially in constant currency terms in the June quarter and growth in the September quarter is estimated to range between 0 and 2%.
With Wipro struggling for growth in the first half of the year, which is seasonally a strong period for IT services companies, there is hardly any hope of a revival in the second half of the year. “Wipro’s weak start to the year will lead to another year of mid-single digit growth,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. While an increase in profit margins had driven valuations last year, that is not the case this time around. “Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin at 16.2% disappointed relative to our expectation of 16.8%, especially given better rupee realizations,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note.
What then explains the optimism on the Street? Of course, one reason could be that since Wipro shares had corrected about 13% from their highs in mid-June, this is a sort of a relief rally. But according to an analyst at a multinational brokerage, “The only reason being cited on the Street for the rally in Wipro shares is that the company reiterated its commitment to its cash return policy through buybacks."" After the government introduced a new buyback tax in this year’s budget, there were concerns that the cash return policy of some companies may get affected.
What’s more, Wipro’s dividends and buybacks translate into a 6% yield for investors, which is nothing to sneeze at.
But a moot question for investors is whether they can remain content with a decent dividend yield, when there are chances of giving up those gains in the form of capital losses. For one, Wipro’s revenue growth is hardly inspiring. Revenues grew 5.9% year-on-year on a like-to-like basis in Q1, far lower than the double-digit growth of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Infosys Ltd.
“We cut our revenue and earnings estimates for Wipro over FY20-21 to reflect weaker growth, a stronger rupee in FY20 and impact of weaker growth on margins. We maintain our ‘underperform’ rating as we expect Wipro to continue underperforming industry growth and believe it is over-valued at 16 times estimated FY20 earnings,"" Jefferies’ said in its note.
“Q1 results show that Indian IT companies are struggling for growth in general, and given that Wipro has been a laggard on this front, its challenges will be relatively higher,"" says the above-mentioned analyst.
If Wipro continues to disappoint on growth, investors will have to face the prospect of capital losses on their investment. But even otherwise, Wipro faces the overhang of high promoter ownership. With the budget suggesting a change in minimum public shareholding rules, Wipro’s promoters may well be forced to bring down their ownership. The resultant increase in supply of the stock can also hurt valuations.
Investors can cheer Wipro’s generous cash return policy if they want, but they can’t afford to ignore the company’s underlying financial performance"
61,2019-07-18,Wipro,"Management is hopeful that healthy deal pipeline will strengthen growth in rest of the fiscal yearSoftness in BFSI, and delays in ramp-up of projects weighed on the revenue growth

Mumbai: Wipro Ltd’s tribulations with growth continued in the June quarter with the company reporting a 1.3% fall in dollar revenues from the March quarter. In constant currency terms, revenues were up 5.9% from a year ago. This is in variance with the double digit revenue growth reported by peers TCS Ltd and Infosys Ltd.
Worse, while the peers are talking about sustainability or acceleration in growth momentum, Wipro is alluding to a flat performance. The guidance for the September quarter implies no growth at all at the lower end, and a mere 2% expansion from the quarter gone by at the upper end of the revenue projection. “2Q revenue growth guidance of 0-2% was at the lower end of the expected range of 0-2.5% despite the weaker base of Q1,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Softness in banking financial services and insurance (BFSI), and delays in ramp-up of projects weighed on the revenue growth, point out analysts. The management is hopeful, that healthy deal pipeline will strengthen growth in rest of the fiscal year.
Analysts, however, remain skeptical. Especially, in the light of emerging weakness in key business verticals. 
“Echoing commentary by other top tier IT services companies Wipro indicated weakness in capital markets and European banks within BFSI. While consumer business was weak in Q1 and was a key reason for the miss, management attributed it to completion of few large projects and deferral of new ones but expects a recovery in the vertical from 2Q onwards. The company also indicated weakness in healthcare and manufacturing,"" Arya Sen, analyst at Jefferies said in a note.
Not surprisingly, the mixed commentary on the back of rupee appreciation and unimpressive revenue growth guidance is triggering reset in earnings expectations. Jefferies fears the subdued growth may weigh on profitability. Reported margins are down 60 basis points (bps) from the March quarter.
“We have revised downward our earnings estimates for FY2020E/FY2021E, factoring in lower-than-expected revenue growth in Q1FY2020 along with muted growth in Q2 revenue guidance and reset of dollar/rupee rate. With inconsistent execution along with macro uncertainties, underperformance in revenue growth among large peers is expected to continue for FY2020E,"" Sharekhan Ltd said in a note."

Mumbai: Indian equities are likely to be lower due to weak global peers.
Asian shares wobbled in early Thursday trading as Wall Street stocks dropped on early signs that the US-China trade war could hurt corporate earnings, helping to underpin solid demand for safe-haven US Treasuries.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down a touch, while Japan’s benchmark Nikkei fell 1.3% and Australian shares dropped 0.4%.
South Korea’s market was off 0.4%. Moments earlier, the Bank of Korea unexpectedly cut its policy interest rate for the first time in three years, as uncertainties from a trade dispute with Japan added to anxiety about the economy’s outlook.
On Wall Street, all three major indexes fell on Wednesday as weak results from trade-related CSX Corp stoked concerns that the protracted trade standoff between the United States and China could hurt US corporate earnings.
Earlier in the week, the US President Donald Trump kept up the pressure on Beijing with a threat to put tariffs on another $325 billion of Chinese goods, amid market nervousness over when face-to-face talks will resume.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%, the S&P 500 lost 0.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5%.
Back home, shares of Yes Bank, Wipro, Mindtree, Allahabad Bank likely to be in focus today.
Yes Bank Ltd will be in focus as it reported a 91% drop in fiscal-first quarter profit on account of higher provisioning and lower other income. The private sector lender posted a net profit of  ₹113.76 crore for the quarter ended 30 June from  ₹1,260.36 crore a year ago.
Shares of Mindtree Ltd, which was acquired by engineering giant Larsen and Toubro Ltd will also be in focus. It reported 41% drop in its quarterly profit because of higher expenses. Net profit fell to  ₹92.7 crore in the quarter ended 30 June from  ₹158.2 crore in the year earlier. Profit plunged 53% from  ₹198.4 crore in the preceding quarter.
The Union cabinet on Wednesday cleared major changes to the bankruptcy law that will enforce a strict 330-day timeline for the insolvency resolution process, including any legal challenges, and uphold secured creditors’ priority right on the sale or liquidation proceeds of bankrupt companies.
Meanwhile, the US treasury yields fell as concerns about the US-China trade war boosted demand for safe haven debt and after data showed weakness in the US housing market. Yields on benchmark 10-year and 30-year bonds climbed more than seven basis points each, to 2.06% and 2.57%, respectively.
In the foreign exchange market, the dollar nursed light losses on Thursday, weighed down by lower US yields and a rebound by the pound from 27-month lows.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Wednesday said the dollar was overvalued by 6% to 12%, based on near-term economic fundamentals. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies was nearly flat at 97.119 after shedding 0.2% the previous day.
The euro was not much changed at $1.1285 after crawling up 0.1% on Wednesday. The greenback fell 0.3% to 107.660 yen, extending an overnight loss of 0.3%. Sterling was steady at $1.2433. It had stumbled to $1.2382 overnight, its lowest level since April 2017 on concerns of a no-deal Brexit.
Precious metals were in demand. Gold prices rose more than 1% on Wednesday as weaker-than-expected US data reinforced expectations for an interest rate cut by the US Federal Reserve later this month, dragging the dollar lower.
Spot gold was 1.2% higher to finish at $1,426.60 per ounce. It last stood $1,427.22 per ounce. Silver soared about 2.5% on Wednesday to hit a more than four-month high of $15.96, extending gains for a fourth straight session. The metal was last quoted at $16.06.
Oil futures fell on Thursday, pushing losses for a fourth straight session after US government data showed large builds in refined product stockpiles. Brent crude futures were down 0.1% to $63.62 a barrel, while US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 0.3% to $56.61 a barrel.

NEW DELHI :
After having converted a cooking oil company into a $8.5 billion IT behemoth, Azim Premji retires today as Wipro chairman and managing director.

56,2019-08-20,Wipro,"The Nifty IT index slipped 1.31% in Aug even as the rupee fell 3.70% against the dollarA Falling rupee means higher dollar earnings for IT firms, but larger concerns hit IT stocks in August

Technology investors typically take heart from a falling rupee as it promises higher dollar earnings, but August was different, as larger concerns weighed on these stocks.
The National Stock Exchange’s (NSE’s) benchmark Nifty IT index has slipped 1.31% in August so far, even as the rupee fell 3.70% against the dollar. Top IT stocks like Infosys Ltd, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd and Wipro Ltd are down 2-5% during the month.
Analysts said technology stocks fared poorly in the June quarter as well, while the outlook for the rest of this fiscal year remains bleak. Ravi Menon, lead analyst for IT at Elara Capital said investors are still cautious on technology stocks due to the weak guidance offered by the managements at various companies. “Though the decline in rupee means higher margins for IT companies, only a sustained weakness in the local currency will benefit these companies,"" Menon said.
In this year so far, the rupee has fallen 2.34% although it strengthened 0.33% in July. The managements have pointed to weakness in the US and Europe, as well as the banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) sector. Low unemployment levels in the US, high attrition, a tightening visa regime and pricing pressure on traditional projects have been the main factors behind the contraction in gross margins, said analysts.
The Nifty IT index rose 23.78% and 12.18% in 2017 and 2018, respectively, while the benchmark Nifty was up 28.65% and 5.91% in both years. In 2018, the rupee weakened 8.45%, while it strengthened 6.34% in 2017.
“Tier-I IT pack delivered constant currency revenue growth of -1%-4.2% q-o-q while tier-II delivered dollar revenue growth of -5.2%-4.7% on sequential basis. Firms under our coverage are uncertain on Q2 revenue growth (TCS, Wipro) which could incrementally reflect on FY20E growth,"" brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher said in a report on 14 August. “Guidance cuts or caution was given by L&T Infotech (mentioned improvement Q3 onwards), L&T Technologies cut guidance from 14-16% to 12-14%, weakness due to hi-tech & telecom…Infosys is the only exception to have raised FY20 guidance from 7.5-9.5% to 8.5-10%,"" it said.
According to Prabhudas Lilladher, the factors which led to margin decline include increase in sub-contracting cost, higher visa costs, rupee appreciation, large deal transition costs and continued pressure on realization. “However, we believe that Q1FY20 will be the bottom for margins and we can see margin uptick in coming quarters. Though the scope of margin improvement will be minimum as rupee will act as a headwind,"" the analysts wrote.
Weak macros in the US and Europe will translate into slower demand, while weakening of BFSI and manufacturing, legacy businesses which still constitute two-thirds of tier-I IT revenues have been dragging overall growth in the sector, analysts said.
“Most of the tier-II firms reported either vertical-specific or client-related issues that drove sharper deceleration in their revenues. Y-o-y growth gap between Tier-I and Tier-II was at its lowest in the past eight quarters at 0.5%. Led by revenue under performance and aggravated decline in margins, valuations gap between tier-I and tier-II is now at over 30% versus negative 8% two years ago,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
Hiring continued to gain pace with net addition of 27,313 employees by the top five IT firms in Q1. TCS topped the list of net additions among the large cap firms with 12,356 employees followed by HCL Tech with 5,935. However, attrition continued to remain elevated for all IT firms with supply side crunches led by lower unemployment rate and H-1B visa policy.

BENGALURU :
Global software major Wipro on Tuesday tied-up with the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for advanced research and innovation in autonomous systems, robotics and 5G.
""We have jointly set up the Wipro-IISc research and innovation network, a hybrid industry academia collaboration unit, to drive idea discovery, research and innovation in technology and product design,"" said the city-based IT behemoth in a statement here.
The industry-academia partnership will focus on research and development (R&D) in disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, visual computing, human computer interaction and vehicle-to-everything communication.
""We will leverage the research insights for our customers and the industry ecosystem while the Institute will benefit from advancing its research goal and capacity building besides commercialisation of the research outcomes,"" said the statement.
Wipro Chief Executive Abidali Neemuchwala said the partnership would enable them to develop innovative solutions in transformative technologies.
""IISc believes collaboration between academia and the industry is a great way of solving challenging real-world problems,"" said Neemuchawala in the statement.
IISc Director Anurag Kumar said the capabilities and talent of both partners would support their joint initiative to solve complex problems in autonomous vehicular systems, robotics and 5G (fifth generation broadband service).
""As part of Wipro's focus on emerging technologies and innovations, we made key investments in the three domains,"" said Kumar.
Wipro's expertise and understanding of domain-specific business challenges, coupled with the Institute's research capabilities, will create synergies to solve complex industry problems and develop next-generation mobility solutions.
As a global software vendor, Wipro has been investing in the three domains over the last eight years.
Autonomous systems work at the convergence of emerging technologies and are poised to disrupt multiple industries and verticals such as mobility, insurance, finance, smart cities and infrastructure, among others.
""We have developed multiple solutions such as large-scale simulators for autonomous systems, including a grounds-up autonomous vehicle, built on our IP platform capable of perceiving and navigating through cognitive algorithms and capable of seamless V2X communications based on 5G systems and services,"" added the statement.

54,2019-08-29,Wipro,"The proportion of Ebitda that converted into operating cash flow in FY19 was 98%, most among large IT firmsThe variation in growth rates may be part of the reason

The story at Wipro Ltd in recent years has been a series of false starts. Even as revenue growth for its larger peers, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) and Infosys Ltd, accelerated, Wipro lagged. But one metric where the company is scoring is cash conversion.
The proportion of Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) that converted into operating cash flow stood at 98% in fiscal year 2019, the highest among large IT companies. Wipro maintains this lead with cash flows to Ebitda staying at 95% in the 12 months ended June 2019, showed an analysis by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Wipro’s growth in operating cash flow and free cash flow exceeded Ebitda growth in 12 months to June. Free cash flow adjusts for capital expenditure as well, apart from cash operating expenses.
Importantly, this is not a recent phenomenon. Cash flow growth is far superior at the company even using three-year annual average growth rates. “Over the last three years, cash conversion has been stable for Infosys/TCS, deteriorated at HCL Technologies Ltd and improved for Wipro,"" analysts at Nomura India said in a note.
What explains the variation in performance is better receivables management. Comparatively, the receivables position increased at other large IT companies, with Infosys seeing material deterioration in recent quarters.
The variation in growth rates may be part of the reason. Constant currency revenue growth year-on-year remains in mid-single digits at Wipro, while its larger peers are growing in double digits. “Typically, a growth-focused company may give some leeway to customers on payment terms,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity. Even so, as the analyst added, Wipro is doing a decent job in getting money quickly from customers.
Of course, all of this is but a silver lining on the dark cloud of poor growth. Most analysts remain sceptical about Wipro’s growth outlook. The September quarter revenue growth guidance indicates no major improvement. The pressure on legacy business is more pronounced at Wipro than at other large companies, showed an analysis by HDFC Securities Institutional Research.
This is reflected in the valuation discount vis-à-vis other large peers. “TCS and Infosys trade at premium valuations due to revenue predictability and stable performance,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in the June quarter results review note, referring to the valuation gap in IT stocks. For Wipro’s returns to pick up, revenue growth will have to inch up as well."

Hyderabad: Built with over 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, a built-up area spanning about 65 football fields, a helipad and 49 elevators which move one floor per second, e-commerce giant Amazon's largest campus building in the world is the latest landmark in Hyderabad.
Built in the Financial District, a key IT cluster, this campus with 1.8 million square feet office space is Amazon's first owned office building outside the US and its single largest building globally.
Spread over 9.5 acres, this 282-feet tall building can house more than 15,000 employees.
The massive campus, built amid the gleaming towers of various corporate giants, is equipped with 49 elevators, which can move a floor per second. Built on three million square feet of construction area, it is also Amazon's single largest building in the world in terms of area.
Amazon officials say the total built-up area, when spread out, will span over 68 acres or approximately 65 football fields. Out of total built-up space, 1.2 million square feet is earmarked for recreation and parking.
""The campus contains over 2.5 times more steel than the Eiffel Tower, measured by weight,"" revealed Amazon Vice President and Global Real Estate and Facilities Director John Schoettler at the inauguration of the facility recently.
Interfaith prayer rooms, a mother's room, quiet rooms, showers, helipad and an all-day open cafeteria are some of the key features of the campus, built in a short span of three years. The company officials say the structure is designed to facilitate inclusion and diversity.
It also features casual, collaborative workspaces, as well as private areas for concentration and confidentiality.
""Every detail is aimed at improving well-being and efficiency, from Destination Control Systems to manage elevators that can move 972 people simultaneously, to 290 conference rooms and 3 scrum areas per floor to foster collaboration,"" the company said.
As many as 2,000 persons were on site every day for 39 months to construct the building, spending 18 million man-hours.
Last year, the construction was awarded the Golden Trophy and Certificate from National Safety Council for safe construction process.
The building meets stringent safety standards, with 110 km of fire protection system conduits.
The campus has one conference room seat for every 3.25 workstations, higher than the global ration of 1:5.
With sustainability at its core, the campus has more than 300 trees dotting its grounds with three specimen trees aged over 200 years. It also has a 850,000 litre water recycling plant.
The company officials declined to divulge the investment made in this campus but said hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to create the facility.
Stating that the facility reaffirms their long-term commitment to India, they pointed out that Amazon already announced $5 billion investment in the country and another 500 million dollar in food retail.
Amazon already houses its largest India fulfillment centre in Hyderabad. Spread over four lakh square feet, the centre is located near Rajiv Gandhi International Airport. The company last month announced that it will be expanded to 5.8 lakh square feet.
Hyderabad is already home to giants like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, Deloitte, Accenture, TCS, Wipro and Infosys.
After Apple Inc opened its development centre in 2016, IT Minister K.T. Rama Rao had declared that Hyderabad became home to four of the top five most valued tech companies to have their largest offices outside the US.
Software giant Microsoft already has largest presence in Hyderabad outside their headquarters in the US.
Search giant Google also plans to build its biggest campus outside its US headquarters. Coming up on 7.2 acres in the Financial District, it is expected to house 13,000 employees. An agreement for this was signed between Google and the Telangana government in 2015.

Bengaluru: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting has launched Wipro Consumer Care–Ventures to invest in startups in the consumer brands space. The company said on Thursday it will invest in companies in India and Southeast Asia that have ""strong entrepreneurs"" and startups with a ""sound business model"".
The venture will focus on companies with a “differentiated approach where both parties can learn by leveraging their strengths and add value to each other"", the company added.
To kick-start this venture, Wipro Consumer Care has appointed Sumit Keshan, a former Wipro executive, as the Managing Partner of the venture. “Our investment in 'Happily Unmarried' was our first step to establishing this venture capital fund. Apart from financial capital, what we bring to the table is deep knowledge of operations and the ability to scale up, and a strong understanding of consumers in India and South East Asia markets. These would support startups in their endeavour to grow rapidly"", Keshan said.
In 2017, the company invested in a New Delhi-based startup called Happily Unmarried, which markets men’s and women’s grooming products under the brands Ustraa and Happily Unmarried, respectively.
Within consumer brands business, the primary area of focus would be categories that are of interest to the company. Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting operates mainly in personal care, skincare, home care, and lighting categories. The company intends to invest in new-age startups in digital, e-commerce, and other ventures that adopt an innovative approach to reach consumers.
Wipro Consumer Care & Lighting is a $1 billion plus arm of Wipro Enterprises, and is among the fastest growing fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) businesses in India. It has a strong presence with significant market share across segments in India, South East Asia, and the Middle East."

A one-time exemption could save about $1 billion in taxes for Indian companies that announced share buybacks this year, according to Umesh Mehta, head of research at Samco Securities Ltd.
Share buybacks announced before the government introduced a 20% levy on such transactions on July 5 will be exempt, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said at a press conference on Friday. More than 70 companies including software exporters Wipro Ltd. and Infosys Ltd. had announced or completed buybacks totaling 355 billion rupees ($5.2) billion before that date, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Companies had opted for share buybacks because they thought it was an efficient way to return money to shareholders, according to Ajay Bodke, chief executive officer for fund management services at Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. “They were blindsided when the tax was brought in, so this exemption can act as a one-time boost,"" he said.

Mumbai: Shares of information technology companies fell on Monday after investors booked profit as analysts see no material impact on tax rates after the government cut tax rates for domestic companies.
Analysts said IT stocks had traded at a premium to other stocks as investors took to defensive plays due to concern over an economic slowdown and liquidity crunch.
On Monday, shares of Infosys Ltd fell 3.2%, Wipro Ltd declined 2.2%, Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 2%, Tech Mahindra Ltd 1.7%, HCL Technologies Ltd 1.3%. Nifty IT Index slumped 2%.
According to a Credit Suisse report, there will be no material impact on tax rates on IT services companies following the tax cuts. The current blended effective tax rates of 22-27% are a combination of higher tax rates paid outside India and much lower tax rates paid in India. IT companies, thus pay lower than 25% tax rates in India and the cuts announced Friday will not lower their overall tax rates.
Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said it has increased underweight on the sector to 390 basis points and remains cautious as growth in tech spends in BFS clients in the US and European geography will be muted compared to last year due to trade war concerns, uncertainty on central bank policy and interest rates, Brexit related uncertainty. The rupee advantage will also weaken now.
The new taxation rule will be neutral event for Indian IT companies at the consolidate level. Tax rates will be lower than 25% as US and UK rates are at 21% and 18% respectively, Prabhudas Lilladher report adds."

BENGALURU :
Indian IT services companies are increasing their local hiring numbers in the US, despite higher costs, to counter the increasingly stringent norms of the H-1B visa programme that allows companies to temporarily employ foreign workers in the US in specialty occupations.
On 13 September, Infosys Ltd said it plans to hire 1,000 people locally by 2023 for its just-launched Technology and Innovation Center in Arizona. The company has surpassed its “spring 2017 commitment to hire 10,000 American workers as part of its ongoing efforts to accelerate the pace of innovation for US enterprises"", it said.
In June, Wipro Ltd announced the opening of a new centre of excellence in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area of the US, for which it will hire 100 people locally over the next two years to boost its already substantial presence in the region. “Wipro specifically plans to leverage local Minnesota talent in addition to providing opportunities for recent university graduates and experts keen on developing their technology-related skills,"" Wipro said in a press release on 13 June.
India’s largest IT services provider Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS), already has about 30,000 US employees, making it the largest employer in the US among Indian peers.
Cognizant, too, continues to hire in the US, “keeping up with the needs of our business growth. Nearly 76% of our revenue is from North America. We have nearly 60 US facilities and clients in 49 states. In 2017, we committed to hire at least 25,000 professionals over a five-year period,"" said a Cognizant spokesperson.
HCL Technologies Ltd, too, has brought down its dependencies on H-1B visas by hiring more people locally. The company has about 17,000 employees in the US and 64.7% of them are US citizens, according to estimates from industry insiders.
At present, there is a yearly cap of 65,000 on new H1-B visas, with an additional 20,000 visas for those with advanced degrees from a US institution.
The number of H-1B visas issued during September-October 2018 dropped 10% year-on-year from 373,400 to 335,000 because of tighter scrutiny, which led to higher on-site hiring in FY19, according to a June report by rating firm ICRA. The number of H-1B visas for initial employment that these companies have received has fallen by as much as 40% between 2014 and 2017, according to a report by Nasscom.
“As a result, the share of H-1B employees in total employment in the US has declined and the share of US-born employees has risen by 5-7%,"" it said.
The high visa denial rates are a key contributor to the increase in on-site hiring.
The visa denial rate for Wipro was highest at 62% in the first quarter of FY19 up from 7% in FY15, according to an analysis of data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) by the National Foundation for American Policy, a non-profit body engaged in public policy research. Infosys had a denial rate of 57% in October-December 2018, followed by HCL Technologies (43%), and TCS (37%). USCIS follows an October-September fiscal year.
ICRA said on-site hiring increases the cost for Indian IT services players and adds to higher visa fees and compliance cost associated with enhanced scrutiny of visa applications. “There have been several proposed legislations to substantially increase the minimum wages for H1B visa holders, which will impact the margins adversely, if implemented."" Higher on-site hiring results in higher wage bills and lower margins, it added."

Bengaluru: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting has allocated  ₹200 crore for the venture fund it launched on 19 September, said CEO Vineet Agrawal. He said the fund has already received a “lot of traction and the team is already talking to about 10 startups per day.""
The company is, however, looking at investing only in 3-4 startups per year. Agrawal said the potential of the startup and Wipro’s ability to add value are the two main criteria they are looking at. “A startup is coming to us because they can get more than what a regular financer can offer,"" he said.
The venture fund titled ‘Wipro Consumer Care-Ventures’ will invest in startups in the consumer brands space focussed in the India and Southeast Asia markets. “We are not entering China mainly because of issues such as language barriers,"" Agrawal said.

43,2019-10-02,Wipro,"Unlike WiFi that uses radio waves, LiFi is a wireless communication technology that uses light waves to provide an internet connectionGiven that visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than radio waves LiFi’s speed can be 100 times faster than WiFi

Despite being a much speedier internet technology as compared to WiFi, LiFi implementations are yet to make any dent in India.
Unlike WiFi or wireless fidelity that uses radio waves, LiFi or light fidelity is a wireless communication technology that uses light waves to provide an internet connection. It allows for much faster data transfer and is considered more secure than WiFi. Given that the visible light spectrum is 10,000 times larger than radio waves and hence LiFi’s speed can be 100 times faster than WiFi.
Despite these advantages, Wipro Lighting that partnered with Scotland-based pureLiFi--a global leader in LiFi technology--more than two years ago to develop new applications for the wireless communications and lighting market in Asia, is yet to see commercial success with LiFi in India, acknowledges Vineet Agrawal, CEO of Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting.
He points out that WiFi spectrum is limited but when you use light, the spectrum increases. Second, data transfer is much faster, and third, data privacy is much higher. ""The only disadvantage is that when there’s no light, you can’t get the data,"" notes Agrawal.
Agrawal believes LiFi solutions will eventually work successfully in sectors like banks where there is huge need for data privacy. “As of now, we have only got pilot installations in areas such as office space and also at a manufacturing site, but it’s a matter of time that it will take off."" The technology has a relatively small set of customers as it is driven by need, and the customers that need data security already have ways to protect their data, explains Agrawal. “Cost is also a deterrent, which we are working to bring down,"" he added.
For instance, a 9W (9 watt) Wipro WiFi-enabled Smart Bulb is priced at Rs.2099 while a standard 9W Wipro LED bulb costs only Rs.240. Other products are similarly priced. On 1 October, for instance, Philips too announced the launch of its ‘Philips Smart Wi-Fi’ LED range of bulbs in India. However, comparisons with LED or WiFi-enabled LED bulbs are not fair since unlike WiFi-enabled LED bulbs that retail in the market, LiFi products are typically business to business (B2B) deals. As an example, PureLiFi has begun offering a LiFi starter kit for small businesses and institutions at the cost of £2500 (about Rs.2.18 lakh at today's rates), excluding delivery and duties.
The term Li-Fi was coined by Prof. Harald Haas, founder and chief scientist of pureLiFi, and also a professor of mobile communications at Edinburgh University. Li-Fi is a category of Optical Wireless Communications (OWC). According to the pureLiFi website, each year the world utilises 60% more wireless data than the previous one, and the number of connected devices (such as mobile phones and smart devices) is likely to be in excess of 50 billion by 2020. “If internet users are going to continue to live in the wireless cloud with wearables, virtual reality and in a fully connected world, we need new wireless technology such as LiFi to realise this future,"" pureLiFi said in a statement when it partnered with Wipro Lighting two years back.
Global Market Insights has forecast the worldwide LiFi market to reach over $75 billion by 2023.
To be sure, Wipro isn’t the first to talk about LiFi. In June this year, Signify (formerly Philips Lighting) launched one of the first commercial LiFi systems. Signify's LiFi system, called Trulifi, is being piloted by Icade, the French real estate investment company in its smart office in La Defense, Paris."

40,2019-10-06,Wipro,"Companies look to invest in budding consumer startups, which have not been hit by slowdownConsumer spending across consumer goods segments have fallen in past few quarters

Leading fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) firms and retailers including Haldiram’s, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting Ltd, LuLu Group and Burman Family Holdings, the family office of Dabur India, are scouting for investments in consumer brand startups to boost growth in a weak economy, multiple investors and industry executives said.
Consumer spending across the FMCG and consumer packaged goods (CPG) segment have fallen sharply in the last couple of quarters.
Wipro Consumer recently launched a venture fund to invest in startups in the consumer brands space. A Wipro spokesperson said the company will look to invest about  ₹10-30 crore in early to mid-stage startups. “We will be looking at those startups where we can add value as well learn from them. Financial returns would be an important objective of the fund as well as adding strategic value, but all as a minority investor,"" the spokesperson added.
Dabur Group’s family office Burman Family Holdings’ has been evaluating startups in the branded consumer goods space, according to a person aware of the group’s investment strategy. Gaurav Burman, director of Dabur International and investor in Burman Family Holdings, said his family fund’s investments will be stage-agnostic with a long-term investment view. “We have no minimum limit on ticket size, although we will look to deploy at least  ₹70 crore per investment through the life of the opportunity,"" Burman said in an email.
LuLu Group, an Indian MNC that operates hypermarkets and retail chains has also been eyeing Indian startups in consumer goods, a consultant aware of the development said. LuLu Group did not respond to an email seeking comments until press time.
Haldiram’s, one of the oldest names in packaged foods space in India, is in discussions with multiple startups in the consumer brands space including Bengaluru-based Frozen Bottle, a quick-service restaurant (QSR) chain that sells milkshakes and desserts, Mint reported on 14 September. While big FMCG and CPG majors turn to consumer brands led by startups, their overall revenues have also been declining consistently in the past couple of quarters, amid an economic slowdown.
Dabur, Hindustan Unilever, ITC Ltd and Britannia Industries have acknowledged that the slowdown has hit their revenue, especially among premium portfolio brands.
A Credit Suisse report this month said the FMCG segment revenue is likely to decline by around 5% in the second and third quarters of 2019-20. FMCG revenue growth had earlier declined from 11% in the third quarter of 2018-19 to around 7% in the first quarter of the current fiscal, the worst revenue growth in the last 15 years.
Analysts and industry observers attribute falling consumer spending to not just low incomes, but also a lack of brand innovation, and failure to understand niche consumer needs, at least in Tier-1 and Tier-2 markets. The renewed interest displayed by traditional firms in startup-led consumer brands, is mostly steered by the fact that these brands virtually saw no impact of the economic slowdown.
“When you are the market leader with a 30% market share, slowdowns are scary. (But) when you are an insurgent brand with less than 1% market share and have a strong product and brand narrative, you should continue growing,"" said Deepak Shahdadpuri, founder and MD, DSG Consumer Partner. According to him, CPG start-ups are least impacted by the cyclical slowdown because they are doing between  ₹50 lakh to  ₹5 crore of net revenue per month. Between May to August from the DSGCP portfolio, companies like Veeba, Sleepy Owl, Arata, The Moms Co., Chai Point, Suzette Kitchen Garden, and Goa Brewing, did not see any slowdown, added Shahdadpuri. “It could also be because the companies we back tend to be in the more premium categories in Tier-1 cities where the slowdown has not had the same impact yet,"" Shahdadpuri added.
Vinay Singh, co-founder and partner at consumer-focused VC fund Fireside Ventures said his portfolio of brands across segments like personal care, clothing and accessories, and lifestyle, witnessed record month-on-month growth (in terms of revenues) in the last couple of months. Fireside Ventures had earlier raised money from ITC, Emami, L’Oreal, and Unilever to reinvest in consumer startups.
To be sure, if smaller brands which appeals to a niche consumer base escape the slowdown, then logically, big FMCG and CPG majors should also be emulating them, but that isn’t the case in the Indian scenario.
According to Harsha Razdan, partner, head of consumer markets at KPMG India, a large company with its vast distribution network is better off acquiring startups and layering their distribution network on top of the new brand, mostly because small brands are splintered in size and reach, which poses a logistics challenge."
39,2019-10-10,Wipro,"Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for top four IT firms, almost same as growth in Q1Growth at TCS is likely to fall to single digits, after four straight quarters of double-digit growth

The July-September quarter has historically been the strongest one for Indian IT services companies. But in this fiscal year, there is unlikely to be any show of strength when companies announce second quarter (Q2) results.
“Organic growth is estimated at 2.4% sequentially for the top four IT firms— TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies and Wipro—in the September quarter, barely higher than the 2.3% growth reported in each of the preceding two quarters,"" says an IT sector analyst at a domestic institutional firm, who declined to be named.
What’s more, year-on-year revenue growth at industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) is expected to fall to single-digit levels, after four consecutive quarters of double-digit growth.
“We see risks to double-digit growth guidance at TCS,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a results preview note to clients. Analysts expect the company to report 9-9.5% growth, down from 10.6% in Q1. While TCS doesn’t give guidance, its management had earlier sounded confident of achieving double-digit growth in FY20.
If the company’s growth falls to single-digit levels in what is meant to be the strongest quarter in the year, it’s fair to conclude that investors would need to settle for lower-than-anticipated growth for the whole year.
Indian IT companies have been sounding cautious about tech spending in the banking and financial services (BFS) vertical, pointing to weakness in areas such as capital markets, European banks and some US regional banks that are going through mergers and acquisitions.
This was attested to when Accenture Plc. reported results for the quarter ended August late last month. Revenues from its financial services vertical grew 4%, far lower than the 7.2% company-wide growth. This was mainly owing to a continued decline in revenues from European banks.
Since the BFS vertical is a mainstay for most Indian IT services firms, it isn’t surprising that overall growth rates are under pressure. “We believe that IT spending will moderate in financial services in 2019 after a strong year in 2018. IT services companies face pressure from higher squeeze on run spends (i.e. traditional services), while spending in new areas remains steady,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients last month.
While revenue growth is coming under pressure, profit margins, too, have been falling. Increasing protectionism has resulted in a higher cost structure in these companies’ US on-site operations.
To be sure, the impact of these headwinds will be felt differently across different companies. In TCS’s case, a high-base last year will also impact growth. Infosys, on the other hand, had a relatively lower base; besides, it has a set of BFS clients that are reportedly increasing tech spend. It’s little wonder shares of the latter have outperformed TCS by a wide margin in the past three months."

Mumbai: Macro-economic inflation data along with the second quarter financial results are expected to turn the Indian equity markets volatile during the coming week.
The Indian rupee's movement against the US dollar in the backdrop of Brexit and impact of rising geo-political tensions in the Middle East and its effect on crude oil prices may also affect the investor sentiments.
Hindustan Unilever, ACC, Multi Commodity Exchange of India, Wipro, Mindtree, Cyient, TVS Motor, Ambuja Cements, Reliance Industries and several others are likely to announce their Q2 earnings results during the week, starting 14 October.
""Developments over the missile strike on Iranian tanker, Narendra Modi-Xi Jinping summit in Chennai and Brexit issue will sway the investor sentiments,"" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research, Motilal Oswal Financial Services.
""Over the next few days, few heavyweights will be announcing results, which could keep the markets volatile,"" Khemka said.
According to Vinod Nair, Geojit Financial Services' Research Head, the preview analysis of Q2 result is muted due to no real increase in demand and prices, which may impact the market performance during the month.
""The August IIP data, which declined to — 1.1%, indicates that the risk of slowdown is likely to reflect in Q2 corporate earnings,"" Nair said.
On Friday, official data showed that contraction in manufacturing activity slowed India's factory output growth to (-)1.1% in August from a 4.6% rise reported in July.
The growth has hit the 81-month low.
""The markets will react to the poor August IIP number,"" said Deepak Jasani, Head of Retail Research, HDFC Securities. Release of RBI MPC minutes and China Q3 GDP number, both due on October 18, would also be watched closely, Jasani said.
Macro-economic data point of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI) for September will be released on 14 October. The balance of trade data for September will also be released during the week.
""Dismal IIP numbers suggest pressure on the rupee and more rate cuts coming,"" said Sajal Gupta, Head, Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities. The rupee might appreciate a bit within an expected range of 70.60 to 71.30, Gupta added.
On technical charts, the NSE Nifty50 remains in an immediate uptrend. ""The Nifty holding above the 50-day SMA and bouncing back this week, the bulls do seem to have an upper hand, at least for the short term,"" Jasani said.
""Further upsides are likely once the immediate resistance of 11,363 is taken out. Crucial supports to watch for resumption of weakness is now at 11,158,"" he said."
35,2019-10-14,Wipro,"Liquidity crunch in rural trade and lower rural wages continued to dampen demand for the maker of Santoor and Chandrika soapsCEO Vineet Agrawal says overall volume growth for the company grew in 'mid-single digits' in the last six months

New Delhi: Consumer goods company Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting said that rural markets grew at a slower pace than urban markets in the September quarter in a sign that a liquidity crunch in rural trade, and lower rural wages continued to dampen demand for the maker of Santoor and Chandrika soaps in India’s hinterland.
“In the last three months clearly rural (growth) has been slower than urban,"" Vineet Agrawal, chief executive officer, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting told reporters on Monday. He further said that while the company started witnessing an overall demand slowdown post March, weak demand has been compounding in rural markets in the last two-three months.
Agrawal said that overall volume growth for the company grew in “mid-single digits"" in the last six months with rural growth lagging urban largely on account of slow wage growth in those markets, as well as, retailers going easy on stocking inventory amid a cash crunch in the market. ""Stock levels have gone down, farm prices have been depressed, and a lot of construction workers who used to send back money have been impacted (because of the slowdown),"" Agrawal told reporters in Delhi. ""I'm not sure from our industry how much the consumer demand has come down but I think it is also a lot of trade correction which is happening, so if trade was keeping three weeks worth of stock they have probably brought it down to two weeks and so it had a ripple effect happening across the market.""
He, however, said that urban demand had continued to stay intact.
The company’s commentary on consumer demand comes amidst a slowdown in the market that is seeing companies spanning automobiles to biscuit makers complain of a weak demand. For makers of fast moving consumer goods the focus has especially been on reviving tepid demand rural markets that draw a large part of sales for some companies.
Rural markets have traditionally grown 3-5% points faster than urban for consumer goods companies on account of increasing affordability, availability, and demand, research firm Nielsen wrote in its quarterly update on the FMCG sector in the month of June. However, Nielsen then noted that rural growth was slowing down at double the rate of urban in recent quarters, narrowing the gap between urban and rural growth rates. The company's commentary on rural demand corroborates Nielsen's projections of a cooling off in demand.
India is also in the middle of the festive season when retailers and brands typically see an uptick in demand amid a shopping frenzy from consumers, but Agrawal added that so far the festive season that commenced with Onam in south had been soft for the company.
""From our perspective, Onam was not great neither was Ganpati, but a lot of government stimulus has happened post that. Let us see how it all moves,"" he said hinging hopes on Diwali that is scheduled for the end of October.
Wipro sells India's second-largest soap brand Santoor that is also the company’s largest-selling brand. A weak demand has also prompted the company to take price cut,s especially as raw material prices that of palm oil have remained low. Santoor took a price cut of 4% to 14% on two of its stock keeping units over the last few months according to an October report by brokerage firm Elara Capital. Competition, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, too slashed prices across its key Lux, Lifebuoy, and Dove soap brands in the last quarter to pass on benefits of lower commodity costs and shore up a weak consumer demand.
Agrawal said that he expects demand to bounce back on the back of a slew of government measures that have been taken. ""One has to wait and watch as to what gets translated to demand,"" he added."
37,2019-10-14,Wipro,"Organically, we should continue to grow at 20% but where we will be 2-3 years from now will depend on when we do larger acquisitions, says Ashok Soota, executive chairman, Happiest Minds

NEW DELHI :
At 76, Ashok Soota, the man who led information technology (IT) services giant Wipro for 15 years and then co-founded and headed mid-size IT firm Mindtree for the next 10, is looking for more adventures. So he’s off for a paragliding trip to Bir Billing (Himachal Pradesh) even as he charts the future of his newest startup, Happiest Minds, a company he says is born digital and agile which gives it the edge in emerging areas like edutech, healthtech and fintech. In an interview, Soota talks about company’s future plans for going public and making acquisitions for inorganic growth.
Your positioning as a born digital, born agile company places you at the frontlines of technology services providers. However, you don’t have the size to take up really large projects. Are you looking at aligning with other companies or making some acquisitions to get that heft?
Generally speaking, there is a little bit of correlation between your size and the size of your orders but we’ve recently won a digital project with absolutely state-of-the-art technologies against 40 odd companies bidding for it from across the world. Our bigger concern is where a company already has three providers and it says I will just convert my legacy into digital and why do I need a fourth. There we don’t get a look in the door. But if they decide to take a completely de novo look and then we bid for it, more often than not we win.
Partnerships, of course, help. We have a partnership with a company called Cloud Lending which was recently acquired by a larger company called Q2 Holdings. We are their prime partners for implementation. There are multiple players with whom we have these type of relationships.
Acquisitions have to be a part of our story going ahead. Organically, we should continue to grow at 20% but if you ask me where we will be 2-3 years from now, that will depend on when we do that larger acquisition. But I would say in about 8-10 months from now we should start doing that.
What are your future funding plans and what would you use those funds for?
As you grow larger and dilute you don’t want to find at any stage that you have brought management shareholding down to such a level that you face the kind of threat that we saw recently in the Mindtree case. In Happiest Minds, we have now got only one large investor that is JP Morgan which had bought out the Canaan Partner’s stake while we bought out the other investors. That gives us a good base to start our dilution from. We also need to decide when is the right time for us to go public. Our mindset is not to go to another private equity player and we would rather go public. It could also be linked to getting the right acquisition.
The reason for looking at a public listing instead of private capital is that I have always enjoyed running a public limited company. I would rather be responsible and accountable and help to reward the public shareholders going ahead. A listing also brings out the governance of your company much better than if you are a private limited company. We would certainly like to be traded in the market and I believe we will get a good corporate governance premium when we do that.
Does being a digitally native company allow you to charge a premium? In what way does it help your bottom line?
That’s also a function of size. The larger players will always have higher profitability because their overheads get distributed and they don’t have the kind of investments in proportion to their sales that we have to make. I would say that today our profitability is comparable with that of some of the mid-size players here. It has the scope to get higher.
You led Wipro for 15 years and then Mindtree for the next 10. Now for the last eight years you have been driving Happiest Minds. How would you describe your evolution as a leader and how have the challenges you faced in each, been different?
First I must go back to the nature of the business itself. At Wipro the industry was growing at 50% while we grew at about 70% for 8-9 years and that was enough to take us up to number two. There the corporate governance, for which the culture created by Azim Premji must get a lot of credit, became the pull which brought the large customers to us. Nobody asked us about our domain knowledge. In fact, they actually taught us the business because the value proposition was so huge. By the Mindtree phase, offshoring had become a de facto standard but what got us started was that there was a dotcom boom and of course we didn’t know that a bust would also come. We managed to survive and went on to do a successful IPO and grow the company. At Happiest Minds, the challenges are much higher because the industry growth rate is down to 8-10% over the last several years.
As far as my leadership style is concerned what makes me happiest is fulfilling my potential and helping others realize theirs. If you have really done that then the rest of it is actually very simple.
Wipro was difficult and challenging. Mindtree was more difficult for sure, because now we were surrounded by giants, but happier, and Happiest Minds is the most challenging but the happiest."

Indian stock markets may stay steady following global peers but domestic macro-economic data may weigh on sentiment on Tuesday. Asian stocks and Wall Street futures inched higher as some investors held out hope that Britain still had a chance to avoid a messy exit from the European Union at key negotiations this week.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.01%. Australian shares were up 0.12%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 1.38%. US stock futures rose 0.19% on Tuesday in Asia after the S&P 500 ended 0.14% lower.
Capping the broader gains, however, was a perceived lack of progress coming out of US-China trade negotiations. Reports of a “Phase 1"" trade deal between the United States and China last week had earlier cheered markets but the dearth of details around the agreement has since curbed this enthusiasm with oil prices extending declines and the safe-haven yen holding gains versus dollar.
The focus has now shifted to Europe where officials from Britain and the EU will meet at a make-or-break summit on Thursday and Friday that will determine whether or not Britain is headed for a so-called no-deal Brexit.
However, sentiment may remain fragile because the outcome of Brexit talks is far from certain and the US-China trade war remains a risk to global growth.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to strike an exit deal at an EU summit on Thursday and Friday to allow an orderly departure on 31 October.
The main sticking point remains the border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland, which belongs to the UK. Some EU politicians have expressed guarded optimism that a deal can be reached. However, diplomats from the EU have indicated they are pessimistic about Johnson’s proposed solution for the border and want more concessions.
Back home, India’s retail inflation sharply accelerated in September to a 14-month high at 3.99% as food inflation nearly doubled to 5.1%. Data separately released by the industry department on Monday, however, showed that wholesale price inflation decelerated to a three-year low at 0.33% in September compared with 1.08% a month ago.
Among stocks, Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) will be eyed as the company reported a 23.4% increase in its consolidated net profit to  ₹1,818 crore and net sales rose 6.07% to  ₹9,931 crore during the July-September quarter. Domestic consumer growth was 7%, with underlying volume growth at 5%.
Wipro will announce its September quarter results on Tuesday.
Adani Gas Ltd stock will be in focus as Total SA has agreed to acquire a 37.4% stake in the city gas distributor for around  ₹5,700 crore, in the French energy major’s biggest bet on India’s clean energy push.
Meanwhile, a bankruptcy appeals court on Monday halted the transfer of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd to JSW Steel Ltd and stayed the Enforcement Directorate’s move to attach assets of the insolvent steel maker, scuttling hopes of a swift resolution of the distressed asset.
In the currency market, sterling held steady at $1.2608, below a three-month high of $1.2708. The yen, often considered a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty, edged higher to 108.40 per dollar. A perceived lack of progress in resolving a prolonged trade row between the United States and China also weighed on investor confidence.
The United States agreed to delay a 15 October increase in tariffs on Chinese goods while Beijing said it would buy as much as $50 billion of US agricultural products after tense negotiations last week. However, the US has left in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods.
US crude dipped 0.22% to $53.47. Prices had declined 2% overnight due to worries that global energy demand will remain weak."

32,2019-10-15,Wipro,"For the December-quarter, Wipro expects a revenue between $2.07 billion and $2.11 billion under IT services unitWipro's operating margin for the IT services unit expanded to 18.1%

IT major Wipro Ltd today reported a better-than-expected September-quarter earnings, driven by higher margins. Net profit came in at  ₹2,553 crore as compared to  ₹1,889 crore a year earlier. Analysts polled by Reuters expected the Bengaluru-based IT company to report a profit of  ₹2,273 crore. Wipro reported a revenue of  ₹14,656 crore for its key IT services unit. Its operating margins for the IT services unit rose to 18.1%.
Unlike Infosys which provides full-year guidance, Wipro gives a quarterly guidance. For the December-quarter, Wipro expects a revenue between $2.07 billion and $2.11 billion for the IT services unit.
Commenting on Q2 performance Abidali Z. Neemuchwala, CEO and Managing Director, said, “We had a good in-quarter execution on both revenues and margins.

BENGALURU :
Higher revenue and favourable tax rates helped Bengaluru-based Wipro Ltd report on Tuesday a September quarter net profit of  ₹2,552.6 crore, a 6.9% sequential jump from  ₹2,387.4 crore.
The company’s revenues for the second quarter came at  ₹15,125 crore, up 2.8% q-o-q. The closely-watched dollar revenue for the IT services segment came at $2.04 billion, marginally up 0.5% from $2.03 billion in the immediate previous quarter.
Wipro expects revenue from its flagship IT services business for the quarter ended December to be in the range of $2.06 billion to $2.10 billion, which translates to a sequential growth of 0.8-2.8%, backed by a robust pipeline of digital deals. The revenue growth forecast is higher than analyst estimates of 0-2%. Unlike Infosys which provides guidance for the full year, Wipro guides for the quarter ahead.
“The demand environment remains unchanged for IT spends, though there is an overhang of macro uncertainty in certain sectors. US market grew at 9.4% y-o-y in constant currency while Europe is weak. We continue to see a robust pipeline and the momentum of order book in Q2 has been better than Q1,"" Abidali Z. Neemuchwala, CEO and MD of Wipro said.
Operating margin for the IT services segment stood at 18.1%, an increase of 3.1% year-on-year and a decline of 0.3% sequentially. “We delivered operating margins in a tight range after absorbing the impact of two months of wage hike,"" Jatin Dalal, chief financial officer, Wipro said in a statement. “Growth remains our priority and we remain invested for future.""

We are winning integrated, transformational deals in Canada, Australia, APAC, and in our key markets of US and UK,"" Neemuchwala said.
Banking, financial services & insurance (BFSI), communication and healthcare remained weak during the quarter declining 0.9%, 2.6%, and 0.7% respectively on a sequential basis while consumer (retail) and manufacturing business performed well growing at 1% and 2.9% respectively. In contrast, cross town competitor Infosys showed muted growth in the retail sector.
The voluntary attrition for Q2 on a trailing 12 month basis stood at 17% marginally down from 17.6% in the previous quarter. “The focus is on hiring from campuses and training them. Millennials are driven to join us because of the variety of clients and technologies they get to work with,"" Saurabh Govil, HR head of Wipro.

36,2019-10-15,Wipro,"Analysts expect Wipro to guide for 0-2% revenue growth for the December 2019 quarter on the back of cautious spending of European banking and capital market clientsWeak growth likely in the financial services vertical but steady growth in other sectors

Bengaluru: With Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd posting a weak second quarter earnings below analyst estimates and Infosys Ltd cheering investors by raising its FY20 guidance on the back of large deal wins, all eyes are now on the earnings of Wipro Ltd.
Mint highlights five things to watch for in Wipro’ second quarter (Q2) results that will be declared on 15 October, after market hours.
Guidance for Q3
Unlike Infosys which provides full-year guidance, Wipro gives a quarterly guidance. Analysts expect the company to guide for 0-2% revenue growth for the December 2019 quarter as growth is expected to be impacted by cautious spending of European banking and capital market clients, Kotak Institutional Equities said in a Q2 preview earnings note. Brokerage firm Emkay Global expects the growth outlook to be in the range of 0.5-2.5% in constant currency. Last quarter too, Wipro had given a revenue guidance of 0-2% for Q2FY20.
Revenue growth
Analysts expect Wipro to disappoint investors in its sequential revenue growth. Prabhudas Liladher expects the company to post a 1.3% q-o-q revenue growth, at the mid-point of 0-2% guidance for Q2FY20. Kotak Institutional Equities too said in a note that it expects a “constant currency revenue growth of 1.2% and cross-currency headwind of 70bps on a q-o-q basis.""
Demand from BFSI, key verticals
Analysts expect Wipro to post weak growth in the financial services vertical but steady growth in the other sectors. Growth from the healthcare sector will be closely watched. Its larger competitor TCS posted slow growth in the second quarter mainly due to weakness in demand from the banking and financial services and retail industries. Cross town competitor Infosys also showed slow growth in the retail sector.
EBIT margins
Analysts expect Wipro’s EBIT margin to decline due to wage hikes. “Full quarter impact of wage revision will likely lead to decline in EBIT margin. We note that Wipro's wage revision cycle is effected from June 1 of every year,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said. However, “Reported EBIT margin will likely increase by 324 bps on yoy comparison largely on account of 360 bps impact from the settlement of lawsuit with National Grid in Sep 2018 quarter.""
Management commentary on demand, digital
Analysts will keep a close watch on the management commentary on the outlook for the key growth drivers of FY2019. Growth from financial services will be monitored among others. They will also look for Wipro’s sustainability of margin in light of muted growth, and benefit from cut in corporate tax rate by the Indian government. Investors will also watch for growth in the digital business. During Q1, Wipro’s digital business grew 5.6% q-o-q and 34.6% annually. Digital contributed 37.4% of the company’s overall revenues as of last quarter.
At 13:10 hours, shares of Wipro were trading up 1.52% at  ₹243 on the BSE Ltd."
30,2019-10-16,Wipro,"Wipro reports a steady revenue growth after a sequential decline in Q1 revenuesNet profit was higher than expectations on better operating margins and a drop in tax rates

Blessed is he who expects nothing, for he shall never be disappointed,"" said the English poet Alexander Pope.
Investors in Wipro Ltd will not only be not disappointed, they will be quite pleased with the company’s September quarter results.
While revenue growth was more or less in line with what analysts expected, at 1.1% sequentially in constant currency terms, profit margins were better than expected.
What’s more, there was a surprise drop in the effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, and the company now expects an effective tax rate of about 20-21% on an annual basis. This is lower than analysts’ estimates of a 22-23% effective tax rate for FY20 and FY21. As a result, earnings estimates are expected to be upgraded by analysts.
Wipro expects its tax rates to drop as a result of the government’s cut in minimum alternate tax rates. This sets it apart from other software services companies who have decided to stay with the previous tax regime, and hence won’t see an increase in earnings estimates as a result of the government’s tax cut.
This comes against the backdrop of a massive underperformance by Wipro shares in the past six months. While the Nifty IT index fell by 5.6% during this period, the company’s shares have slumped by 15.3%. Wipro’s shares were trading at only around 13 times FY21 estimated earnings, far lower than the more than 20 times valuation in the case of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS). “Given the rock-bottom expectations from the company, its performance will be cheered by investors,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, on condition of anonymity.
Note that Wipro’s revenue had fallen by 0.7% in the June quarter, after which its stock posted losses vis-à-vis peers.
But while the Q2 show looks decent against the backdrop of the weak Q1 performance and generally low expectations, there are still concerns about growth. Year-on-year growth stood at merely 3.8% in Q2. Adjusted for the contribution from acquisitions, the sequential revenue guidance for Q3 is only 0-2%.
Revenue from the banking and financial services vertical fell sequentially, which is a worry for prospects for growth going forward. Besides, the steady operating profit margins in Q2 were aided by some one-off factors that may not repeat going forward.
As such, investors would do well to not extrapolate the earnings in Q2 as a sign of things to come. Wipro’s year-on-year growth rates remain far lower than those of peers, and a large differential in valuations compared to large peers such as TCS and Infosys Ltd looks justified.
But as pointed out earlier, the fact that things improved compared to the June quarter, and considering the surprise bump in earnings owing to the tax change, the valuation gap can be expected to narrow a bit."

Indian stock markets are expected to consolidate further tracking positive global cues. Asian shares took off on Wednesday and sterling held near six-month highs as Britain and the EU made headway on a Brexit deal ahead of a leaders' summit though it remained unclear if London could avoid postponing its scheduled departure on 31 October.
Officials and diplomats involved in negotiations over the acrimonious divorce between the world's fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading bloc said differences over the terms of the split had narrowed significantly.
The news lit a fire under European and US equities, which jumped about 1% on Tuesday. The British pound rocketed to $1.28, a level not seen since 21 May. It gave back some of those gains on Wednesday to be last at $1.2759.
The positive sentiment extended on Wednesday with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising 0.3%.
Japan's Nikkei jumped 1.7%, while Australian shares added 0.9% and South Korea's KOSPI index climbed 0.7%.
Stronger-than-expected earnings from major US banks - JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo - further boosted sentiment even as the International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 global growth forecast for a fifth time.
EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michael Barnier had been demanding a legal text of any agreement by midnight UK time. However, the talks were still going on between UK Brexit negotiator David Frost and EU's executive European Commission past midnight in Brussels.
The EU will determine whether a deal is fit to be put to Thursday's leaders' summit for consideration.
The International Monetary Fund, while slashing its growth projection for the country to 6.1% for the current fiscal from its July forecast of 7% said on Tuesday India should opt for further monetary policy easing and broad-based structural reforms to reverse a cyclical demand slowdown.
Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd are likely to be in focus. According to a Mint report, VTB Capital Plc, a unit of Russia’s state-controlled lender VTB Group, is in talks with two potential investors to sell a 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.
Wipro on Tuesday reported a 35.82% annual rise in consolidated net profit at  ₹2,561.30 crore for the September quarter compared with  ₹1,885.70 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. On a sequential basis, the profit was up 6.2%. It has guided for IT services revenue of $2,065 million to $2,106 million for the December quarter.
Meanwhile, news on the US-China trade front has been less encouraging. Bloomberg reported, citing sources, that China will struggle to buy $50 billion of US farm goods annually unless it removes retaliatory tariffs on American products, which would require reciprocal action by US President Donald Trump.

26,2019-10-21,Wipro,"In the first quarter ended June, Wipro paid a retention bonus of  ₹1 lakh to freshersThe move was aimed at checking attrition as the IT industry has seen a higher number of junior staffers leaving in the past quarters

Bengaluru: Wipro Ltd plans to promote around 5,000 employees in the coming quarters to check attrition and make the company future-ready, Business Standard reported on Monday. For the quarter ended September, the Bengaluru-based company’s attrition rate stood at 17%, 60 basis points lower than in the previous quarter.
“Attrition (rate) has been a good story for us as compared to others. We have given salary hikes and now are looking at a huge number of promotions in the coming quarter. Around 5,000 people in the experience range of five to eight years will get promoted,"" Saurabh Govil, HR head, Wipro said.
In the first quarter ended June, Wipro paid a retention bonus of  ₹1 lakh to freshers, who were hired via campus placement and completed one year. Those who had an experience of up to three years in the firm, since the time of their campus placements, were also given bonuses.
The move was aimed at checking attrition as the IT industry has seen a higher number of junior staffers leaving their employers in the past quarters. “Junior-level attrition is slightly higher than the company average. However, it is lower among performers as they get higher bonuses, incentives and salary hikes,"" said Govil.
According to the news report, in the next phase of promotion at Wipro, employees at L1 level would go to L2 and L2 staff would be promoted to L3. IT firms categorise staffers into various levels starting from L1 (junior most level) onwards.
“We want to be (stay) prepared. That's the reason we are building up a huge cadre and are preparing for the demand through training and re-skilling our people well. These initiatives should reflect on our revenue in the next two-three quarters,"" Govil said. He also said the IT firm was reducing its dependence on sub-contractors by building up an employee pyramid on key onsite locations. According to the company, around 68% of its employees in the US are locals.
Govil said, apart from scaling up its delivery capabilities, Wipro is eyeing more consulting-led sales growth in coming quarters and hiring more consultants to improve its cross-selling opportunities. “We are hiring more people in this consulting space. Today, it's (one of our) big investment areas and it is paying us back well."""
25,2019-10-22,Wipro,"16.5% of what was traditionally done by humans three or two years ago, is now being done by bots. The trend will only continue, says Jatin Dalal, CFO, Wipro

BENGALURU :
Software services companies are shifting their focus towards digital solutions with market forces driving their customers to become digital enterprises. Digital, for instance, contributed to 39.6% of Wipro Ltd’s total revenues. In an interview, Jatin Dalal, chief financial officer, Wipro, shares the initiatives taken by the company to boost its digital business and improve margins. Edited excerpts:
What initiatives has Wipro taken to achieve higher growth, and what is your role as the CFO?
One key strategy we embarked upon is what we call the big bet strategy, wherein we have four areas—digital, cybersecurity, engineering and cloud—which will drive disproportionate growth for the industry and for the company. So, we are investing in a big way in all of these.
Clearly, the role of the CFO is to balance growth—capital or growth expense that some of these entities need. We have to balance the need for the investment and also have the right calibration so that the investment is most productive.
The second initiative is clearly around the big deals, because our business has, what I call, the normal flow of businesses. And, on top of that, if you want to grow faster, you will have to do a few large deals. You have to maximize the value for your customer and for yourself. That’s very clear, and these are the two big initiatives. Both are very critical for the organization’s future growth prediction.
How do you compare the demand environment for your traditional business, versus digital?
The demand environment is superior for the new-age businesses, which is reflected in the growth rates. For example, digital has grown 29% year-on-year. Cybersecurity has also grown similarly. So, clearly, growth rates in the new-age businesses are very different. Therefore, the demand environment is certainly superior to the traditional services.
What about the deal sizes of the digital businesses?
Whenever we start a new service, we start small-scale because our customer is also sort of experimenting and learning as we go. So, the deal sizes are certainly smaller, but that doesn’t mean the scope is small. It’s just being tendered out in smaller chunks. But effectively, it’s still a large piece of work that goes digital, and it is a way of developing an experience for either the internal or external customer. Currently, digital contributes to 39.6% of our revenues.
What are you doing to improve margins?
One big lever is, of course, utilization. Second lever is automation on work done by bots. In the parameters we use, in the June quarter, it was 15.3%, which is now 16.5% for our fixed price projects. This means 16.5% of what was traditionally done by humans three or two years ago, is now being done by bots. The trend will only continue.
The third lever of operating margin is clearly the pyramid structure. No matter how the industry operates, we have to have the freshers at the bottom of the pyramid, who will gradually build experience and become project managers, delivery heads and business leaders. The final lever is pricing, wherein some of the new service lines must be able to command a superior margin."
24,2019-10-24,Wipro,"As Asia's third-largest economy battles waning consumer demand, extravagant corporate gifts risk becoming a thing of the pastAnalysts said the curtailed spending was a reflection of the gloom surrounding the business community, with economic growth its most sluggish in years

For Indian executive Bibhas Chakraborty, Diwali used to mean shiny expensive gifts from business associates keen to use the auspicious -- and spectacular -- Hindu festival to deepen ties. Now it's mostly sweets and nuts.
As Asia's third-largest economy battles waning consumer demand, extravagant corporate gifts risk becoming a thing of the past, leaving many worried that this weekend's festival of lights -- and presents -- is losing its lustre.
""Earlier, the quality of gifts we received was higher and often included gold and silver-plated picture frames or bowls. But now, with the economic slowdown, that's all changed,"" Chakraborty, a Mumbai-based 48-year-old, told AFP.
""The joy of opening wrappers to find surprising items has been replaced with the usual sweets... which has taken the sheen off the festival somewhat.""
India's corporate gift industry usually works overtime in the run-up to Diwali to meet a surge in demand -- with the annual ritual seen as a convenient way to nurture business relationships while avoiding accusations of outright bribery.
But in Mumbai's busy Mangaldas market, a street lined with shops offering festive discounts, third-generation entrepreneur Jatin Shah is a worried man.
Shutters down
The owner of Rainbow Dry Fruits, an 80-year-old gift packaging firm, Shah added 20 temporary workers to his staff of 15 to account for the anticipated Diwali rush.
But orders have yet to materialise.
""In previous years... we would work till two in the morning. Now since the orders are lower in size and scale, we finish work and pull down the shutters by 10 pm,"" Shah told AFP.
Even orders for the cheapest items -- small boxes of Indian almonds, walnuts, and cashews -- have fallen by more than half, he said, bringing down the firm's annual turnover by 35 percent and leaving him with no funds for employee bonuses, another Diwali tradition.
""Diwali is not only the festival of lights but also represents economic prosperity,"" Shah said.
Hindus mark Diwali with prayers to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and the weeks leading up to the holiday usually see an uptick in consumer spending, similar to Thanksgiving or Christmas in the West.
Mood of gloom
But this year Indians don't appear to be in a mood to spend, with the slowdown hitting sales of everything from cars to cookies.
""I am not sure if there will be many gifts coming my way this year,"" said finance executive Chakraborty.
Some of the biggest companies have slashed their corporate gift budgets for Diwali, said Ritu Grover, CEO of TGH Lifestyle, which works with more than 350 firms including telecom giant Airtel and IT outsourcing firm Wipro.
Analysts said the curtailed spending was a reflection of the gloom surrounding the business community, with economic growth its most sluggish in years.
""Reduction in corporate gifting is an indicator of economic slowdown and there is no ambiguity on that front,"" N. Chandramouli, chief of Mumbai-based TRA Research, told AFP.
""All indicators show it is going to be a slow Diwali this year.""

23,2019-10-30,Wipro,"Every second H-1B visa application sent by IT majors like Infosys, Wipro got rejectedOverall, the US government denied an H-1B visa to every fourth applicant

NEW DELHI :
With the Donald Trump administration being tough on immigration rules, the US government is now rejecting every fourth H-1B visa application, according to a report. Data from the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) shows that Indian IT majors like Infosys and Wipro are amongst the worst hit by visa denials.
Almost every second H-1B visa petition sent by both Wipro (53%) and Infosys (45%) for initial employment got rejected in FY 2019 (October-June). As compared with FY 2015 (October-September), the denial rates have gone up by 46% for Wipro and 43% for Infosys, according to the report which analysed data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
The United States issues 85,000 H-1B work visas every year, out of which an estimated 70% goes to Indians.
""As a result of more restrictive Trump administration policies, denial rates for H-1B petitions have increased significantly, rising from 6% in FY 2015 to 24% through the third quarter of FY 2019 for new H-1B petitions for initial employment,"" the report said.
For Tech Mahindra Americas, the denial rate was as high as 41%.
""Given the time and expense involved with filing H-1B petitions, employers generally only file cases for individuals they believe qualify for H-1B status, which is why high denial rates should not be expected,"" the report said.
For big American companies like Amazon (6%), Microsoft (8%), Intel (7%), Google (3%), Apple (2%), Facebook (2%), and others, the rate of H-1B visa denial seem to be less harsher.
At least 12 companies that provide professional or IT services to other US companies, including Accenture, Capgemini and others, had denial rates over 30% in FY 2019 so far. Most of these companies had denial rates between 2% and 7% in FY 2015.
USCIS data reveals that in FY 2019, 88,324 H-1B visa applications for initial employment were approved while 27,707 were rejected.
For continuing employment, the denial rate was 12% as over 1.85 lakh such applications were approved."
22,2019-11-02,Wipro,"The USCICS rejected 45% of H-1B visa applications for Infosys while for Google the figure was only 3%For TCS, the rejection rate was 34% while for Wipro it was 53%

NEW DELHI :
With the United States government becoming tougher on immigration rules under Donald Trump's rule, several Indian IT companies including Infosys and Wipro are having a tough time in sending their employees on H-1B visa to work in the US, according to a latest report.
Even as the denial rate for new H-1B visa applications was as high as 45% for India's IT bellwether Infosys, Google was somehow lucky as only 3% of its petitions were rejected by the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), according to National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP).
The data pertains to the first three quarters of FY 2019 (October-June). In the US, the financial calendar runs from October-September.
For American multinationals like Amazon, Microsoft, Intel, Google, Apple and Facebook, the rejection rates varied between 2% to 8%. Employees of Apple and Facebook had the lowest denial rate.
The NFAP report, which provides a detailed break-down of company-wise rejection rates, shows that when it came to Indian IT companies, the rejection rates went up manifold.
In 2015, 4% of all H-1B visa applicants sent by Tech Mahindra Americas were rejected but the figure shot up to 41% this year. For TCS, the denial rate was as high as 34% this year, Wipro 53% and Infosys 45%. In 2015, during the earlier dispensation, the rejection rates varied between 2%-7% for these Indian companies, according to the report.
A change in US policy is also reflected in cases where an existing H-1B visa holder applied for a renewal of his or her work visa. Infosys employees faced the highest rejection rate of 29%, according to the report. For Wipro, the figure stood at 19% and TCS 22%.
If we look at the overall figures, every fourth H1-B visa application got rejected. The US government issues about 85,000 such visas every year out of which an estimated 70% goes to Indians alone. Most H-1B applicants from India are IT professionals."

Four IT companies, including Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, are in the fray to manage and operate the Business Analytics Project (BAP) of insurance sector regulator Irdai.
Irdai said TCS, Larsen and Toubro InfoTech, Wipro and EIT Service India Private Ltd (a DXC Technology company) have been shortlisted for the next round of bidding.
The four companies had submitted their initial bids in response to an 'expression of interest' floated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (Irdai) in August.
L&T InfoTech has been providing BAP services on a BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer) model to Irdai since 2011. The contract is expiring this month.
Irdai said BAP was implemented for automation of registration and other connected activities for insurers, brokers, surveyors and third party administrators, as well as automation of product approvals, branch office opening and advertisements, among others.
In addition to providing the BAP services, the selected company will also be responsible for enhancing the services/functionality of the platform.
While inviting the expression of interest, Irdai had said 'BAP 2.0' will be the next version of the project with additional business and administrative processes designed to provide a significantly enhanced experience to end-users through a major revamp of some of the current interfaces.
The regulator said the BAP system has been designed for effective supervision and regulation including compliance, monitoring trends of the insurance industry, risk based assessment of functioning of insurers, providing early warning signal and initiating corrective action.
As part of BAP, Irdai had introduced the concept of e-filing, doing away with manual filing and paper based records in its departments."
20,2019-11-11,Wipro,"Software and IT services is expected to lead the IT spend growing at 15.2% and 13.4% respectively in 2020The uptick in IT spending is expected to aid large IT companies like Accenture, IBM, and HPE

BENGALURU :
IT spending in India is pegged to grow 6.6% to reach $94 billion in 2020 from $88.5 billion in 2019, primarily led by growth in consumer devices, according to the latest forecast by research firm Gartner.
Software and IT services is expected to lead the IT spend growing at 15.2% and 13.4% respectively in 2020, followed by devices (6.3%), data centre systems (2.5%), and communications services (2%).
The uptick in IT spending is expected to aid large IT companies like Accenture, IBM, and HPE. Even Indian IT services companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd, Wipro Ltd, and Tech Mahindra Ltd which have a relatively strong domestic focus, are expected to benefit.
For TCS, India accounted for 5.7% of its overall revenue for the second quarter ended September. While Wipro and Tech Mahindra doesn’t share revenue specifically from India, the rest of the world (excluding North America and Europe) contributed 16.9% and 24.9% to their topline in the September quarter.
“2020 will be a rebound year for India’s IT spending as consumers return to purchasing mobile phones after sitting on the sidelines in 2019,"" said John-David Lovelock, research vice president at Gartner. “Additionally, business spending on IT grew 6% in 2019 and is expected to increase 9% in 2020, helping to drive growth across all segments.""
Strong growth in total software spending will be driven by enterprise application software which is forecast to grow 17% in 2020. The expected increase in overall business spending will help drive 16% growth in enterprise mobile phone spending in 2020, pushing growth in the devices segment to 6.3%.
Arup Roy, research vice president at Gartner said that corporate spending in software and services saw an uptick as the Indian government introduced corporate tax cuts, along with policies that were aimed at reviving the economy and bolstering consumer spending in mid-2019.
“In the next two to three years, IT spending will increase as the economy benefits from the goods and service tax (GST) implemented by the Indian government in 2018, and as policies supporting consumer spending come into practice,"" said Roy.
Among technologies, automation-enabled areas such as robotic process automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and chatbots are seeing huge uptick, Roy said. “Cloud still remains quite strong, along with data and analytics."""
19,2019-11-11,Wipro,"Lithium Urban Technologies also plans to provide pick and drop services to corporate employees by offering bus servicesThe company to provide transportation services to Wipro’s India campuses

Electric cab services firm Lithium Urban Technologies plans to foray into the logistics segment and plug gaps in the last-mile connectivity area, head of external relations of the company Vikash Mishra said.
In line with the government’s push for electric mobility, the corporate transport service provider, which has a fleet comprising four-wheelers also plans to provide pick and drop services to corporate employees by offering bus services.
“We want to try and test with multiple form factors. Right now, the viable business model is four-wheelers. Eventually, we will move to bus and start the logistics business as well,"" Mishra told Mint.
The Bengaluru-based company on Monday said it has tied up with Wipro to provide transportation services to the information technology company’s India campuses. Lithium had started servicing Wipro’s Hyderabad campus over a year ago. “The aim is to rollout in a phased manner over the next 12-18 months EV (electric vehicle) fleet powered by renewables, catering to Wipro’s employee transportation needs across the country,"" the company said in a statement.
The electric mobility transport provider is in also in talks with real estate companies offering office spaces to offer mobility services to address the last and first mile connectivity issue, Mishra said.
Founded in 2015, Lithium claims to own the largest fleet of electric vehicles (EV) in the world outside of China. The company owns and operates country’s largest EV charging network spread across seven cities such as Delhi/National Capital Region, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune, among others. With a fleet size of over 1,000 electric cars, the company has hired 2,000 drivers to drive them.
The company procures vehicles from Mahindra Electric and is in talks with other original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) for similar tie ups.
“In the next 6-12 months, more OEMs will come to us with their products…We are testing with couple of OEMs,"" Mishra said.
Lithium’s plans comes against the backdrop of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA)-led government making an aggressive push for a cleaner and cost-effective mode of transport to reduce India’s dependence on oil imports.
As part of the strategy, the government has also been trying to incentivize the adoption of EVs through several steps in the past few months, similar to those taken by governments in China and Europe. Apart from reducing taxes on EVs and chargers, the government announced tax rebates of up to Rs1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy EVs, with a total exemption benefit of Rs2.5 lakh over the entire loan period. Customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, as announced in the Union Budget in July, is expected to help lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries in India, as they are not produced locally. In March, the Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles or FAME 2 scheme—to expand commercial vehicle fleet—was also announced with an outlay of Rs10,000 crore.
While Mishra lauded the steps taken by the government on a policy level, towards promoting electric mobility, there are challenges as far as implementation is concerned.
“For example, in Maharashtra, a policy was announced in announced last year our fleet is yet to get subsidy from the government. Similarly, Telangana had announced EV tariff policy. But there is a lot of confusion related to EV tariff implementation,"" he said."

Mumbai: Bengaluru-based corporate transport service startup Lithium Urban Technologies has forged a strategic partnership with Wipro for its employees' commute across the country. The partnership is aimed at rolling out in a phased manner over the next 12-18 months electric vehicle (EV) fleet catering to Wipro's employee transportation needs across the country, Lithium said in a statement on Monday.
Lithium, which claims to own the largest fleet of EVs in the world excluding China, has been servicing Wipro’s Hyderabad campus with its electric cars since June last year.
""This journey which started in Hyderabad is now being expanded nationally. We aim to deliver results in terms of both, cost savings and carbon footprint reduction. It is indeed our privilege to partner with Wipro in serving the nation,"" said Sanjay Krishnan, co-founder and chief executive, Lithium Urban Technologies.
As much as 40-50% of energy used by Wipro campuses is from renewables. With a target to convert 35% of fleet to electric in the next 18 months, Wipro aims to reach 100m green kilometres, according to the release.
The start-up firm has its own fleet of EVs and associated charging infrastructure, backed by a strong technology platform that involves telematics, fleet management systems, scheduling, rostering and analytics-based optimisation; and trained and certified drivers.
Lithium also owns and operates the country's largest EV charging network spread across seven cities.
""As a part of Wipro’s commitment to ecological sustainability, we are continuously involved in multiple environment-related programs both within and outside our business boundaries. Therefore, the decision to move to EVs for our employee transportation services was natural,"" said Nittan Bhalla, general manager and head of facilities management and operations, Wipro.

-""At NITI Aayog, we are tracking aspirational districts. We are now measuring change and putting data in public domain. If you are able to transform the 115 districts in India, we can transform India's growth trajectory. By tracking data, we have brought in a lot of data. Today, a bank account can be opened in less than a minute through the use of biometrics. Our mobile data consumption is more than US and China put together. India has thrown up a vast amount of data. The new Ayushman Bharat scheme is cashless and paperless. Ayushman Bharat covers 500 million people which is more than the population of US, Europe and Mexico put together, which makes it the biggest health insurance scheme in the world,"" says Kant.
-""We (India) have brought in a revolution and it is the revolution of technology,"" says Kant.
""India's mobile data consumption is more than US and China put together,"" says Kant."

It’s like 15 IQ points go away,' said Gates at Mint Visionaries event'We need more investment to tackle malaria,' said Gates in conversation with Wipro Ltd chairman Rishad Premji

New Delhi: Identifying health as the pre-eminent challenge facing India, Bill Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said: “If there was one wish I had for India, it would be to get rid of malnutrition because that reduces the potential of those kids so dramatically and their ability to provide and learn are reduced. It’s like 15 IQ points go away.""
Speaking at the inaugural “Mint Visionaries"" event in New Delhi where he was in conversation with Rishad Premji, chairman of Wipro Ltd, Gates said his favourite Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) was health. No prizes for guessing that since the former tech czar’s philanthropic venture—the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)—has global health as one of its key focus areas.
SDGs are a collection of 17 global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. Set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly, the SDGs are intended to be achieved by the year 2030. Health is one of the important goals that aim to tackle major problems such as maternal and child mortality, and malnutrition.
Gates also spoke of the impact of vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria. “Malaria has been a major problem. To tackle this, we need more investment. Earlier, the poor countries were suffering because rich countries had the money and poor didn’t have the money to develop new tools to handle it"" he said. Drawing a linkage between health and climate change, Gates said: “With climate change, as you heat the world up, mosquitoes can live in higher altitude. They will start thriving at the places where they never used to live.""
The world malaria report released by the World Health Organization (WHO) in November 2018 also stated that India reported 3 million fewer cases in 2017, a 24% decrease compared with 2016. The report also said that India is on track to achieve a 20-40% reduction.
Talking about BMGF’s work on healthcare, Gates said: “The biggest thing our foundation has done is getting vaccines for children around the world. Vaccine misinformation is worst today as it was ever."" He also said that with the help of technology, diseases such as cancer can be tackled via apps.
During the event, Gates also spoke of the impact of climate change and emphasized the need for efforts to minimize emissions in the world.
“Work on mitigation requires immense innovation. Electric cars in the next 10-15 years will outcompete gasoline cars without subsidy. We have to accelerate innovation which won’t come if we don’t step in. Middle-income countries cannot be left out.""
“The work on mitigation requires immense innovation. We have a lot of inventions that need to be made. For example, steel and cement use a lot of energy. Climate change is a problem young people are waking up to. Climate change makes poor farmers suffer. Crops will fail every three years as against 7-8 (years earlier).""
He added that all countries —whether low income or middle income—will have to participate in mitigating climate change because 60% of the world’s population lives in developing countries.
“About 80% of those suffering from climate change are going to be poor farmers,"" Gates warned.
On the impact of social media and the responsibility of tech companies on tackling fake news, Gates said: “In the past, we all read the same newspaper. There may be a need to ban micro-targeting because it drives people apart. Society has to decide what these rules are.""

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Wednesday:
RIL: Reliance Jio, after market hours on Tuesday, said it will hike tariffs of its mobile services. This after a day of rival Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd announcing a hike in their tariffs starting December. Reliance Jio said it would “take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments.""
Yes Bank: The private lender on Tuesday said that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has found underreported bad loans worth  ₹3,277 crore for the year ended March 2019. In a regulatory filing, it said it has already classified loans worth  ₹1,259 crore as non-performing assets until the quarter-ended September. Divergence, which arises when RBI’s assessment differs from that of a bank’s, was at  ₹978 crore as on 31 March in provisions for bad loans.
Infosys: Asia’s second largest IT services provider late on Tuesday clarified that allegations made in news reports in the second round of whistleblower complaints against the top management of the company are similar to what was said the first time. The company has been in news since 21 October when a group of anonymous employees alleged unethical accounting practices at the top management level, especially by its chief executive Salil Parekh.
Bharti Airtel: Shares rallied after the telecom operator on Monday said it will hike tariffs for its mobile services. It has added around $5.5 billion to its market capitalisation in the past three trading sessions despite posting massive loss for the September quarter as it made provisions for dues and penalties to be paid to the government in the adjusted gross revenue case. Vodafone Idea Ltd also added $1.25 billion to its market capitalisation in the past three trading sessions alone.
NBFC Stocks: RBI can now direct resolution of non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) with assets worth at least  ₹500 crore under the insolvency law to address defaulting cases in the sector, according to the ministry of corporate affairs. The decision of the government comes in the wake collapse of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) Ltd and Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd.
Wipro: The IT company on Tuesday said its subsidiary Appirio has partnered with software provider MuleSoft to provide digital integration solutions that allow businesses to enhance the value and versatility of their customer relationship management systems. The partnership will allow both the companies to leverage Appirio's ability to develop and execute salesforce strategies and use MuleSoft's APl-led framework.
Central Bank: The lender has reported an increased net loss of  ₹6,430.5 crore for the fiscal year ended March 2019 due to divergence in non-performing assets (NPAs) after assessment of bad loans by the RBI. The net divergence in NPAs stood at  ₹2,565 crore for the said year. The public-sector bank had earlier reported a net loss of  ₹5,641.5 crore for 2018-19. Banks are required to report divergence in asset classification and provisioning as per SEBI guidelines of 31 October 2019.
TCS: The IT major announced that it has expanded its partnership with UK-based airline Virgin Atlantic to enhance and create innovative customer experiences. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd now covers technology programs on digital channels for Virgin Atlantic. Separately, the IT firm was the lead contributor in  ₹2.4 lakh crore of market capitalisation added last week. Its market cap zoomed  ₹1,93,666.73 crore to reach  ₹8,16,068.63 crore.
Reliance Capital: The company said its shareholding in Reliance General Insurance has been transferred to IDBI Trustee Services after invoking of pledge of shares. The Trustee was purported to act on behalf of two parties, claiming against the company under certain guarantees, while another lender has filed a suit in the Bombay High Court, claiming that the shareholding in Reliance General Insurance comprises security for all lenders to the company.
Allahabad Bank: The ministry of finance has given in-principle approval to the proposed merger of Allahabad Bank into Indian Bank. This merger is part of the Centre’s mega plan to consolidate weak and small PSU banks with healthy and bigger ones. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had made the announcement in August, with which India will have only 12 state-run banks."
12,2019-11-21,Wipro,"Acquisitions such as Designit, International TechneGroup amplify capabilities, says head of firm’s digital bizDigital is a crucial part of Wipro’s biz, contributing nearly 40% of total revenue in the Sep quarter

BENGALURU :
Bengaluru-based software services firm Wipro Ltd is strengthening its digital business inorganically through strategic acquisitions of digital-native companies.
Digital is a crucial part of Wipro’s business, contributing nearly 40% of total revenue in the September quarter.
“We pride ourselves on making sensible acquisitions that amplify our existing capabilities and expand our presence across different markets. These included Designit, Appirio, Cooper, Syfte and, most recently, International TechneGroup (ITI), a digital engineering and manufacturing solutions company,"" said Rajan Kohli, president, Wipro Digital.
Wipro, which acquired US-based ITI in October, said the acquisition complements its core digital strengths. “The acquisition of ITI has enabled Wipro to offer end-to-end solutions in digital engineering and manufacturing within our industrial and engineering services business,"" Kohli said.
Wipro’s revenue from digital grew 29% annually and 7% sequentially in constant currency in the September quarter. While Wipro doesn’t offer guidance on digital revenue, Kohli said, “the business is seeing continued robust growth. Our investments and end-to-end digital transformation capability continue to bear fruit by winning deals and acquiring new logos. We expect the digital proportion of our overall business to continue to rise.""
In comparison, larger peer Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd’s digital revenue stood at 33% of total revenue, growing 28% year-on-year for the fiscal second quarter. Infosys Ltd’s digital business grew 38% annually and contributed 38.3% to the total revenue.
Analysts believe acquisitions offer a great way for companies like Wipro to acquire digital skills. “From a large IT company’s standpoint, building those capabilities from scratch will take time. Such acquisitions bring in solid experience, client base, and some amount of intellectual property too,"" said Arup Roy, vice president, research at Gartner.
Sectorwise, Wipro’s financial services, energy & utilities, healthcare and telecommunications, are particularly focused on digital transformation at the moment, though “we are also seeing interest in the technology, consumer packaged goods, retail and manufacturing markets. Financial services is the largest business unit for Wipro and is also the biggest spender on technology,"" Kohli said.
Wipro chief executive Abidali Z. Neemuchwala said during the Q2 earnings that the company is winning “integrated transformational deals"" in Canada, Australia, and Asia Pacific, besides the key markets of the US and UK.
To further scale up its digital business, Wipro is also building its digital talent. For instance, Wipro’s internal crowdsourcing platform, Top Gear, has more than 55,000 employees who collaborate with colleagues and tech partners to provide additional support to traditional teams.
“Top Gear is also a social learning platform for workforce reskilling, with more than 2,000 learning assignments across more than 200 skills, presenting an avenue for our employees to upskill themselves. We also hire from universities close to our different markets and office branches,"" Kohli said. “This localisation is important for us to not only create a global, diverse and distributed talent base, but also to be part of every community in which we operate.""
Over the last three years, Wipro has trained and upskilled 130,000 employees in various digital skills. “Our most immersive training program is our Digital Academy to create full-stack digital ninjas,"" Kohli said."
11,2019-11-24,Wipro,"In conversation with Rishad Premji, Bill Gates discusses the challenges of mitigating climate change and eliminating malnutrition

On 17 November, the first edition of the Mint Visionaries series, which seeks to delve into the minds of people inspiring a new future, was kicked off with entrepreneur-philanthropist Bill Gates, who is also the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, sharing his thoughts with Wipro Ltd chairman Rishad Premji. The two discussed the challenges of mitigating climate change, eliminating malnutrition, and improving the health and education infrastructure, besides the role of technology, such as artificial intelligence, for social inclusion, something Gates considers a mission statement. Edited excerpts:
Rishad Premji: Climate change will be one of the defining challenges of the 21st century—the impact of weather events, rising sea level, islands getting flooded. It will affect the way people live and potentially impact health and mortality. There is a huge implication of climate change. I know you personally and the Gates Foundation is spending a lot on mitigation—on how to reduce carbon emission. I know you are spending time on breakthrough energy ventures in your personal capacity, investing in technology that can pay off, as well as around adaptation. What are you personally, and through Gates Foundation, doing in these areas? And, what can we do to learn how to leverage science and technology, as governments and as citizens, to be more informed about climate change and its impact, considering that we often have this debate on whether it is real. And, what can come out of it?
Watch: Bill Gates and Rishad Premji in conversation I Mint Visionaries
Bill Gates: I am actually writing a book about climate change. It will come out next June. And, it is to explain how we have to change the economy to get these emissions down to zero. Today, we are emitting 51 billion tonnes, and that number is going up every year. So, the idea that some year it will start going down and some year it will get to zero is very challenging.
Most of the energy that we use in the world comes from coal, natural gas or gasoline. By the time you get to zero, you basically got rid of those sources of energy and moved over to nuclear, renewable, hydro, which today make up less than 20%. The work on mitigation really requires immense innovation. There is innovation that you can see today—there are electric cars, and over the next 10-15 years, they will outcompete gasoline cars without subsidies. So that’s really good. There is a new type of meat that is actually made of just protein and not cow. Today, there is a small price premium, but over time, the quality and the cost should beat normal ground beef, which produces greenhouse gas emissions.
We have a lot of inventions that need to be made. For example, the way we make cement and steel are extremely heavy-emission activities and, yet, the world is going to build more buildings between now and 2060 than exist today. As the world urbanizes, there is no way around but to use a lot of steel and cement. This is a very unusual thing. So, we have to accelerate innovation. We have to create words for innovation, which might not come if we did not step in.
Another thing that is very hard about this is that every country in the world has to participate. Even if you leave out the low-income countries, you cannot leave out the middle-income countries, because 60% of humanity lives there and, as we get out, a lot of the emissions will be coming from those countries and not just the rich countries.
So, India is kind of paradigmatic. Can we innovate so well that as India quadruples its electricity capacity and provides air conditioning, refrigeration, lighting 24 hours a day, reliably to everyone in the country and it’s done in a way that it does not emit greenhouse gases? If we had to do it with today’s technology, you would do it with coal because the intermittency and challenges of renewables are quite large. So, mitigation is hard because when we have warming, we need adaptation and, there, we need much better seeds.
I want to seriously mention about Bihar’s chief minister Nitish Kumar, whom I have seen over the last 10 years. He has done a lot of great work in Bihar, and our foundation has been helping him with it. In our first meeting, I did not expect him to talk about climate change. When I am in Seattle or Washington DC, London or Paris, that’s the big topic. But I was impressed that in Patna, he was saying that we have a problem with climate change, and trying to get our advice and help on water supply, seeds and what could they do to minimize the problem. This is a problem that young people are beginning to wake up to.
Over the last five years, the energy behind it has gone up dramatically. Some people think it is easy to solve, and can be solved in 10 or 20 years. I wish that was true. We need to engage in a plan that will take 30-40 years to get this done. I am putting a lot of money and time in it because the people who would suffer the most are the poorest—in north India, in Africa, all over the world, it is the farmers who will bear the brunt even though they did nothing to cause the problem.
Premji: That is what I struggle with. The conflict is that the fast-emerging economies are saying that we need to grow and renewable energy cannot keep up, but if you have climate change impact, the people in the lowest end of the pyramid in those countries will suffer the most. So, on one side, there is the challenge of growth, and on the other, the challenge of suffering that may come with that growth, depending on the energy sources that are actually available in the country...
Gates: Growth is necessary. We cannot tell people: Sorry, too bad, the rich world has emitted too much greenhouse gas, so you don’t get to have air conditioning as your days get hotter and hotter. So, we have to make a lot more energy. Even if the rich countries cut half of energy that they use, the middle-income countries including India deserve a lot more energy. So we need new technology. This is where my book focuses on—it lets you generate that energy, without the greenhouse gases. If we froze technology today, we will face an impossible choice between letting people improve their lives and emitting so much greenhouse gas that the warming would make the tropical areas almost unlivable.
Premji: I know one of the energies you are really excited about is nuclear. Tell us a little bit about why you are so excited?
Gates: Some of the things that we do, whether it is advanced seeds that can be controversial, family planning can become controversial. Through my office, I have invested millions in next-gen nuclear. Today’s nuclear plants, although they are fairly safe, are not inherently safe and they are a bit too expensive. And that design has been around for 50 years. It wasn’t designed with a digital computer. Now, we can make the fourth generation of nuclear power, which is a lot better. It gives you clean energy 24 hours and you can put it near where power is needed. I can’t say for sure that the world will accept nuclear because attitudes vary a lot, but it could be a key part of climate. We need to pursue nuclear energy, we also need to pursue other breakthroughs—miracles in storage, geothermals. So, we have different sources. Right now, the goal is to build demo plants of this next generation and really show people that the economics, safety and waste, all of those things can really be dealt with.
Premji: What is your view on investing in these technologies, as some of these may not pay off. You have to have bold philanthropy, perhaps which will look at investments that may or may not pay off? What is the role of investing in these technologies of the future? Is it the responsibility of philanthropy, private market forces or governments? What do you think about that?
Gates: Four years ago, at the Paris Climate Accord, Prime Minister Modi announced what he called mission innovation and there was a commitment from governments to double their energy on R&D. So, governments, in terms of basic R&D which is open to everyone, have a key role in terms of regulations that encourage things like electric buses and cars. They have a lot to do to let you build a grid, when you put on intermittent power, you need to connect up the entire country because you have parts of the country with no wind or sun.
The only way to get reliability is to have as big a grid as possible. So, governments have a big, big role to play.
The venture capitalists have tried to back the clean energy sector, but it didn’t go that well. So we’ve created, with help from people like John Doerr and Vinod Khosla, who are fantastic, this new venture group called Breakthrough Energy Ventures. I called 25 rich people, 21 said yes. So, I got the billion dollars quite easily and we’ll do a number of rounds. That group has now invested in 30 breakthrough ideas. We need to invest in about a 100, I think, because 10-15% will be successful. Energy is a lot harder than software. Software, you just do it, put it out there and get feedback. With energy it is the physical economy, and that has to be reliable. All the electrons are kind of same. There isn’t a special market out there. So, this is going to be difficult. There have been books written on how slowly things change in the industrial economy. We will be having more global cooperation, more innovation, more speed than ever in the history of the Earth, and that’s what we need.
Premji: The impact of climate change on diseases. Vector-borne diseases such as malaria, which you are very passionately focused on, and its eradication, like you did with polio… What are the challenges of climate change and the changing goal post, because we don’t know how it can spread further?
Gates: Eighty per cent of people suffering from climate change will be poor farmers. How does climate change make them suffer? It is not just that it’s hot during the day. Although, in some places it is almost unlivable. It is that their crop will fail more like every three years than 8-10 years. Their productivity every year will be lower. So that means more malnutrition, which means they will be dying of diseases. The way we respond to that is to come up with much better seeds, better advice, credit for fertilizers and we have to improve the health system. Even if they get pneumonia or diarrhoea, they won’t die.
As you heat the world up, the mosquitoes can live in higher altitude. A lot of African cities are located in the altitude where mosquitoes don’t come. As it gets warmer, mosquitoes thrive in places where they didn’t before. Potentially it is very bad. But we should have enough tools to get rid of malaria, independent of climate change. Malaria is a pretty evil stuff without the temperature going up. It is an example of something that makes things worse.
Premji: Switching from climate change to AI (artificial intelligence). It is a subject that we all believe has a huge impact and potential. The world has made a lot of progress in AI over the last few years. The building of algorithms, availability of data, compute and storage has certainly made the commercial usage of AI more prevalent. There is tremendous opportunity for AI in the social space—in how you detect disease, manage disaster relief, smarter cities, safer cities, plant management. Give us a holistic view from your perspective on where you see AI going? You have mentioned that AI is both a nuclear power and a weapon in terms of its promise and danger. What should we be excited about, and what should we be cautioned about regarding AI?
Gates: AI has accelerated over the last 10 years, with this machine learning technique called deep learning. Some varieties around that have advanced very rapidly. There is a class of things like game playing, speech recognition, image recognition, where the performance levels have been phenomenal. If you compare human speech recognition to computer speech recognition, the computer is slightly better and that is mind-blowing.
In AI, usually we see things that are completely dumb—it is hard for us when we interact with a bot, but bots are really good at a few things. And when we see that, we think it must be good at everything. We think that it can do something like read a book. It can’t read a book. It has no model of the world, common sense. There are a lot of people at Microsoft and Google, etc., working hard to try and do that, but that is a very unknown area.
What we have today is a tool. We are going to take AI and create an ultrasound device so that when a woman is pregnant, we will be able to see if it is going to be a complicated pregnancy. We can point at the lungs and see if there is infection or TB (tuberculosis). The person using that won’t have to be well trained.
There are miracle tools that even today’s AI can give us. A lot of the debate is about when the next stage is coming and in terms of what that does to the job market. How do we think about that? It is out there and a very important topic. There is a recent book called Rebooting AI, which talks about what we’re good at and what we’re not, and reminds people that we’re not really at the breakthrough yet, and we don’t even know the path to the breakthrough that gets general intelligence.
Premji: You touched upon this. What is your view on the narrative that AI is taking over our jobs? If you believe that, do you worry at all that to reskill people and the kind of advance skilling you require to reskill, do you further enhance the inequity gap?
Gates: You have to be careful. When there are advances, in a sense, we are all better off. If machines can make all the food and the clothes and none of us have to work, you think you have all the freedom. If we want to stand behind the counter and make sandwiches, you can, but there is another way of doing it. It will be very disruptive. If you are mid-career in manufacturing or driving, then it is a disruption. We have had that in a slow way for hundreds of years. We used to all be farmers and, now, very few of us are farmers. That happened gradually enough and more generational as opposed to mid-career. The rate of change, and the need for the government to step in to help improve everybody so that they have a safety net. If you have more resources, the safety net should be incredible—the food, resources and rent safety net. The world today, we have a lot of shortages. Even in a rich country, people talk about universal basic income. That is basically when you are so rich you can have an unconditional safety net when even if you are just lazy, you get all sort of good things. We cannot afford that yet. If you get AI up to a certain level, then those periods of excess will come. Those are certainly not in my lifetime.
Premji: Share a couple of examples wherein AI has scaled the impact of the work that you are doing at the Gates Foundation, perhaps in health or education? Something that can excite us and has applicability in India?
Gates: Certainly we use AI to do drug discovery. These biological systems are very complicated, but the fact is we have vaccines for TB and HIV coming, which are partly enabled by this rich data, advance in biology and machine learning. The most direct application you would see is when we would examine a woman to see if she has cervical cancer we do image recognition—there we can do way better than any human or previous tests, just by using a cellphone camera. It can tell us if you need treatment. If you catch that early, you completely avoid that cervical cancer, which is caused by human papillomavirus. So, imaging, whether through ultrasound or through normal picture, even down at the primary healthcare clinic, there is going to be mind-blowing improvements in what we can do to treat people. And, some of it you will have on your own cellphone—to look at your sleep, to look at your diet, and help yourself do the things that avoid getting sick. So, these agents, agents that help you tutor or learn maths. You can have this great dialogue and figure out what you are confused about. It can be like a personal tutor. That’s coming within the next five years, or so, and that is fantastic because it can prepare a society to do new types of work.
Premji: I want to move to social media, Bill. Social media has been an amazing leveller—of access, connectivity and information. We have created some of the largest platforms in the world. It can be misused in their reach and their power. What are your views on the responsibility of producers, distributors and consumers of information?
Gates: The thing with social media that wasn’t fully anticipated is this idea of upsetting people—things that really grab your attention can pull you away from the centre. So, if you are kind of a left-wing person, there are certain stories, some of which are true or not, can really incite you and get you feeling “God! Those rightwing people are so bad!"", and likewise for the right-wingers—various stories and exposures that can pull you. In the past, we all read the same newspaper, the same front page and the political ads. We all saw the same political ads. Nobody would run a political ad that was too over the top because they knew that even if 10% of the voters get really riled up in a positive way, the other ones would see them as really inappropriate for society as a whole. Today, because of targeting, which you can say started with satellite TV and hundreds of channels, the news shows kind of got fragmented, at least in the US. I don’t know India, with the kind of political slant. Now, it’s really extreme. You can target political ads at somebody to get them incensed, and incensed against the other. So, what should be the regulation about that? About that, my current view is that there maybe a need to ban the micro-targeting because it kind of drives people apart. It is a very novel set of issues and, in a way, people are mad at the tech companies, and say “how come you created this problem?"" Society has to decide what these rules are. Microsoft is not actually in the centre of this, we have things like LinkedIn or GitHub, but not the main kind of consumer video platforms or messaging platforms. But for the first time, people are saying how should we restrict this technology, wherein in many cases, the negatives outweigh the benefits.
Premji: My question is more basic. How do we make sure that what we distribute is the truth? What are your views on fact-checking and fake news, and content moderation? How do we ensure that what we read is, in fact, the truth, forget political ads, the more controversial things, but what about the basics? How can technology help us there?
Gates: In our foundation, the biggest thing we have done is work on vaccines and getting vaccines out for diarrhoea and pneumonia to all the children in the world, including with some amazing Indian partners. A number of the vaccines companies, such as Serum, have been phenomenal. Therefore, it’s very troubling when you see in this digital world that vaccines are bad and that they harm children. The idea that vaccines are bad, that they harm the children and, therefore, mothers shouldn’t vaccinate their children. This tool is allowing those untrue things to spread. When you put out an article about how these vaccines really protect your children, those don’t spread. There is a need to energize people—wow this is amazing, I have to tell my friends. But when you tell a lie, in this case, it is a lie. People are spreading this around. The idea is that a tool, I naively would expect would raise the level of factualness and understanding. A newspaper summarizing details, or when you click on YouTube, and it educates you about some areas of science, everybody is going to be doing that. In fact, for the vaccine denial, it has been a setback. Now hopefully, it’s a chance to be clever about the positive messages, clearly when children die of measles or pertussis (whooping cough). The risk is about those deaths and that’s talkative. I cannot say that we have solved it. Vaccine misinformation is worst today than ever.
Premji: I will end with a philosophical question. What do you think technology cannot serve? What do think in our society, in our way of living, will stand the test of time, no matter how much technology changes?
Gates: Well, technology can free up our time, but it can’t tell us what you want to do with all this free time. I mean, in the extreme, this idea that you have to go and do your job. Well, some jobs are pretty boring; at least I wouldn’t want to do those jobs. But eventually, it becomes a very deeply philosophical question. Machines won’t help in what we do with that time, and what we value. It used to be in the farming society, that yes, I am a good farmer. But now jobs are almost a sense of value—he is hard working, there are middle-class families that work hard.
What is the organizing principal, in education and all, it becomes less important. I am a weird case. Obviously, I don’t need to work, but the most fun thing for me is learning new science and knowing the partners, the foundation, and going around. Actually, even in the meantime, the society, it’s a very rich world and there’s a lot of poverty out there that we should be able to get rid of. In some ways, the idea of how you allocate, take these technical advances.
Something like malaria—there was almost no money going into it. What (little) we got was because the rich countries didn’t have malaria, and the poor countries didn’t have the ability to create new tools against it.
And, there was no market signal there, because those people who were suffering didn’t have enough money for it unless it was a priority. So, definitely, you know. if you need to overlay values. the capitalistic market system and the machines can’t do that for us.

10,2019-11-25,Wipro,"They do not seem to have engaged startups with the same urgency as foreign firms

It is now becoming better accepted that India’s engine of growth for the future will be driven by its entrepreneurial class, and that the “organized sector"", as generally defined, will be less of a contributor to future growth. This is coupled with the fact that the country’s other large employer, our government, has realized that privatization of assets is the way forward, as evidenced by recent news reports of public sector disinvestment of state-owned companies.
Nasscom recently released a report on startups in India. The study indicates that more than 1,300 startups have been set up thus far in 2019 and that their number has been growing at a healthy clip of 12-15% over the past five years. Seven of these startups reached “unicorn"" status this year (a unicorn is a start-up whose private market valuation is greater than $1 billion), and 24 of these companies are already active in India. The report also counts 60,000 new jobs directly added by these startups, with a knock-on effect of twice-to-thrice that number of indirect jobs getting created. In what is good news to a deep tech/science investor like me, the report says that the share of these startups leveraging deep tech has grown by a compounded annual rate of 40% since 2014 to over 1,600.
It is also evident that startup founders who have successfully cashed out of their first forays are now reinvesting at least some of those proceeds in the startup ecosystem. For instance, over 20 startups were founded by former members of Zoho’s team and over 10 startups by the alumni of FreshWorks.
Outside India, large organizations are engaging startups in growing numbers. This willingness to engage with the startup ecosystem is in part due to a general realization among senior management that their companies are not “agile"" and, as a result, not organized efficiently enough to respond timely to fast-paced technological change.
In addition to the slew of quarter-by-quarter investor demands, employees who have been coddled by an internal bureaucracy pose significant resistance to change in existing corporate cultures. While some lip service has been paid to “internal disruption"", the truth is that the lumbering nature of large enterprises makes them ill-equipped to handle innovation. Engaging with startups instead makes more sense for most large organizations, given that while startups tend to explore low-margin, high-risk and small-market propositions at first, such efforts do not support short-term company growth targets. Given time and money, they may well “disrupt"" or shrink the market share of today’s large firms a few years later, though.
There are many ways for established companies to engage startups. The first is through corporate venture funds and accelerators. These need clear objectives and often require a leader from outside the organization. Balancing collaboration with operational independence from the mother entity is crucial. Other popular modes of engagement are for corporations to pitch their problems to startups, asking for solutions, and offer themselves as early customers so as to gain insights into emerging technologies and guide their product evolution processes.
There are two examples from Germany that have been in the news recently: Bayer, with its focused programme to engage digital health startups called Grants4Apps, and BMW’s Start-Up Garage programme, which offers startups an opportunity to gain BMW as an early client.
Interestingly though, India’s corporate houses don’t seem to have responded with the same level of urgency as their foreign counterparts. Nasscom’s report suggests that 90% of the corporate investors who are active in equity funding are global multinational corporations. Further, while there were about 35 acquisitions in 2018 and 2019, it appears that it is mainly Reliance Industries that has increased its acquisitions this year.
Also, some casual research on participation from Nasscom’s original member firms, such as the big five Indian information technology (IT) service providers, throws up interesting findings. These stack up quite differently from the efforts of Big Tech firms.
In addition to Bayer and BMW, Microsoft, Google and Amazon are extremely active in the space. All three of these Big Tech firms actively provide credits to startups to use their colossal cloud computing environments. They also provide financial assistance via investment through corporate venture funding arms, in addition to assistance via joint go-to-market and sales enablement. For a startup focused on a business-to-business (B2B) technology value proposition, a joint go-to-market offer from a firm like Microsoft, which has an almost unassailable market share for its Windows products, can prove irresistible. The Redmond, Washington-based tech behemoth, is willing to provide over $120,000 in credits for the use of its Azure cloud platform for qualified startups to boot.
By contrast, IT services players such as Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys primarily engage startups via financial assistance through corporate venture capital and by granting them access to their client network. They lack the extra cloud operation platforms that are critical to getting startups up and running in the first place. These IT firms may risk getting left behind, given the attractiveness of Big Tech’s value propositions to B2B startups. It might be time for many companies to rethink their engagement of startups, especially in India.

9,2019-11-28,Wipro,"Syska looks to sell up to 49% stake at up to  ₹4,000 crore valuationThe promoters are looking to raise equity capital to deleverage the parent firm’s balance sheet

US-based private equity firms General Atlantic, Blackstone and TA Associates have evinced interest in Syska LED Lights Pvt. Ltd which plans to sell a significant minority stake, said two people aware of the matter, requesting anonymity.
Promoters of Syska, one of India’s leading LED (light-emitting diode) lighting solutions provider, are seeking to sell 40-49% stake in the company at a valuation of  ₹3,500-4,000 crore, said the first person cited above.
“The promoters are looking to raise equity capital to deleverage the parent company’s balance sheet. While there is interest from private equity majors, the discussions are at a preliminary stage,"" the person said. “The company has appointed Edelweiss as a sole adviser on the transaction.""
“The deal value could be anywhere between  ₹1,000-1,500 crore,"" said the second person cited above.
Syska group had outstanding debt of  ₹1,174.64 crore as on 31 March 2018, according to a 30 January note by rating agency Acuité. Its debt-to-equity ratio stood at 2.43 times, the report said.
Syska LED, General Atlantic, Blackstone and Edelweiss Financial Services declined to comment. An e-mailed query to TA Associates on Wednesday remained unanswered till press time.
Promoted by brothers Rajesh and Govind Uttamchandani, Pune-based Syska LED also manufactures grooming, personal care products and home wires under the ‘Syska’ brand name.
Founded in 2013, the company gets close to three-fourths of its revenue from trading and manufacturing of LED lights and distributing them across the country.
The lighting firm’s sales grew 26% to  ₹802 crore in fiscal year ended 31 March 2018, compared to the year-ago period, as per filings with Registrar of Companies (RoC). Its profit after tax, too, nearly doubled on a year-on-year basis to  ₹10.2 crore, during the period.
“There have not been any private equity investments in major lighting companies such as Philips Lighting, Wipro and Havells India. So, it is most likely that there will be a lot of interest in this transaction from PE firms considering it is a consumer-facing business that is also profitable. In my view, the company should be able to get a significant premium on its valuation, owing to its strong distribution network in the country,"" said Pankaj Chopda, director, Grant Thornton India Llp.
“The LED lighting market in India, which was dominated by Chinese imports earlier, is now expected to grow multi-fold, owing to ‘Make in India’ and many other government initiatives in this segment. Any market leader in this space, will therefore be a definite beneficiary,"" he added.
India’s energy efficiency market is estimated at $23 billion with a vast potential to grow as the government plans to expand the use of LED bulbs in the country. While its UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable Lighting for All) scheme aims to reduce LED bulb prices, the Street Lighting National Programme, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015, has replaced 13.4 million conventional street lights.
Syska LED is part of Syska Group, which comprises six firms including the LED lights business.
The group started its journey as Shree Sant Kripa Appliances Pvt. Ltd (SSK Group) in 1989, as a distributor of T-Series audio cassettes, CDs, and audio-video systems. Later, the group bagged the exclusive distributorship of Samsung smartphones and tablets in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
In 2012, the company acquired a Korean LED manufacturing company IST Ltd as a part of its launch of Syska LED lights in India and overseas."
8,2019-12-03,Wipro,"WCCL, the $1 billion-plus arm of Wipro Enterprises, has spent $950 million in acquisitions so farCanway is its 12th acquisition in the last 16 years and the second one this year

Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting (WCCL) on Tuesday said it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire South Africa-based personal care company Canway Corp., which markets brands such as Oh So Heavenly, Iwori, and IQ.
The transaction is expected to be completed by January-end. However, the transaction value was not disclosed.
Canway posted revenues of around $21 million last year.
WCCL, the $1 billion-plus arm of Wipro Enterprises, has spent $950 million in acquisitions so far. Canway is its 12th acquisition in the last 16 years and the second one this year. In April, WCCL acquired Splash Corp., the Philippines’s largest personal care company.
Oh So Heavenly, which accounts for 80% of Canway’s sales, is a popular personal care brand in South Africa, selling exclusively through Clicks, one of the leading health and beauty retailers in the country. “The Oh So Heavenly brand enjoys market-leading position in multiple categories such as bath and shower, hand creams, fragranced body sprays, and children’s products. It is a leader in the gifting segment that constitutes a large portion of the South African personal care market,"" Wipro said.
The Iwori brand, which uses key organic African ingredients, was launched recently with considerable success, WCCL said. The company has its own manufacturing plant and research and development centre in Durban.
“This acquisition gives WCCL a significant entry into South Africa and other African markets. It is an important milestone for us given our vision of being among the top three players in personal care in Asia and Africa. We are excited to be in South Africa, the largest personal care market in Africa and the second-largest economy of the continent,"" said Vineet Agrawal, chief executive officer of WCCL.
In India, the top seven best-selling personal care categories include cosmetics, fragrance, men’s grooming, skincare, bath and shower, hair care and oral care. Out of them, specialized categories such as cosmetics, fragrance, men’s grooming and skincare, are set to overtake the growth of generic categories. By 2020, these specialized categories will contribute 40-45% to the overall market, said a 2018 report by market research firm RedSeer Consulting.
On bringing Canway products to India, Agrawal said the company is yet to evaluate the launch in the country but is likely to come up with a plan by the end of January. “The Oh So Heavenly brand portfolio can be expanded to other international markets where Wipro has a strong footprint,"" said Raghav Swaminathan, chief financial officer, Wipro Enterprises.
Analysts believe the acquisition is a positive strategy for WCCL.
“For fast-moving consumer goods companies, Africa has always been on their radar for a while now. Essentially what companies such as WCCL are doing is entering the market through brands that already have a strong presence there and they might gradually push their own products,"" said Harminder Sahni, managing director at Wazir Advisors."
7,2019-12-09,Wipro,"Raju Reddy wants to create a model for building social entrepreneurship ecosystems in rural hubs countrywide

When Raju Reddy first left his home in Nizamabad, 175km north of Hyderabad, he was a 10-year-old going to Sainik School, Korukonda, near Visakhapatnam on the east coast. His father was an itinerant executive engineer for the Kadem irrigation project in Telangana and wanted his son to get a good education and “discipline"".
Today, 50 years later, Reddy is one of the most successful Indian Americans in Silicon Valley, having sold his IT services company Sierra Atlantic to Hitachi in 2010. But he still returns to Nizamabad every three or four months, like he used to as a boy.
Pappu (Telugu version of dal), vegetables, chapati, rice, and thick curds are on the lunch table which he shares with his 87-year-old father, Ram Reddy, and another prominent Bay Area angel investor, 75-year-old Kanwal Rekhi, who is a guest in their old two-storeyed bungalow. Cows in the backyard provide fresh milk for the curds, Reddy’s father tells Rekhi.
Apart from visiting his parents, Reddy works on a social entrepreneurship programme he founded, Kakatiya Sandbox, Nizamabad. It’s named after the Kakatiya dynasty under which Telugu culture flourished in the 13th century before it was overrun by the Delhi Sultanate.
DRAWING INVESTORS
What marks the modern-day Kakatiya is the diverse set of organizations and people that Reddy pulls into its ‘sandbox’ to tackle social problems with an “entrepreneurial mindset"". Hence Rekhi’s visit to one of the smallest outposts of the global networking and mentorship body, The Indus Entrepreneurs (TIE), which he co-founded in 1992. An iconic entrepreneur and investor like Rekhi coming all the way from San Francisco is a magnet for many others from nearby Hyderabad and other places.
Whether he’s dealing with moneyed patrons or millennials who want to make a difference, Reddy believes the key lies in giving them the confidence that their money and time are being put to effective use. “A lot of non-profit organizations and NGOs don’t deserve to be supported because they’re either corrupt or very personality dependent. So, for me, it’s about building an institution.""
He’s doing it brick by brick, just as he did with IT services company Sierra Atlantic, which employed 2,500 people in multiple countries when Hitachi acquired it in 2011. “Connecting with the community in Nizamabad, building a network of local leaders, supporting other social entrepreneurs and like-minded organisations--everything is incremental,"" explains Reddy. “Fundamentally, it comes down to your ability to attract, retain and nurture great talent. You need a strong purpose that can draw this great talent, but it’s really about people at the end of the day.""
There are important differences in a non-profit venture, so it’s also a learning and intellectually stimulating experience for him. “The for-profit world is Darwinian: you get feedback signals quickly. If you’re not serving your customers, they won’t buy, a competitor’s product will do better.""
The value of a non-profit organization is harder to assess. That’s why he pays a lot of attention to scaling and connecting with the right people and organizations on his periodic visits to Nizamabad.
VALLEY KINSHIP
On a drive to a skill development centre, Rekhi asks him if they track the progress of students after they leave the centre, and Reddy cites examples of those who got hired by Amazon and Google. Role models that other students can identify with are vital, agrees Rekhi, who always cites his own humble beginnings in Kanpur to inspire would-be entrepreneurs.
Watching them in the car, I could imagine the Rekhi-Reddy dialogue stretching back over two decades. The first Indian American to take his venture-backed company to a Nasdaq listing, Rekhi was an inspiration to Reddy and one of the first investors in Sierra Atlantic. The two friends continue to collaborate, whether it is co-investing, contributing to think-tanks and governments or philanthropy. It is this sense of kinship that underpins the success of Indians in Silicon Valley.
Reddy feels the Kakatiya Sandbox, inspired by the Deshpande foundation’s sandbox in Hubbali, Karnataka, has only scratched the surface. But it’s starting to make an impact at scale. One of its initiatives has reached over one lakh cotton farmers in Nizamabad, Karimnagar and Adilabad districts with better farming practices to increase yield.
He hopes to create a model that can be replicated in other parts of the country. “If you have 20 such ecosystems, each touching 10 million people, that’s 200 million people or a quarter of the rural population,"" says Reddy, who is used to thinking in numbers. “And it’s not a one-time impact. If we create the right sense of ownership and the right capacity at the local level, then it’s amazing how quickly we can see transformation.""
PICKING WINNERS
India has always been a part of Reddy’s entrepreneurial initiatives. He was working at Intel in California when he stitched together its first major outsourcing deal with Wipro. It later prompted him to start Sierra Atlantic. If Wipro and Infosys could provide software services to global companies out of Bengaluru, why not somebody like him who could straddle Silicon Valley and India? This led him to a 17-year journey culminating in one of the most successful exits for an Indian-American venture.
He became an angel investor after selling the company. One of the first cheques he wrote was for GreyOrange at a time when VCs scoffed at the fledgling robotics startup from India. Today its robots have marched into warehouses across the world.
Although he has picked some early winners, angel investing represents more than making money for him. “I’m fascinated or you could say suckered by ‘Pride of India’ stories,"" he says with a chuckle.
Reddy likes to back Indian entrepreneurs addressing global markets. He has an affinity for his alumni, knowing how the quality of its broad-based flexible system worked for him. His recruiter at Intel was also a Bitsian. So he’s paying it forward.
A recent investment was in Pixxel, which aims to send a ring of micro-satellites into orbit to provide better imagery for AI analytics in commercial and social use cases. Its founders, Awais Ahmed and Kshitij Khandelwal, were still in Pilani when they started the venture last year.
Reddy and Rekhi were co-investors in RedBus, acquired by Naspers in 2013, whose co-founder Phanindra Sama is a Bitsian. Today Sama is the chief innovation officer for the government of Telangana and a founding patron of Kakatiya Sandbox. These alumni and diaspora networks run deep. They’re now out to make an impact at the grassroots level.

NEW DELHI :
Indian equities to hit a one-month low on Tuesday, amid a sell-off, led by a fall in information technology (IT), auto, metal and banking stocks. A decline in index heavyweights--TCS, ITC, Axis Bank, HDFC and Reliance Industries--exacerbated the fall.
Investors also exercised caution, staying away from placing large bets, ahead of a host of global as well as domestic macroeconomic data releases and key events due through the course of this week.

IT stocks fell for the second straight session today, as the rupee strengthened. Analysts expect appreciation in the rupee to hurt margins of these companies, which typically earn a chunk of their revenue in dollars. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) fell 2.3%, Tech Mahindra Ltd was down 1%, Wipro Ltd shed 1% and HCL Technologies Ltd was 1.2% lower.

Traders also focused on general elections in the UK scheduled on 12 December.
The US Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee will begin its two-day policy meeting later today. Markets widely expect the central bank to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of the meeting Wednesday, having cut rates three straight times so far this year.
Back home, the government will release India’s retail inflation and factory output data on Thursday.

MUMBAI :
Anand Mahindra’s decision to be non-executive chairman of Mahindra and Mahindra, effective 1 April 2020, is also a culmination of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations, which mandate that the chairperson of the top 500 companies need to be non-executive.
To comply with Sebi norms, such changes are imminent in over 214 companies, including banks, public sector enterprises and large corporates, including Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Bharti Airtel Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and Adani Ports Ltd.
The likes of Mukesh Ambani of RIL, Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Airtel, Sanjiv Mehta of Hindustan Unilever and Sanjiv Puri of ITC will have to either become a non-executive chairperson, or take the executive role of managing director and chief executive officer.
According to data compiled by nseinfobase.com (run by Prime Database) of the top 500 companies, 162 have the same person as the chairperson, MD and CEO. In another 52 companies, the chairperson and MD/CEO are related.
Sebi norms under the Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirement (LODR) also mandate that chairperson cannot be related to the MD or CEO. Sebi relies on the definition of a relative as per the Companies Act, 2013.
“Promoter assuming a non-executive chairperson role is and would be rare. In my view, in most cases, you would find the promoter shall continue with the role of MD/CEO while appointing an existing independent director as the non-executive chairperson. There is still a long way to go. As with other regulations, especially relating to the composition of board, the true test will lie in its implementation -- would there be simple checkbox compliance as we have seen in the past or would the implementation be in spirit as well,"" said Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database, a primary market tracker.
Most of India Inc. is currently consulting lawyers and family office specialists on restructuring their management and board chairmanship.
“Corporates do not want a situation where they are saddled with someone, either at the board level or management level, who does not understand the thinking of promoters. Many Indian companies for years have been promoter-driven with control over management and board. So, the restriction that MD/CEO and chairman cannot be related is another big concern. The succession planning is acutely being relooked at,"" said a senior lawyer, who is consulting with some of the Nifty 50 companies on navigating the new Sebi requirements.
But, there are also some corporates who are resisting the change and urging Sebi to revisit the norms. So far, Sebi has refused to consider representations from India Inc. on this issue.
According to a joint report published by International Finance Corp. (IFC), the BSE and Institutional Investor Advisory Services India (IiAS) on corporate governance practice in Indian boardrooms, there is a pushback on Sebi regulations seeking separation of chairperson and CEO roles.
“We find that 57 companies in the BSE 100 and 23 of the 50 IPO companies have separated the roles of the chairperson and CEO, with the chairperson being non-executive. However, some companies have a chairperson and CEO from the same promoter group,"" said the report."

The outperformance of the NSE IT index waned in 2019 since September, partly because the government’s tax cuts did not benefit software services companies. But investors are also concerned about the moderation in revenue growth during the year. The NSE IT index had gained 24% in 2018, while the Nifty had risen 4%. So far in 2019, the NSE IT index has risen 9%, whereas the Nifty gained 12%.
The year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of industry leader Tata Consultancy Services Ltd dropped to single-digits in the September quarter. Growth at Wipro Ltd remained sluggish. Infosys Ltd and HCL Technologies Ltd kept up the momentum during the quarter. But many doubt if the one-off large deals that have powered Indian IT in the past year will be replicated in 2020.
The reasons are partly cyclical. Uncertainty on government spending, taxation and regulation ahead of the US presidential elections in November 2020 can delay decision-making at clients’ end, some fear.
“Besides inherent immigration rhetoric, we find that slow, delayed decision-making by clients in election years (FY09, FY13, FY17) has translated into cyclical growth moderation for the IT services industry,"" BOB Capital Markets Ltd said in a note.
There are structural headwinds as well. Sluggish economic activity and low bond yields in Europe are hurting spends in the key banking and financial services segment. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities warned that if spends of clients facing disruption in their respective industries can take a hit.
“While maturity of digital spends augurs well for medium-term growth delays/decline in spends of challenged clients can create near-term headwinds. Tier 1 IT has provided cautious outlook on near-term growth in spends from the (retail) vertical,"" analysts at Kotak said in a note.
Separately, an analysis of the client financials by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd shows a steady state at the US banking, financial services, insurance and consumer verticals. But troubles in retail, softness in oil and gas, manufacturing, in Europe means a large part of the IT companies’ target market is facing growth headwinds.
Of course, it is not all gloom and doom. Performance over the past year shows IT companies are withstanding the market challenges better. Digital and new-age services, which are seeing strong client spends, now constitute a large part of the IT companies’ revenues. In the September quarter, more than 38% of Infosys’s revenue came from digital. For TCS, the share stood at 33%.
With deal sizes also increasing, digital has become a key growth driver for Indian IT. However, the rapid expansion of this business has caught companies off-guard on the human resources side. Companies rushing to recruit employees with required skillsets is driving up costs, and hurting profitability. The trajectory of margins is another aspect investors will keenly track in 2020."
