114,2018-01-25,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma  chairman Israel Makov says he doesn't expect the slump in US generic prices that's roiling the global industry to last

Mumbai: The chairman of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India’s largest drugmaker, said he doesn’t expect the slump in US generic prices that’s roiling the global industry to last. 
Mumbai: The chairman of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India’s largest drugmaker, said he doesn’t expect the slump in US generic prices that’s roiling the global industry to last.
Pressure on prices will eventually lead to restrictions on supply that will hurt the health-care industry, Sun Pharma chairman Israel Makov said in an interview with BloombergQuint at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. “I see this as a temporary cycle.""
A consolidation among pharmacies and intensifying competition have sent prices of generic drugs, cheaper copies of off-patent medicines, in the US into a tailspin and has left the global industry scrambling to adjust. Sun Pharma has warned that revenue this year may come in lower than last, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, the world’s largest generic-drug maker, has said it would eliminate 25% of its workforce and sell assets.
Makov, who was formerly the chief executive officer of Teva, said the current turmoil in the generic industry could be an opportunity for companies from India, already the world’s largest exporter of copycat medicines, to increase its share of the market globally. Bloomberg"
113,2018-02-14,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma reports a net profit of Rs365 crore in the December 2017 quarter compared to a net profit of Rs1,472 crore a year earlier

Bengaluru: India’s largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd reported a 75% plunge in third-quarter net profit on Wednesday as pricing pressures in the United States, its biggest market, hit sales.  
Bengaluru: India’s largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd reported a 75% plunge in third-quarter net profit on Wednesday as pricing pressures in the United States, its biggest market, hit sales. 
Sun Pharma, along with other Indian pharmaceutical companies, has been battling increased competition in the generics market and greater pricing scrutiny in the United States.
The drugmaker has also struggled as some of its products were banned from sale in the United States because the factories that made them did not meet US quality standards. It was also hit by adjustments for US tax reforms in the third quarter.
Its net profit of Rs365 crore ($57 million) for the October-December quarter was its smallest profit in over two and a half years, and well below analysts forecasts of Rs912 crore in a Reuters poll.
The company said its US sales slumped 35% to $328 million in the quarter, hurt by lower sales of generic versions of cancer drug imatinib and olmesartan, which is used in the treatment of high blood pressure.
US sales accounted for nearly a third of the company’s total sales, which fell 14% to Rs659 crore. 
The company said its profit was also hit by a one-off deferred tax adjustment of Rs513 crore on account of tax reforms in the United States. 
Sun Pharma shares closed 2.53% lower at Rs574.45 on BSE, while the Sensex was down 0.42% at 34,155.95 points. Reuters"
112,2018-02-24,Sun Pharma,"US FDA has issued a Form 483 with three observations after inspecting the Halol plant in Gujarat, for failing to meet good manufacturing practice standards, says Sun Pharma

Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India’s largest drug maker, on Friday said the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had made three observations after inspecting its factory at Halol in Gujarat, for failing to meet good manufacturing practice standards. 
Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, India’s largest drug maker, on Friday said the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had made three observations after inspecting its factory at Halol in Gujarat, for failing to meet good manufacturing practice standards.
“The US FDA conducted a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) inspection of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd’s Halol facility. At the conclusion of the inspection, the agency issued a Form 483 with three observations,"" the drugmaker said in a regulatory filing. The inspection was conducted between 12 February and 23 February.
The shares ended 5.17% higher to close at Rs570.20 on the BSE on 23 February.
Sun Pharma’s US supplies were hit over the past year after the US FDA found violations of manufacturing practices at the company’s Halol manufacturing unit. US FDA conducted its first inspection of the facility in 2014 and another in December 2015. The company was given a warning letter with six observations, preventing it from making fresh filings of new drug applications. 
In November-December 2016, Sun Pharma’s Halol plant was re- inspected and the US FDA issued Form 483 with nine observations. The FDA inspectors found the drugmaker’s testing programmes inadequate and said the company had failed to report potential contamination issues on time.
As per the US health regulator, observations are made in Form 483 when the investigators feel conditions or practices in a facility are such that products may become adulterated or could be injurious to health.
The facility at Halol, one of Sun Pharma’s biggest units, holds the key to its US formulation business. Sun Pharma gets about half of its revenue from the US market and the Halol unit contributes a majority of its drug filings. 
Barred from new drug filings in the American market, the company’s US business has been severely impacted in last couple of years due to the US FDA’s observations on Halol.
Resolution of concerns at the Halol unit is therefore critical for the company’s US business. Sun Pharma has been struggling to fix quality control problems at the facility. Clearance from the FDA will unlock several complex generic filings and allow the company to bolster existing products.
“The company remains committed to working closely with the US FDA and continues to enhance its Good Manufacturing Practices compliance on an ongoing basis. The company is committed to addressing these observations and will submit a reply to the Food and Drug Administration within 15 days,"" it said in the exchange filing.
Centrum Broking analyst Ranjit Kapadia said though the number of observations have come down to three from nine, it didn’t make any difference. “We still need details on these three observations. How serious they are before making any further comments. It is not known whether these observations are the same as earlier or new observations. The number of observations going down doesn’t matter.""
Purvi Shah, research analyst at Sharekhan said, “We view the development as a sentimentally positive read-thru for Sun Pharma and Sparc, as they have got only 3 observations as compared to earlier 9 observations in 2016-17 re-inspections. Closure of these observations with positive clearance from US FDA will remove long standing overhang on Sun Pharma and also for Sparc as it will help in acceleration of approvals from the plant. Currently, we have a ‘hold’ recommendation on the stock."""
111,2018-02-26,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma, for its Halol plant, got another form 483, which is issued when USFDA finds lapses in compliance, with three observations

When the answer finally came, it was a disappointing no. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd was unable to convince the US Food and Drug Administration inspection team to give its Halol (Gujarat) plant an all-clear. 
When the answer finally came, it was a disappointing no. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd was unable to convince the US Food and Drug Administration inspection team to give its Halol (Gujarat) plant an all-clear.
An establishment inspection report would have given it closure and closed the warning letter on the plant. That would then see pending generic drug approvals filed from Halol come through, adding to Sun Pharma’s revenues and profits. That would be welcome considering the pressure on its US generics business.
Instead, the company got another form 483 which is issued when the FDA finds lapses in compliance, with three observations this time, which was the only consolation. The previous inspection in December 2016 had resulted in nine observations. This one should have ideally resulted in none. Sun Pharma had spent considerable time and money in ensuring this plant was up to the USFDA’s compliance levels.
What next? The 5% increase in Sun Pharmaceutical’s shares was a bit surprising, considering its press release gave no details about the observations. It did not clarify if any of these were repeat observations. A repeat observation would be seen as a negative development. The statement states the standard line of taking prompt action and replying to the FDA in 15 days.
Once the form 483 becomes available, the severity of the lapses and whether there were any repeat ones will be known. If these are minor in nature and do not require a re-inspection by the regulator, it could be resolved relatively quickly. That will be the outcome investors will be looking for.
If this calls for remedial action and another inspection, then there may be a long wait. That will prolong their agony over the loss in earnings due to Halol’s non-compliant status. In the recent quarterly earnings, the company had said that pricing pressure was still visible in the US market. If Halol had come back on stream, then it could have eased some of that pressure. That plant goes right back on the watch list of triggers that investors should watch out for."
110,2018-03-21,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma announces its first US FDA approval for an innovative medicine, marking a milestone in the company's bid to diversify out of generic drugs by building a portfolio of novel ones protected by patents

Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., India’s largest drug maker, has announced its first US approval for an innovative medicine, marking a milestone in the company’s bid to diversify out of generic drugs by building a portfolio of novel ones protected by patents. 
Mumbai: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., India’s largest drug maker, has announced its first US approval for an innovative medicine, marking a milestone in the company’s bid to diversify out of generic drugs by building a portfolio of novel ones protected by patents.
Sun’s drug Ilumya was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat adults with moderate to severe cases of the skin condition plaque psoriasis, who are also candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. Phase-3 studies for the drug demonstrated significant clinical improvements, according to the statement.
“We are committed to working with all relevant stakeholders to make Ilumya available to appropriate people with plaque psoriasis,"" Abhay Gandhi, the chief executive officer of Sun’s North America business, said in the statement.
The approval comes as Sun’s core business making copies of other companies’ medicines has been squeezed by a wave of competition in the US, putting pressure on prices for these generic drugs. Sun has been particularly exposed because its ability to offset the price declines with new revenue has been hampered by a US sanction preventing new product launches from a key plant in India.
The roll out of innovative medicines has been seen not only as a new revenue stream, but one that will deteriorate less quickly because other generic firms won’t be able to copy them until the patents expire.
Sun licensed Ilumya from Merck & Co. in 2014, agreeing to fund Merck’s efforts to complete the Phase 3 trials and get it approved, and then takeover the commercialization and regulatory upkeep after. Merck is eligible for milestone payments and royalties on the drug. Bloomberg"

With this, Sun Pharmaceuticals is poised to become one of the handful of companies in India to launch a novel biological entity in the US market. While the price and date of launch is yet to be decided by the company, the company is evaluating European market for the next launch. 
Sun Pharmaceuticals acquired worldwide rights to tildrakizumab from Merck for $80 million in 2014, taking the responsibility for regulatory activities, including subsequent submissions, pharmacovigilance, post approval studies, manufacturing and commercialization of the approved product."

107,2018-03-23,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma has passed a key milestone with the Ilumya drug approval, but its investors seem to be fixated on its ability to get the USFDA approval for the Halol plant

In every conference call held in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) after Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s quarterly result, the launch of tildrakizumab was a key point discussed. The Halol plant’s non-compliant regulatory status was another. It’s a bit of a surprise then that its shares yawned at the announcement that the firm got a novel drug approval for Ilumya, the brand name for tildrakizumab. 
In every conference call held in fiscal year 2018 (FY18) after Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s quarterly result, the launch of tildrakizumab was a key point discussed. The Halol plant’s non-compliant regulatory status was another. It’s a bit of a surprise then that its shares yawned at the announcement that the firm got a novel drug approval for Ilumya, the brand name for tildrakizumab.
This could be a case of the news already in the price but this was by no means a slam dunk, as seen from the conversations in these calls.
There is the possibility that the company’s continuously flagging US sales growth and inability to clear the Halol hurdle has made investors circumspect, even in the face of positive news. At Halol, new generic approvals have stopped as even a recent inspection of the plant saw observations regarding deficiencies.
Ilumya is good news in that light, becoming a key contributor to US revenues eventually. This drug was licensed by Sun Pharma from Merck and Co. in 2014, by paying an initial sum of $80 million and while Merck did the work and filings to bring it to market, Sun Pharma has borne all costs.
It has worldwide rights for this product and has out-licensed it for Europe. Sun Pharma will pay Merck milestone-related amounts (the approval itself will trigger a payment) and then royalty on sales that will range from mid-single digit through teen percentage rates on sales.
Sun Pharma deserves a pat for getting its licensing candidate right, which targets a large market opportunity. In recent calls, Sun Pharma’s management has said its marketing organization for Ilumya is in place, and some field force recruitments are already done. That means related investments and expenses, to an extent, are already in its expenditure.
Initially, Merck will supply the product and later Sun Pharma will shift production to a third-party facility. Sun Pharma’s management had said that the investment phase for Ilumya—where the company will spend more than it will sell—may last for 1.5-2 years.
In the US, the market for psoriasis drugs is a sizeable one. For instance, Janssen Biotech Inc.’s Stelara earned $4 billion in global revenues in 2017. Janssen also launched a product Tremfya, which is in the same sub-category of IL-23 products, as Sun Pharma’s Ilumya. There are some concerns too, on whether too many products are crowding this market, whether Tremfya will be preferred over llumya, and also positive trial data for a new product risankizumab (being developed by AbbVie Inc.).
In response to a question that asked the revenue potential from speciality products, Sun Pharma’s managing director Dilip Shanghvi said that IL-23 and IL-17 (different sub-categories of immunology products targeting diseases such as psoriasis) are being sold by very large companies with more experience in speciality biologics than Sun Pharma. While the company may not have the same success the large firms may have (in turning it into a blockbuster drug), Shanghvi said it has a good product and sees no reason to not try and match those revenues. He also clarified that the current spend is not geared to handle that kind of volume and upside but Sun Pharma will take that decision closer to market.
After its March quarter results, the management will give a guidance for FY19, which should factor in the impact of Ilumya’s launch. Sun Pharma will probably share some details on its plans for the product and its future. Investors are keeping their hopes low. Whether they are surprised by the management’s guidance remains to be seen. The company has passed a key near-term milestone with the Ilumya approval. Sun Pharma’s investors seem to be fixated more on its ability to get the Halol facility compliant for them to change their cautious view."
106,2018-04-09,Sun Pharma,"Data from Bloomberg showed that M&M has 95.24% or 40 of the total 42 analysts tracking the company, recommending a buy or outperform rating on the stock

Mumbai: Analysts’ recommendations for front line stocks have seen some shakeup at the start of the new fiscal year with utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M) rising to be the most preferred Sensex stock because of the brightening outlook for the rural India story. 
Mumbai: Analysts’ recommendations for front line stocks have seen some shakeup at the start of the new fiscal year with utility vehicle maker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (M&M) rising to be the most preferred Sensex stock because of the brightening outlook for the rural India story.
Drug maker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. on the other hand, has dropped down from being the third-most preferred stock a year ago to the fourth-least preferred stock as pricing pressures weigh on the sector which derives a substantial chunk of its revenue from US.
The analysis includes stocks which have the highest percentage of buys/outperform/add ratings from the Sensex pack of the total ratings for the respective stocks.
Data from Bloomberg showed that M&M has 95.24% or 40 of the total 42 analysts tracking the company, recommending a buy or outperform rating on the stock. It has 2 “hold"" or “netural"" rating and does not have any sell of underperform rating.
Jefferies upgraded M&M to buy from hold on 16 March, and raised the target price to Rs860 from Rs820 earlier, saying stock performance has lagged improvement in fundamentals factors for the company.
“Higher government spending on rural economy and infrastructure ahead of 2019 elections is likely to sustain tractor cycle—good monsoon is an additional catalyst,""J efferies India Pvt. Ltd. analysts Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal said in the note.
Tractor and light commercial vehicle (LCV) cycles have been stronger than expected and outlook remains positive, and margin has expanded over 100 basis points so far in the current fiscal year, Jefferies’ analysts said, adding that value of listed investments of the company have appreciated.
“Yet stock performance over 3/12 months has not reflected much of this. While we have medium-term concerns over PVs (passenger vehicles), capital allocation, sustainability of tractor cycle, the mispricing is a near-term opportunity, in our view,"" Jefferies analysts Arya Sen and Ranjeet Jaiswal said in the note.
The stock is down 2.7% so far in the calendar year 2018, but has added nearly 14% so far in fiscal year 2018.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s (BofAML) belief in the rural story stems from the fact that the government is likely to respond to any actual/perceived loss of political ground by increasing social/rural expenditure and aggregate agricultural incomes are still growing year-on-year, but more importantly, agriculture is now a much smaller part of rural GDP.
“Our December Sensex target of 32,000 still implies downside—but sectors exposed to Rural India (two wheelers, cement, staples) should do relatively better. Amongst covered stocks, we like M&M, Hero MotoCorp and Hindustan Unilever,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on 26 March,
On the other hand, Sun Pharma has 41.46% or 17 of 41 analysts rating the company a buy or an outperform, while 11 have a hold or neutral on the stock, and 13 have a underweight, reduce or sell. At the end of last fiscal year though, stock had 39 buys and just one sell rating of the total 46 ratings.
In the quarter ended December, the country’s largest drugmaker reported a sharp 75% plunge in net profit from a year before as pricing pressures in the United States, its biggest market, hit sales.
Sun Pharma’s US generics are impacted with strong competition in Derma portfolio of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., competitive intensity in older generics, and supply disruption from Halol, Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd. noted in a report on 14 February, while maintaining reduce rating on the stock. 
The second and third most preferred stocks were leading private lenders ICICI Bank Ltd. and HDFC Bank Ltd., respectively. In terms of absolute number of buys, both these bank stocks had the highest number of buys/outperform at 50 each.

103,2018-05-28,Sun Pharma,"The worst may be over for Sun Pharma, it appears from the Q4 results, and also from the management's guidance of a low double-digit growth in FY19. Still, investors will remain cautious

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s stock is down by a fifth from a year ago as of Friday when it declared its March quarter (Q4) results. Whether the rest of FY19 turns out differently for investors depends on whether it can deliver on its promises. 
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s stock is down by a fifth from a year ago as of Friday when it declared its March quarter (Q4) results. Whether the rest of FY19 turns out differently for investors depends on whether it can deliver on its promises.
In FY18, its revenue declined by 14% chiefly because the US generic drugs business failed to deliver. Even after adjusting for currency fluctuations and GST-related effects, revenue still fell by 9.5%. The worst may be over, it appears from the Q4 results, and also from the management’s guidance of a low double-digit growth in FY19. Still, investors will remain cautious.
Some key launches expected in the US market are one reason behind Sun Pharma’s guidance. While it is confident of delivering on those, another pillar for the guidance is the pending clearance of its Halol plant from the US Food and Drug Administration. The long-pending resolution of this plant has affected its launch pipeline and investor confidence in Sun Pharma as other companies have succeeded where it has failed.
The management said they expect to complete their remedial actions by the second quarter of FY19. A green signal from the US FDA subsequently should clear the path for approvals from this facility. Given the repeated regulatory setbacks for this plant, investors will probably wait for confirmation before factoring recertification in their estimates.
In the March quarter, Sun Pharma’s US revenue rose by 12.2% sequentially which was attributable to better showing by specific products and gains in market share. If this continues in the current fiscal, it will be good. The company also expects to launch three speciality products. While these will also see costs increase due to hiring and marketing, they should contribute to revenue growth too in the medium to long term.
Sun Pharma’s domestic sales too are improving though GST-related accounting changes are affecting reported numbers. While it reported 2% growth in the quarter, it said full year reported sales growth of 4% would have been 9%, adjusted for GST-related effects. The market itself is recovering and Sun Pharma’s domestic growth in FY19 should look better, barring any uncertainty caused by government policy.
Overall, Sun Pharma’s revenue in the March quarter declined by 2.2% over a year ago and rose by 4.9% sequentially. 
Its profitability improved by 2.3 percentage points sequentially to 24.1%. This was chiefly due to a higher gross margin.
Sun Pharma said that they intend to rationalize their US generics portfolio and weed out unprofitable products. A better product mix and lower material costs are two reasons that could contribute to higher gross margins. If gross margins sustain at higher levels, that can be another positive signal. Even on the research front, the company intends to focus its spending on speciality products and rationalise R&D spends too. That too could lead to better margins.
Much of what Sun Pharma’s management is saying and doing seems sensible. The numbers too indicate that the company’s performance is on the mend. The two uncertainties are whether its long tryst with the US FDA for its Halol plant ends in its favour in FY19, and whether pricing pressure or any other new policy hiccups trips up its US generics business again. If none of that happens, then FY19 may well be the year when Sun Pharma finally sees some sunshine on the valuation front."

The brokerage firm has increased its target price to Rs600 a share from Rs445 a share.
The company also said that it sees domestic operations growing in excess of 10% year on year against 9% in fiscal year 2018. R&D expense to increase to 8-9% of fiscal 2019 sales with higher spend on specialty products which analyst expects that may improve margins.
“We expect FY19 to be a critical year for Sun’s specialty initiatives, with three key products (viz. Illumya, Seciera, Yonsa) hitting the market and likely scale-up in a few others (Bromsite, Odomzo).

USFDA issues VAI status to Sun Pharma on its Halol plant. VAI status means that though objectionable conditions were found at the plant, the issues do not justify further regulatory action and any corrective action is left to the investigator to take voluntarily.
A Sun Pharma spokesman said the company was assessing the USFDA update.
The US drug regulator in February had made three observations after inspecting its factory at Halol in Gujarat, for failing to meet good manufacturing practice standards, reported Mint.
The facility at Halol, one of Sun Pharma’s biggest units, holds the key to its US formulation business. Sun Pharma gets about half of its revenue from the US market and the Halol unit contributes a majority of its drug filings.
Analysts believe that this development brings the company closer to obtaining USFDA clearance for its Halol plant."

98,2018-06-11,Sun Pharma,"The resolution of Sun Pharma's Halol plant could add as much as $100 million in revenues annually

Is this the beginning of something good for Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd?  
Is this the beginning of something good for Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd? 
More importantly, will investors regain their long lost faith in the company, whose shares have halved from their high levels of April 2015?
Consider the 8% jump in its share price on Friday. News reports said the US Food and Drug Administration had delivered a voluntary action indicated (VAI) verdict after an inspection of its Halol facility. 
This was apparently interpreted by investors as a sign that a re-inspection was not required. 
In turn, that implied a shorter resolution timeline after which pending generic drug approvals could get cleared.
The significance of this resolution, if it does actually happen, is not in question.
The plant’s non-compliance has held up approvals for nearly four years now and is partly responsible for Sun Pharma’s US business underperformance. But this development should not have been news to Sun Pharma’s shareholders.
In a conference call on 25 May, after its March quarter results, Dilip Shanghvi, managing director’s responses to questions on Halol also indicated as much. 
He said that they did not expect a re-inspection and that the last date for a post-remediation response to FDA was in the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.
The guidance for FY19 too included a quarter or two of revenues from launches from Halol, which assumed it would get a green light.
Still, its shares went up 8% on news that merely confirms what the management said very recently. Does that reflect lack of confidence in the management’s assertion? 
That is possible. It’s been nearly four years since Halol came under the FDA scanner, in which it has tripped on multiple inspections and was also issued a warning letter. You can’t fault investors for wanting to see proof that this time could actually be different.
The management’s response to the stock exchanges, after Friday’s news, says they will be able to provide an update after they get an establishment inspection report (EIR). 
The EIR is a closure report that will hopefully see Halol turn compliant, the warning letter will get lifted, and the cycle of approvals will resume.
That is important as Halol’s resolution could add as much as $100 million in revenues annually, according to a Motilal Oswal Research note.
While that can add to revenue and profit, the cash flows so generated will be useful for its research programmes.
The problems in the external environment will remain, such as pricing pressure and competition in the US market or the threat of domestic policy proposals to control drug prices.
But Halol was a problem of its own making. Getting rid of it will allow the management to focus on the market. Thankfully, there are no recent repeats of Halol in other locations. In the same conference call, Shanghvi had said the past year saw 18 site audits by the US FDA, which resulted in either zero or very limited observations. If they can maintain that record, say for the next five years, their credibility on this front should recover."

The facility had been under FDA scanner since September 2014. 
In December 2015, it was served a warning letter, following an inspection that revealed quality issues. Since then, there have been no FDA approvals for drugs made at this plant.
The resolution of the issue paves way for Sun Pharma to resume selling to the US market from this facility. The US business accounts for 35-40% of the revenue for Sun Pharmaceutical.
Prior to the FDA action in 2014, the plant accounted for 8-10% of Sun Pharma’s US business, especially injectables. 
In February, the US FDA had issued three observations after inspecting the facility. The company had then said it was preparing the response to the observations.

In the last two years, pharma companies have seen earnings decline due to the inadvertent price decline in US generics markets. The mutual fund house expects these companies to report growth in FY19 due to launch of new products and cost control which would help earnings recover to FY17 base. 
It expects normalization of growth to 12-14% for domestic industry in the next 12 months. Rural, infrastructure and consumption are three themes that the mutual fund house is bullish on for FY19.
Elusive earnings growth and higher valuations were major concerns for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) who have been continuously selling Indian shares while domestic institutional investors (DII) including mutual funds and insurance companies’ buying have been intact. So far this year, FIIs have sold Indian equities worth $ 845.31 million while DIIs have bought  ₹ 59,912.14 crore.
According to Patil, FIIs may continue to sell in India on valuation concerns, high crude price, rupee depreciation and increasing interest rates. Crude prices have risen 14.66% while rupee has slipped 6.83% in 2018. In June, the US Federal Reserve announced the second interest hike of the year and the seventh since it started increasing lending rates in 2015—taking overnight lending rate in the US to a range between 1.75% and 2%. 
The US Federal Reserve’s rate-setting panel also signalled two more rate hikes this year and dropped its pledge to keep rates low enough to stimulate the economy “for some time"". Higher interest rates tempt large foreign funds to move their money to the US, hurting emerging markets including India which are already struggling with a stronger dollar and expensive crude oil.
After a robust rally last year, markets are struggling to stay firm as investors remain worried on global political developments as trade tensions between world two biggest economies US and China have escalated. In the year so far, Sensex and Nifty have gained 1.34% and 3.41% respectively while MSCI World Index dropped 0.72% and MSCI Emerging Markets Index slipped 7.83%.
According to Bloomberg data, earnings estimate for Nifty companies in FY19 has been slashed 1.3% from beginning of this fiscal while for next year, it has been cut by 0.9%. Valuation-wise, price to earnings (PE) of Nifty is at 17.16 for this year which makes it one of the most expensive markets among peers. 
The Indian markets ended nearly 1% lower on Wednesday. The Sensex ended at 35,217.11, down 272.93 or 0.77% while the Nifty closed at 10,671.40, down 97.75 or 0.91%."

New Delhi: The country’s largest drug maker, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, has received its first approval in five years for a product manufactured at its Halol, Gujarat, plant from the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA). 
Infugem, which is used for the treatment of cancer and is manufactured at its Halol facility, received the USFDA approval on Wednesday, the company said.
The Halol plant had been under USFDA scanner since September 2014 and the quality cloud over it was lifted only last month. The resolution of the issue paved the way for Sun Pharma to resume selling to the US market from this facility, which accounts for 35-40% of the revenue for the company. 
“This is the first USFDA approval for the product from Sun Pharma’s Halol facility post receipt of the Establishment Inspection Report (EIR) in June 2018,"" Sun Pharma said. 
The USFDA approval is for Infugem injection (gemcitabine in 0.9% sodium chloride injection) 10 mg/mL, for intravenous use in a ready-to-administer bag. The product will add to the drug firm’s expanding oncology portfolio of novel products. It had an addressable market size of about $35 million for the 12 months ended March 2018, the company said.
“The technology used to formulate Infugem eliminates the risks associated with compounding, an extra step in the administration of cytotoxic infusion products, providing improved safety for healthcare professionals and cancer patients,"" said Abhay Gandhi, Sun Pharma’s North America chief executive officer.
Infugem uses a proprietary technology that allows cytotoxic oncology products to be premixed in a sterile environment and supplied to the prescribers in ready-to-administer infusion bags. 
According to the pharma firm, the product provides greater safety by preventing problems of “over or under dosing"". It also prevents “the risk of contamination that can lead to infections"", Sun Pharma said. 
In December 2015, the company’s Halol plant was served a warning letter, following an inspection that revealed quality issues. Since then, no new products manufactured at the facility have been approved."

88,2018-08-15,Sun Pharma,"What is surprising is that despite the increase in sales in the US, Sun Pharma's gross margins have declined both from a year earlier and sequentially

If Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s sales in the US turns around, that solves most of its problems. The company’s June quarter (Q1) results did provide a hint of that happening, which was enough to send its shares up 6.9% on Tuesday. Now, Sun Pharma’s US business sales rose 8% from a year earlier and 3% sequentially. While this is a rebound from the decline seen in preceding quarters, remove sales of its US subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, and the numbers look even better. Sun Pharma’s own sales rose 18.3% on-year and by 17% sequentially. That’s a positive sign.

Sun Pharma’s own sales rose 18.3% on-year and by 17% sequentially. That’s a positive sign.
The company launched a speciality product Yonsa, a drug to treat prostate cancer, in the US market. A few more US launches are expected. The company is also awaiting approval to launch two speciality products filed from Halol, a plant that has recently been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). A steady stream of launches can drive up its US business growth, while delays can flatten it. Taro’s relatively dull showing is a risk to growth.
Sun Pharma’s India business saw sales increase by 22% over a year ago, but this is partly due to a low base effect, and will normalise from the current quarter.
What is surprising is that despite the increase in sales in the US, Sun Pharma’s gross margins have declined both from a year earlier and sequentially. This was attributed to product mix and higher input costs at Taro. Higher contribution from countries such as India and other emerging markets, where margins would be relatively low compared to the US, could explain the mix part.
The company had said that its launch programme in the US market will lead to higher costs during FY19. This is visible in the 7.8% increase in employee costs over a year ago, but other expenses are down by 1.3%. Its research expenses were also 4.2% lower from a year earlier. The net result was an impressive 4.6 percentage point increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) margin, but note that Ebitda fell 1.9 percentage points sequentially.
Growth in the domestic pharmaceutical market is expected to sustain and that should hold up Sun Pharma’s growth, but not at the first quarter’s inflated growth rate.
Now, the company’s US business is expected to see a revival as launches pick up steam. Keeping an eye on them will give an idea of how those expectations are working out through FY19. If Taro’s US revenue growth picks up speed, that can be useful. Quarterly margins may see some fluctuations, as expenses related to US launches may be front-loaded, while revenues may take time to ramp up. Even research expenses tend to be lumpy and could swell up in a quarter.
Sun Pharma said it expects sales to grow in the low double-digits in FY19. If you annualize the first quarter revenue, it represents a 3% increase over FY18. That’s a sign that the company has already factored in growth in the US revenues in the remaining three quarters in its guidance. 
A higher-than-expected growth in the US market, possibly due to an accelerated pace of launches, is what Sun Pharma’s investors should look out for, to change their view on the company’s stock."

New Delhi: Two days after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued six observations related to deficient procedures at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s Halol manufacturing facility, the regulator also turned up the heat on the drug company’s Mohali plant in Punjab by starting a three-day surprise inspection at the plant on Monday. 
The US drug regulator had found seven breaches of manufacturing standards at the Mohali plant during an inspection between 7 and 16 November 2016 and had issued Form 483, citing four deviations in the laboratory system, two in the quality system and one in production.

New Delhi: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and its research arm Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd (SPARC) on Friday said it has got the US Food and Drug Administration’s (US FDA) approval for its new drug application of XELPROS, which is used to reduce open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. 
New Delhi: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and its research arm Sun Pharma Advanced Research Company Ltd (SPARC) on Friday said it has got the US Food and Drug Administration’s (US FDA) approval for its new drug application of XELPROS, which is used to reduce open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
With this, Sun’s speciality ophthalmic portfolio in the US now features three approved products.
“This approval is from Sun Pharma’s Halol (Gujarat) facility. Sun Pharma in-licensed XELPROS from SPARC in June 2015 and this approval will trigger a milestone payment to SPARC,"" said a joint statement by Sun Pharma and SPARC.
The approval concerns Sun Pharma’s Halol (Gujarat) facility and negates recent concerns over the plant, which got six observations from US regulators last week, according to the statement.
SPARC is also eligible for milestone payments and royalties on commercialisation of XELPROS in the US, the statement added.
“This approval, coming less than one month after the approval of CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution) 0.09%, reaffirms the strength of Sun Pharma’s fast-growing ophthalmic division and its commitment to serve the needs of patients with ocular disorders,"" said Sun Pharma CEO North America Abhay Gandhi.
The approval was sought in June 2015. However, the company could not get the approval because of concerns raised by USFDA, with Sun pharma receiving a warning letter for Halol and future products approvals being withheld in December 2015. In June 2018, Halol was cleared by USFDA. 
XELPROS will be commercialised in the US by Sun Ophthalmics, the branded ophthalmic division of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s wholly-owned subsidiary.
Shares of Sun Pharma closed on Friday 2.35% higher at  ₹ 665.10 apiece on BSE.
“Approval of XELPROS by USFDA is a significant milestone for SPARC. It is also a validation of our SMM technology, which helps to solubilise drugs that have limited or no solubility, thus eliminating the need for benzalkonium chloride,"" said Anil Raghavan, the chief executive officer of SPARC."

77,2018-12-05,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma's management appears keen to resolve investor concerns and unwind transactions or structures they disapprove of, but there remain unanswered questions

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd tried its hand at limiting the damage from a scathing note by a brokerage firm and a whistleblower complaint to the Securities and Exchange of India (Sebi). The company issued a written statement clarifying its position, followed by a conference call with analysts and investors. But none of these seem to have helped. Leave alone a recovery, Sun Pharma shares fell another 2.7% on Tuesday, taking the drop in the past seven trading sessions to more than 15%. 
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd tried its hand at limiting the damage from a scathing note by a brokerage firm and a whistleblower complaint to the Securities and Exchange of India (Sebi).

Leave alone a recovery, Sun Pharma shares fell another 2.7% on Tuesday, taking the drop in the past seven trading sessions to more than 15%.
Investors are worried about the possibility of a regulatory probe. Besides, the company’s valuations don’t offer much comfort either—they are near the industry average after the correction, and provide no compelling reasons for investors to jump in. Are the worries around corporate governance reasonable?
Sun Pharma managing director Dilip Shanghvi’s response to a question on the use of little-known merchant banker Jermyn Capital illustrates the difficulty it is facing in explaining its past decisions. Earlier, the company clarified that Jermyn Capital had only co-managed its 2004 FCCB (foreign currency convertible bond) issue and JPMorgan & Chase Co. was the lead manager.
When an analyst queried why they needed Jermyn Capital even as a co-manager and whether it was true that the merchant banker had links to Ketan Parekh and Dharmesh Doshi, Shanghvi replied he was unable to respond as the information was old and they did not have it with them.
He also made a point that in 2004, Sun Pharma was a  ₹ 1,100 crore company, which is barely 3% of its current revenue. In the past 14 years, the regulatory framework, expectations of transparency and corporate governance have changed significantly. Applying today’s standards and revisiting old management decisions puts an unreasonable burden, goes the reasoning. Evidently, investors don’t agree.
But questions have also been raised on current developments. In FY18, loans given by Sun Pharma rose to  ₹ 2,242 crore, compared to  ₹ 69.8 crore a year ago. This sharp increase has been questioned. The company said this was a structured transaction, related to the pharmaceutical business. But it did not share more details, citing business sensitivity. Sun Pharma has said it can unwind this transaction earlier than planned, if required.
Then, there’s the matter of Aditya Medisales, through which the domestic business sales are routed. This firm became a related party in FY18 due to consolidation among its promoter entities. Even earlier, it was linked to Sun Pharma’s promoters. Shanghvi explained that this was a structure created from a tax efficiency viewpoint but the company is open to changing it. When asked if this will affect the tax outgo, he clarified that with changes to laws, such as the goods and services tax (GST), there would be no impact.
Although Shanghvi did not comment on the tax efficiency part, the structure may have been useful when state taxes were levied in every state. Some companies devised a distribution structure to lower the cascading effect of state taxes. If Sun Pharma taking over distribution will have no impact on the tax efficiency, maybe the change could have been effected earlier itself.
On the positive side, Sun Pharma’s management appears keen to resolve investor concerns and unwind transactions or structures they disapprove of. But there remain unanswered questions or partially unanswered questions, and whether regulatory agencies investigate these allegations. The outcome of any investigation can be an uncertainty that could hang heavy over the stock. It also comes at a time when growth concerns in the US generics business are already affecting investor sentiment.
The management may have to do more, on sharing information and taking adequate steps to satisfy investors. 
The episode acknowledges that investor concerns on corporate governance, whether big or small and whether new or dated, will have to be taken seriously. It also puts other companies on watch, even the big names, who may have skeletons in their closets."

2) The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure BSE midcap and smallcap indices also falling nearly 2% each.

10) Further adding to concerns for the Indian markets, oil prices rose today, extending gains from Friday when producers club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. Brent crude edged up 0.2% to $61.79 per barrel."
75,2018-12-12,Sun Pharma,"A whistleblower had last month approached Sebi with a document alleging various irregularities by the company

Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi Wednesday said it is examining the whistleblower complaint against Dilip Shanghvi-led Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. 
Mumbai: Markets regulator Sebi Wednesday said it is examining the whistleblower complaint against Dilip Shanghvi-led Sun Pharmaceutical Industries.
A whistleblower had last month approached Sebi with a document alleging various irregularities by the company, its promoter Shanghvi and others.
“There is whistleblower complaint which we are examining. I have nothing more to add,"" Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi told reporters after its board meeting.
Sources had told PTI last month that Sebi may reopen an insider trading case against Sun Pharma and as well as probe alleged lapses by some of its promoters and other entities in raising funds overseas.
Following this, Shangvi, who is also the managing director of the pharma firm, had said it has not received any query so far from the markets regulator regarding the whistleblower complaint.
“We are following highest levels of corporate governance at Sun Pharma,"" Shanghvi had said.
In August 2017, Sun Pharmaceutical, Shanghvi and nine other entities settled an insider trading probe on payment of  ₹ 18 lakh towards settlement charges.
However, reports have stated that the regulator is likely to reopen the case as it has powers to reopen cases of settlement related to insider trading on various grounds.
The sources had said that alleged irregularities by the company’s promoters and others in raising funds through Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds (FCCBs) are also likely to be investigated by the watchdog.
In August 2017, the regulator had not disclosed the details of the insider trading case.
However, it had appeared to be related to the acquisition of Ranbaxy by Sun Pharma from Japanese drugmaker Daiichi, as the settlement with the regulator has also been done by former Ranbaxy CEO Arun Sawhney, Daiichi’s director Kazunori Hirokawa, its ex-Chairman Takashi Shoda and its former senior executive officer Tsutomu Une.
Shoda is said to have led Daiichi’s acquisition of Ranbaxy in 2008, though the Japanese giant had to eventually sell its stake in the company to Sun Pharma in 2014.
Besides, the settlement was done by Ranbaxy’s former secretary S K Patawari; Sun Pharma’s directors Sudhir V Valia and Sailesh Desai; and its company secretary Sunil Ajmera."

New Delhi: Sun Pharma on Wednesday said its arm DUSA Pharmaceuticals has received relief from a US court in a patent infringement case.
Massachusetts-based DUSA has been granted preliminary injunctive relief by a federal district court prohibiting defendants Biofrontera Inc, Biofrontera Bioscience GmbH, Biofrontera Pharma GmbH, and Biofrontera AGf from using its confidential and proprietary trade secret information, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries said in a regulatory filing.
Earlier this year, DUSA, which is wholly-owned by Sun Pharma, filed a lawsuit against the Biofrontera defendants in the US District Court for the District of Massachusetts.
The lawsuit alleged trade secret misappropriation and patent infringement of DUSA’s photodynamic therapy patents covering its product.
DUSA, in its amended complaint filed in July 2018, additionally alleged the Biofrontera defendants misappropriated confidential and trade secret information by obtaining confidential information from its former employees to sell and market defendants’ own products.
The lawsuit sought an assessment of both damages and injunctive relief against the Biofrontera defendants, Sun Pharma said.
The court’s order prohibits Biofrontera from making use of or disseminating DUSA’s sales and financial information, customer lists and customer target lists, training and marketing materials, standard operating procedures, technical information, and unpublished clinical data, and any derivations thereof, effective immediately, it added.

Volatility has increased a lot over the past few weeks on back of global volatility and it would start inching upwards from the middle of the February with respect to the interim budget and during the time of general elections in the first half, he added.

New Delhi: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries today informed the stock exchanges that a wholly owned subsidiary would now handle the distribution of its domestic formulations. This transfer of business from current distributor Aditya Medisales, a related party, would take place by June, a company notice to the BSE said. Aditya Medisales was at the heart of the controversy that engulfed Sun Pharma last week and eroded its share price.
The steps seemed to assuage investors rattled by concerns over corporate governance at the company, and the share price of Sun Pharma was up almost 5% at  ₹417 on the BSE in the session under way today. It touched a high of  ₹421.15 before that.
A whistleblower complaint had alleged that payments made by Sun Pharma to Aditya Medisales had been routed to Suraksha Realty, a company owned by Sudhir Valia, a Sun Pharma promoter. The complainant alleged that the transactions took place between 2014 and 2017 and were worth over  ₹5,800 crore. The allegations were first reported by journalist Sucheta Dalal’s 'Moneylife' magazine, a platform that professes to fight for rights of investors and the common man.
Sun Pharma has continued to deny that this was the case. Sun Pharma, in the latest BSE notice, also denied that it had extended any loans or stood as guarantor for Suraksha Realty.
Extending its attempt to come out clean, the company said it would be unwinding a  ₹2,238 crore loan given to Atlas Global Trading, an unrelated party. Atlas will assign its rights and obligations to a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma. The transaction will be completed this quarter itself.
The transaction with Atlas dates back to September 2014 when Sun Pharma’s Halol manufacturing facility in Gujarat was hit by the US FDA’s concerns related to ‘good manufacturing practices’ at the plant. As the US FDA issues hit the Halol plant, Sun Pharma wasn’t able to adhere to its supply commitments with Atlas. Sun Pharma, in 2017-18, funded Atlas towards non-fulfillment of its supply obligations till the time such obligations were fulfilled as per the agreement."

New Delhi: Sun Pharma on Tuesday announced a slew of measures, including replacement of its domestic formulations distributor Aditya Medisales and change of auditors for its arms, in the wake of a second whistleblower complaint that raised corporate governance issues.
The company also announced the settlement of a transaction amounting to  ₹2,238 crore with Atlas Global Trading -- with which it had a supply agreement -- that had arisen out a patent litigation settlement over Protonix.
Last week, Sun Pharmaceutical asked market regulator Sebi to look into the issues of certain entities and individuals allegedly adopting unfair trade practices prejudicial to the company's shareholders.
""Sun Pharma's distribution related to India domestic formulations business shall be transitioned from Aditya Medisales Ltd, the current distributor, to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma,"" the company said in a BSE filing.
Aditya Medisales is reported to have had transactions of over  ₹5,800 crore with a real estate firm, Suraksha Realty that is promoted by Sudhir Valia, who is the brother-in-law of Sun Pharma promoter Dilip Sanghvi. Valia is also an executive director in the pharmaceutical major.
Announcing the steps taken, Sun Pharma said its distribution related to domestic formulations business in India shall be transitioned from Aditya Medisales Ltd to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma.
""This change will be made effective by Q1FY20, post receipt of all requisite regulatory approvals,"" the company said without disclosing the reasons for the change.
Sun Pharma further said it ""has initiated steps to induct SRBC & CO LLP, its statutory auditors, as auditors of subsidiaries that are currently audited by Valia & Timbadia"".
Regarding unwinding of the transaction with Atlas Global Trading, Sun Pharma said, as of March 31, 2018, the company's consolidated balance sheet, reflected a liability towards obligation of supplies to Atlas Global Trading amounting to  ₹2,238 crore.
""This liability was in respect of Atlas assuming the damages on account of Protonix patent litigation settlement entered by Sun Pharma,"" it said.
Sun Pharma was unable to fulfil its supply agreement with Atlas after its Halol facility in Gujarat failed to comply with USFDA norms in 2014.
Subsequently, in 2017-18, Sun Pharma said it had ""funded Atlas towards non-fulfilment of its supply obligations till the time such obligations are fulfilled as per the agreement"".
The company said the parties to the supply contract have now agreed ""in principle, that Atlas will assign its rights and obligations arising from this contract to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma"".
""This assignment will ensure that the loans and advances given to Atlas will be settled. On conclusion of this transaction, in the consolidated balance sheet, this loan and the obligation will cease to exist as it gets squared up. This transaction is expected to be concluded in 2018-19,"" the company added.
Refuting report that suggested Sun Pharma had financial dealings with Suraksha Realty, a firm promoted by Valia, the pharma major said ""neither any loans nor guarantees have been given to Suraksha Realty.
""Sun Pharma would like to dispel all falsehoods being spread about its financial dealings with Suraksha Realty. The company states unequivocally that it does not have any financial transactions with Suraksha Realty"".
Last week in a letter to Sebi Chairman Ajay Tyagi, the Mumbai-based drug maker had said it has come to know from a media report that a second whistleblower complaint has been filed against the company.
""We are concerned that certain entities/individuals are adopting unfair trade practices prejudicial to the interest of shareholders and other stakeholders,"" the company had said in the letter, a copy of which has been submitted to the stock exchanges.
In November 2018, a whistleblower had approached Sebi with a document alleging various irregularities committed by the company, its promoter and others."
63,2019-01-23,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma ends business arrangement with promoter-owned Aditya MedisalesSun Pharma had come under a cloud over allegations of related-party transactions with Aditya Medisales

Mumbai: The markets regulator has started a probe against Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd for allegedly failing to make proper disclosures, financial irregularities and governance lapses, based on complaints received from a whistleblower, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.
Under pressure from investors, Sun Pharma on Tuesday discontinued a business arrangement with Aditya Medisales Ltd, an entity owned by Sun Pharma promoters that distributed the drug maker’s formulations in India. The business would now be handled by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharma, the company said in a stock exchange filing. Dilip Shanghvi owns 59.67% of Aditya in his personal capacity.
Sun Pharma had come under a cloud over allegations of related-party transactions with Aditya Medisales.
To be sure, Sun did not categorize Aditya as a related party till 2017-18, as it was legally required to declare it only in 2018, when provisions of the new companies law came into effect.
Sun Pharma’s stock surged 4.95% to  ₹418.05 on BSE after the announcement.
“Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) in its probe is trying to verify the allegations levelled against the company. It is early to say but, as per initial examination, Sebi suspects that there could be some disclosure lapses or governance lapses. The alleged financial irregularities can only be talked about only after some more examination,"" the first of the two people cited earlier said on condition of anonymity.
Replying to Mint’s emailed queries, a Sun Pharma spokesman said: “We received two queries from Sebi which the company has responded to. We are not in a position to comment as to whether the queries are related to the whistleblower complaint.""
Sun Pharma has been in the eye of a controversy after the whistleblower accused the company’s top executives, including managing director Shanghvi, of indulging in business dealings with stock market scam accused and absconder Dharmesh Doshi. In a second complaint made public on 16 January, the whistleblower alleged that these transactions ran up to  ₹5,800 crore.
Shanghvi denied the links with Doshi in an investor call on 3 December and termed the allegations as old and irrelevant. However, copies of certain emails (dated 1 and 2 December) have now emerged, which suggest a different story. The whistleblower has shared copies of these emails with Mint and Sebi. Mint could not independently verify the authenticity of these mails. The emails, now under Sebi scrutiny and purportedly exchanged between Shanghvi and his brother-in-law Sudhir Valia, executive director of Sun Pharma, refer to communications with Doshi. One of the suggestions in these emails was to shut down or restructure Aditya Medisales, which was announced on Tuesday.
Valia, a chartered accountant and often described as Sun Pharma’s “numbers man"", has driven the company’s various acquisitions.
Doshi is one of the key accused in the 2001 stock market scam and is barred from the Indian markets for life. Doshi has evaded arrest and is still absconding. Interpol issued a Red Corner Notice against him in 2002 at the request of the Central Bureau of Investigation. There is a non-bailable warrant pending against him and his passport has been revoked.
The whistleblower has alleged that Shanghvi and Valia have close links with Doshi.
In an emailed response, the Sun Pharma spokesperson said: “We unequivocally state that there is no iota of truth in the said assertions. No such emails were ever exchanged nor such conversations transpired between Mr. Dilip Shanghvi, our managing director and any individual(s)"".
Sun Pharma also denied giving any loans or advances to third parties.
Shriram Subramanian, founder and managing director of InGovern Research Services, said that good governance is not just about following the rule of law. “Good governance requires that there is no speck of doubt. There should be clean structures and complete transparency for investors,"" said Subramanian.
According to him, the existence of the relationship with Aditya Medisales defies logic. “When the pharma company has a huge distribution and sales network, what is the need to have a privately-held third party as a distributor,"" he asked."
62,2019-02-06,Sun Pharma,"Price erosion because of increased competition in US hastens firms’ push towards specialty medicinesSun Pharmaceuticals is of the view that specialty medicines will drive medicine spending in the coming years

NEW DELHI :
Indian drug makers are shifting focus from their once lucrative generics medicines to specialty drugs amid continued price erosion in its biggest market, the US.
The focus on specialty medicines has been accelerated by measures taken by the Food and Drug Administration of the US (US FDA) to increase competition in generic medicines to bring down prices, experts said. Specialty drugs are high value prescription medications used to treat complex, chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.
The price erosion, caused by increased competition and channel consolidation in the US, has put pressure on Indian generic drug companies over the past few years to look at newer avenues, the experts said.
“With increased competition, price erosion and decline of Para 4 opportunities (patent challenges by generic drug makers) in the US market, leading Indian generics (companies) have been trying to plot a specialty play for the past couple of years,"" said Sujay Shetty, pharma practice leader for India and Asia Pacific at PwC.
“The journey is difficult as the dollar spends and the capabilities from R&D to marketing are of a much higher magnitude than the conventional oral solid dosage (OSD) type products. For Indian companies this is a must-win battle as we look at 2020 and beyond.""
India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd is of the view that specialty medicines will drive medicine spending in the coming years.
“The share of specialty medicines in global spending in 2017 stood at 32%, up from 19% in 2007. In the US and EU5 markets(Germany, France, Italy, UK, and Spain), the contribution of specialty medicines to overall pharmaceutical spending has almost doubled over the preceding 10 years. This trend is likely to continue,"" a company spokesperson said.
Sun Pharma has a portfolio of around 10 specialty products, of which seven have already been commercialized. Indian firms have been working to create a pipeline of specialty drugs, innovative products and biosimilars by increasing investments in research and development through acquisitions.
“We have accelerated our innovation-led journey with key specialty investments in the US, where our aim is to satisfy unmet needs of patients and healthcare providers in the areas of movement disorders and the central nervous system (CNS), lung delivery of medicines (inhalation therapies), and respiratory illnesses besides hospital and institutionally administered products,"" said Umang Vohra, managing director and global chief executive officer, Cipla.
Several other institutional assets of Cipla are under late-stage evaluation as the company explores acquisition and in-licensing, said Vohra. “These moves are in keeping with our stated intention to build a specialty pipeline in the US market and reinforce Cipla’s innovation-led approach and commitment to caring for the life of patients,"" he said.
Glenmark also started building a pipeline of specialty products a few years ago.
A new drug application for the first specialty product from the company’s organic pipeline, Ryaltris, a treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, has been filed with the FDA and the product is likely to be launched in the first quarter of FY20.
Glenmark has signed pacts to commercialize Ryaltris in Australia and New Zealand with Seqirus and in South Korea with Yuhan Corp.
The pharma major has two other organically developed products in the pipeline, a biosimilar of Xolair (used to treat asthma) and a nebulised formulation of tiotropium (used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
“The specialty products’ space is very exciting and offers significant opportunities. Respiratory and dermatology are Glenmark’s stronghold and we are leveraging the capabilities in these therapy areas to build our specialty business in the US. We expect to launch our first specialty product Ryaltris in the US in FY20. We continue to invest in enhancing our pipeline and expect the specialty business to start contributing meaningfully to our US revenue in the next 2-5 years,"" said Glenn Saldanha, chairman and managing director of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals."

New Delhi: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s founder and managing director Dilip Shanghvi on Tuesday assured investors that they have not been “disadvantaged"", following serious corporate governance issues that emerged last November.
Shanghvi said the company has responded to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) that is examining a complaint by a whistle-blower, who had approached the capital markets regulator with a 150-page letter alleging various irregularities by the company, its promoters and others.
The letter highlighted Sun Pharma’s dealing with subsidiary Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), a pharmaceutical distribution company classified as a promoter shareholder of Sun Pharma with a stake of 1.6% as of end-December. Concerns have been raised by investors as to whether AML has made any gains in the past at the cost of Sun Pharma.
Shanghvi allays the concerns and said “I would like to take this opportunity to clarify certain queries that have been raised by some investors. The queries pertain to whether AML has benefitted in the past at the cost of Sun Pharma minority shareholders.
AML’s financials are available in the public domain and it can be seen that it earns Ebitda margins of only about 1.4% from Sun Pharma for distributing its products in India,"" he said.
“I would like to reassure investors that at no point of time Sun Pharma shareholders had been disadvantaged in the transaction with AML,"" he said, reiterating that the company has taken corrective steps. “The issues bothering investors are behind us and we can focus on growth of the business,"" he said in a post-earnings investors call on Tuesday.
The drug maker’s profit in the December quarter rose nearly four-fold to  ₹1,242 crore from  ₹321.5 crore in the year-ago period.
“Our 3Q performance was in line with our expectation,"" Shanghvi said.
Revenue from operations increased 17% year-on-year to  ₹7,933.25 crore from  ₹6,782.42 crore. Sales for the quarter rose 1.16% to  ₹7,656.71 crore from  ₹6,598.21 crore in the same period last year. Ebitda for the quarter came in at  ₹2,151 crore. The Ebitda margin at 28% exceeded street expectations of a 21.8% margin. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Given the volatile times in the US, Shanghvi said Sun Pharma will focus on investing and getting the best out of the products they have launched already there.
“Our focus on execution is reflected in the 3Q performance. We remain committed towards executing our global specialty strategy, strengthening our core operations and enhancing our overall efficiencies. The Ilumya launch in the US has been well received by doctors. We recently commercialised Xelpros in the US and are preparing to launch Cequa in the coming months,"" Shanghvi said. The company will also focus and is likely to invest more on research and development, and clinical trials, he added.
Sales in the US, which accounted for more than 34% of total sales, rose 10% to $362 million during the December quarter. Its sales at home grew 7% to  ₹2,235 crore the company said."
60,2019-02-13,Sun Pharma,"Sebi adds three more senior officials to its investigation wingSebi is planning to recruit 100 employees every year for the next three years to strengthen investigations

Mumbai: Recent stock market volatility and growing complaints of market manipulation have prompted the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to increase the number of experts in its investigation department.
“Sebi traditionally always had one chief general manager (CGM) as the head of the department for investigations. Now, owing to the case load, Sebi has increased the number to four,"" said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
The four CGMs are Anita Kenkare, Debashis Bandyopadhyay, Sura Reddy and V.S. Sundaresan, said a second person aware of the matter. Both declined to be identified. V.S. Sundaresan was the only CGM for investigations so far.
An email sent to the Sebi spokesperson Tuesday remained unanswered till publishing of this story. Sebi’s move assumes importance in the wake of increased cases and complaints of market manipulation and unusual volatility in a select few stocks.
In the past two months there have been at least four instances of blue-chip stocks and companies coming under the radar due to complaints, rating action and lender action. For instance, the stock price of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd fell by 7.5% in December after a whistleblower’s complaint. A month later, a second complaint by the same whistleblower, alleging related party transactions with Aditya Medisales Ltd, impacted the stock by 12%.
According to Sun Pharma disclosures to stock exchanges on Tuesday, Sebi has queried the company on its relation with Aditya Medisales. Similarly shares of Dewan Housing and Finance Ltd (DHFL) fell by 9.73% on 30 January following allegations of  ₹31,000 crore of financial irregularities.
“Sebi has been increasing its surveillance and investigation efforts to clear the backlog of cases. But new cases of alleged market manipulation are being observed. More resources need to be channelled towards investigating these cases to protect the interest of investors. Sebi is also planning to recruit 100 employees every year for the coming three years and most of the manpower will be devoted in strengthening investigations,"" said the first person quoted above.
This move also comes a day after Sebi published a discussion paper which proposed price bands for future and options (F&O) stocks. Sebi in the discussion paper said it has observed high levels of volatility in F&O stocks in the past six months. Forty scrips witnessed intraday movement of over 20%. Of these, 29 saw intra-day movements of 20-30%. Five stocks moved between 30% and 40% and six moved more than 40%.
One solution proposed by Sebi is introducing a 20% price band for all stocks including ones on which derivatives are available. However, this could pose difficulties as F&O stocks have enhanced eligibility criteria.
Another way is to use a mix of dynamic and fixed price bands. “The current framework for dynamic price band may be allowed to continue with the initial threshold set by the stock exchanges,"" said the paper. However, this framework would be available up to a threshold of 30% of intraday movement, after which a fixed price band on the stock may be imposed or a call auction held for a fixed duration, Sebi said."
59,2019-02-14,Sun Pharma,"A 48% jump in Sun Pharma's operating profit on the back of 16% rise in revenue comes as a positive surpriseBut Sun Pharma share price falling 1% a day after the Q3 result reflects continuing investor unease

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s strong earnings performance in the December quarter (Q3) brought brief respite for investors. After opening the day’s trading session with decent gains, the stock closed 1% lower on Wednesday. The gyration reflects continuing investor unease with the company’s corporate governance issues.
The 48% jump in operating profit on the back of 16% rise in revenue came as a positive surprise. Profit margins expanded a whopping 5.8 percentage points to 27%, with help from forex gains and lower research and development expenses. Even after adjusting for one-offs, profit margins and operating earnings were notably higher than Street estimates.
But concerns over corporate governance remain an overhang. Sun Pharma said it has responded to queries from market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), and is transferring the domestic distribution business to a wholly owned subsidiary. Still, there are concerns that transactions between Aditya Medisales and other promoter group firms came at the cost of minority shareholders.
“We expect investors to remain cautious in the backdrop of the whistle-blower’s complaint to SEBI and its possible outcome. These issues are likely to outweigh the company’s sound fundamentals in the near term,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a note on Wednesday.
On the positive side, the Q3 results show recovery in its India business. With the pricing in the US, another key market, being stable and gross margins expanding, Sun Pharma can see a cyclical recovery, point out analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd.
But if one excludes the contribution of its American arm Taro, sales in the US were flat or up just 2% on a sequential basis. To mitigate the impact of a steady erosion in generic drug prices, Sun Pharma is building its specialty drugs business, although the progress has been mixed.
For instance, the company delayed the launch of one specialty drug, and withdrew another drug launch citing financial unviability. Several more specialty drug launches are lined up for this calendar year. As these products hit the market, the much-watched specialty products business will take shape in FY20.
But for these drugs and the specialty business to attain scale, Sun Pharma will have to step up spending on promotions and sales teams. This can keep costs elevated in the coming year, weighing on earnings, fear some analysts. “The management expects frontloading of costs to continue as the company continues to invest in specialty launches,"" added analysts at ICICI Securities.
To conclude, Sun Pharma may have delivered better-than-expected earnings in Q3, but as far as its share price performance goes, much depends on the resolution of corporate governance issues and the ramp-up of the specialty drugs business in the US."
58,2019-02-21,Sun Pharma,"Indian pharma companies are seeing reduced pricing pressure in the US generic drugs businessHelped by new product launches, US revenues of large pharma companies are expected to recover in FY20

The December quarter (Q3) results of Indian pharmaceutical companies, while unexciting, gave important cues about the US market.
One, companies are seeing reduced pricing pressure in the US generic drugs business, even though the degree varies across companies and product categories. Two, the long-awaited complex generics and specialty products businesses are finally shaping up. These segments have higher entry barriers and better price realizations. As these gain traction, and pricing pressure in the core generic drugs business subsides, chances of a rebound in US revenues in FY20 are quite high, say analysts.
“We expect US generic revenues to recover sharply over FY20-21 on the back of new launches, although the timing of the launches is still somewhat uncertain, which may push back the recovery in revenues and profits,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a recent note referring to the domestic pharma companies.
US is a key market for large Indian pharma companies, such as Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd and Lupin Ltd. Compared to a 1.6% fall in FY19, Kotak estimates the combined sales of these three companies to increase by 16% next fiscal year.
As competition in the US generic drugs business intensified, financial performance of all the three companies had come under pressure. Signs of stabilization emerged in Q3, with all three registering sequential growth in US revenues. The growth was driven by volume increase, new product launches and reduced pricing pressure.
Drug makers such as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, however, continued to see pricing pressure, but compared to earlier years, the price drop has moderated, after the squeeze in profitability made the industry wary of irrational pricing.
Concurrently, as companies began introducing complex generics and specialty drugs, the fall in revenues at the portfolio level is being arrested.
Lupin, which had launched one specialty drug (Solosec) last year, expects its sales to grow this year. It plans to introduce more limited competition drugs in the current quarter. Similarly, Sun Pharma introduced a couple of specialty drugs and plans to launch a few more this year.
In this backdrop, the expectation of a revival in US growth isn’t surprising.
Even so, Anshuman Gupta, analyst at Investec Capital Services (India) Pvt. Ltd, warned that the recovery assumptions are tied to the success of the new products. “The recovery will be dependent on success of these large products, where we believe the chances of surprising on the downside are higher,"" he said.
Indeed, the caution is warranted. Delays in product launches are commonplace, and the recent specialty drug launches did not see the kind of growth as initially envisaged. This should be reason enough for investors to exercise some caution.
Complex and specialty drugs require significant upfront investments. Slow growth can not only prolong the payback period, but can also increase risks to earnings projections. How well the companies ramp-up this business will be crucial.
“These investments are significant, and also bring in more risks as the probability of success is lower, along with higher gestation periods,"" pointed out Gupta."

New Delhi: The government capped trade margins of 42 cancer drugs at 30% on Wednesday, seeking to curb profiteering on these vital medicines. The move is expected to reduce prices of cancer drugs by 85% and will cover 72 formulations and 355 brands, India’s drug pricing regulator said in a statement.
The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) approved the formula which restricts the trade margin of the selling price by up to 30%.
These are in addition to 57 cancer drugs already under price control. “42 non-scheduled anti-cancer medicines have now been selected for price regulation by restricting trade margin of the selling price up to 30%,"" the NPPA said.
Manufacturers have been asked to recalculate prices and inform NPPA within next seven days.
NPPA chairperson Shubhra Singh told Mint that the step gains significance in the government’s attempt to provide affordable healthcare. “The authority has noted that despite the fact that India is the pharmacy of the world, out-of-pocket expenses on medicines is the largest cause for pushing families beyond poverty threshold, which itself is a great contradiction and therefore we have invoked extraordinary powers under para 19 of the drug price control order (DPCO),"" she said, indicating that the move is a pilot for more drugs and medical devices in the future. “This is being rolled out as a pilot for the proof of concept which means that it will be upscaled,"" she said.
The NPPA currently fixes price of drugs on the National List of Essential Medicines under schedule I of DPCO. So far, around 1,000 drugs have been price-capped through this mode. Singh said self-regulation by manufacturers would usher in a new price regulation regime. “It’s going to be a game-changer because once it is established, then for the first time, you are making reasoned foray into price regulation of non-scheduled drugs and medical devices.""
The move is likely to face resistance from the pharma industry, a pharma lobby expert said, requesting anonymity.
Malini Aisola, co-convenor, All India Drug Action Network (AIDAN) said, “The margin is equivalent to 43% mark-up for the price to stockists which is a break in convention of the DPCO and done as a concession to the industry. Because of the prohibitive prices of cancer drugs, discounts are a common part of sales strategies. Retail prices are not likely to be significantly affected through this move. However, through mandatory margin caps, patients will benefit in hospitals which were undoubtedly indulging in profiteering by taking massive cuts"". Calling it a significant decision, Sunil Attavar, president, Karnataka Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Manufacturers’ Association said, “We could see a significant reduction in MRPs and this will benefit patients. The margin of 30% on sale price seems to be in line with the existing margin of 20% to retail and 10% to wholesale"".
Kanchana T.K., director general, Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) said, “OPPI members are committed to the interest of Indian patients. We note the government’s intent is that they are using the initial anti- cancer selective drug list as a pilot proof of concept, but we would expect a universal implementation for all non-scheduled products as a follow-through.""
The move could impact pharmaceutical companies like Sun Pharma Laboratories ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Zydus Cadila, and Biocon Ltd. Emails sent to these companies remained unanswered. With the price rationalization extended to 72 formulations and 355 brands, NPPA expects the net savings to the consumer at a minimum of  ₹105 crore. “Price reduction across brands would vary from 86.79% of MRP to 0%,"" said the NPPA in a statement. According to the price regulator, five brands will see price reduction of about 70%, whereas 12 brands will see 50-70% reduction in prices. The maximum of 45 brands will see prices coming down by 25%."
56,2019-03-04,Sun Pharma,"Panel to decide if Sun Pharma’s anti-cancer drug, Meril’s biodegradable stent have therapeutic  advantageMumbai-based Sun Pharmaceuticals is seeking an exemption for its anti-cancer gemcitabine hydrochloride injection

A plea by drug maker Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd and medical devices maker Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd to seek a rare exemption from government-set price caps for two products has failed to find favour with India’s drug pricing regulator.
Mumbai-based Sun Pharmaceuticals is seeking an exemption for its anti-cancer gemcitabine hydrochloride injection while Gujarat-based Meril Life Sciences wants a similar exemption for its first locally made biodegradable cardiac scaffold, a naturally dissolving stent that clears blockages in arteries.
The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), in a meeting on 21 February, has referred the matter to an overarching expert committee headed by the director-general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to see if both the products have any therapeutic advantage to merit a price exemption.
The exemption, if granted, will be valid for five years. Both the companies have been trying to seek an exemption under para 32 of the Drug Price Control Orders (DPCO) that says the price cap won’t apply if a new drug developed through a unique and indigenous process is patented under the Indian Patents Act and is not produced elsewhere.
An earlier multi-disciplinary committee of experts met on 7 February and found that both products are eligible for exemption. The pricing regulator verified the committee’s submission and referred the applications to the Standing National Committee on Medicines.
The NPPA, which deliberated the matter noted that a decision on exemption has to be taken from a “holistic perspective"". It found that the expert committee did not apply itself to the important yardstick of public interest and, hence, sent the matter for further examination.
“In public health, choice of consumer is impeded by information asymmetry and lack of knowledge regarding quality and efficacy of drugs/medical devices. Often, high-priced items are prescribed/preferred on the premise of improved quality. It is, therefore, important that pricing policy is not operated in silos. Any decision to exempt drugs from price regulation has to be taken in holistic perspective,"" reads the minutes of the meeting.
“The authority noted that the expert committee had not applied itself fully to the important agenda pertaining to public interest... It was decided to refer both applications to Standing National Committee on Medicines for revision of NLEM (National List of Essential Medicines) with a request to examine the products from the perspective of any significant therapeutic advantage and increased efficacy that may merit exemption under para 32 of DPCO, 2013,"" added the minutes. Mint has reviewed a copy of the minutes.
Malini Aisola, co-convenor, All India Drugs Action Network, said NPPA is correct in requiring a holistic consideration of the impact on public health. However, she was strongly critical of the exemption clauses, saying, “They remove essential medicines from price control, undermining the objective of the DPCO.""
The stents developed by Meril are known as MeRes100. However, the year they were granted approval by the Drug Controller General of India—in 2017—was also when prices were slashed. This prompted Meril to hold back from launching the stents. The company says its stents are biodegradable, and an alternative to traditional metal stents.
“Abbott’s BVS (bioresorbable vascular scaffold) that introduced the technology on which Meril’s stent is premised was found to be associated with higher risk of major adverse cardiac events and subsequently withdrawn globally. Therefore, it is our position that a price exemption for a risky, inadequately tested technology is unwarranted and the application should be rejected,"" she said.
A stent is a wire-like mesh inserted into blood vessels to remove blockages. Abbott’s Absorb was a dissolvable stent which did not leave a residual metal in the body like other cardiac stents. However, Abbott said their stents called Absorb were withdrawn due to low commercial uptake."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday asked former Ranbaxy promoters Malvinder Singh and Shivinder Singh to apprise it how they proposed to comply with the  ₹3500 crore arbitral award passed against them by a Singapore tribunal.
A bench headed by chief justice Ranjan Googi asked the Singh brothers, who were present in the court, to consult their financial and legal advisers and give a concrete plan on how they will comply with the tribunal's order.
""It is not about individual honour but it doesn't look good for the country's honour. You were the flag bearers of the pharmacare industry and it doesn't look good that you are appearing in court,"" the bench, also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjiv Khanna, said.
The bench asked the Singh brothers to appear before it on 28 March and submit the plan and said: ""Hopefully it will be the last time you are appearing in the court"".
The apex court was hearing the plea of Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo, seeking to recover  ₹3,500 crore, awarded to it by a Singapore tribunal in its case against Malvinder and Shivinder Singh.
The Japanese firm, which filed the contempt plea against the Singh brothers in the apex court, said it was promised some shares of Fortis Healthcare by them.
The apex court had earlier refused to pass any interim order on pleas relating to the sale of controlling stakes of Fortis Healthcare to Malaysian firm IHH Healthcare Berhad.
The top court, on December 14 last year, ordered status quo with regard to the sale of controlling stakes in Fortis Healthcare. ""Status quo with regard to the sale of controlling stake in Fortis Healthcare to Malaysian IHH Healthcare Berhad be maintained,"" the bench had said.
The top court had also issued notices to the Singh brothers, asking them to explain why contempt proceedings should not initiated against them for allegedly violating its earlier order of not pledging shares.
The board of Fortis Healthcare had, in July, approved a proposal from IHH Healthcare to invest  ₹4,000 crore by way of preferential allotment for a 31.1% stake.
Daiichi had bought Ranbaxy in 2008. Later, it had moved the Singapore arbitration tribunal alleging that the Singh brothers had concealed information that Ranbaxy was facing probe by the US Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Justice, while selling its shares.
Daiichi had to enter into a settlement agreement with the US Department of Justice, agreeing to pay a $500-million penalty to resolve potential, civil and criminal liability. The company then sold its stake in Ranbaxy to Sun Pharmaceuticals for  ₹22,679 crore in 2015.

Sun Pharma group's senior executive Abhay Arvind Gandhi and his wife Kiran have settled with Sebi a case related to insider trading in shares of Ranbaxy Laboratories in 2014.
Both have paid a total of over  ₹70 lakh as settlement charges. At the time of alleged violation, Abhay Arvind Gandhi was the CEO of Sun Pharma Laboratories Ltd (SPLL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

51,2019-05-06,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma’s founder and managing director Dilip Shanghvi comments on the issues faced by the drug maker, steps to strengthen the governance‘Some long-term institutional investors have used this opportunity to increase their holding’

NEW DELHI :
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has been in the spotlight after a whistle-blower complaint on corporate governance prompted the stock market regulator to investigate India’s largest drugmaker.
In an email interview, Sun Pharma’s founder and managing director Dilip Shanghvi comments on the issues faced by the drug maker, steps to strengthen the governance and plans to enter China. Edited excerpts:
Corporate governance directly impacts the profits and reputation of the company. What problems have you faced ever since these issues surfaced? Do you think the company has lost credibility and reputation?
Our learning is that apart from being right - legally and technically, we also have to take into consideration how the transaction would be perceived by the world outside. Even though our actions were legal and in the best interest of the company, we thought it is important to address investor concerns. There were some perception issues which have already been addressed.
Do you think it has shaken the belief of some small investors, with many exiting the company?
While there has been an erosion of shareholder value for some small investors, we have seen some long term institutional investors have used this opportunity to increase their holding. We have to continue to perform consistently to regain shareholder trust and valuation.
Q: How do you plan to restore the faith of investors? Do you have a correction plan in sight?
Sun has provided consistent returns to its shareholders in the last 25 years and we remain committed to creating long term shareholders value. We have always believed that if you perform well, people will appreciate and acknowledge. In line with this philosophy, we will continue to focus on performance and producing consistent returns that we are known for.
Q: You have maintained that there was nothing illegal that the company did. Why did you then make some corrective measures then?
As I have explained earlier we may be legally right but perception is important. Some investors gave us feedback that if it does not significantly impact the company’s cost structures, we should make the changes and we did.
Q: Do you think Sun Pharma handled the issue well? Do you think it was blown out of proportion?
We are not a very media-savvy company. We tried to swiftly respond to all queries within the constraints of operating as a public company.
Q: Are there more issues that need to be settled with Sebi? Or are these issues beyond Sun Pharma now?
We received two sets of queries from Sebi and have shared the requisite information. We hope that they will close the investigation at the earliest.
Q; How do you plan to ensure that these corporate governance issues will not take place again? What measures have specifically been taken by the company on that front?
As a leading global pharmaceutical company, we have been adhering to global best practices in the industry. Our board has initiated necessary steps to strengthen the governance standards further.
Q: Do you think pricing pressure in US generic pharma has impacted your profits? Have you made any revamp strategies to cope with the pricing pressure?
The market dynamics in the US have changed in the last few years and it has impacted the entire pharmaceutical industry. To address these challenges, we have taken some steps. We have added speciality as an additional engine of growth in the US. On the generics front, we are focusing more on complex & value-added products. Given the tough pricing conditions in the US market, we will continue to focus on cost optimisation including rationalisation of generic R&D investments.
Q: In 2015, you were the wealthiest person in India, surpassing Mukesh Ambani. What went wrong? Do you think some bad decisions have been taken?
I believe that valuations based on how the company’s stock price reacts is transitionary.
Q: Do you think acquiring Ranbaxy was a wise decision?
Acquisition of Ranbaxy has given us size and scale. We have gained market leadership in India and expanded our presence in emerging and other regulated markets. It has given us entry into the OTC space with established brands like Revital and Volini. All parts of Ranbaxy business are growing and as it starts contributing fully to our future growth, there will be a greater appreciation.
Q: Are you the face of Sun Pharma and continue to be or will we see your son to be on the front foot in days to come?
Traditionally, Sun has a reputation of being reserved with the media. We prefer to let our work speak for ourselves. While this I believe is the right decision for the company, it has led to a perception that Sun has only one visible face. Sun is a professionally run company managed by a world-class team. I don’t plan to retire anytime soon.
Q: What are the future plans?
In each of the key geographies including North America, India, Europe and emerging markets our plan is to grow faster than the market. We have added speciality as a new engine of growth and invested approximately $1 billion in this business over the last 4-5 years. Seven of our speciality products are already in the US market. It is currently a small part but we expect reasonable revenue contribution from this business over the next 3-5 years. Besides, we are also focusing on entering new growth markets like China. We have big expectations from markets like Japan and China."
50,2019-05-06,Sun Pharma,"Sun Pharma's China venture would create a significant new revenue stream, which is not factored in our valuationThe policy push comes as many generic drugmakers continue to reel from a brutal price war in the US

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. is scouting for a partner in China to help it win a larger piece of the world’s second-largest drug market, where the government is on a mission to drive down the cost of healthcare.
With a recovery underway in its US business, Sun Pharma’s billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi is homing in on China and believes market watchers are underestimating the potential there for India’s largest drugmaker.
“There is a big opportunity for us,"" Shanghvi said in an interview with Bloomberg News Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait in Mumbai on Thursday. “That would create a significant new revenue stream, which is not factored in our valuation when analysts look at it.""
China has rolled out an ambitious multi-city bulk drug procurement program that’s driving down prices and providing an opening for Indian manufacturers like Mumbai-based Sun Pharma to compete. The country is importing more drugs, reimbursing for more and speeding up approvals of new medicines to ensure they reach patients faster.
The policy push comes as many generic drugmakers continue to reel from a brutal price war in the US, the world’s biggest drug market. While Sun Pharma’s Indian rivals, like Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd. and Cipla Ltd., are already expanding in China, Shanghvi has mostly kept quiet about his plans there.
Scaling Up
India’s top drugmaker will start scaling up its China business in six to nine months, according to Shanghvi. The unit is expected to contribute “some percentage"" to Sun Pharma’s $4 billion of overall sales within three years, from almost nothing right now, he said.
The $160 billion Chinese drug market “is now a focus for Indian generics"" as U.S.-approved drugs are cleared faster, Jefferies analyst Piyush Nahar wrote in a Feb. 27 note.
“While the reforms make China an attractive market, ramp-up and profitability will have significant challenges,"" Nahar wrote. “Unlike US, distribution is important in China and will need a local partner and higher spend.""
Analysts are split on the prospects for Sun Pharma’s shares, which have lagged the rise in the S&P BSE Sensex this year. In the last four years, Sun Pharma has fallen nearly 52 percent compared to the Sensex’s 42 percent climb.
Sun Pharma’s large portfolio of US-approved products should help the drugmaker ramp up its China business with little investment, Shanghvi said.
“We see enormous interest in China for products that we have global rights for,"" Shanghvi said, adding that the company “would be comfortable making significant financial commitments,"" there longer term.

Bucking the weak trend, homegrown FMCG major Marico rose 6% today after the company's volume growth in Q4 beat analyst estimates. Volume growth is an important indicator in a way as it looks at growth in sales minus the price hikes undertaken by the company. Domestic brokerage Motilal Oswal maintained ""Buy"" on Marico, citing high visibility on volumes/margins with target price of  ₹425.
In another development, China today said that Vice Premier Liu He will go ahead with a visit to the United States this week, after efforts to reach a deal to end a trade war were thrown into doubt by US President Donald Trump's vow to impose new tariffs.

47,2019-05-08,Sun Pharma,"Dilip Shanghvi proved a white knight for Suzlon in 2015 when he bought 23% stake for  ₹1,800 croreSuzlon still hasn’t exited debt-restructuring program, missing deadlines since 2017

DILIP SHANGHVI,
		             SUN PHARMA :
Billionaire Dilip Shanghvi intends to stay invested in unprofitable wind-turbine maker Suzlon Energy Ltd. even though the company’s financial health has worsened over the last few years.
“If I look at outcome then clearly that investment hasn’t had a great outcome,"" Shanghvi said in an interview in Mumbai, adding that Suzlon has to solve its own challenges. Shanghvi, founder and managing director of India’s largest drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., said policy hurdles were responsible for lower demand for Suzlon’s wind turbines and the resultant cash squeeze.
Shanghvi proved a white knight for Suzlon in 2015 when he bought 23% stake for  ₹1,800 crore ($258 million) to help the turbine maker return to profitability after it became India’s largest convertible-bond defaulter in 2012. Suzlon still hasn’t exited India’s debt-restructuring program, missing deadlines since 2017.
Shanghvi said his investment was based on the assessment that within the renewable-energy sector Suzlon had “the product and the future pipeline, which will allow them to grow.""
Over the past two years, India’s shift to auctions for building wind projects from an earlier fixed-tariff program increased competition among suppliers, diluting Suzlon’s market share and putting pressure on its profit margin. The company is losing ground to competitors such as Vestas Wind Systems A/S and Senvion SA, according to Bloomberg NEF.
Ratings assessor Care Ratings Ltd. cut the long-term bank facilities of Suzlon to default from BB in April after it was unable to meet a repayment obligation to its lenders. The company has $172 million in foreign-currency, convertible bonds due in July. .
The company’s market value plunged to  ₹3,300 crore on Wednesday from a high of  ₹10,900 crore, a few weeks after Shanghvi announced the investment.

46,2019-05-09,Sun Pharma,"DoP will waive interest amount of  ₹1,325 cr if the firms drop cases against its orderThere are 666 cases where DoP has asked firms to disgorge excess profits because of non-compliance with govt orders

NEW DELHI :
The government has offered a one-time waiver of interest charges if drug makers, including Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd, Pfizer Ltd and Lupin Ltd, agree to deposit more than  ₹3,501 crore they collected by selling drugs at prices higher than those notified by the drug pricing regulator.
The department of pharmaceuticals (DoP) has offered to waive interest amounting to more than  ₹1,325 crore out of the total outstanding amount of  ₹4,827 crore on the condition that the companies drop lawsuits challenging the department’s order.
There are 666 cases where the department has asked drug makers to disgorge excess profits because of non-compliance with government orders since 1997.
The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA) sends notices to drug makers specifying recovery of overcharged amounts, penalties, a charge of 15% interest and prosecution measures, according to the Essential Commodities Act. Many of these disputes are, however, tied up in litigation.
To settle such disputes, DoP has written letters dated 13 March and 2 April to pharma lobby groups including Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) and Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA), offering to waive interest charges.
The one-time settlement offer, however, comes with a rider. “Whether IDMA and IPA can ensure after the payment of outstanding dues that there will be no legal cases,"" the letter says. “In this regard, a clarity is required whether pharma companies are ready to pay  ₹3,501 crore outstanding on account of principal and interest i.e. there is no dispute on the principal amount in all 666 cases and pharma companies have no objection to pay the interest after condonation."" Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
Pharma industry executives say DoP has later clarified that the government wants companies to pay only the principal amount. Mint could not independently verify this.
IDMA, in a letter dated 22 April to DoP, has mentioned about the discrepancy. “The liabilities displayed on the website against various companies suffer from discrepancies. Method of computing the accrued amount, period, quantities taken into consideration etc appear to be inaccurate in several instances,"" says the letter.
According to data available on the website of NPPA, India’s pricing authority has not made much headway in recovering outstanding dues from the companies for overcharging.
Public health activists say the settlement offer is designed to let the companies off with a rap on the knuckles. Malini Aisola, co-convener of All India Drug Action Network termed DoP’s offer unlawful.
“The DoP’s offer for a one-time settlement is unlawful and goes against the objectives of the price control regulations. The DPCOs (Drug Prices Control Orders) have been issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. There are no provisions that allow for condonation, therefore any waiving of the interest is in contravention of the law,"" she said. “The settlement is designed to allow the companies that have illegitimately pocketed huge amounts by overcharging consumers over the years to go scot-free. It sets a wrong example that will be detrimental to overall compliance by diluting the enforcement of penalties.

44,2019-05-14,Sun Pharma,"Sun, Dr Reddy’s among firms named in antitrust suit filed by 40 US statesThe lawsuit accuses 20 pharma firms of conspiring to inflate prices of more than 100 different drugs

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON :
Seven Indian drug makers, including Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, and five of their executives have been named in a US lawsuit that accuses Israel’s Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd of orchestrating a conspiracy to raise medicine prices.
The antitrust lawsuit was filed by 40 US states on 10 May and is based on a five-year investigation of the firms. Other Indian generic drug makers named in the lawsuit are Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Lupin Ltd, Wockhardt Ltd and Zydus Pharma.
The lawsuit accuses 20 drug makers of conspiring to inflate prices of more than 100 different drugs, significantly broadening a 2016 complaint. In addition to the states, the justice department’s antitrust division is conducting a criminal probe. The complaint is an expanded document of suit, which is still under litigation and was filed by US states in December 2016.
ALSO WATCH:
The states claim that the drug makers conspired with one another to fix prices and carve up markets for medicines among themselves, rather than compete on price. Executives used industry dinners, cocktail parties and golf outings to perpetuate the scheme, in addition to communicating through text messages and telephone calls, the complaint said.
Indian pharma stocks declined in Mumbai on Monday. BSE’s healthcare index fell 3.53% to 13,310.47 points. Shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals plunged 21% in intraday trading, but ended the day down 9.39% to  ₹396.85 on the BSE. Dr Reddy’s fell 2.5% to  ₹2,804.95.
A Sun Pharmaceutical spokesperson said, “We believe the allegations made in these lawsuits are without merit and we will continue to vigorously defend against them.""
The US complaint puts Teva at the centre of the conspiracy, saying it colluded with a core group of competitors to follow each other’s price increases. During a 19-month period from 2013 to 2015, Teva significantly raised prices on about 112 generic drugs and colluded with its competitors on at least 86 medicines, the states said. While the size of the increases varied, some were more than 1,000%.
“Teva is a consistent participant in the conspiracies identified in this complaint, but the conduct is pervasive and industry-wide,"" according to the complaint that was filed in federal court in Connecticut. “Through its senior-most executives and account managers, Teva participated in a wide-ranging series of restraints with more than a dozen generic drug manufacturers, all of whom knowingly and willingly participated.""
In a statement, Kelley Dougherty, a Teva vice-president, said, “The allegations in this new complaint and in the litigation more generally, are just that—allegations.""
The US states are seeking unspecified damages and penalties from the firms. Potential fines could exceed $2 billion, given that generic drug firms were making higher profits during the time in question, said Steven Tepper, an analyst at Israel Brokerage and Investments. That strikes a blow to Teva, struggling to pay back $29 billion of debt—a sum almost twice its market value.
“We have hard evidence that shows the generic-drug industry perpetrated a multi-billion dollar fraud on the American people,"" Connecticut attorney general William Tong said in a statement on Friday. “We all wonder why our healthcare, and specifically the prices for generic prescription drugs, are so expensive in this country—this is a big reason why.""
The firms have argued that price increases were due to factors such as industry consolidation and regulator-mandated plant closures."

The decline in Indian markets came despite Asian stocks bouncing from a 3-1/2-month low.

40,2019-05-16,Sun Pharma,"Companies rarely accept wrongdoing until they are presented with incontrovertible evidence

There are very few industries as notorious as Big Pharma. Fewer still have done more to deserve that notoriety. Tweaking existing drugs to generate new patents, price gouging by creating artificial scarcities, and simply buying off competitors, there’s hardly a dirty trick that pharma companies haven’t tried.
So, last week’s news about the charges filed by 44 American states alleging collusion among 20 drug makers to raise prices and allocate product markets among themselves comes as no surprise. While Israeli firm Teva is at the epicentre of the ring, which includes reputed multinational firms such as Pfizer and Sandoz, also named are seven of India’s top pharma companies, including Taro Pharmaceutical Industries (a subsidiary of Sun Pharma), Glenmark, Dr Reddy’s and Aurobindo Pharma.
The charge against these companies is that they conspired to fix prices at artificially high levels. An excerpt from the department of justice (DoJ) filing gives a sense of how outrageous some of the hikes were: “Clomipramine HCL, also known by the brand name Anafranil, is used for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, and chronic pain. In addition to defendants Sandoz and Mylan, defendant Taro also manufactured Clomipramine HCL. Indeed, it was Taro that led a price increase on this product on May l, 2013. The price increase was striking—more than a 3,440% increase to Taro’s WAC pricing on certain formulations.""
Significantly, the DoJ document also says that besides conspiring with Teva, the other “competitors also colluded with each other on drugs that Teva did not market"". Presumably, this included the seven Indian companies as well. All the accused firms have denied the charges. But that isn’t surprising.
Companies rarely accept wrongdoing until they are presented with incontrovertible evidence and the threat of worse punishment if they continue with their denials. In 2011, the DoJ began investigations against automotive parts manufacturers in the US on charges of large-scale price-fixing. The case dragged on for seven years before all but two of the charged companies pleaded guilty last year, and a total of nearly $3 billion in criminal fines was imposed on them.
The present case, being dubbed the biggest single act of cartelization in the US, picked up steam when in 2017, two executives of Heritage Pharmaceuticals, an American company that is part of the current lawsuit, pleaded guilty to fixing prices for two generic drugs, doxycycline and glyburide, and agreed to cooperate with the larger probe.
It is true that makers of generic drugs have provided badly needed low-priced alternatives to expensive drugs. Indeed, it was Cipla Inc., not named in the current investigations, that in 2001 provided the real impetus to Indian generics when it slashed prices for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients in Africa from $10,000 to $100 per year by launching its version of the HIV triple drug combination.
In recognition of the growing role of generics in the healthcare business, the US Congress in 1984 passed the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to streamline the process for generic pharmaceutical approvals while retaining the incentives needed for research and development. The Act came about following protracted drug testing and approval procedures of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its purpose was to allow a faster approval route to generic drugs. The Act has served its purpose rather well. Nearly 90% of all prescriptions in the US are for generic drugs.
The US generic drug market, dominated by hospital pharmacies, was valued at $103.8 billion in 2018, having grown at 12.1% between 2011 and 2018, according to IMARC Group. It is expected to reach $190.4 billion by 2024, at a projected compound annual growth rate of 10.6% in the period from 2019 to 2024.
That represents a huge opportunity for Indian pharma firms that already have a major share of that market. However, recent events, including strictures from the US FDA on quality-related issues as well as the current charges of anti-competitive behaviour, could act as a dampener.
The success of India’s software services companies rests on maintaining quality and ethical standards on par with the best in the world. Five years ago, as the Ranbaxy story fell apart in the US, it queered the pitch for other Indian pharma exporters who found themselves subjected to additional scrutiny by the FDA on abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). The knock-on effect of the current investigations could lead to similar reprisals over and above fines running into several millions of dollars that the accused firms will have to pay if the DoJ and state attorneys are able to prove their charges.
As the plaintiff states have demanded a trial by jury, there will be an emotive angle to whatever judgement is delivered. American citizens are literally sick of what they perceive as the excesses of the pharma companies. Witness the glee over news of solitary confinement for Turing Pharma’s infamous chief executive officer Martin Shkreli, now serving a seven-year sentence for securities fraud. This is the man whose company hiked the price of antiparasitic drug Daraprim from $13.50 to $750 a pill. As evident from statements by politicians, the knives are out for pharma companies. Will they pay heed?

39,2019-05-16,Sun Pharma,"Forty-four US states have filed a lawsuit against 20 firms that make generic drugs, accusing them of inflating prices, sometimes by as much as 1,000%. The lawsuit also names seven Indian pharma firms

Which are the firms named in the lawsuit?
The firms named in the lawsuit include the world’s largest generic drug manufacturer, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. Of the 20 companies named in the complaint, seven are Indian—Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, Wockhardt Ltd, Zydus, Lupin Ltd and Sun Pharma-ceutical Industries Ltd’s US arm Taro. All the Indian firms are listed entities. The firms are accused of manipulating and raising prices of generic drugs artificially to bump up profit. The 10 May complaint is an expanded document of a suit that’s under litigation and was filed by US states in December 2016.
How did the firms perpetrate the fraud?
Teva allegedly selected a core group of competitors with which it had profitable relationships. It had an understanding with them to lead and follow each other’s price increases. Industry executives arranged regular parties, industry dinners, lunches and golf outings as part of efforts to give shape to their anti-competitive agreements. The collusion began in July 2013 and continued through January 2015. During this l9-month period, Teva significantly raised prices of about 112 generic drugs. The Israeli company colluded with competitors on at least 86 of these drugs and was largely the sole company in the other markets.
Did the suit affect Indian pharma stocks?
Pharma stocks tumbled at the stock exchanges on Tuesday. The healthcare index fell 3.53% to 13,310.47 points. Sun Pharma shares ended the day down 9.39% after tanking 21% intraday.
Is the complaint backed by evidence?
The allegations in the complaint are supported by information and evidence, including the review of documents produced by many firms and individuals throughout the generic pharmaceutical industry. The complaint is backed by an industry-wide phone call database consisting of more than 11 million call records from hundreds of individuals at various levels of the defendant companies and other generic manufacturers, and information given by unidentified witnesses, who were directly involved in the alleged conduct.
How has Teva reacted to the lawsuit?
Teva said in a statement it would continue to defend itself and that while it does review prices in the context of market conditions, availability and cost of production, it does not discuss individual pricing rationale/strategies. It denied engaging in anything that would lead to criminal or civil liability. “Overall, we establish prices to enable patient access, maintain our commitment to innovative and generic medicines and fulfil obligations to our shareholders,"" said the Israeli pharmaceutical company."

NEW DELHI :
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd reported a 53% drop in quarterly profit after it took a  ₹1,085 crore one-time charge, following a corporate governance scandal that also led to founder Dilip Shanghvi’s brother-in-law moving to a non-executive role.
Net profit fell to  ₹635.9 crore in the quarter ended 31 March from  ₹1,342 crore in the year earlier, India’s largest drug maker said in a stock exchange filing on Tuesday.
Sudhir Valia, brother-in law of Shanghvi, will become a non-executive director from whole-time director with effect from Wednesday. The move follows corporate governance allegations related to Valia raised by a whistle-blower. Sun pharma now faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
A 150-page complaint by the whistle-blower filed with the capital markets regulator that emerged last November alleged various irregularities by the company and its promoters.
From 1 November till date, Sun Pharma has lost $5.4 billion in market value.
The whistle-blower letter highlighted Sun Pharma’s dealing with subsidiary Aditya Medisales Ltd (AML), a drugs distributor that is also classified as a promoter shareholder of Sun Pharma with a stake of 1.6% as of December-end. It alleged that AML had lent to companies run by Valia.
Concerns have since been raised by investors over whether AML made any gains in the past at the cost of Sun Pharma.
Sun Pharma discontinued its domestic business tie-up with AML and Shanghvi assured investors that shareholders were never disadvantaged in the transactions with AML. In order to deal with the allegations and further reassure investors, Valia stepped down to take a non-executive role, Sun Pharma said on Tuesday.
The company, in a media statement accompanying the filing, said the reported profit was not comparable with the fourth quarter of last year because of the one-time impact of distribution change for its domestic business.
“Sales for the quarter included a one-time impact of about  ₹1,085 crore related to the change in distribution for India business,"" the statement said.
Consolidated revenue was  ₹7,044.26 crore for the quarter under consideration, up from  ₹6,711.01 crore for the same period a year ago.
“In spite of the one-time impact for India business, our full-year sales have grown by double digits. We continue to focus on executing our global specialty strategy,"" said Shanghvi.
Independent analyst Ambareesh Baliga said: “Though the numbers were lower than analyst expectations, but if accounted for the one-off sales adjusted due to change of distribution for India business, they offer some optimistic cues. US business has shown robust traction with 20% growth, especially when analysts had reduced weightage due to margin pressure. The whistle-blower complaint, which bogged down the stock in the last few months, seems to have relegated to the background, with no further information or development on the same."""

33,2019-05-30,Sun Pharma,"As the company re-routed India distribution to its own entity, domestic sales slumped 44% last quarterAs domestic business normalizes, the management expects revenues to expand in low to mid-teens in FY20

The distribution realignment in India, triggered by the whistle-blower complaint, impacted Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s performance in the March quarter. As the company re-routed India distribution to its own entity, domestic sales slumped 44% last quarter. This weighed on overall revenues, which grew just 5%. Excluding the impact, revenues would have grown 21%, largely driven by the US business that received a large order.
As domestic business normalizes, the management expects revenues to expand in low to mid-teens in FY20. But continued investments in specialty drug business means costs will remain elevated. This can weigh on profitability, according to the management. Research and development (R&D) expenses as a percentage of sales is projected to rise to 8-9% in the current financial year from 7% a year ago.
The higher expenditure guidance triggered a revision in earnings expectations. “We cut our FY20 margins by 200 bps as we factored a higher R&D and substantially higher specialty promotional spend. We also reduced FY21 margins by 100 bps, led by higher R&D (50 bps) and some increased spend in specialty. Consequently our FY20/21 earnings per share falls by 10/3%,"" Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note. One basis point (bps) equals one hundredth of a percentage point.
The reduction in earnings estimates also underscores slow revenue recovery expectations. Revenues at the much-talked about specialty drug business is seeing only gradual ramp-up, reflecting distribution challenges. While pricing pressure in the US generic drug business abated, competition continued to remain high. “Near-term challenges in specialty (drug business) eclipse the medium-term outlook as the ramp up has been slow even as competition is intensifying,"" Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.
Business in India, on the other hand, is only tracking industry trends. Adjusted revenues last financial year are up 12%, not significantly better than the 10% growth clocked by the industry.
Of course, the current fiscal revenue growth guidance of low to mid-teens indicate an incremental improvement from 10% sales growth in FY19. But as analysts at Edelweiss pointed out, the guidance would amount to single-digit growth if one excluded the one-off impacts in the base year (FY19).
Thankfully, much of the scepticism is factored in the stock price. It lost 17% in the past year as corporate governance and related party issues riled investors. At current valuation of 15-16 times FY21 earnings estimates, the stock trades at a notable discount to its peers. While this should limit the downside, much depends on the business recovery and how the company resolves governance issues."
32,2019-05-30,Sun Pharma,"Caught up in a corporate governance controversy, an insider view shows Sun trod ethical grey zones since the 1990s

No single form of growth-driving pharma marketing in India’s generic drug space of the 1990s could be totally free from controversy. Marketing strategies, including that of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, which promoted a long-term relationship with doctors, polarized professionals. But was there a choice? Most large companies, which stuck to what they perceived as “ethical marketing"" were slipping into a slow-growth zone.
“Sarabhai and some multinationals were fastidious in maintaining hygiene in marketing practices, and a sanitized distance between the doctor and the medical representative (MR) was built into the relationship they cultivated. Some of these companies considered giving anything more than a pen as a gift (to be) a sacrilege. Many of us did go through the initial ethical dilemma of whether what we were doing was the right thing,"" a professional who had joined Sun said.
Since Sun was changing the game and bringing new drugs to India, it couldn’t afford to play by the old rules and hope to be effective. They had a duty to inform the doctor about how a new drug behaves within the body. Also, Sun was meant to shape the market for chronic drugs. This, by its very definition, was generating business through the lifelong prescriptions of specialists, and in that business landscape, long-term sustainable relationships with doctors were the only framework they had to operate in.
(Founder of Sun Pharma Dilip) Shanghvi also went through the arduous grind an MR faces daily—competing with others in sweat and dust, turned away from a doctor’s door after an endless wait. If he could offer something of value to the doctor, he would have an advantage over his peers.
Before Sun, Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd (a competitor) had started forging closer ties with medical bodies like the Neurological Society of India, Cardiological Society of India and the Indian Psychiatric Society. Its founder U.N. Mehta had served as an MR for years and understood the struggle foot soldiers go through just to get a few minutes to tell a drug’s story to the doctor. He started sponsoring conferences, promoting them as platforms MRs could use to mingle with their demigods. This strategy succeeded for Torrent in oiling its customer relations and was adopted in various avatars by Sun, Intas, and others.
The conference fee game
At Sun, (Sundaresh) Raju christened the strategy “Scientific and Academic Services (SAS)"". In its basic unrefined form, it meant sponsoring top prescribers to attend medical conferences. “Through SAS, I wanted to give a clear message that it was not a way of spending money on doctors. That spend has to be with a purpose, that being it should ultimately help doctors treat their patients better (with drugs Sun sold),"" Shanghvi said. When (Shyamal) Ghosh’s friends from multinational companies (MNCs) derided such practices as inducements to doctors, he tried explaining it to them as he had been told.
“The guys we sponsor for conferences are celebrated specialists and have practices that earn them lakhs every month. Offering them these things for an academic pursuit is like offering them loose change. One must keep in mind that … they could feel awkward when they land in a different city. We wish to take away that headache,"" he clarified.
Ghosh, T.K. Roy, and other Sun insiders emphasized that unlike other companies which sponsored a lot of foreign junkets, Sun kept it domestic and restricted it to medical conference venues, a move that suited the company’s values and pockets.
“Marketing spends couldn’t be on fun trips as many other firms were practising. This devalued the relationship and made it transactional. It eroded respect for the company and was not sustainable,"" Raju said.
Reflecting on the practices he named a quarter-century ago, Raju said “services"" in SAS was an integral component in the whole framework and literally meant devotion. Raju laughed off any reference to the company’s marketing strategies as a “grey zone"". “There is no grey here because we knew our lines and didn’t cross them. Those who referred to it as grey either misunderstood or misinterpreted it,"" he asserted.
Rivals and detractors claimed that Sun smartly wrapped its commercial motive in a feel-good, emotionally appealing package. “The shrewd ways Sun developed customer relations under various heads can never be caught. Connect it to academics by a long stretch of imagination, and suddenly every form of marketing, even when they were spending so much, becomes palatable to doctors. Highlight the emotional connect, and suddenly the very motive of that relation, which is business, doesn’t sound vulgar. Retrospectively, they outbid all competitors by practising a strategy which people in the industry took a long time to grasp,"" a top executive of a rival firm admitted with grudging admiration of the model.
He pointed out that behind all the emotion was a cautious arithmetic justifying the business. Sun picked the doctors it wanted to invest in very carefully, classified them into high-return, medium-return and low-return, depending on factors like patient flows, the number of prescriptions generated, and retail sales audit. This marketing spends to sales, according to several former insiders, was roughly 1:10. They however explained that it wasn’t designed to be the quid-pro-quo that it is now being made out to be by some rivals. In fact, the rationale of such a classification was to make best use of the time and energy of the limited number of MRs Sun had at the time.
The chosen set of doctors was sponsored for medical conferences year after year. Sun devised ways to help their patient flows, expand their market, and, in turn, its own—by bringing new drugs in their therapies and quenching the academic thirst of doctors in ways that the medical industry in India had not witnessed till then. Sun spent its marketing budget on doctors by gifting them books, which they wanted but were not inclined to buy. Doctors in Calcutta credited Sun with building their libraries over the years. This was a practice which was later emulated by most other firms flogging psychiatric drugs.
Book dole-outs
Once we had started doing well, boss exhorted us to do things differently and introduce some new practices. (Marketing director) Subbarao (Chaganti) had just authored a book on pharma marketing and that became the first book we distributed,"" Roy recounted. Subsequently, Subbarao introduced Shyamal Ghosh and T.K. Roy to P.T. Rajasekaran, who ran Panther Publishers in Bengaluru.
They met Rajasekaran and thrashed out a deal. Rajasekaran reached out to major international medical publishers. He brought to the table a commitment to buy books in bulk at discounted prices and print them in India. On their part, international publishers would have to promise to make it a limited exclusive edition and not bring those titles to India for at least six months. It made sense for most international publishers because their books priced upwards of $20 were not popular with bookshops.
By the late 1990s, medical soirees had not only been adopted by many more companies but were also getting grander, hosted in foreign locales, and plush five-star hotels. Sun consciously opted for a venue away from the city, where there wasn’t much to do even if you got away from the conference hall.
Some industry veterans, however, hurl accusations at Sun’s practices. “As a pure business strategy, SAS was a stroke of absolute brilliance.Many companies which made a noise about Sun polluting the market initially, ended up blatantly aping its marketing moves. Even then, they couldn’t copy the execution, which has set Sun apart. But when it comes to ethics, I couldn’t out Sun above others. In the pharma marketing practices of the Indian market, if doctors and pharma companies went to bed together, you could not absolve Sun from that responsibility,"" a top executive of a rival firm felt.
Shanghvi said, “My belief from day one is that the doctor will support the company only if he respects it. If I do anything to reduce the respect of a doctor, I will attain suboptimal results. Above that, I have a resource constraint and I have to operate within that to earn their respect. So we focused on training our MRs on scientific awareness. My advantage was that I was an outsider, so I was not viewing things from a coloured perspective. I saw the problems just as they were and sought solutions that would work.""
Emotional connect
Cardiologists and psychiatrists agreed on the emotional connect. A senior cardiologist from Mumbai was in Delhi to attend a medical conference in the winter of 1999. His trip was being sponsored by one of Sun’s rivals. Early in the morning, he broke into a cold sweat, panting for breath, and felt his heart sinking. Being a cardiologist, he could diagnose himself and the first call he made was to a manager of Sun, managing to utter, “Kunal, I am having a heart attack."" One came across several such cases of Sun boys rushing to help when doctors turned patients.
Ethics in the pharma industry continues to be a sticky subject. While responding to the word “ethical"", a number of doctors, particularly psychiatrists, perceived Sun as more ethical than its competitors. Factors that helped the perception included continuity of the same people over years, which made specialists familiar and comfortable with Sun boys, prompting most to conclude that there must be something good about the firm.
The second factor was that Sun boys wouldn’t commit to something that they couldn’t do. They felt Sun operated under broadly set guidelines, which empowered the first-line managers to take decisions and stick to it.
Some drew a strangely abstract connection between ethics and Sun’s academic orientation in marketing. Somehow, Sun’s gifts of books and journals, its promptness in helping consultants build their name by publishing and presenting their papers, and the academic events made it appear more “ethical"".
The seed for the credibility Sun enjoyed among psychiatrists, cardiologists and endocrinologists were probably sown in 1992-93. Shanghvi, early in his career when he was working in the field, was sitting with a senior specialist who told him, “A senior bureaucrat’s wife was here and I prescribed her an MNC’s product."" It was a product that Sun was also selling.
Shanghvi recalled, “What was important was this: he not only prescribed a med of an MNC, but also said it to me, which meant he took pride in his action. With no amount of convincing, would I get him to prescribe my meds unless I earned his respect and trust? With this realization, our focus to earn the customer’s respect got stronger. It’s this in-depth understanding of the doctor’s behaviour that helped us design our policies. We were clear that it is through our actions that we have to earn his respect because I have no parents sitting in the US and Europe who have created a legacy of credibility. Either I create it through my actions or I don’t get it.""
At a time when large MNCs and Indian giants like Sarabhai kept a distance between MRs and doctors, and fast-growing lifestyle drug companies jumped to do anything, Sun chose the middle path. It spent heavily on marketing and doctors but made the core incentives it offered academic. This made the favours appear acceptable to the community, which was struggling to cope with the rapid transition in the pharma industry, and was stuck in a moral dilemma between the temptations dangled by the corporate sector and a conscience call.
One elderly psychiatrist called it a pull between “Lakshmi"" (the goddess of wealth) and “Saraswati"" (the goddess of knowledge). “Sun’s Lakshmi (marketing spend on doctors) came as Saraswati (academic focus of marketing), resolving a deep-seated conflict in the doctors’ minds and making it acceptable to our community,"" the psychiatrist concluded.

31,2019-06-11,Sun Pharma,"In a first step, Sebi has sought to address the issue of so-called vested complainants in cases of insider tradingTo address the issue of veracity of complaints, Sebi proposes to set up an office independent from investigations department

Mumbai: Investigations by the Securities and Exchange Board of India or Sebi into the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd (NSE), Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Infosys Ltd and ICICI Bank Ltd all have one thing in common -- they are all based on so-called whistleblower complaints.
Sebi found some merit in these complaints; with it passing orders in the case of alleged lapses at NSE's colocation platform, allowing settlement in the probe into corporate governance lapses at Infosys, sending letters to Sun on a case of alleged insider trading when it purchased Ranbaxy, and issuing notice to ICICI Bank on inadequate disclosures.
However, during the probes questions were raised on the veracity of the complaints and complainants. For instance, one of the so-called whistleblower complaints in case of lapses at NSE came from the office of 63 Moons Technologies Ltd (formerly known as Financial Technologies Ltd), similarly Sun asked Sebi to intervene and look into the genuineness of the complaint.
In a first step, Sebi has sought to address the issue of so-called vested complainants in cases of insider trading.
Sebi on Monday issued a discussion paper which proposes a reward, amnesty and protection policy for 'informants' who blow the whistle on cases of insider trading. Sebi will create a separate disclosure window for such whistleblowers to submit information of alleged wrongdoing and they will be rewarded to the tune of  ₹1 crore for cases where disgorgement has been at least  ₹5 crore. Sebi hopes that this policy move will improve its conviction rate in cases of insider trading.
To address the issue of veracity of complaints, Sebi proposes to set up an office independent from the investigations department which will look into complaints filed in cases of alleged insider trading.
In case the office determines that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious, Sebi can initiate appropriate action against the informant under the securities laws and any other applicable law, Sebi said in the discussion paper.
While this addresses the issue of 'vested and frivolous complaints' it may also discourage complainants as the ramifications of a wrong complaint have been kept wide ranging, said a lawyer practicing securities law.
Considering that the past two years have seen big cases come to light through complaints filed by anonymous complaints, Sebi should propose such a mechanism for fraudulent trade practices too and not limit it to insider trading, he added."
30,2019-06-21,Sun Pharma,"Cumulative proceeds from the recent drug sales should be sufficient for the proprietary business’s R&D costs for the next two years, driving it towards self-sustainability, says EdelweissAs price erosion in the generic drug business began undermining profitability, pharmaceutical firms are pressed to control costs, particularly product development

Last week, Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd sold two neurology drug brands for $110 million and certain royalty payments that will be received in future. In April, too, the company had entered into a similar agreement to sell a dermatology brand.
These divestments mark a crucial change in its strategy. Along with generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients, drug discovery used to be a focus area for the company. In the fiscal year 2016 annual report, chairman K. Satish Reddy had lauded the progress made by the firm in proprietary drugs, saying it would be one of its growth drivers.
Three years hence, the company is shrinking the drug discovery unit. As price erosion in the generic drug business began undermining profitability, pharmaceutical companies are pressed to control costs, particularly product development. Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd is another case in point.
Apart from selling proprietary drugs, Dr. Reddy’s has also sold a couple of manufacturing units. Cumulative proceeds from the recent drug sales should be sufficient for the proprietary business’s research and development (R&D) costs for the next two years, driving it towards self-sustainability, says Edelweiss Securities Ltd. “In proprietary products, Dr. Reddy’s incurred ~ ₹400 crore losses in FY19, adjusted for the sale of three dermatology brands to Encore, which generated ~$30 million. The upfront cash flow of $110 million+$30 million from the sale of total five proprietary products should eventually finance R&D for two dermatology products and one neurology product, which Dr. Reddy’s expects to file in CY19,"" Edelweiss analysts said in a note.
This will help the company contain costs, furthering its profitability objective. But for investors tracking the Indian pharma industry trajectory, the whole episode is a cautionary tale.
Apart from cost pressures, the retraction from drug discovery also underscores the patchy progress of Indian firms in product development and commercialization. The experience with specialty drugs, in particular, demonstrates this. These drugs, which are priced higher and have limited competition, are expected to make up for revenue loss from the pressures in the generic drugs business (thereby yielding growth at the company level). But, as seen at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Lupin Ltd in recent quarters, the ramp-up has been rather gradual, even as upfront costs continue to mount. Importantly, as one analyst points out, Indian companies lack the ideal specialty drug portfolio in a given category, because of which they don’t enjoy scale benefits. In this backdrop, Dr. Reddy’s decision to sell its branded products is seen as a strategically right move. “Given our long-standing concerns over the scalability of Dr. Reddy’s proprietary products strategy, and questionable product selection track record, we believe the divestitures are a correct step,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note."
29,2019-07-15,Sun Pharma,"The stock has been a big underperformer in the last two yearsThe scrip was upgraded on expectation of a revival in the company’s earnings from fiscal 2021 onwards

Mumbai: Shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd on Monday surged over 4% after foreign brokerage firm Morgan Stanley double upgraded the stock to overweight and increased its target price.
The stock was upgraded on expectation of a revival in the company’s earnings from fiscal 2021 onwards, driven by steady growth in base operations coupled with plateauing of current elevated cost structure, leading to positive operating leverage.
Shares of the company have risen as much as 4.12% so far today to hit a high of  ₹424.50 on BSE. At 11.16 am, the scrip was traded at  ₹416, up 2% from previous close.
Brokerage Morgan Stanley expects specialty ramp-up, manufacturing rationalization, cost control, Halol contribution, among other factors, to help improve margins for fiscal 2021.
The stock has been a big underperformer in the last two years, falling over 41% compared with gains of 31% in benchmark Sensex index. So far this year, the scrip has declined down 3%, while the Sensex has risen 7.5%. As a result, valuation has become reasonable, even based on Morgan Stanley's reduced estimates. Price earnings are now 22.3x for FY20 estimates and 15.8x for FY21 estimates.
""Sun's earnings and stock price are both at multi-year lows. We expect FY20 to be a transitional year, followed by a year of cost normalization and positive operating leverage. Specialty is a ""free optionality."" With this upgrade, Sun is our top pick,"" said Morgan Stanley in a 14 July note. The brokerage firm has raised its target price on the stock to  ₹505 a share, up 27% from the earlier  ₹398.15.
Globally aging population, pressure to contain costs, significant patent expiries, and new markets (such as Japan) will define global opportunities, said Morgan Stanley report.

27,2019-07-29,Sun Pharma,"In their current form, such banks serve largely as money-transfer channels. This business model, however, appears unsustainable in the absence of other reliable streams of revenue

Since at least 1969, financial inclusion has been a core goal of Indian policy. Among the relatively recent efforts in that direction, letting payments banks operate has been a decidedly bold move. Unlike classic banks that borrow cheaply from depositors to lend at higher rates of interest to businesses and others, these banks are not advancers of loans. Instead, they were conceptualized as new-age entities that would leverage information and communication technologies to grant transactional ease to people in far-flung parts of the country, especially those who have never visited a bank before. However, the nascent industry stares at a bleak future, with competition snapping at everyone’s heels, targets hard to achieve, and virtually all space for manoeuvre blocked. Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank said as much when it announced it was folding up barely 18 months after it began operations. The decision, the bank recently stated, was taken “due to unanticipated developments in the business landscape that have made the economic model unviable"".
It was on 19 August 2015 that the Reserve Bank of India gave in-principle approval to 11 entities to set up payments banks in the country. Four of them, including Sun Pharmaceuticals and Tech Mahindra, dropped out within months, but others were hopeful that millions of people—particularly the poor—would open small savings accounts with them and use a variety of remittance services via their mobile phones. Airtel’s bank was first off the block, its launch coinciding with demonetization in November 2016, and the concept seemed well-suited for a telecom network of its size and reach. Apart from it, Fino, India Post, Jio and Paytm are among the brands of payments banks still in operation. As a pre-existent online payment device, Paytm had already stolen a march on the rest by getting its app onto handset screens and establishing a consumer interface—the first challenge for any online business. It also made the most of the cash scarcity caused by demonetization, its user base doubling from 140 million in October 2016 to 270 million in November 2017. Most of the rest, though, have found it tough signing customers up. They had pinned their hopes on a cheap Aadhaar-based verification process, but this got a jolt once the Supreme Court ruled that this number was not mandatory for bank accounts or phone connections. Too few sign-ups, coupled with the regulatory limit of  ₹1 lakh per account on deposits they’re allowed to accept, leave payments banks with little money for asset creation. In any case, under the rules, 75% of deposits have to be invested in low-yield government bonds. As they pay depositors higher rates than regular banks, they need to cover their costs on far thinner spreads. It’s a wafer-margin business that requires high-volume money transfers to justify. For most, that’s a tall order.
Like with other network-based concepts, it can be argued, payments banks are a winner-takes-all business. This suggests that only one or two will survive. Even so, the very model looks like getting crushed between that of regular lenders and simple payment devices. Perhaps they need to be converted into either full banks or transaction enablers. This would kill the original idea. But then, reaching payment services to the last woman in the farthest village was never their sole responsibility. State-run banks could also fan out across the countryside to hardsell Jan Dhan accounts and get their apps onto millions of phones."
28,2019-07-29,Sun Pharma,"Indian pharma firms are seeking partners that can make tangible business contributions, safeguard IP, ensure operational control and manage talent, says a BofA-ML reportDr Reddy’s, Aurobindo Pharma, Cipla, Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries are looking at China as a big opportunity

Amid stifling competition in its biggest market, the US, Indian drug makers are scouting for partners in China, the world’s second largest drug market. A report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, released on Monday, estimates more Indian companies will enter the pharma industry in China through joint ventures.
Major pharmaceutical companies in India like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Cipla Ltd and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd are looking at China as a big opportunity, making the market one of the focus areas for future growth.
“Indian companies are seeking partners that can make tangible business contributions, safeguard IP, ensure operational control and manage talent,"" said the report. Five joint ventures are already in place in China.
Dr Reddy’s has identified 70 products from its US portfolio that meet requirements and can obtain approval from Chinese authorities in coming years. The company is building a new plant, upgrading teams and building a pipeline for China.
Aurobindo Pharma is next in line to construct a facility in China. The company expects commercialisation of its products in the next 2-2.5 years. There is also a joint venture for inhaler products which will start operating soon.
Early in July, Cipla said it was setting up a joint venture with a Chinese pharmaceutical company to manufacture and sell drugs. They are in the process of setting up a facility in China. “The company is looking at both routes--manufacturing in India and exporting to China as well as looking at potential facilities in China--for oncology,"" the report further says.
In May, Sun Pharmaceutical said it had entered into licensing agreements with China Medical System Holdings to develop and commercialise drugs to treat psoriasis and dry eye in Greater China. According to the company, there is a strong interest in China for products which it has global rights. Alembic Pharmaceutical has also announced its interest in China.
According to the report by analyst Girish Bakhru, the recent renewed interest in China has stemmed from healthcare reforms in the country that aim to reduce drug prices and increase competition and the quality of generics.
“Given high fragmentation, complex distribution, high hospital channel share, language and cultural barriers, most Indian firms are opting for joint ventures in China. Efforts are visible across the board as companies put China as one of the focus areas for future growth,"" added the report by Bakhru.
In an announcement on Monday Strides Pharma Science Limited (Strides) said that its step down subsidiary Strides Pharma Global Pte, Singapore (SPG) has entered into a joint venture (JV) with Sun Moral International (HK) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd (Sihuan), one of China’s leading pharmaceutical companies.
According to the statement, the JV will fast track Strides’ entry into China. “The recent regulatory developments in China has enabled fast track approvals of differentiated high-quality generics approved in key regulated markets. Strides’ specialized basket of 140+ products qualifies for the program, and this JV will be able to leverage it in China,"" said the company.
The spending on medicines in China is expected to reach $140 billion to $170 billion by 2023, reckons research firm IQVIA."

Tracking higher global markets, India's stock market indices Sensex and Nifty rebounded today, with some buying emerging in stocks that fell sharply in Tuesday's selloff. After rising over 500 points at day's high, the Sensex ended 353 points higher at 37,311 after US delayed tariffs on some Chinese imports, bringing some relief to global markets rattled by a trade conflict. The broader Nifty ended nearly 1% higher at 11,029. The rupee also rebounded after slumping to 6-month low on Tuesday though it later pared some gains. 
Here are 10 updates from Indian stock markets
1) Among the sectors, financials and auto which were hammered in Tuesday's selloff, led the gains today.
2) Among financials, Yes Banks, which slumped over 10% on Tuesday, rose 4% today. Bajaj Finance, which also fell nearly 6% in the previous session, saw some buying and settled 2% higher.
3) Reliance Industries shares today rose 1% today, extending their Tuesday's 10% gain.
4) Some buying was also seen in auto stocks Hero MotoCorp (+2.6%) and Bajaj Auto (+1.5%).
5) Metals stocks Tata Steel and Vedanta each ended nearly 5% higher as the global risk-on sentiment improved slightly.
6) Data released on Tuesday showed that India's retail inflation rate had eased slightly in July. ""Benign inflation continues to provide some more space for Monetary Policy Committee"" to ease rates further, Kotak Securities said in a note.
7) The finance ministry on Tuesday issued guidelines for rolling out its budget announcement of offering  ₹1 trillion partial credit guarantee to public-sector banks purchasing high-rated pooled assets of financially sound NBFCs. ""We believe that Ministry of Finance/RBI’s recent measures will improve liquidity for retail NBFCs. Trends from 1QFY20 results suggest that select NBFCs have faced challenges in raising funds likely due to exposure constraints of banks and MFs,"" Kotak said in a note.
8) Meanwhile, the rupee strengthened today to a day's high of 70.85 against the dollar, before paring some gains. 
9) Some pharma stocks came under strong selling pressure. Glenmark fell 8%, Sun Pharma declined 5% while Dr Reddy's and Lupin both lost nearly 2% each.
10) Wall Street soared overnight after US President Donald Trump on Tuesday delayed his September 1 deadline for 10% tariffs on some Chinese imports, including a range of consumer goods."
22,2019-08-14,Sun Pharma,"The Sun Pharma stock was the biggest loser among Nifty stocks on WednesdayWhile the firm’s June quarter results seemed good at first, sustainability is under question

MUMBAI :
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s shares gained 4% on Tuesday, after the company reported better-than-expected June quarter results. But the gains did not last long. On Wednesday, Sun Pharma was the biggest loser among Nifty stocks, falling 5.2%.
The 16% rise in revenues and 31% growth in profit exceeded Street estimates. But the expectations were soon tempered, as investors realized that the earnings momentum is not likely to sustain in the near term.
Growth in the US, a key market, was driven by a non-recurring short-term order. Besides, profits were aided by lower research and development (R&D) expenses, and higher other income. In fact, gross margins fell from the year-ago quarter, owing to an unfavourable product mix.
Sun Pharma expects R&D and tax expenditure to rise from hereon. To add to this, there is the promotional expenditure pertaining to specialty drugs. In this backdrop, analysts doubt if the 22.8% June quarter operating margin will be sustained in the near term. “Significant part of the beat was led by lower R&D and tax rate, which will normalize going forward,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
Importantly, the earnings call indicated a delay in the launch of a specialty drug CEQUA (cyclosporine ophthalmic solution). The company now expects to launch the drug only in the next quarter against the earlier expectation of a launch in Q2.
The news came to light amid reports that another large pharmaceutical firm, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, may also see a delay in launch of one of its key drugs (NuvaRing) in the US market. The reports sent the shares of Dr Reddy’s lower as well, pulling down the Nifty Pharma index.
Even so, the sharp fall in these companies’ share prices is surprising. Dr Reddy’s had already alluded to the possible delay in the NuvaRing launch in its recent earnings call. Further complexities of the specialty drug business mean delays will not be uncommon.
Perhaps the challenges are unnerving investors. With the base generic drug business continuing to face price pressures, hopes are pinned on the limited competition drugs to drive growth. With the scale-up and launches not progressing as per plan, investors are getting wary. “Sun Pharma is increasingly reliant on specialty portfolio to deliver growth in US as base business commentary remains lackluster at best. In the specialty basket, key products such as Ilumya are tasked with expanding market share in what is a difficult and crowded market. Management expects to launch Cequa in Q3 FY20 though associated costs are fully reflected in Q1 expenses; moreover, it believes Cequa to be an attractive opportunity even if Restatis (a similar drug in the market) is genericized,"" Yes Securities Institutional Equities said in a note"

Tracking gains in other Asian markets, the Sensex rose as much as 368 points at day's high but could not sustain the gains. The Sensex finished just 52 points higher at 37,402. The broader Nifty finished just 6 points higher at 11,053, much lower than its day's high of 11,146. The rupee also failed to sustain gains and was at 71.41 against US dollar in late trade.

Indian markets have had a rocky journey in recent months, with the BSE Sensex falling about 7% since a record high in June, amid slowing economic growth.
There are expectations that the government may soon announce a stimulus package to arrest a slowdown.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman this month held several meetings with industry executives, who have called for stimulus measures, including tax rebates, to support consumer demand and private investment.
""A stimulus is expected to be announced which can reverse the markets in the short term,"" said Jimeet Modi, founder and CEO of SAMCO Securities.
Among other Sensex stocks, Tech Mahindra, Axis Bank, L&T, RIL and ICICI Bank rose between 1% and 2%.
Global markets were mostly higher today on expectations that major economies would look to prop up stalling growth with fresh stimulus measures. This eased pressure on bonds and dampening demand for perceived safe-havens such as gold. (With Agency Inputs)"

18,2019-09-03,Sun Pharma,"The overhang may not yet be done and dusted as Sebi is yet to communicate its final decision to Sun PharmaIn the past three months, the Sun Pharma stock has also outperformed the Nifty Pharma index

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has been getting a dose of some bitter-sweet medicine. Following the Halol plant’s positive review by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) in mid-August, news reports suggest that whistle-blower’s allegations against the company may continue to be an overhang.
Earlier, reports indicated that a preliminary enquiry committee set up by the capital market regulator found no merit in the allegations, driving the stock prices higher by 6.2% over the last three trading days. In the past three months, the Sun Pharma stock has also outperformed the Nifty Pharma index.
Yet, the overhang may not yet be over as the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is yet to communicate its final decision to Sun Pharma.
Note that the whistle-blower allegations have kept the stock under pressure for some time now. The stock has lost 35% from its peak in September 2018.
“The corporate governance issue has been a big overhang on the Sun Pharma stock. If you consider the news of Sebi’s investigation of not finding anything wrong in terms of divergence of funds, as well as on foreign fund-raising, to be true, then this huge concern is now behind. If there is no clean chit, there could be further volatility. A positive has been that its Halol plant has got a clean chit from the US FDA,"" said Krishnanath Munde, pharma analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd.
Besides, the progress over its first-quarter performance needs to be considered. Its specialty chemicals business, where analysts had pencilled better growth rates, undershot the Street’s expectations.
Recently, Sun Pharma said it was developing an early-stage pipeline for its specialty business. So, that may be an advantage. Additionally, the domestic business has reported decent growth, while the US one has also been steady. Operating margins have held steady, boosting Q1 FY20 net profit, which was up 31% year-on-year.
However, there are not too many triggers. “One trigger for the stock would be an uptick in the US specialty business,"" notes Munde.
Hence, for investors, being on the fence and waiting for more clarity from Sebi may do no harm. It will also give them time to evaluate whether Sun Pharma is building on its Q1 FY20 performance."

New Delhi: Drug major Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Thursday said a forensic audit has been ordered by markets regulator Sebi with regard to its financial statements for three financial years between 2015-16 and 2017-18.
In a regulatory filing, Sun Pharma said, ""A forensic audit has been ordered by Sebi w.r.t. the financial statements of Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd for the financial years ending March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018"".

Sun Pharma, however, did not provide any specific details on the reasons for the Securities and Exchange Board of India to order the forensic audit.
A forensic audit is an examination and evaluation of a firm's or individual's financial records to derive evidence that can be used in a court of law or legal proceeding.

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. said it is undergoing a forensic audit of its financial statements as ordered by India’s markets regulator.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India has asked for a forensic audit of the company’s financial statements for three financial years to March 2018, India’s biggest drugmaker told exchanges in a late evening filing Thursday without specifying the reason. The shares fell 3% to  ₹439.35 intra-day on the BSE.
The latest probe points to mounting challenges for the billionaire Dilip Shanghvi-controlled drugmaker after whistle-blower complaints on corporate governance lapses triggered a stock slide last year and forced the firm to tweak some of its business contracts to contain the crisis. The latest regulatory action was disclosed after a query by exchanges asking the company to confirm local news reports that Sun had been asked to conduct the forensic audit following the complaints.
“Sentimentally things will remain negative at the present juncture,"" said Surya Patra, vice president at Phillipcapital India Pvt. in Mumbai. “What is not known is the outcome of the investigation, and if there will be some action taken by Sebi. The basis of the forensic audit is also not known.""
Sun Pharma had swung into action early this year to quell the crisis of confidence, triggered by the whistle-blower complaints alleging that its founder Shanghvi was wringing extra financial benefits from the company’s operations through related party transactions.
Shanghvi had denied wrongdoing in a December conference call.
The company is “committed to adhering to all applicable legal and statutory requirements,"" it said in the filing on Thursday.

This included sales of its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical at $161 million, up 1% on year

NEW DELHI :
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries on Thursday posted a consolidated net profit of  ₹1,064 crores for the July-September quarter, against a loss of  ₹269.6 crores last year.
Earnings in the corresponding quarter last year was dragged down by  ₹1,238-crore part payment of an anti-trust litigation settlement in 2017 with Canada-based Apotex Corporation. The litigation was related to the drug modafinil, which is used to treat sleepiness.
The company’s consolidated revenue from operations grew 11.5% at  ₹8,123 crores in September quarter, aided by sales in the Indian market.
The drug maker’s India sales came in at  ₹2,515 crores, up 35% on-year as the company launched 12 new products in the domestic market during the quarter, as per a company release.
US sales of Sun Pharmaceutical were flat at $339 million. This included sales of its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceutical at $161 million, up 1% on year.
“In the US, we recently launched Cequa while Ilumya continues to gain traction. The recently released long-term follow-up clinical data for Ilumya demonstrates sustained response for patients over four-year period with very good safety profile,"" Sun Pharmaceutical managing director Dilip Shanghvi said.
Sun Pharmaceutical’s operating income grew 12% on-year at  ₹1,616 crores, while its operating margin was 20.3%.
Sun Pharmaceutical also manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). While a significant chunk of it is for captive consumption for key products, it also sells it externally. For the reporting quarter, external sales of API were at Rs. 468 crores, up 10% on year.
India’s largest pharmaceutical company has filings for 103 generic drug applications awaiting US Food and Drug Administration approval, which include 20 tentative approvals, as per the release. During the reporting quarter, the company filed two generic drug applications and got approvals for seven.
Today, shares of Sun Pharmaceuticals closed 3.4% higher at  ₹442.50 on the National Stock Exchange."
7,2019-11-08,Sun Pharma,"Revenues from the US region were flat in the second quarter of FY20 compared with last yearSun Pharma’s domestic business saw a year-on-year growth of 35%, the highest in six years

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd’s second quarter figures have outrun estimates, showing that the firm is getting back on the recovery path. The stock surged immediately after the results and ended Thursday about 3% higher.
Overall, Q2 revenues were about 16.1% higher than a year ago, driven by steady growth in its home market and integration of the Pola Pharma Inc. business in Japan in the rest of the world business. Sun Pharma’s profit before tax increased by about 8% year-on-year (y-o-y).
The US market, however, has been seeing signs of sluggishness. Revenues from this region were flat compared with last year. Analysts have noted that headline growth has been largely in line with estimates, though US sales, excluding sales of its subsidiary Taro Pharmaceuticals, were much weaker than anticipated.
However, the product market in the US is predicted to improve in the coming quarters, but it will depend on how many new drugs the company can launch in the overseas market. The company has about 103 abbreviated new drug approvals awaiting the US FDA nod. Sun Pharma received approvals for seven ANDAs, enlarging its US pipeline to 54 approved new drug applications.
A big positive was the ramp up in its India operations due to a spate of product launches. This segment delivered the highest-ever quarterly sales growth of the last six years, rising 35% y-o-y.
“The India business was a good surprise and aided margins due to a favourable geographical mix in revenue growth. An increase in new launches and improvement in secondary sales were good signs. Overall, the margin beat was positive,"" said Krishnanath Munde, pharma analyst, Reliance Securities Ltd.
Research and development expenses fell as a proportion of revenue. Consolidated R&D expenses in Q2 FY20 were  ₹488 crore, about 6.1% of revenue. This compares well with Q2 FY19’s  ₹452 crore, which was about 6.6% of revenue. The product-mix change, though, seemed to crimp margin growth. Despite strong revenue growth of about 16%, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization grew only 12%. Besides, expenses related to the marketing of specialty products dented the Ebitda margin. However, the Ebitda margin was a touch higher than analysts estimated, which seems to have had a positive effect on the stock.
The stock trades at a one-year forward price earnings of about 20. Since the beginning of this year, the stock has been seeing signs of consolidation, yet the outlook for the US and India operations is key. Also, in the coming quarters, the Street will also be looking for a ramp up in its specialty products."

2,2019-12-09,Sun Pharma,"Top 10 drug manufacturers posted sales growth in the range of 12.6-17.9% in NovemberWhile sales of drugs under national list of essential medicines, grew 15.2% to  ₹1,245 cr, that of medicines not under price control grew 14.6% to  ₹10,866 crores

NEW DELHI :
A low base coupled with an early festival season helped pharmaceutical sales rise 14.5% year-on-year to  ₹12,624 crore in November, with sales of most Indian drug manufacturers outpacing their foreign peers, data from market research firm AIOCD-AWACS showed.
The market research firm said the sales were “one of the best growths seen in more than 32 months"", and attributed it to the weak 7% sales growth seen in the corresponding month last year, as well as the entire festival season ending in October itself this year. Last year, Diwali was in November.
Among the top 10 drug manufacturers, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Cipla, Cadila Healthcare, Lupin, Mankind Pharmaceuticals, Alkem Laboratories and Torrent Pharmaceuticals posted sales growth in the range of 12.6-17.9% in November.
India’s largest firm Sun Pharmaceutical posted a 14.5% growth in sales for the month to  ₹1,035 crore, while the Abbott group, the largest multinational firm and India’s second-largest, posted 12% growth to  ₹779 crore.
While sales of drugs under national list of essential medicines, which come under price control, grew 15.2% to  ₹1,245 crores, that of medicines not under price control grew 14.6% to  ₹10,866 crores.
Among the major therapy segments, anti-infective and respiratory drug sales led the growth with 17.0% and 19.7% respectively in November.
Over the last few years, medicines in anti-diabetic and cardiac segments have led sales growth, reflecting their increasing cases among the Indian population. For the year ending November, these two segments were the only ones in the top-10 therapies that grew in double digits.
For the year ending November, sales in the Indian pharmaceutical market grew 9.8% at  ₹1.39 lakh crore, with Lupin, Mankind Pharma, Intas Pharmaceuticals and Alkem Laboratories leading the growth."
1,2019-12-09,Sun Pharma,"Growth was driven by volumes, which increased 5.9%, followed by a 5.7% rise in prices, and new products that were up 3%Given the long monsoon season and the increase in pollution levels, sales of anti-infective and respiratory drug sales were among the highlights of this season

MUMBAI :
The surge in domestic pharmaceutical sales in November may have been encouraging, but sparked modest investor interest in pharma stocks, as was seen from the flat close of the Nifty Pharma index on Monday.
Sales rose 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the month, led by an increase in anti-infective and respiratory therapies, according to data from market research firm AIOCD Awacs.
It must be noted that November has been the best month in more than 32 months, shows the AIOCD Awacs data. In October, revenue growth had been soft at 5%, while volumes had declined.
The growth in November was driven by volumes, which increased 5.9%, followed by a 5.7% rise in prices, and new products that were up 3%. The growth is on the back of a lower base from a year ago, when sales grew by about 7%.
Analysts said the volume growth data was encouraging. “The pick up in volumes is the highlight after a negative volume growth of about 2.7% in October. Overall volume growth has been better this year. Additionally, Indian pharma companies outperformed multinational companies, which happened for the first time in the last six months. The domestic pharma market continues to remain strong,"" notes Kunal Dhamesha, pharma analyst at SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
While this year’s growth has been on the back of a lower base, a few firms managed to better market growth rates. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd posted the highest y-o-y growth at 28%, while Lupin Ltd and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd each reported 15% growth.
Given the extended monsoon season, sales of anti-infective and respiratory drugs grew the fastest in November. Besides, analysts expect the domestic market to continue to do well as lifestyle diseases are on the rise.
A positive is that the growth was broad-based across categories. Respiratory and anti-infectives grew at about 20% and 17%, respectively, y-o-y. Gastrointestinals also clocked a growth rate of about 15% y-o-y.
However, risks to the domestic pharma market could come from a revision in the National List of Essential Medicines. This constitutes about 10% of the domestic pharma market. Another factor to watch for would be growth rates post the acute season. Sales growth could tend to slow down in the coming months.
The pharma market penetration is still considered low in India, even as the affordability of drugs has been rising. However, the game seems to be shifting in favour of firms that have a strong domestic formulations portfolio. In short, the action is likely to become more stock-centric."
0,2019-12-24,Sun Pharma,"Since the Halol plant is crucial for future drug approvals, market expects some of the issues to be resolved quicklyShares of Sun Pharma have outperformed the Nifty Pharma index lately, but US FDA observations may act asa dampener

Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd continues to struggle with observations from the US food and drug administration (FDA) for its Halol plant. That could just prolong a recovery in the stock for some more time even as it has been consolidating at these levels for this past year.
Though the firm has received eight observations for its Halol unit, some analysts say most observations are procedural. “Most of the observations are procedural except the second observation, which mentions potential for alterations in sample data and information which might be considered serious,"" said Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
According to analysts, share of the Halol plant in total revenues is in high-single digits. Besides, in the immediate term, exports to the US will continue, so there will be a minor impact on financials.
However, Sun Pharma is expected to incur expenses to resolve these issues. Analysts say some observations will require comprehensive explanations and responses. This means that the company will have to spend considerably to ramp up procedures and facilities at this plant.
Since the plant is crucial as far as future drug approvals are concerned, the market expects some of the issues to be resolved in less time. “We expect Sun Pharma to implement corrective and preventive action (CAPA), and to resolve the issues highlighted in Form 483 in 3-4 months. Particularly, the issue related to sampling at the end of the filling process is important from future ANDA approval perspective,"" said the Motilal Oswal note. ANDA is abbreviated new drug application.
An important aspect to keep an eye on is future drug approvals from the Halol plant. As of now, not many new drug filings are expected from here in the near term.
“Although the number of filings from the plant is unknown after the warning letter earlier, quite a lot of filings would have been transferred to other sites and thus, the financial impact may not be meaningful even if the observations escalate. Nevertheless, this would be a sentiment dampener in the interim,"" said Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a note to clients.
Even so, one has to watch out for regulatory risks and any new issuance of warning letters. However, some of this may have already been factored in the stock price.
Nonetheless, investors will also want to see that its speciality products business picks up pace, which holds the key for growth. One positive is a pickup in domestic growth. Further, cost-control initiatives, and rationalization of research and development expenses, are factors that can aid operating metrics."
