Exit poll results indicate a tight race between BJP and Congress in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and an edge for the Congress in Rajasthan. The election results for five states Rajasthan, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram and Chhattisgarh will be announced tomorrow. The rupee fell sharply today to 71.41 a dollar as compared to Friday’s close of 70.82. 
Here are 10 things to know about stock market fall today
1) Among 30 Sensex stocks, just two stocks - Maruti Suzuki and Coal India - managed to close in the green. Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Adani Ports, Tata Motors, Asian Paints and Reliance Industries fell between 3% and 4% . Shares of Kotak Mahindra Bank slumped 6% after the private sector lender said that it has challenged in court the RBI’s decision to disregard the issue of preference shares to reduce promoter stake in bank.
2) The broader markets were also under strong selling pressure BSE midcap and smallcap indices also falling nearly 2% each. 
3) Some analysts expect a knee-jerk reaction from the markets, depending on the outcome of the state election results. G Chokkalingam, founder & managing director of Equinomics Research & Advisor, said: “There may be knee-jerk reaction in the markets depending upon the outcome. We firmly believe that the results of state elections do not matter much for the stock markets for the long term.""
4) Sanjiv Bhasin, executive VP-Markets & Corporate Affairs, IIFL Securities, says: “Any correction may be gradually bought into as markets will discount state election results as macros are improving for India."" Global oil prices are down from around $86 a barrel in October to around $60 now. This had sparked a 5% rally in Nifty in November. 
5) Rahul Sharma, senior research analyst at Equity99, said investors should stay cautious ahead of the outcome of state elections. On the economic front, industrial production data for October and retail inflation data for November will be declared on Wednesday. 
6) Asian markets slid today, extending their recent slide on worries over slowing global growth and fears that a fresh flare-up in tensions between Washington and Beijing could quash any chances of a trade deal. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.7%, falling to a two-week low.
7) Global markets were already reeling on news last week that Canadian officials had arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the US. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies.
8) White House trade adviser Peter Navarro’s comments that US officials would raise tariff rates on Chinese imports if the two countries could not come to an agreement during a 90-day negotiating period fanned fresh concerns over US-China trade relations.
9) Data released over the weekend showed China reporting far weaker than expected November exports and imports, underscoring concerns over slower global growth. 
10) Further adding to concerns for the Indian markets, oil prices rose today, extending gains from Friday when producers club OPEC and some non-affiliated producers agreed a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January. Brent crude edged up 0.2% to $61.79 per barrel."

India’s biggest stock exchanges have penalized hundreds of companies for non-compliance with the listing and disclosure norms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The National Stock Exchange (NSE) said it has penalized about 250 companies for violating Sebi’s Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirement Regulations (LODR) 2015. The violations include non-appointment of a woman director, compliance officer and share transfer agent and delay in intimation of board meeting.
These companies include Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Jet Airways (India) Ltd, Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd, InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, IL&FS Engineering and Construction Co. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd.

Due to poor hinterland connectivity, the port has so far only started partial operations in its 30 MT capacity

Mumbai: Adani Ports, India’s largest private sector port operator, and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Navi Mumbai are likely to bid for Dighi Port, which was declared bankrupt by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in April, according to two people aware of the matter.  
Mumbai: Adani Ports, India’s largest private sector port operator, and Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Navi Mumbai are likely to bid for Dighi Port, which was declared bankrupt by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in April, according to two people aware of the matter. 
A subsidiary of South Korean steel giant Posco is also rumoured to be interested in the port, although Mint could not independently verify this.
Queries sent to Posco Maharashtra Steel and Adani Ports were unanswered at the time of going to print while a spokesperson for JNPT declined to comment. 
Dighi Port is a minor greenfield port located in the Raigad district of Maharashtra, along the Konkan coast. It is a private port owned by Balaji Infra Projects Ltd and IL&FS Ltd. Dighi port is part of the Dedicated Freight Corridor and the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor. 
The port is being developed as a multipurpose, multicargo and all-weather port under a 50-year concession agreement with the Maharashtra Maritime Board (MMB) on a build, own, operate, share, transfer basis and has a land bank of 1,600 acres. 
However, because of poor hinterland connectivity, the port, which has a 30 million tonne capacity to handle coal, bauxite and containers, has only started partial operations.
In March, the port had been taken to the bankruptcy court by an operational creditor. It also owes  ₹ 1,600 crore to a consortium of banks. 
The last date for buyers to submit expressions of interest is 21 September, according to disclosures made under NCLT.
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) is the country’s largest port developer and operator with 10 ports and terminals on both the western and eastern coasts—Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, Vizhinjam in Kerala and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai. 
APSEZ represents 24% of India’s total port capacity and is also developing a transshipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala. The company reported net profit of  ₹ 3,683 crore in FY18. 
In May, Mint reported that JNPT was considering using its sizeable cash reserves to buy out smaller cash-strapped ports to quickly ramp up capacity. As of March 2017, JNPT had reported  ₹ 4,700 crore of free cash reserves and the government-owned port is close to exhausting its capacity to handle coal, steel and other cargo. 
In an interview on 22 May, Neeraj Bansal, chairman-in-charge, JNPT, said that the Mumbai-based port operator had hired a consultant to carry out a feasibility study and identify potential acquisition targets. This included the loss-making Mormugao Port Trust in Goa and the Dighi Port in the Konkan.
For South Korean steel maker Posco, it will be its first logistics-related investment in India. Posco Maharashtra Steel, a subsidiary of Posco Korea, operates a plant in Raigad district with installed capacity of 0.45 million tonnes per year of coated steel and 1 million tonnes per year for cold-rolled steel."

New Delhi: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Wednesday said it has concluded import and delivery of 50 US-made GE locomotives to Indian Railways. All 50 locomotives were manufactured by GE Electromotive Division in the US and imported to Mundra port. 
New Delhi: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Wednesday said it has concluded import and delivery of 50 US-made GE locomotives to Indian Railways. All 50 locomotives were manufactured by GE Electromotive Division in the US and imported to Mundra port.
“Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) successfully concluded the import and dispatch of 50 General Electric Transportation (GE) locomotives from Mundra port for the Indian Railways with full customer satisfaction and ‘zero’ incident. All 50 locomotives were manufactured by GE Electromotive Division in the US and imported at Mundra port for the Indian Railways, a first for Indian shopping and logistics,"" the company said in a statement.
The final locomotive was handed over to the Indian Railways at the Roza Loco Shed (UP) on November 23, 2018.
The commissioning of the locomotives was completed in the period between October 2017 and November 2018, which is a landmark record for the logistics and ports sector.
The statement said Mundra port has the unique distinction of handling consignments critical for development and defence of the nation.
In a short span of time, the port has played an instrumental role in logistics of wagons for various Metro projects pan-India, mining dump truck of 240 MT capacity and heavy duty air-crane (helicopter), it said.
The port is also set to receive the first batch of Boeing Chinook helicopters, which is purported to give a decisive edge to India’s defence forces in war like scenario and also during times of humanitarian crisis, as per sources.
APSEZ is India’s largest private multi-port operator and a part of the Adani Group, an integrated infrastructure corporation.
Since 1962, after the import of WDM2 ALCO locomotives for the Indian Railways, the current import of GE locomotives is the biggest import consignment in India.
The first GE locomotive was imported to Mundra and handled by Adani Port in October 2017.
“Efficiency in logistical operations is given an utmost priority at Adani Ports. Therefore, while handling the logistical operations for the Indian Railways and GE, we made sure the transportation of cargo from the vessel to its destination is seamless and without any incident,"" APSEZ Chief Operating Officer Avinash Rai saidMundra Port is the second largest port in India in handling container cargo. In 2014 – 15, Mundra port handled 1.75 million TEUs and has the installed terminal capacity to handle 2.3 Million TEUs per annum.
Adani Ports operates two terminals at Mundra - Adani Mundra Container Terminal (AMCT), which started operations in 2007, and Adani International Container Terminal (AICTPL), which was operationalised in 2013. Jointly both terminals handle 26 services, connecting India to destinations across the world.
APSEZ’s 10 strategically located ports and terminals — Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai — represent 24% of the country’s total port capacity, handling vast amounts of cargo from both coastal areas and the vast hinterland. The company is also developing a transhipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala."

Supreme Court dismissed Essar Bulk Terminal's appeal, and upheld Gujarat govt's 2016 notification on expansion of Adani's Hazira port saying it was not contrary to public interest

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an Essar Group company’s petition challenging a Gujarat government move to expand the limits of the Hazira port. 
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an Essar Group company’s petition challenging a Gujarat government move to expand the limits of the Hazira port.
Dismissing Essar Bulk Terminal Ltd’s (EBTL) appeal, a bench headed by justice Rohinton F. Nariman upheld the Gujarat government’s 2016 notification in this respect. The notification was not contrary to public interest, it ruled.
In an 18 January, 2016 notification issued under the Indian Ports Act, 1908, the Gujarat government allowed Hazira Port Pvt. Ltd (HPPL) and Adani Hazira Port Pvt. Ltd (AHPL) to expand their port limits in Hazira. Essar said such a move would infringe on the limits of its Magdalla port and encroach upon the land it reclaimed. This would allow Adani to usurp developmental works done by Essar, it claimed. 
In May, EBTL moved the Gujarat high court seeking quashing of the notification. When the high court rejected the petition, Essar moved the Supreme Court. 
“We are not satisfied that the notification is ultra vires Section 5 of the Indian Ports Act, 1908. We have already seen that the appellants (EBTL) have no ‘right’ to private property in view of the fact that the ownership of the captive jetty that has been constructed and the ownership of reclaimed land is with the Gujarat Maritime Board/state government,"" the 45-page judgment stated.
EBTL argued that it had spent huge amounts of money on the land it reclaimed, which would be affected by the expansion. 
Mihir Joshi, senior counsel for EBTL told the court that it had been granted clearance for land reclamation by the environment ministry on 6 May 2014, and that an expanded port limit would eat up 140 hectares of reclaimed land. Joshi also said that the notification had failed to consider the element of public interest.
This was opposed by senior advocate Harish Salve, counsel for the Gujarat government, who submitted that Essar’s demands for reclaimed land had nothing to do with the expansion of the limits of Hazira port as they operated in two completely different spheres."

Ahmedabad: Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ), India’s largest port operator, on Thursday reported a 19.5% rise in fiscal-third quarter profit.

While western ports in India will continue to grow, we are confident of exponential cargo volume growth in eastern and southern coasts of India. We will continue to increase our footprints in the logistics space. This will further improve our port to hinterland connectivity,"" said Karan Adani, chief executive officer of APSEZ in a statement.

Adani Abbot Point Terminal in Australia's Queensland state has to refinance about A$326 million ($256 million) of the loan due in November, S&P said

Sydney: An Australian deep water port linked to one of the world’s biggest planned coal mines should lock in refinancing within six months of a loan maturing in November to safeguard credit ratings on its debt, according to S&P Global Ratings. 
Sydney: An Australian deep water port linked to one of the world’s biggest planned coal mines should lock in refinancing within six months of a loan maturing in November to safeguard credit ratings on its debt, according to S&P Global Ratings.
Adani Abbot Point Terminal Pty in Australia’s Queensland state, controlled by Indian billionaire Gautam Adani, has to refinance about A$326 million ($256 million) of the loan due in November, S&P said. The credit assessor currently has a BBB- credit score and stable outlook on the port’s rated debt securities.
“We expect the refinance to be completed on time,"" Meet Vora, an analyst at S&P, said in a telephone interview. “If it’s within the six months of the maturity and nothing’s happening we start getting a bit concerned, which is where we need to start taking some actions.""
The loan is coming due at a sensitive moment for Adani Enterprises Ltd’s Australian operations. The company intends to use the port to ship coal from its planned Carmichael mine in Queensland. The project has drawn ire from environmentalists, who say it will endanger the health of the nation’s Great Barrier Reef. Adani Enterprises is separately seeking as much as A$3 billion in debt funding to help start producing at the mine, but lenders from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to three of China’s largest banks have ruled out providing loans for the project.
Adani began courting lenders for a new five-year, A$250 million loan for the port last September—the proceeds of which may be used to refinance part of the loan that’s maturing later this year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Adani is still searching for lenders willing to finance its new loan, according to the person who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
Moody’s Investors Service expects Adani to be able to refinance the loan but says that failure to do so would be a near-term risk for the terminal.
Adani’s management could also choose to deploy cash the port holds to slash its debt, analyst Arnon Musiker said. Improving demand for thermal coal will further support the Abbot Point’s business and finances, according to Musiker.
Adani’s Australia chief executive officer Jeyakumar Janakaraj declined to answer questions when contacted by telephone. An Adani spokeswoman said that, as reported in the Courier-Mail newspaper in December, the debt had already been refinanced. She didn’t reply to follow-up questions asking if that debt referred to bonds or loans when contacted by email.
Port expansion
While Adani’s port business is financed separately from its mining division, the company intends to transport coal sourced from its planned Carmichael mine by rail to the export terminal, which it acquired for A$1.8 billion in 2011. Abbot Point has one terminal and is being expanded to 60 million tonnes from its current 50 million tonne capacity, according to its website.
The terminal has exported coal since it was commissioned in 1984. Major producers in Queensland’s Bowen Basin coal province including Glencore Plc export supplies from Abbot Point.
The loan refinancing efforts come after Adani Abbot Point Terminal sold $500 million of bonds in December. The sale was part of an effort to refinance about A$976 million of combined Australian dollar bonds and loan debt due in November this year, according to S&P. The company called its Australian currency notes—which would have matured in November—on 12 December following the sale of its dollar debt, Bloomberg-compiled data show.
The US dollar bond sale highlighted continued debt investor interest in the port, Musiker said. “There’s still appetite for some paper -- it would just depend on spread,"" he said. Bloomberg"

However, their core ports are situated in India’s west coast, which have been lately seeing competitive intensity due to the addition of new container terminals at JNPT and Kandla port, eyeing the export-import container business.
Gujarat Pipavav’s recent June quarter results reflect the impact of growing competition. Despite higher volume and revenue, net earnings dropped from a year ago. Earnings were impacted by an adverse volume mix. The management has warned about competition and pricing pressure. Several analysts have pared their earnings estimates, fearing subdued profitability.
Adani Ports’ performance wasn’t exceptional either. Revenue and net earnings trailed Street estimates in Q1. Even so, adjusted for non-recurring revenue in the year-ago quarter and forex losses due to mark-to-market adjustment on dollar-denominated debt, the core ports business did well, said analysts.
Importantly, the management guided for improvement in profitability at the ports business and rise in free cash flows. “Port Ebitda margins to expand by 100 bps to 71%,"" Nomura research said in a note on Adani Ports. Management expects free cash flow of  ₹  1,750-2,000 crore against  ₹  1,253 crore in FY18 and  ₹  675 crore in FY17, pointed out Nomura. The Q1 results and commentary indicate that Adani Ports’ focus on improving the cargo mix is yielding results.
Still, the superior earnings outlook doesn’t mean much. Share performance is lacklustre. What’s more, valuations are at a discount. Compared to Gujarat Pipavav’s 26 times FY19 earnings per share multiple, Adani Ports is trading less than 20 times. This is despite Adani Ports generating superior returns. 
Despite the slow growth profile, institutional investors prefer Gujarat Pipavav for its transparency and simpler business structure, said an analyst with a domestic broking firm.
Further, Adani Ports’ dealings with its group firms don’t help. Reacting to investor concerns, Adani Ports curtailed related party loans. However, exposure to group firms remains high. Trade receivables jumped to  ₹  4,300 crore (about 38% of sales; FY17 was  ₹  2,700 crore), said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note analysing Adani Ports latest annual report. This was led by a steep jump in receivables from related parties.
What this means is that even as expanding trade volumes are helping domestic ports, a clear winner is yet to emerge."

A section of traders is betting on SALMAN to lead the next rallyThe asset quality of SBI improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19%

Mumbai: HRITIK acronym for index heavyweight stocks: HDFC Bank, Reliance Industries, ICICI Bank, Infosys and Kotak Bank put up a strong show in 2019. Leading a Nifty rally, three among these advanced 38 to 50 per cent in the last one year. Market participants are now guessing who would be the next set of stocks leading the rally.
A section of traders is betting on SALMAN -- SBI, Axis Bank, Larsen and Toubro, Maruti Suzuki, Adani Ports and National Thermal Power Corporation Limited (NTPC) -- to lead the next rally.
The Brokerages have maintained 'BUY' on SBI, betting on a recovery in India's growth momentum. Nomura had said SBI's Q2 asset quality beat its estimates. SBI gained over 12 per cent in the past one year, and closed on Friday at  ₹337.25 a share.
The asset quality of the bank improved with gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio coming in at 7.19 per cent, down 276 bps yearly and 34 bps sequentially.
Axis Bank, has also been traders and brokerages favourite. The index heavyweight along with RIL, ICICI Bank and HDFC were the preferred pick by the brokerage house CLSA. The bank had reported a consolidated Interest Income of  ₹12,183.88 crore, up 3.89 per cent from last quarter. Axis Bank has gained over 15 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹739 a piece.
The NTPC has also been on the rise after the foreign financial firm Morgan Stanley upgraded the company's shares to 'Overweight' from 'Equal-Weight' earlier. This came on the back of the government's decision to approve strategic disinvestment in the power major.
It had, however, fallen 23.53 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹114.55 a share on Friday.
JPMorgan had recently reiterated 'overweight' rating on Maruti Suzuki and also raised its target price. The largest car manufacturer in India has, however, declined 8.58 per cent in the last one year and closed at  ₹7,255 a share.
Larsen and Toubro had recently downgraded by Credit Suisse to 'neutral' from outperform and revised target price down to  ₹1460 from  ₹1750. The brokerage has downgraded the stock as macro continues to remain hostile in terms of gap in government finances from tax shortfall and continuing credit growth deceleration.
It has fallen 8.64 per cent in the past year and closed at  ₹1,310.75 a share.
Global brokerage houses are also bullish on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone despite its quarterly results falling short of market expectations. Macquarie has also raised its target price on Adani. Adani Ports lost a little over one per cent in the last one year of trade and closed at  ₹371.65 a share on Friday."

Around 41% of APSEZ’s cargo volumes are generated by containersGiven APSEZ’s tactical investments and capacity additions, the company is seen to be better placed

Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) made modest cuts to its annual forecast last month despite a notable slowdown in the September quarter. Volume growth slowed from 18% in the June quarter to a mere 1% last quarter.
But the company projected revenue growth of 11-13% for FY20 compared with its earlier guidance of 12-14% growth.
Evidently, the management hopes that volumes will improve in the second half of the fiscal year. However, traffic trends at major ports do not indicate any major recovery.
Total cargo at major ports across the country declined 0.3% in November, shows data compiled by Antique Stock Broking Ltd. Worryingly, the fall in container traffic worsened. Container traffic, measured in twenty-foot equivalent unit, dropped 5% last month, a steeper fall compared with the 1.7% drop in October.
Around 41% of APSEZ’s cargo volumes are generated by containers. Also, more than one-third (35%) of India’s container traffic is handled by the company.
As power plants come out of their maintenance shutdowns during the monsoon, the sector is expected to step up coal imports, which is another large business segment for APSEZ. But coal volumes have not seen any noticeable recovery yet. Total coal volumes at major ports were down 22% in November.
Given APSEZ’s tactical investments and capacity additions, the company is seen to be better placed. Volume growth in first half of FY20 stood at 9% vis-à-vis 5% expansion at the industry level (Indian ports’ total cargo).
Still, APSEZ’s pan-India presence is increasingly making it difficult for the company to escape the slowdown in cargo traffic. The deceleration in volume growth in the September quarter is a case in point."

In 2019, Adani group companies issued five dollar bond offerings, including two bonds by the ports operator, totalling about $2.76 billionAdani Ports has outlined a capex bill of nearly  ₹17,500 crore for various expansions

After tapping the dollar bond market twice in 2019, Gautam Adani’s ports business Adani Ports and Special Economic Zones is preparing for a fresh issue in the new year, two people aware of the development said.
In July, Adani Ports raised $650 million to buy back bonds of a similar amount maturing in 2020, and in June, it raised $750 million through a separate bond sale.
“Adani Ports has started working on another dollar bond issuance. It is likely to hit the market as early as the first quarter of calendar year 2020,"" said the first of the two people cited above, both of whom spoke under condition of anonymity.
According to the second person, the funds will be used for capital expenditure, unlike the previous two rounds, which were aimed at refinancing existing foreign and domestic debt of the ports operator.
The port operator has lined up significant expansion plans till financial year 2025, which will see the company expand its cargo handling capacity at four of its ports—Mundra, Hazira, Dhamra and Kattupalli—grow from a collective capacity of 345 million tonnes to about 477 million tonnes, according an October investor presentation by the company.
It is also developing a container terminal port in Myanmar and several multimodal logistics parks.
Adani Ports has outlined a capex plan of approximately  ₹17,500 crore for these expansions.
Emails sent to the Adani group remained unanswered.
The year 2019 has seen the group aggressively tap the dollar bond markets amid favourable interest rates and availability of capital.
“The Adani group has been sort of a darling of the bond market in 2019. They have seen subscription of three-four times for all the deals that they took to the market,"" said the second person cited above.
Adani group companies issued five dollar bond offerings, including two bonds by the ports operator, totalling about $2.76 billion.
Apart from the port company, Adani’s renewable energy business Adani Green Energy Ltd raised $500 million in May and followed it up with another bond issuance of $362.5 million in October.
Adani Transmission, the power transmission and distribution business of the group, raised $500 million in November.
Mint reported on 29 September that Adani Electricity Mumbai Ltd, the city electricity distribution business of the group housed under the transmission arm, is also planning to refinance part of its existing domestic debt by raising bonds in the offshore market.
Adani group’s aggressive moves in the dollar bond market mirror those of other Indian companies that tapped the offshore bond market this year, after tepid fund-raising activity in 2018.
Last year, Indian companies raised around $6.3 billion by selling dollar-denominated bonds, a 51.7% decline from the previous year, according to data from Refinitiv.
While IndusInd Bank Ltd raised $400 million in April, State Bank of India raised $1.25 billion through overseas bonds in January.
GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd also raised $300 million through bonds in the offshore market to refinance the debt of its parent GMR Infrastructure Ltd.
Renewable energy firm ReNew Power Ltd, too, has raised close to $700 million through two bond offerings.
On 24 September, JSW Steel Ltd said it has raised $400 million through dollar bonds for capital expenditure and other purposes.
Adani Transmission has hired Standard Chartered Bank to advise on its bond offering, Mint reported on 12 September.
“Global macro conditions have created a rally in the markets, which has helped issuers. Given that there were few Indian bond deals in 2018, there was a strong pipeline that got built up, and investors also had more room to buy Indian debt paper,"" said an investment banker, who did not want to be named."

Its facilities are mostly built on land leased from govt or owned by the railways, at concessional rates sometimesLast week, the government said it will offload 30% of its 55% stake in Concor and transfer management control to the strategic buyer

Shares of Container Corporation of India Ltd (Concor) gained about 20% from their lows in August, even as its business hit a soft patch in recent quarters.
Investors are optimistic about the prospect of an ownership change. Last week, the government said it will offload 30% of its 55% stake in Concor and transfer management control to the strategic buyer. At the current market price, a 30% stake sale will fetch the government around  ₹10,300 crore.
The largest container train operator in India has much to offer, drawing enough interest from potential investors. Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd recently told analysts that it will consider buying the government’s stake in Concor, even though it is cheaper to build the business from scratch.
But building facilities of such scale would take 15-20 years. So it makes strategic sense to acquire the company, goes the logic.
Further, the government should be able to realize much better value. “In a strategic sale, since the buyer has strong industry expertise and, therefore, is in a position to extract better value notably through revenue and operating synergies, this makes them offer a higher price,"" said Sandeep Mathew, analyst at SBICAP Securities Ltd.
What’s more, the ownership change can improve the capital allocation efficiency and pricing flexibility. SBICAP Securities data shows moderation in Concor’s return on capital employed during the past decade.
On the flip side, however, “Concor controls around 70% market share and selling a strategic stake with management control will create a virtual monopoly for the buyer,"" said Vikram Suryavanshi, vice president (equity) at PhillipCapital (India) Pvt. Ltd.
Concor’s facilities are mostly built on land leased from the government or on land owned by Indian Railways, and sometimes at concessional rates. Also, the company’s senior management is often drawn from the Railways, giving them preferential access.
Untangling these relations and ensuring a level playing field after the ownership change will not be easy. “With a fair access policy, Indian Railways can ensure a level playing field among operators,"" added Mathew of SBICAP Securities."

Despite a notable slowdown in volume growth, management pared the guidance for current fiscal only slightlyCargo volume growth decelerated to 1% in September quarter compared to double digit growth in the previous four quarters

Mumbai: For long, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd circumvented market changes by tactically expanding service offerings and capacities. But such is the intensity of the current slowdown even the largest private port operator in India is finding it hard to withstand the challenge.
Cargo volume growth decelerated to 1% in September quarter compared to double digit growth in the previous four quarters. The stock is down 0.8% in Wednesday morning trade. Cumulatively volume growth in first half of the current fiscal stood at 9%, down from 15% in the H1 FY19.
Growth at the mainstay Mundra port declined 5.7% last quarter. In the first half of the year, they grew just 4.5%. The volume slowdown weighed on revenue growth, impacting profitability. Operating profit margin contracted two percentage points to 63%. This led to a tepid 5% expansion in operating earnings.
Profitability trailed Street expectation, triggering cuts in earnings estimates. But the cuts are rather modest. Analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd and Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt Ltd lowered their operating earnings estimates by 2-5% for current fiscal year.
The earnings estimate cuts were modest tempered by management optimism. Despite a notable slowdown in volume growth, the management pared the guidance for current fiscal only slightly.
The company expects current fiscal revenue to grow 11-13%, more or less similar to 12-14% it provided earlier. Volume growth projection was also trimmed slightly to 8-10% from 12%. The minor cuts in guidance capped losses in the stock.
But the guidance will not hold ground if the current slowdown in trade continues. Volumes in October did not see meaningful improvement.
Further, the guidance pins hopes on rebound in oil and coal trade, whose users (refineries and power plants) are seeing muted consumer demand. “While management acknowledges October has been weak as well, it expects a revival in 2H which may enable the volume growth guidance of 8-10% in FY20 to be achieved. In fact, management believes that crude oil volumes will normalize as refineries under planned maintenance come on-stream in 2H,"" Nomura said in a note. “Furthermore, increased thermal coal volume demand from power plants in Mundra and from Dhamra port (both thermal and coking coal) will lead to volume growth in 2H in addition to the present run rates,"" analysts at Nomura add."

Mumbai: Billionaire Gautam Adani’s flagship business Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) reported a 72% surge in its net profit in the September quarter to  ₹1,059.20 crore, boosted by a deferred tax write-back of  ₹290 crore.
APSEZ reported revenue from operations of  ₹2,821 crore for the July-September quarter, a rise of 8% on an annual basis. Costs rose 14% over the same period to  ₹2,440.5 crore.
In the first half of this fiscal, APSEZ recorded cargo throughput of 109 million tonnes (mt), 9% higher year-on-year. Ports across all three regions (west, south and east) registered strong growth, the company said in a release. Dhamra, the eastern port of APSEZ, registered a growth of 46%, Kattupalli in the south registered a growth of 17% while the western ports of Hazira grew 7% and Mundra grew 5%.
The company said increased cargo volume and the ability to maintain realization helped core operating profit (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, EBITDA) grow 10% to  ₹3,634 crore in H1 FY20 from  ₹3,292 crore in H1FY19. EBITDA margins were at 65% in H1 FY20 compared to 66% in H1 FY19.
Karan Adani, CEO and whole-time director of APSEZ, said: “APSEZ continues to gain market share due to strategy of having multi commodity ports across key locations. Our market share in H1 FY20 has increased by 100 bps to 22% of all India cargo volume and to 35% of all India container volume. Though Q2 of FY20 was subdued, container volume continues to be strong. We expect H2FY20 to be better and (are) confident of achieving 224-228 mt of cargo throughput in FY20.""
APSEZ is the largest port developer and operator in India and has 11 strategically located ports and terminals — Mundra, Dahej, Kandla and Hazira in Gujarat, Dhamra in Odisha, Mormugao in Goa, Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh, and Kattupalli and Ennore in Chennai. These ports represent 24% of the country's total port capacity, handling vast amounts of cargo from both coastal areas and the vast hinterland. The company is also developing a transhipment port at Vizhinjam, Kerala and a container terminal at Myanmar."

Power transmission firm to use funds raised from overseas dollar-denominated bonds to repay debtThe proposed bond offering could be launched after the September quarter results

Power transmission and distribution company Adani Transmission Ltd is looking to raise $750 million to $1 billion by selling overseas dollar-denominated bonds, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
“The proposed bond issuance will be used to repay existing high-cost debt of the company, specifically the debt that Adani Transmission raised to acquire Reliance Power’s Mumbai distribution business,"" said the first person mentioned above.
Last year, Adani Transmission had acquired Reliance Infrastructure’s integrated business of retail electricity distribution, transmission and generation. The business included Reliance Infra’s power generation units in Dahanu, power transmission network across Mumbai and Maharashtra, and the retail power distribution network in Mumbai suburbs. The distribution business serves more than three million customers across 400 sq. km. The acquisition marked the firm’s foray into large-scale electricity distribution.
“Work on the bond issuance has started recently. Standard Chartered Bank is currently advising the company and more banks are expected to join the syndicate soon. The bond offering could be launched after the September quarter results,"" said the second person.
Adani Transmission was earlier trying to raise equity to repay part of its debt, but the plans did not fructify.
“As a group, they have been very active in the dollar bond market this year,"" he added.
Mint had reported in January that Adani Transmission was looking to raise up to  ₹ 3,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering to repay debt. It had appointed five investment banks—Kotak Mahindra Capital, Citi, Credit Suisse, Edelweiss and JM Financial—to manage the share sale.
As on 31 March, the company’s total outstanding debt stood at  ₹18,900 crore, or $2.7 billion, according to its investor presentation, comprising of rupee and dollar bonds, masala bonds, commercial paper and external commercial borrowings.
In July, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd had said that it was raising dollar bonds worth $650 million to buy back bonds of the same amount, which were due next year.
In June, Adani Ports had raised $750 million through another bond issuance. In May, the group’s renewable energy business, Adani Green Ltd, had raised $500 million through an offshore bond offering.
Adani Group and Standard Chartered Bank spokespersons declined to comment on the proposed bond offering.
Adani Transmissions’ bond issue follows several other Indian firms who tapped into the offshore bond market this year, after tepid fund-raising activity in 2018. Last year, Indian companies had raised $6.3 billion through dollar-denominated bonds, down 51.7% from a year ago, according to data from Refinitiv.
While IndusInd Bank Ltd raised $400 million through a benchmark three-year issuance, at a coupon rate of 3.875% per annum in April, the State Bank of India had raised $1.25 billion through overseas bonds in January. GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd also raised $300 million through bonds in the offshore market to refinance debt of its parent firm, GMR Infrastructure Ltd. Renewable power producer ReNew Power Ltd, too, has raised close to $700 million through two bond offerings."

In other news, American hedge fund Steadview Capital plans to invest $500 million in growth-stage companies in India over the next two years

Mumbai: Mint brings you your dose of the top deals news, reported from newsrooms across the country.
Adani Ports starts buyback of $650 million bonds due next year
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd began a tender offer to buy back bonds worth $650 million due next year, Mint reported citing a company statement. The bond repurchase programme by the Adani group firm that closes on 24 July, buys back the $1,000 bonds at $1,009.5 each. The company is also issuing new bonds of at least $650 million, proceeds of which will be used for the buyback of the bonds due in 2020. Fitch Ratings assigned the port operator’s new bond issuance an expected rating of ‘BBB-(EXP)’ with a stable outlook. This is the second bond repurchase after last month’s $750-million offshore bond sale, which aimed to repay existing loans and finance capital expenditure. Adani Ports claims to be the country’s largest port developer and operator with a 21.2% share of port capacity.
American hedge fund Steadview to increase investments in Indian startups
American hedge fund Steadview Capital plans to invest $500 million in growth-stage companies in India over the next two years, Mint reported citing two people aware of its strategy. The average investment per deal is expected to be $20-40 million, but it could even invest up to $100 million in a single firm if the company’s financial metrics justify heavy capital. The hedge fund, which has previously invested in unicorns, such as Flipkart and Ola, is looking at consumer internet startups in vertical e-commerce, content and fintech. After going slow on investments between 2015 and 2018, Steadview exited Flipkart in 2018 and sold it to Walmart Inc. After the Flipkart stake sale, it made six new investments totaling about $200 million, besides investing $74 million more in Ola Cabs. This year, Steadview has bet on business-to-business agriculture-marketing platform Ninjacart, online education startup Unacademy and online fantasy gaming platform Dream11, where its investment catapulted the startup to unicorn status. Last year, it bought secondary stakes of existing investors in eyewear retail startup Lenskart, home services firm UrbanClap, and INDWealth, a wealth management platform started by former Ibibo founder Ashish Kashyap.
Government to invite expressions of interest for Air India by August
India is considering inviting expressions of interest to sell Air India Ltd by the end of next month as the government plans to sell its entire stake in the carrier this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter, Mint reported citing Bloomberg news. The government will conduct road shows as well as be open to meet prospective buyers even before the expressions of interest are sought, the people said, declining to be identified as the discussions are private. The process will likely allow the bidders to look at the accounts of the airline except for some portions that are confidential and also see the share purchase agreement. The potential bidders will have the option to make suggestions for changes in the sale terms during the process of expressing their interest in the deal.

Adani Ports is buying back the $1,000 bonds for $1,009.5 apieceThe plan under which Adani Ports is buying back $1,000 bonds at $1,009.5 each will close on 24 July, a statement said

NEW DELHI :
Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd on Tuesday said it has begun a tender offer to buy back bonds worth $650 million due next year. The bond repurchase programme by the Adani group firm will close on 24 July, a company statement said. Adani Ports is buying back the $1,000 bonds at $1,009.5 each.
The company is also issuing new bonds of at least $650 million, proceeds of which will be used for the buyback of the bonds due in 2020.
“The tender offer is conditioned on the issuance of the new notes in a principal amount of at least $650 million on terms and conditions satisfactory to the company,"" the statement added.
On Tuesday, Fitch Ratings said it has assigned the port operator’s new bond issuance of $650 million an expected rating of ‘BBB-(EXP)’ with a stable outlook.
“Historically, the issuer has experienced throughput resilience in economic cycles. Adani Ports has some flexibility in modifying tariffs and around 14% of its revenue in the financial year ended March 2019 (FY19) was associated with long-term revenue-guaranteed contracts. The company has spare capacity and can fund its large capex plan from operational cash flow. Its debt structure is corporate-like, with spread-out bullet maturities,’ the rating agency said in a note.
The bond issuance and the bond repurchase programme follow last month’s $750-million offshore bond sale, which aimed to repay existing loans and finance capital expenditure.
Adani Ports claims to be the country’s largest port developer and operator with a 21.2% share of port capacity.
The company reported 18% rise in its debt to $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2019, compared with $3.3 billion a year ago, according to company data. The port operator’s profit remained almost flat at $579 million in FY19, compared to $573 million in FY18.
Several other Indian firms had also tapped the offshore bond market this year, following tepid fundraising activity in 2018. Indian firms had raised $6.3 billion through dollar-denominated bonds, down 51.7% from 2019, shows Thomson Reuters data.
For instance, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd had raised $300 million through bonds in the offshore market to refinance debt of its parent, GMR Infrastructure Ltd."

DHFL’s survival hinges on  ₹3,000 crore equity infusion
Mortgage lender Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL) needs between  ₹2,500 crore and  ₹3,000 crore of fresh equity investments immediately to meet capital adequacy requirements and sustain lending operations, Mint reported citing two people aware of the development. On Saturday, DHFL said it has been under substantial stress since the second half of FY19 due to consistent downgrades in its credit rating since February. Its ability to raise funds has been impaired and the business brought to a standstill, with virtually no disbursements, raising a significant doubt on the ability of the company to continue as a going concern, it said. As of December, DHFL had an outstanding debt of  ₹1 lakh crore, of which 38% was in the form of bank loans, 47% from debt markets and 10% through deposits. PE firms Oaktree Capital, Cerberus Capital and AION Capital have already submitted non-binding offers to buy a stake in DHFL. The mortgage lender’s board will discuss the offers at its next meeting.
Byju’s valuation soars to $5.5 billion in latest funding round
The valuation of Byju’s, India’s most valued ed-tech company, surged by $2 billion to $5.5 billion in its ongoing Series F funding round, an unprecedented jump within a single round, as investors clamoured for a piece of the education startup that has reported dizzying growth, Mint reported. The firm first raised capital in the ongoing Series F round in December, giving it a valuation of $3.5 billion. In the fourth round in the first week of July, it raised $86 million ( ₹589 crore) at a valuation of $5.5 billion. Such valuation differences within a round are uncommon, according to the experts who based Byju’s valuation jumps on its rapid growth. Bengaluru-based Think and Learn Pvt. Ltd, which runs Byju’s, grew its revenue threefold in the year ended 31 March to  ₹1,430 crore and turned profitable on a full-year basis. Its expansion into grades I-III and entry into the US market have contributed to the valuation jump, investors said. The ed-tech firm, which has already attracted more than 35 million students on its platform, has so far raised  ₹3,159.4 crore ($460.8 million) in the round, led by investors such as South Africa’s Naspers, private equity firm General Atlantic, and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, shows data sourced from business information platform Paper.vc.
NIIF may invest $100 million in Multiples PE’s third fund
The National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is considering an investment of $100 million in the third fund of private equity firm Multiples Alternate Asset Management Pvt. Ltd, Mint reported citing two people close to the deal. Multiples Private Equity Fund III, which began raising funds from limited partners (LPs) or investors last year, is targeting to raise one of the largest Indian private equity funds at about $900 million. The third fund is anchored by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) for $200 million or 25% of the total fund value, whichever is lower. Based on the commitments so far, the total fundraise stands at close to $300 million, as of July. If the commitment from NIIF and another new investor that is also evaluating the PE firm comes along, Multiples’ first close for the third fund could reach between $400-$500 million. The deal, however, is at a very early stage and both the parties are still evaluating and discussing the investment terms. Multiples, which raised its first fund of $405 million in 2011, had closed its second fund of $700 million (including a $150 million co-investment pool) in 2017, and launched its third fund, Multiples Private Equity Fund III, in February 2018. It has made nearly 20 investments from the first and second funds.
Suzlon stares at offshore bonds default, asks investors to hold on
Suzlon Energy is staring at a default on redemption of its foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) worth $172 million( ₹1,200 crore) that will be due on Tuesday, The Economic Times reported citing three people involved in the matter. The stressed wind power firm has told its bondholders that they will have to wait until banks accept its proposed one-time settlement plan, that depends on a deal being negotiated with Canadian investor Brookfield, which is interested in acquiring equity in the Tulsi Tanti-led company that has net term debt, including FCCBs, of  ₹7,761 crore and working capital debt of  ₹3,380 crore. In 2012, the firm had defaulted on FCCB repayment, the biggest at the time, which triggered cross defaults on other bonds. Suzlon Energy had then issued these bonds that are due for redemption on Tuesday to replace the bonds it was unable to redeem then. In March this year, the loss-making company defaulted on repayment of principal and interest to lenders worth  ₹412 crore towards term loans and working capital facilities and on making payments to certain overdue creditors.

The bond issue comes after several other Indian firms tapped into the offshore bond market this yearAdani Ports has a 21.2% market share of port capacity in India

Mumbai: Billionaire Gautam Adani-promoted Adani Ports And Special Economic Zone Ltd on Wednesday launched a $750-million offshore bond sale to repay existing loans and finance capital expenditure, two people aware of the development said.
“The book was opened on Wednesday morning and is expected to close by midnight of 26 June,"" said one of the two people cited above. Both persons spoke on the condition of anonymity.
The funds will be used for capital expenditure, including on-lending to subsidiaries to meet their capital expenditure needs, as well as for repaying existing debt, this person added. Investment banks Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Standard Chartered Bank, Citi, JP Morgan, Barclays and others are managing the offering.
“The US dollar-denominated bonds are priced at a mark-up of 265 basis points over the 10-year US benchmark yield,"" the person cited above said. As of 25 June, the US treasury benchmark yield was trading at 198 basis points, Bloomberg data shows.
The bond issue comes after several other Indian firms tapped into the offshore bond market this year, after tepid fundraising activity in 2018. Last year, Indian companies raised $6.3 billion through dollar denominated bonds, down 51.7% from a year ago as the number of issuances more than halved, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
Companies that have tapped the offshore bond market this year include IndusInd Bank Ltd, which in April raised $400 million (around  ₹2,700 crore) through a benchmark three-year issuance, at a coupon rate of 3.875% per annum. In January, India’s largest lender, State Bank of India, raised $1.25 billion through bonds issued abroad. Recently, GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd also raised $300 million through bonds in the offshore market to refinance debt of its parent firm, GMR Infrastructure Ltd, while renewable power producer ReNew Power Ltd raised $375 million through dollar-denominated green bonds.
Adani Ports claims to be the country’s largest port developer and operator with a 21.2% market share of port capacity. The company has nine ports in operation, of which two are under development and three are Inland Container Depots located in ten locations across east, west and south coasts of India, according to a recent investor presentation.
Adani Ports is estimated to have a capital expenditure plan of  ₹2,500-2,800 crore annually over fiscal years 2019-21 on account of its capacity expansion plans for Mundra, Kattupalli and Dhamra ports to boost cargo volumes, according to a September 2018 Icra note.

The reduction in related-party loans is visible in the sizeable drop in working capital during FY19With the regulators paving the way for tariff renegotiation at a loss-making plant of group firm Adani Power Ltd, concerns about incremental loans to this entity have further abated

Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd have gained momentum in the past year, with the company reducing its financial exposure to group firms through related- party loans. Besides, the company has suggested that capital expenditure (capex) has peaked, which will result in balance-sheet deleveraging and improvement in profitability.
The reduction in related-party loans is visible in the sizeable drop in working capital during FY19. Besides, with the regulators paving the way for tariff renegotiation at a loss-making plant of group firm Adani Power Ltd, concerns about incremental loans to this entity have further abated.
All this helped the Adani Ports stock gain 12% in the past year.
That’s not all. The company delivered on its guidance of better payouts to shareholders. Last week, it surprised the Street by announcing a  ₹1,960 crore share buy-back, and said that it would return 20-25% of profits every year to shareholders.
This is a notable change in Adani Ports’ dividend policy. Payouts in the five years between FY14 and FY18 were less than 15% of profits, as the accompanying chart shows. The payout ratio in FY19 was abnormally high due to a special dividend.
“We had assumed a 15% pay-out for FY20/21 in our estimates but the new announcement is clearly a positive development. With the higher pay-out, we now estimate that return on equity for FY20/21 can be 18.8%-19.8%, which would be a 50 basis point improvement from current estimates,"" analysts at Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
With several of Adani Ports’ assets generating free cash flow, it is only logical that the company returns the cash. If, indeed, it consistently returns the cash within the guided payout range and stays clear of related-party transactions, the stock may be better valued, say analysts.
Much depends on how the management balances its growth ambitions. After the peak capex in FY17, Adani Ports steadily moderated its investments to around  ₹2,500 crore. In FY20, the company plans to invest  ₹4,000 crore (including  ₹1,000 crore in Myanmar).
“In the past few months, we have seen a renewed capex aggression towards expanding footprints in port and logistics,"" analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a note.
Against its “desired"" net debt- to-Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of less than three times (2.9 in FY19), Adani Ports now expects to maintain the leverage at 3-3.5 times. While this may not be a deal-breaker, a large acquisition can add to the leverage. This would be a risk to watch out for."

BPCL, Jet among companies fined for violating listing, disclosure normsExchanges can levy fines and freeze promoter holding if firms continue to not comply with rules

MUMBAI :
India’s biggest stock exchanges have penalized hundreds of companies for non-compliance with the listing and disclosure norms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).
The National Stock Exchange (NSE) said it has penalized about 250 companies for violating Sebi’s Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirement Regulations (LODR) 2015.

In market cap terms, APSEZ lost more than  ₹6,100 crore in value, which seems like an overreactionAcquisition rekindled investors’ worries that the group is piggybacking on APSEZ’s financial strength

Shares of Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd (APSEZ) plunged 8.4% on Monday after the company said it will purchase Adani Agri Logistics Ltd from Adani Enterprises Ltd for  ₹945 crore. In market cap terms, APSEZ lost more than  ₹6,100 crore in value, which seems like an overreaction, given the size of the transaction that triggered the fall.
However, the acquisition rekindled investors’ worries that the group is piggybacking on APSEZ’s financial strength.
The transaction has precedence. The sharp rise in loans and advances (purportedly to related parties) undermined APSEZ’s shares in FY16, so much so that the company was valued at a notable discount to its smaller competitor Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd. The company addressed these investor concerns by eventually pulling back those advances, narrowing the valuation gap.
Subsequently, the stock outperformed the broader markets over the past three years. As capital expenditure peaked, the management alluded to its focus on cash flow generation. Even as losses mounted at its group firm Adani Power Ltd, it ruled out any bailout. The transfer of the liquefied natural gas terminals to a joint venture firm is also expected to strengthen its balance sheet.
Against that backdrop, the latest acquisition brings the situation back to square one. Not because APSEZ is paying a premium, or that the acquisition can push up debt levels. However, as analysts at two broking firms pointed out, the transaction with group entities deepens investor scepticism about the usage of funds. “Timing-wise, we think this deal may be viewed with suspicion as Adani Ports’ intention to reward minority shareholders versus group companies with its cash flows will likely be questioned, especially given the market sentiment,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
The acquisition pegs the FY20 enterprise value to Ebitda (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) at 16.8 times, higher than Container Corporation of India Ltd’s 15 times. The current profitability estimates peg the return on capital employed of the target company at sub-10%, which is significantly lower than the 16-18% APSEZ is estimated to generate in the coming two years, showed calculations by Antique Stock Broking Ltd.
Even so, given its small size, the acquisition is expected to have only a marginal impact on APSEZ’s finances. “Our FY20E-21 earnings per share (estimate) sees a marginal downward revision of 1% and return on equity moves lower from 16.9% to 16.7% in FY20E, and from 17.5% to 17.4% in FY21E,"" said Jefferies India. “Net debt equity moves to 0.54 times from 0.48 times in FY20E and to 0.38 times from 0.32 times in FY21E.""
However, as the steep fall in the share price indicates, investors are attaching little importance to the actual financial impact right now. The faster the company moves to rebuild investor confidence the better. “We find the transaction bit overpriced and, that too, with a related party. This will bother investors and can weigh on the stock in near term,"" said analysts at Antique Stock Broking."

Mumbai: Essel Infraprojects Ltd is in talks with infrastructure developers and private equity (PE) companies to sell a part of its roads portfolio, three people close to the development said. 
The Subhash Chandra-controlled company has placed six road projects on the block and is seeking a combined enterprise value of  ₹ 11,500 crore, one of the three people said. The company wants to complete the sale by June, the person added, requesting anonymity.
Selling the roads portfolio will help Essel Group generate funds for setting up a plant to manufacture lithium-ion batteries that are used in electric vehicles. In July, Essel Infra said it would invest  ₹ 1,750 crore in Uttar Pradesh to set up charging stations for electric vehicles and was looking to buy lithium mines outside India.
The second person said Essel Infra has been in talks with several companies, including road developer Cube Highways and Infrastructure, backed by infrastructure fund I Squared Capital; Adani Enterprises, which made its first investments in public infrastructure in 2018; and three Canadian pension funds—Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and Roadis, a highways platform controlled by Canadian pension fund PSP Investments.
An Essel Group spokesperson said the company “confirms the ongoing discussions with all the prospective partners in the ecosystem, pertaining to the divestment of its road portfolio"". 
An Adani Group spokesperson said: “As part of our business growth strategy, we continue to evaluate various opportunities. We will inform all stakeholders if and when something concrete emerges."" A CPPIB spokesperson declined to comment. Emailed queries sent to CDPQ, Cube Highways and Roadis went unanswered till press time.
Essel Infra has 14 road projects in its portfolio, of which six are national highways and the rest state highways, according to the company’s website. 
“Adani and Cube are likely to be the front runners,"" the second person said, requesting anonymity. “Last year, Adani Infra had hired Krishna Prakash Maheshwari as CEO. He used to head Essel Highways earlier and knows the Essel assets well. Adani Group made its first investment in public transport infra last year, with a highway project in Chhattisgarh. Cube has been one of the most active buyers in the roads space in India and had bid the highest for NHAI’s (National Highways Authority of India’s) recent toll-operate-transfer auction. Essel has engaged Ambit Capital to advise on the sale.""
Vijay Agrawal, executive director, Equirus Capital Pvt. Ltd, expects deals in the highways space to be driven by foreign private equity. “Developers are cash-strapped and struggling with financial closure in several of their own projects. I think the trend for 2019 will be developers selling completed assets to PE players to recycle capital."" 
Essel Group was founded in 1926 by Jagannath Goenka and has business interests in media, packaging and infrastructure. Last November, it decided to sell a 50% stake in its media business arm, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, to a global strategic partner. Essel Infra has also been offloading its public infrastructure projects, starting with the sale of four power transmission projects for an enterprise value of  ₹ 6,000 crore to Edelweiss group-backed Sekura Energy Ltd in October. In November, Mint reported that Essel had closed the sale of its solar power projects to private equity investor Actis Llp for  ₹ 5,500 crore. 
Mint reported last week that Essel Group is seeking to raise $400 million in a structured credit transaction to refinance part of its promoter debt."
