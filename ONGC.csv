182,2018-01-01,ONGC,"The ONGC discovery has indicated potential in-place reserves of about 29.74 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) has made a significant oil and gas discovery to the west of its prime Mumbai High fields in the Arabian Sea, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday.  
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) has made a significant oil and gas discovery to the west of its prime Mumbai High fields in the Arabian Sea, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Monday. 
In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, he said the discovery was made in the well WO-24-3 (WO-24-C) drilled west of Mumbai High fields. Though a holiday was declared for Parliament, replies to questions were posted on the Lok Sabha website. 
“Based on the data generated during drilling, 9 objects/zones were identified and on testing all the objects flowed oil/gas,"" he said. The discovery has indicated potential in-place reserves of about 29.74 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas, he said. 
“The 9th object on testing flowed oil at the rate of 3,310 barrels per day and gas at the rate of 17,071 cubic meter per day,"" the minister said. “This multi-layered oil and gas accumulation in this well opened up new area for exploration/development."" Mumbai High, India’s biggest oil field, currently produces 205,000 barrels of oil per day (just over 10 million tonnes per annum) and the new find would add to that production in less than two years’ time. 
ONGC is carrying out a further appraisal of the discovery and has intimated upstream regulator the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH). The new find, which comes almost 50 years after ONGC began production in Mumbai High, will help the company maintain production levels from the basin for a longer time than currently estimated. 
Mumbai High is ONGC’s flagship oil producing assets. It along with other small fields along the western offshore produce 16 million tonnes per annum of oil, which is 44% of India’s total crude oil production of 36 million tonnes. ONGC produced 25.5 million tonnes of oil in 2016-17, which will reach 28-29 million tonnes by 2019-20, officials said."

Mumbai: Two joint ventures of steel baron Lakshmi Niwas Mittal with ONGC Videsh Ltd are shutting shop, documents filed with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) show.
The joint venture partners are Mittal Investments Sarl, the private investment company of the Mittal family, and ONGC Videsh, the overseas exploration and production arm of state-run explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC).
The first venture, ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd (OMEL), has ONGC Videsh holding 49.98% and Mittal Investments 48.02%. SBI Capital Markets holds the balance 2% stake.
The company was formed in 2006 to source equity oil and gas from abroad for securing India’s energy independence.
“The company had no operations for a long time and the board decided to discontinue the operations. It was decided by the board to strike off the name of the company from the register of companies. Accordingly, the financial statements have not been prepared on a going concern basis,"" said the company in its 11th annual report for the year to March 2017, filed with the RoC. 
For the year ended March 2017, OMEL reported a loss of Rs166,623 against a loss of Rs127,000 for the year to March 2016. Closing balance of profit and loss account for 2017 stood at Rs500,000 against Rs333,377 for 2016, according to the report. 
OMEL, through its Nigerian subsidiaries, held participating interests in three Nigerian exploration blocks—OPL-246, OPL-279 and OPL-285. It had also invested in a producing block in Syria. 
OMEL had in November 2006 paid $100 million to win the OPL-246 block in Nigeria. It had paid a signature bonus of $50 million for OPL-285 and $75 million for OPL-279. 
“The Nigerian blocks had been relinquished after unsuccessful exploration efforts and OMEL is shutting down its Nigerian operation and its associated subsidiaries,"" OMEL said in an emailed response. 
OMEL added that the Syrian investment is presently affected by political unrest in Syria and the management is keeping track of the political situation in Syria. 
“The operations in Syria may be resumed once the political and security situation improve in Syria,"" said OMEL. 
The second venture, ONGC Mittal Energy Services Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of OMEL, was to be involved in trading and shipping of oil and gas (including LNG) sourced by OMEL from abroad. 
OMEL in the emailed response added, “At present, this company does not have any operation and may be closed in due course."""

179,2018-01-10,ONGC,"ONGC is set to open a new sedimentary basin in the country as it puts Kutch offshore on the oil and gas map of India

New Delhi: After a gap of over three- decades, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is set to open a new sedimentary basin in the country as it puts Kutch offshore on the oil and gas map of India. Kutch would be India’s eighth sedimentary basin.  
New Delhi: After a gap of over three- decades, state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is set to open a new sedimentary basin in the country as it puts Kutch offshore on the oil and gas map of India. Kutch would be India’s eighth sedimentary basin. 
ONGC had previously opened for commercial production six out of India’s seven producing basins. Cauvery was the last Category-I producing basin which was discovered in 1985. ONGC has made a significant natural gas discovery in the Gulf of Kutch off the west coast, which it plans to bring to production in 2-3 years, senior company officials said. 
India has 26 sedimentary basins, of which only seven have commercial production of oil and gas. Except for the Assam shelf, ONGC opened up for commercial production all the other six basins, including Cambay, Mumbai Offshore, Rajasthan, Krishna Godavari, Cauvery and Assam-Arakan Fold Belt. The discovery in Kutch offshore may hold about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. 
The spread of Kutch offshore basin covers an area of 28000 square kilometres in water depth of up to 200 metres and will become eighth producing basin of the country. Talking about the possibility of adding new basin for production, ONGC director (exploration) A.K. Dwivedi said: “The results are very encouraging and I am sure that this is going to open up many new opportunities"". 
He said several state-of-the-art technologies like broadband seismic acquisition have been used in exploration campaign to acquire more accurate data from the exploration acreages. While congratulating the exploration Team, ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker said, “Our constant efforts will be on looking for new opportunities to replenish our reserves. Our focus is to improve the quality of pre- drilling data through the use of innovative technologies in order to improve the success rate."" Exploration, he said, is the most important value creator for any E&P company worldwide. 
“ONGC will leave no stone unturned to improve success rate from its exploratory campaigns. We are trying to optimize cost as much as possible, both during pre and post exploratory drilling phases,"" he said. However, imbibing most modern technologies as well as conducting a customized training programme for the geoscientists to substantially enhance the quality of data before exploratory drilling starts are needed, he said. 
“This will have a huge positive impact both in short and long run."" In order to go for early monetising of Kutch Offshore, ONGC is looking for pricing support from the Government of India. Since Kutch Offshore is a difficult field, its cost of production is also going to be high. Hence, a matching pricing support is extremely important. 
Officials said the present government-mandated gas price of $2.89 per million British thermal unit does not make the discovery commercially viable. Since the find is in shallow waters, it does not qualify to get the $6.30 per mmBtu cap price set for difficult fields. ONGC, they said, has stepped up the acquisition of 2D and 3D seismic data in a bid to raise production and help cut country’s dependence on imports to meet oil needs by 10% by 2022. 
In 2017, the company acquired around 7000 square kilometre of 3D seismic data. Officials said 37 discoveries have been made in last two years. 17 of these are onland, 18 in shallow water and two are deepsea discoveries. Also, a framework for monetisation of 166 new and small discoveries have been mapped at the Basin and Asset level, they added."

Mumbai: A Pawan Hans helicopter with seven people on-board, including five ONGC officers and two pilots, crashed off the Mumbai coast minutes after it took off for the state-owned company’s oil installation in the Arabian sea. 
So far, five bodies have been recovered, the Coast Guard and the Navy said in their statements. Search operation is on for other missing persons. The Pawan Hans helicopter with five Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) officers, including three of the level of deputy general managers, went missing around 10.40am on Saturday.
ONGC, Coast Guard and Navy pressed helicopters and speed boats as soon as the information of the chopper going missing was received at the Juhu helibase. ONGC has key oil and gas fields off the Mumbai coast and Pawan Hans helicopters routinely ferry company employees and officers to the oil installations that are situated as far as 160km from the coastline. 
The field in the offshore include Mumbai High, the nation’s largest oil field and Bassein fields, the largest gas field. The helicopter crash is not the first accident in ONGC’s history. In August 2003, an Mi-172 helicopter crashed off the Mumbai coast killing 27 people and pilot on-board.
“ONGC vessels and choppers along with the Coast Guard and Indian Navy are combing the areas where the chopper has apparently crashed,"" the ONGC statement read. “Identification of the bodies is in progress,"" it read. The chopper Dauphin N3 went missing after taking off from the Juhu aerodrome. 
The chopper, bearing registration number VT-PWA, was scheduled to land at the designated oil rig at Mumbai High at 11 am. In a statement, the Coast Guard said, “Search teams from ICGS Agrim were able to locate and recover five bodies from water. The floating debris was also recovered by the ship. The search operation for the remaining crew is continuing in coordination with other ships and aircraft from ONGC and the Indian Navy. 
The recovered bodies along with debris have been handed over to ONGC vessel at the crash site for further formalities, it said. “At about 1120 Hrs on 13 January, Headquarters, Coast Guard Region (W) received information from ONGC about a helicopter with seven persons (two pilots and five passengers) missing in position about 22 Nm North West from Uttan Light (16-17 Nm from land). The location falls in the approach/return leg of route taken by ONGC helicopters while proceeding to oil rigs in Mumbai high area,"" it added.
“A Dornier aircraft was immediately launched from Coast Guard Air Station Daman and reached the area for search. Certain debris was reported by the aircraft. Further, Indian Coast Guard Ship (ICGS) Agrim, on patrolling off Mumbai was diverted to the crash site and reached the datum at about 1230 hrs.
“The ship also reported widespread debris in the area and began search for the missing passengers and crew from aircraft,"" it added.
Four more Coast Guard ships based at Mumbai (ICGS Samudra Prahari, ICGS Achook, ICGS C-154 and ICGS C-434) apart from ICGS Agrim were pressed into service and reached the datum to widen the search parameter. Besides, another two Dornier aircraft were deployed from Coast Guard Air Station Daman to augment the search effort, it added. A release from the Navy said, “The naval ships have recovered pieces of debris of the ill-fated helicopter and continue the search for two missing crew members. Five bodies have been recovered so far."" 
The Navy said the two Fast Interceptor Crafts, INS Tarasa and the frigate INS Teg of the Indian Navy joined the rescue effort with diving teams and a Chetak helicopter operating on board INS Teg joined the operation for survivors of the Pawan Hans helicopter. “In addition, Seaking helicopters from INS Shikra and a Dornier recce aircraft from Porbandar have been operating through the day. A P8-I long-range maritime reconnaissance aircraft from INS Rajali near the East Coast has also arrived in the area to assist the search. INS Makar, a naval survey ship with the latest side-scan sonar and underwater cameras has also sailed from Karwar to augment the SAR effort,"" an naval release said.

New Delhi/Mumbai: India is considering a plan to sell its ownership in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to the nation’s biggest explorer at a premium of not more than 9% of the company’s six-month average share price as it seeks to reach a final agreement as early as 31 January, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 
New Delhi/Mumbai: India is considering a plan to sell its ownership in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. to the nation’s biggest explorer at a premium of not more than 9% of the company’s six-month average share price as it seeks to reach a final agreement as early as 31 January, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
Capping the premium will prevent opposition from minority shareholders of HPCL, since the government doesn’t plan to open the offer to the public, and also not burden state-run acquirer Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. An agreement is near completion with the parties working to endorse the valuation, they said.
At the proposed valuation, the sale will help Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration raise as much as Rs36,600 crore ($5.7 billion), that is more than half of its annual asset sale target. The government plans to complete the transaction before 31 March to achieve the $11 billion asset sales target for the current financial year. The stake sale is crucial for narrowing its budget gap that has climbed to Rs6.12 trillion during eight months to November, or 112% of the target.
The HPCL stake sale is unlikely to trigger an open offer as the government’s holding is being transferred to another state-run firm. Under India’s takeover code, if a company acquires more than 25% of another listed entity, it has to make an open offer to buy at least 26% more.
Calls made to finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik went unanswered. ONGC spokesman declined to comment while an email sent to HPCL spokesman remained unanswered.
ONGC will tap the debt market for the first time to fund the acquisition as it is running low on funds after boosting spending on oil and gas exploration amid low output prices. The explorer has sent request for proposals to banks to raise Rs25,000 crore in loans.
ONGC’s board approved the deal on 22 August following the cabinet’s decision to sell the HPCL stake to the explorer.
The acquisition is part of a plan first outlined by finance minister Arun Jaitley while presenting the federal budget in February last year. Bringing HPCL into its fold would make ONGC the nation’s third biggest refiner after Indian Oil Corp. and Reliance Industries Ltd. Bloomberg

Justice Rajiv Shakdhar noted during the proceeding that policy-making by government was a ‘unilateral’ act, which if applied to the PSCs would enable the government to change the terms of the contract unilaterally. 
Cairn India had moved the high court in December 2015 seeking an extension of the PSC. Subsequently, in July 2016, Cairn India and ONGC mutually agreed to extend the PSC for the Barmer block by 10 years under the existing terms and conditions. However, the union cabinet in March 2017 granted extension of 10 years or economic life of the field, whichever is earlier, to PSCs for 10 oil and gas blocks, including the PSC between Cairn India and ONGC for the Barmer block, under different terms and conditions. The new policy mandated higher profit sharing with the government, a no-litigation clause and a compulsory clause on arbitration, among others. 
During the course of hearing, ONGC sided with the government, arguing that the terms and conditions as per the new policy of March 2017 should apply as the mutual agreement to extend the PSC on existing terms was before the new policy came in. 
The PSC between Cairn India and ONGC for the project was signed on 15 May, 1995 for a period of 25 years. While Cairn India operates the block with 70% participating interest, ONGC has the remaining 30%. The Barmer block comprises the Mangala, Bhagyam, Aishwariya and Raageshwari oil and gas fields.
Cairn India is now part of the Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group."
172,2018-01-20,ONGC,"ONGC signs a deal with the President of India to acquire 51.11% stake in HPCL for Rs36,915 crore

New Delhi: State-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) on Saturday signed a deal with the President of India to acquire 51.11% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), a state-run refiner, for Rs36,915 crore, ONGC said in a statement. 
New Delhi: State-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) on Saturday signed a deal with the President of India to acquire 51.11% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), a state-run refiner, for Rs36,915 crore, ONGC said in a statement.
The ONGC board cleared the proposal on Friday to buy 778,845,375 equity shares in HPCL at a cash purchase consideration of Rs473.97 per share. The purchase price is at a premium compared to HPCL’s closing price of Rs416.55 on BSE on Friday. The scrip closed trading 5.5 points or 1.34% up on Friday.
The deal is exempt from a public offer as both the entities are related parties but the transaction involving two listed entities have been carried out on an arms length basis, ONGC said.
ONGC’s acquisition of HPCL will make the explorer a more integrated energy company and is a revenue booster for the government in a fiscally challenged year that saw falling indirect tax revenue and lower dividend receipts from the Reserve Bank of India. On Wednesday, the finance ministry had said that it has pared its additional borrowing requirement for the current fiscal to Rs20,000 crore from Rs50,000 crore as had been estimated earlier.
However, according to a government official, who recently spoke to Mint on condition of anonymity, any revenue receipt to the exchequer from the transaction was only incidental and the goal was to create an integrated energy company as articulated in budget 2017-18.
HPCL, which has refineries in Mumbai and Vishakhapatnam and a joint venture refinery in at Bhatinda with Mittal Energy Ltd, markets around 35 million tonne of petroleum products with a market share of about 21%. HPCL is also a leading lubricant marketer.
“The acquisition has been undertaken in furtherance of the government’s objective to combine the various central public sector enterprises to give them capacity to bear higher risks, avail of economies of scale, take higher investment decisions and create more value for the stakeholders and create an ‘oil major’ which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies,"" said the ONGC statement echoing the objective for the deal as announced by finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech last February.
“There is synergy between the assets of ONGC and HPCL and the transaction will deliver value to the acquirer in the medium to long term,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice president and group head-corporate ratings at Icra Ltd.
SBI Capital Markets Ltd and Citi Global acted as transaction advisors, and Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas acted as the legal advisor to ONGC."
171,2018-01-20,ONGC,"With its stake sale in HPCL, the government's disinvestment receipt will work out to be Rs91,252.6 crore

New Delhi: The government is all set to cross annual disinvestment target this fiscal for the first time with Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) buying the centre’s entire 51% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) for Rs36,915 crore.  
New Delhi: The government is all set to cross annual disinvestment target this fiscal for the first time with Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) buying the centre’s entire 51% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) for Rs36,915 crore. 
Total disinvestment proceeds during the current financial year 2017-18 stood at Rs54,337.60 crore (as on 11 January). With its stake sale in HPCL, the government’s disinvestment receipt will work out to be Rs91,252.6 crore. The higher receipt from disinvestment will help the government in sticking to its fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of the GDP this financial year, which may see lower collections from the newly introduced goods and services tax (GST).
In the Union Budget presented on 1 February last year, finance minister Arun Jaitley had set the target of disinvestment in public sector units at Rs72,500 crore. This include Rs46,500 crore as disinvestment of CPSEs, Rs15,000 crore from strategic disinvestment and Rs11,000 crore from listing of insurance companies. 
The government reduced its stake in several PSUs this year, including HUDCO, EIL, NTPC, Nalco and Oil India Ltd. Two state-owned insurance companies, GIC and New India Assurance were listed on stock exchanges this fiscal. 
In the last fiscal, the government had raised a record Rs46,247 crore. In the budget for 2016-17, it had set a target of Rs56,500 crore from disinvestment. Later in the Revised Estimates, the target was scaled down to Rs45,000 crore. 
State-owned ONGC on Saturday announced acquisition of the government’s entire 51.11% stake in oil refiner HPCL for Rs36,915 crore, paying a premium of over 10%. Earlier in the month, the government had announced to curtail its additional market borrowing programme by 60% to Rs20,000 crore. 
The decision to lower additional borrowing, which was taken after a review of revenue receipts and expenditure, will help contain fiscal deficit that has come under stress on account of lower GST mop up. In the budget, the government had announced the fiscal deficit target for fiscal ending March 2018 at 3.2% of the GDP."

New Delhi: State-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) is looking at raising debt and selling some of its shareholding in other public sector companies to finance its Rs36,915 crore acquisition of a 51.11% stake in state-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (HPCL). 
New Delhi: State-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) is looking at raising debt and selling some of its shareholding in other public sector companies to finance its Rs36,915 crore acquisition of a 51.11% stake in state-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. (HPCL).
ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker said the company will decide the most economical way of fund raising to conclude the deal by the end of January. 
“We have cash balance with us. We have some liquid assets also (cross-holding in other state-owned companies). That is worth about Rs25,000-30,000 crore. Simultaneously, what we have done is that we have tied up short-term borrowing at a very competitive rate. When we have to make the payment (for the acquisition), we will look at all these options and whichever is the most economical for us, we will exercise that,"" said Shanker.
ONGC has a cash balance of about Rs13,000 crore and holds a 13.77% stake in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and 4.86% in GAIL India Ltd.
Shanker said that since the company wanted more flexibility in its funding options, it has raised borrowing limits to Rs35,000 crore from the Rs25,000 crore decided earlier. 
He also ruled out fire sale of any liquid assets to finance the transaction.
After concluding the deal, ONGC will retain HPCL’s identity but explore synergies between the refiner and ONGC’s subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL).
“HPCL is a very professionally run company. It will continue the way it has been functioning. In our group, we have MRPL in the downstream sector. We can leverage their synergy. If we source crude oil together for MRPL and HPCL, we will have better bargaining power,"" said Shanker. 
ONGC’s acquisition of HPCL, announced on Saturday, is exempt from a public offer as both entities are related parties.
The deal is intended to make ONGC a more integrated energy company. It will also be a revenue booster for the government in a fiscally challenging year.
HPCL, which has refineries in Mumbai and Visakhapatnam and a joint venture refinery at Bhatinda with Mittal Energy Ltd, markets around 35 million tonnes of petroleum products with a market share of about 21%. HPCL is also a leading lubricant marketer."

Rs36,915 crore
What is it? The amount that Oil and Natural Gas Corp. will pay to acquire the government’s 51.1% stake in refiner and marketer HPCL (Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd) in an all-cash deal.
Why is it important? It would create an oil company that is more integrated across the value chain and can compete better with global rivals. This would also help the government exceed its disinvestment target for the current fiscal, when it has seen a fall in its indirect tax revenue and received lower dividends from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). This is likely to help the government achieve its fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of the GDP (gross domestic product).
Tell me more: ONGC would buy 77.9 crore shares in HPCL at Rs473.97 apiece, a premium of 13.7% over its closing price on Friday, and it might need to raise debt to do so.
20
What is it? The number of members of legislative assembly of Delhi’s ruling party, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), whose disqualification was sought by the Election Commission (EC) on Friday for holding offices of profit.
Why is it important? President Ram Nath Kovind accepted the EC’s recommendation on Sunday and AAP is likely to take the legal route for reprieve. Bypolls for these 20 seats will have to be held within six months. Although the disqualification does not pose an immediate threat to Delhi’s ruling party, which has 66 legislators in the 70-member Delhi assembly, this may weaken the party’s prospects after a string of losses in recent elections. 
Tell me more: After Arvind Kejriwal’s AAP swept the Delhi assembly polls in 2015, winning 67 of 70 seats, his government passed an order to appoint 20 legislators as parliamentary secretaries to ministers, which was described as them holding offices of profit by a lawyer who sent a petition to then President Pranab Mukherjee.

Why is it important? This is among the primary steps to lower maternal mortality rate (MMR) and infant mortality rate (IMR). Although both have declined in recent years, India still has some way to go to catch up with developed nations. India’s MMR was 174 per 100,000 live births in 2015; or, 45,000 mothers died to due to causes related to childbirth, which was 17% of such deaths globally. Its IMR was 41 per 1,000 live births in 2015-16, down from 57 in 2005-06.
Tell me more: About one-fourth of checkups under the programme were done in high-priority districts that called for immediate attention. Based on individual needs, 84 lakh haemoglobin tests, 55 lakh HIV tests, 41 lakh tests for gestational diabetes, 33 lakh tests for syphilis and over 15 lakh ultrasound scans were done to detect high-risk pregnancies.

This year’s WEF event, which is themed “creating a shared future in a fractured world"", will also see the presence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump.

Tell me more: Of the 16 ODIs played by Australia since January 2017, they have won only three, while losing 10 (three matches were no results), raising many questions around their readiness of their defence of the ODI World Cup in 2019.

169,2018-01-22,ONGC,"ONGC's HPCL acquisition will help the government comfortably achieve its disinvestment target for 2017-18

The Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) deal has left the government with a big smirk on its face. After all, the deal consideration of Rs473.97 per share, amounting to Rs36,915 crore that ONGC will shell out for a 51% stake in HPCL, will help the government comfortably achieve its divestment target for this fiscal. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this month. 
The Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) deal has left the government with a big smirk on its face. After all, the deal consideration of Rs473.97 per share, amounting to Rs36,915 crore that ONGC will shell out for a 51% stake in HPCL, will help the government comfortably achieve its divestment target for this fiscal. The transaction is expected to close by the end of this month.
The acquisition price is at a 13.8% premium to HPCL’s closing share price on Friday. Still, ONGC investors are likely to heave a sigh of relief. That’s because the Street was expecting a significant premium compared to what has come through and by that logic, it’s a disappointment for HPCL shareholders. 
Secondly, ONGC will not have to make an open offer, which will reduce the additional stress on its pockets.
It’s crucial how ONGC funds the deal, details of which are not yet out. ONGC has the option of monetizing its stakes in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) or Gail (India) Ltd. Still, consolidated debt is expected to increase.
As of 31 March, ONGC’s consolidated debt stood at Rs55,681 crore, translating into debt-to-equity of 0.25 times. IDFC Securities Ltd estimates ONGC group debt (including the $1.2 billion for Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd’s Krishna-Godavari assets and $2.2 billion for Russia’s Vankor field) could rise substantially if it buys the 51% stake in HPCL by raising debt and by not monetizing its ~14% stake in IOCL. The adjacent chart has details. 
On a standalone basis, the deal is expected to turn its net cash balance sheet into net debt one.
Nevertheless, analysts expect the deal to be earnings accretive for ONGC. This column wrote earlier that for integrated oil companies, a lot depends on oil price levels and how best companies are able to hedge against price movements. For example, there have been times when refining companies have been able to perform comparatively better when crude oil prices dropped, as refining margins remained sturdy. ONGC could look to potentially reap benefits from such instances.
HPCL will not see much of an impact owing to this deal. “For HPCL, specifically, the transaction changes little on ground, with the company retaining its independent identity and only direct ownership changing hands,"" pointed out Probal Sen of IDFC Securities in a report on 21 January.
What of the stocks?
ONGC shares have been suffering from the overhang of this deal and also fears about rising subsidies. With the deal price at a lower than expected premium, some of those worries are likely to recede. What this means is investor focus will now shift to earnings and firmer crude prices mean outlook on that front is rosy. Investors would do well to follow the production trajectory as well.
For HPCL, recent pressures on marketing margin may weigh on sentiment. Plus benchmark Singapore refining margins have been sequentially lower during the December quarter. In the last three months, the HPCL stock has fallen by a tenth."

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has received approval from the government to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and GAIL India Ltd to help fund the Rs36,915 crore acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL). 
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has received approval from the government to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and GAIL India Ltd to help fund the Rs36,915 crore acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL).
ONGC holds a 13.77% stake in nation’s biggest refiner IOC, which at Tuesday’s trading price is worth over Rs26,200 crore. It also holds 4.86% stake in gas utility GAIL, which is worth over Rs3,847 crore.
Top sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the government gave ONGC nod to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL earlier this month but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.
Currently, ONGC is funding the acquisition of government’s 51.11% stake in oil refining and marketing firm HPCL from the about Rs12,000 crore cash it has and short- term borrowing. Sources said ONGC is a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status.
The short-term loan it is availing have provision to pre-pay without any penalty. It plans to pre-pay the one-year tenure loan it is taking for HPCL buy by selling IOC and GAIL shares in due course, they said.
Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state- owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10% discount to the prevailing price. So, ONGC has decided to offload the shares in open market.
ONGC’s purchase of HPCL would create India’s first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs7,738 crore acquisition of 80% stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.’s KG basin gas block.
ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company’s board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from Rs25,000 crore to Rs35,000 crore. This will be the company’s first ever debt.
“We will use our (Rs12,000-13,000 crore) cash first and then the liquid assets and debt will be last,"" Shanker had said. “This order can change, because we won’t sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over Rs50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.""
Shanker had said the company paid less than the acquisition price recommended by the company’s valuation adviser, Ernst and Young (EY). He, however, refused to share details.
The Rs473.97 per share ONGC is paying to the government is 14% higher than Friday’s closing price of HPCL and over 10% of the 60-day weighted average of the HPCL scrip. Sources said while the government was seeking as much as Rs69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL’s valuation at Rs475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at Rs500 per share.
The stake sale will help the government cross its sell- off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of gross domestic product. The government had set a target of Rs72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected Rs54,337.60 crore.
HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries Ltd. ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million tonne refinery.
At 2.03pm, ONGC shares traded 3.75% up at Rs207.45 on BSE, whereas HPCL shares fell 1.47% to Rs395.85. The Sensex was up 0.86% at 36,104.42 points."

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised its growth forecast for the world economy to 3.9% each in 2018 and 2019, up 0.2 percentage points from its October 2017 projections. It has attributed half of the upgrade to recent tax cuts by the US, whose GDP growth projections have been increased by IMF by 0.4 percentage points and 0.6 percentage points for 2018 and 2019, respectively. The IMF retained India’s growth forecasts at 7.4% for 2018 and 7.8% for 2019, making it the fastest-growing among emerging economies.
4. China, India least attractive emerging markets in 2018
Despite holding the mantle of being two of the fastest-growing economies around, India and China are currently languishing at the bottom as investment propositions due to valuations, according to a Bloomberg analysis of 20 emerging markets. Besides growth, the analysis considered metrics such as yields, current-account position and asset valuations. It said that valuations of China and India are “relatively expensive in historical terms"", and that their economic growth is unlikely to be as fast as in the previous decade. Mexico and Turkey topped the list.

Mumbai: Rating agency Moody’s on Tuesday affirmed the ratings for state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) as ‘stable’ following the oil major’s recent acquisition of majority shareholding in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL).  
Mumbai: Rating agency Moody’s on Tuesday affirmed the ratings for state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) as ‘stable’ following the oil major’s recent acquisition of majority shareholding in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL). 
The transaction remains subject to requisite approvals from the shareholders of ONGC. ONGC has acquired 51.11% equity stake in HPCL from the centre for a consideration of Rs36,915 crore to be paid in cash by 31 January this year.
“Moody’s Investors Service, affirmed Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd’s (ONGC) ‘Baa1’ local and foreign currency issuer ratings, and the ‘Baa1’ ratings on the senior unsecured bonds issued by ONGC Videsh Ltd and ONGC Videsh Vankorneft Pte Ltd, both guaranteed by ONGC,"" the rating agency said. “The outlook on all ratings is stable,"" it added. 
ONGC’s ‘Baa1’ issuer ratings are primarily driven by its standalone credit profile. Moody’s noted that ratings reflects ONGC’s position as the only integrated oil and gas company in India with significant reserves, production and crude distillation capacity, post the acquisition. Besides, it also incorporates substantial operating cash flow generation capacity as well as weakened but still appropriate credit metrics for its ratings following the HPCL acquisition. 
Further, Moody’s expects that the company will not be asked to share fuel subsidies as long as the oil prices stay below $60-65 per barrel. “The rating outlook is stable reflecting Moody’s expectation that the company will lower its borrowings through sale of stake in IOC and GAIL,"" the agency said. 
“Further, the stable outlook also incorporates our expectation of benign oil price environment and that the company’s growth plan will continue to be executed within the tolerance level of its current ratings,"" it added. However, the agency noted that likelihood of a ratings upgrade for ONGC in the next 12 -18 months remains low given the high leverage. 
Moody’s said that ONGC may finance HPCL equity stake will be funded by up to  ₹ 5,000 crore of incremental borrowings, with the balance being cash on hand. “The payment of acquisition price will result in ONGC’s net borrowings increasing by  ₹ 36,915 crore, irrespective of the mix of debt and cash used for such payment,"" it said.
Accordingly, post-acquisition, ONGC’s proforma net borrowings for the fiscal year ending March 2018 will increase to Rs1,26,500 crore as against Rs47,200 crore without the acquisition. It can be noted, post-acquisition the ONGC board had approved fresh debt raising of Rs35,000 crore. “ONGC’s proforma credit metrics for fiscal 2018 will also weaken with retained cash flow/net debt declining to 28 per cent from 68 per cent without the acquisition,"" the agency said."
159,2018-02-05,ONGC,"ONGC which planned to produce gas from a deep water block in the Krishna-Godavari basin from June 2019 won't produce first gas until at least the second half of 2020

Mumbai/New Delhi:Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) is facing a delay of at least a year in starting production from its biggest project, according to people with knowledge of the matter. 
Mumbai/New Delhi:Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) is facing a delay of at least a year in starting production from its biggest project, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The nation’s top explorer, which planned to produce gas from a deep water block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off the country’s east coast from June 2019, won’t produce first gas until at least the second half of 2020, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. Oil production will start a year after gas. ONGC hasn’t completed tendering for major equipment and services for the $5 billion project, they said.
Production from the KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Bay of Bengal, where the depth of water is comparable to ultra-deep fields in the Gulf of Mexico, is critical to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s goal of cutting India’s oil imports and doubling the share of gas in the country’s energy mix to 15%. Speeding up new developments is also vital for ONGC as it faces declining production from older fields. It plans to spend Rs11 trillion ($173 billion) by 2030 to raise output.
The delay in finalizing tenders means the company won’t start to drill wells in the block until next year. Hostile weather conditions in the area allow drilling for only about half the year. An ONGC spokesman was unable to comment on Monday.
ONGC might be able start gas production in the later half of 2020 if it finalizes contracts soon, the people said. State-run ONGC is looking to contract as many as five deepwater drill ships and dozens of jack-up rigs for its drilling program in the block.
Reliance Industries Ltd, which produces gas from an adjoining area, has seen production tumble more than 92% since hitting a peak in 2010. The Indian company and its partner, BP Plc, found the reservoir more difficult to produce from than they had initially estimated.
ONGC aims to produce 15 million standard cubic meters a day of gas and 77,000 barrels a day of oil from the block.
The company was engaged in the past year with the acquisition of a controlling stake in state refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. and arranging debt to finance the deal. The $5.78 billion acquisition was finalized this month. Bloomberg"

New Delhi: Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to sell its holding in two state-run energy companies within a year to repay debt it raised to fund the purchase of the Indian government’s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The state-run explorer may sell shares of Indian Oil Corp. and GAIL India Ltd in multiple transactions on the open market through the year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. ONGC has already received the approval of the government and is waiting for the right price to begin offloading the shares, they said.
The sales can help ONGC return to its debt-free status, give it greater flexibility to acquire overseas oil and gas assets and invest in projects to boost output. ONGC holds 13.77% stake in Indian Oil, the nation’s biggest refiner, and 4.83% in its largest gas utility, GAIL. The holdings can fetch over $4.8 billion at current market rates, covering almost 90% of the loans taken by the New Delhi-based driller.
ONGC raised one-year bridge loans worth Rs35,000 crore ($5.4 billion) from seven banks to partly fund the Rs36,900 crore purchase of the government’s holding in HPCL. It tapped the debt market for the first time last month and can pay off its entire loan if it uses part of its Rs13,000 crore of cash reserves.
ONGC rose as much as 3.3% and traded 2.9% higher at Rs190.80 as of 2:55pm in Mumbai on Wednesday. Indian Oil climbed as much as 2.2% to trade 0.9% higher at Rs405.
An ONGC spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday. Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik wasn’t immediately available for comment.
“We will use our cash balance first and then liquid assets. Debt will be last,"" ONGC chairman Shashi Shanker had said on 22 January, while announcing the HPCL deal that was completed on 31 January. “We will take a call on selling if the market is favourable, but we won’t sell anything in distress.""

New Delhi: A consortium of Indian companies led by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC)’s overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, has bought a 10% stake in the UAE’s offshore oil and gas field Zakum, as India pursues overseas hydrocarbon assets while oil-rich nations resort to ways of reducing risk and balancing their budget deficits. 
New Delhi: A consortium of Indian companies led by state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC)’s overseas arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, has bought a 10% stake in the UAE’s offshore oil and gas field Zakum, as India pursues overseas hydrocarbon assets while oil-rich nations resort to ways of reducing risk and balancing their budget deficits.
ONGC Videsh said late on Saturday night that the Indian side will pay a sign-up bonus of $600 million as part of the deal inked in Abu Dhabi between company executives and UAE officials in the presence of visiting Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Abu Dhabi crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
The deal gives the Indian consortium, which includes Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd’s overseas arm Bharat PetroResources Ltd, access to about two million tonnes of annual share from the field which produces about 400,000 barrels of oil a day.
Backed by diplomatic efforts, Indian energy companies have been aggressively pursuing a share in the world’s most prolific oil and gas fields. In 2016, Indian Oil, Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources had bought stakes in two assets in Siberia owned by Russia’s state-backed PJSC Rosneft Oil Co. for $3.3 billion.
Although global oil prices have been rising recently, it is far below the $100-plus levels seen three years ago, forcing many oil-rich nations to narrow their budget deficits by selling assets and diversifying into non-oil sectors of the economy. US exporters stepping up their supplies is also helping to reduce the effectiveness of the supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), aimed at propping up prices. The UAE is a member of Opec.
“The trend in upstream oil and gas projects is to take a consortium approach which helps in mitigating the risk. Besides, building good relationship between the two nations is also a motivation for the deal,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and group head, corporate ratings, at Icra Ltd.
In a statement, ONGC Videsh said the stake acquisition in Zakum is the first time that Indian oil and gas companies have been given a stake in the development of Abu Dhabi’s hydrocarbon resources. The deal has a term of 40 years.
“We are hopeful that this historic agreement will lead to further opportunities for Indian oil and gas companies to participate in the UAE’s energy sector,"" the statement said, citing chairman Shashi Shanker."

Kochi: An explosion and fire on an ONGC drill ship while it was undergoing repair at the Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) left five people dead and seven injured on Tuesday, the CSL said. 
The explosion occurred in a front tank of the ONGC vessel Sagar Bhushan at 9.15 am. It could have been due to “gas consolidation (inside the tank)"", CSL chairman and managing director Madhu S. Nair said, citing immediate reason for the blast. 
He, however, said that the exact reasons would be known only after a detailed investigation. Firefighters were called in and 12 persons were immediately evacuated from the ship following the blast and admitted to various hospitals. 
In a statement, the CSL said that five people died and seven were injured in the fire incident. The condition of one person who suffered 45% burns was serious. Others are out of danger, Nair said. 
The CSL said that “at around 0915 on Tuesday, a phone call was received at CSL informing that there is a gas leakage near the AC compartment area of the ship MODU Sagar Bhushan, undergoing repair in the drydock No 1"". 
“Immediate instruction was passed on to stop all the hot works. By this time explosion had occurred in the forward area of ship, near to the AC plant. Immediately a fire tender rushed to the ship along with ambulance,"" it said. 
Fire men onboard the ship immediately started firefighting and the fire tender joined them for the fire fighting from the Aft area, it said. 
The deceased were identified as CSL senior fireman Unnikrishnan C.S, short term contract employee safety assistant Gevin, contract fire watchman K.B. Jayan and two employees of a contract firm—Ramshad M.M. and Kannan M.V., Nair said. 
CSL has announced an immediate ex gratia of Rs10 lakh for the kin of the deceased. All treatment expenses of the injured will be met by the company as per the existing policies, the company said. 
“Besides this, all statutory obligations will be followed to support the victims’ families,"" Nair told reporters here. 
He said CSL has begun a high level internal inquiry into the incident. Detailed technical investigations will be carried out by DG Shipping and Factories and Boilers Department. 
City police commissioner M.P. Dinesh visited the accident site and said those trapped on the ship were evacuated and the situation was under control now. 
Police said smoke inhalation is suspected to be the reason for the casualties. Union minister for road transport and highways, shipping and water resources Nitin Gadkari expressed shock over the loss of lives in blast. 
“Shocked by unfortunate blast at Cochin Shipyard... My heartfelt condolences to bereaved families. I have spoken to MD, Cochin Shipyard n asked him to provide all necessary medical support to victims n to initiate immed inquiry with help of concerned agencies (sic),"" he tweeted. 
Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan condoled the death of the five persons in the blast. In a Facebook post, he said directions have been issued to conduct rescue operations and provide urgent medical care to those injured in the blast.

152,2018-02-18,ONGC,"OVL is one of the 34 companies Iran pre-qualified last year for development of South Azadegan field, which contains an estimated 33 billion barrels of oil in place

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), will bid for development rights of Iran’s giant South Azadegan Oilfield in direct competition with the likes of global giants like Shell, France’s Total, Petronas of Malaysia and Russia’s Gazprom.  
New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), will bid for development rights of Iran’s giant South Azadegan Oilfield in direct competition with the likes of global giants like Shell, France’s Total, Petronas of Malaysia and Russia’s Gazprom. 
OVL will also rework the $6.2 billion cost of developing the Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf, which it had discovered a decade back, to get Iran to award rights of the field to it, sources privy to the development said. 
OVL is one of the 34 companies Iran pre-qualified last year for development of South Azadegan field, which contains an estimated 33 billion barrels of oil in place, of which 6 billion barrels are deemed recoverable. The field currently produces about 80,000 barrels of oil per day (4 million tonnes per annum) and output is envisaged to touch 320,000 barrels a day (16 million tonnes). 
People privy of the development said OVL will make a formal bid when National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) opens a tender for developing the South Azadegan oilfield. 
Other firms prequalified include Japan’s Inpex Corp, China’s CNPC, Eni of Italy, Sinopec of China and Russia’s Gazprom, Lukoil and Rosneft. 
They said OVL had last year made its ‘best’ offer to invest $11 billion in developing the Farzad-B field as well as in building the infrastructure to export the gas but Iran has deterred awarding the rights of the field to the Indian firm owing to differences over pricing of the fuel. 
With the deal on the verge of collapsing, OVL has offered to do just the upstream part of bringing the field to production while leaving the marketing of the fuel to Iran, they said, adding that the upstream part is to cost $6.2 billion while another $5 billion will be required to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility.
Iran believes the upstream investment should not be more than $5.5 billion. Farzad B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The field in the Farsi block has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 trillion cubic feet, of which 12.5 tcf are recoverable. 
On Saturday, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan held talks with his visiting Iranian counterpart Bijan Namdar Zangeneh where he pressed for a stake for Indian companies in a producing oilfield and promised to raise crude oil import from the Persian Gulf nation in the year beginning April to reverse the reductions introduced in the current fiscal. 
Zangeneh said he was “optimistic"" about signing of an agreement awarding rights of Iran’s giant Farzad-B gas field to its discoverer, OVL. 
A team of officials led by OVL will be visiting Tehran this week to renegotiate terms. He said Indian public and private sector oil companies will in 2018-19 fiscal buy 0.5 million barrels of crude oil per day (25 million tonnes). This will be 25% more than current fiscal imports estimated at 370,000 barrels per day (18.5 million tonnes). 
India had for the current fiscal cut oil imports from Iran by nearly 25% over delays in award of Farzad-B development rights to OVL. 
In 2016-17, India had imported 510,000 barrels per day (25.5 million tonnes) of oil from Iran. 
Pradhan said Iran has given “good incentives"" on crude oil exports to India. “It will be beneficial for India to buy more crude from Iran rather than from other countries. We have agreed that India will buy more crude oil from Iran in coming days."" 
Like the recent acquisition of 10% stake in 20 million tonnes a year producing oil field in UAE, India made a case for a stake in a producing Iranian oil field, he said, adding that on Indian horizon was a field like South Azadegan. 
“The deadlock we had on the viability of Farzad-B block, its size of capex, return, timeline, we discussed all the three issues. We have exchanged our positions. Next week our business delegation will go to Tehran to discuss all these issues,"" he said. 
The two sides, he said, decided to remove “all the bottlenecks on all the three issues. On the capex, business model and timeline. We have decided today to reopen and re-engage on all three issues again."""
151,2018-02-21,ONGC,"Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had in November 2017 proposed to sell a 60% stake in ONGC and Oil India fields to private exploration firms as a production enhancement measure

Mumbai/New Delhi: Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) may be rethinking its plan to sell 60% stake in hydrocarbon blocks held by Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), two people familiar with the development said. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) may be rethinking its plan to sell 60% stake in hydrocarbon blocks held by Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), two people familiar with the development said.
Last November, as a production enhancement measure, DGH had proposed to sell a 60% stake in the hydrocarbon fields of ONGC and OIL to private exploration firms. The two firms would retain the rest 40%. The plan included 15 blocks—11 of ONGC and four of OIL. 
ONGC officials have been protesting against the idea.
“We have written a detailed mail to the DGH providing data to them concerning the fields in question. We have asked them why is there a proposal and need to give 60% in these fields to private players as we have been producing from these fields for last three decades. We have been given to understand that the DGH is re-thinking on the plan,"" said an ONGC official, one of the two cited above, on condition of anonymity.
The official added that if such a sale takes place, operational control of the fields would go to private firms.
Mails sent to ONGC and the DGH on 15 February remained unanswered. 
“At the moment, there is no policy on selling ONGC assets to private players. Every national government considers strategies to enhance production from time to time. However, there is no plan to sell ONGC assets to private players on the anvil,"" said the second person mentioned above, a DGH official, who too spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
In a letter to PM Narendra Modi on 23 November 2017, the Association of Scientific and Technical Officers (ASTO) of ONGC said the oil and gas fields in question have been discovered, developed and operated by ONGC for 30 years, and that the decision to sell stake in them may have lasting consequences on the health and future growth of ONGC. 
“After 30 years of production, output from these fields will naturally show a dip from peak levels and, thus, cannot be termed under-performers,"" ASTO’s president (central working committee), Sanjay Goel had written in the letter. 
According to the ONGC official mentioned above, the fields shortlisted by DGH include some of its prolific blocks—Kalol, Ankleshwar, Gandhar, Santhal, Jhalora, Sagara, Vasna, Padra, Rudrasagar and Bhuvanagiri. Most of these are in Gujarat.
ONGC has lined up investments of around $11 billion to raise its gas production by nearly 30% over the next three-four years.
The idea of farming out stakes in ONGC and Oil India’s fields stem from the fact that the government aims to cut oil imports by 10% by 2022. This could be achieved through enhanced hydrocarbon output by domestic companies both public and private.
Since consumption of fossil fuels has been increasing in line with the economic growth rate, the government has been exploring ways to develop markets for alternative fuels including methanol, as well as to create an ecosystem for electric mobility. It has often spoke of India moving to an all-electric fleet by 2030.

150,2018-02-21,ONGC,"ONGC is set to hire US oil service giants Halliburton, Schlumberger and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes to boost output from domestic oil fields in push to increase local supplies and cut expensive imports

Mumbai: India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp is set to hire international oil service giants for the first time to boost output from domestic oil fields in response to a government push to increase local supplies and cut expensive imports. 
Mumbai: India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp is set to hire international oil service giants for the first time to boost output from domestic oil fields in response to a government push to increase local supplies and cut expensive imports.
ONGC, India’s biggest explorer, has short-listed US oil service companies Halliburton, Schlumberger and GE subsidiary Baker Hughes to submit proposals on boosting production from two onshore fields, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The three companies have until May to submit their proposals for what ONGC is calling a “production enhancement contract"" for an oilfield in Assam state and another in Gujarat.
“The shortlist is ready. We will now share our data on the two fields with these companies,"" an ONGC executive said.
The executive — who did not wish to be named as ONGC has yet to make an official announcement — said the final contract is likely to be awarded by May.
Emails to Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes requesting comment on their participation were unanswered outside of US business hours.
Soaring demand, struggling output
The government last September proposed selling a 60% stake in ONGC’s producing fields to foreign companies to ramp up domestic oil and gas output and meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s target of cutting oil imports 10% by 2022.
India’s oil production has stalled below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent years, even as oil demand has surged. That has resulted in its crude oil imports soaring, making it the world’s third-biggest importer, behind China and the United States. In January, India’s imports hit a record of almost 5 million bpd.
ONGC, which the government hopes to eventually build into a global giant like Exxon Mobil or a state-owned oil major like PetroChina, has often been criticized by analysts and New Delhi for failing to increase its production.
ONGC’s output — most of it from fields that have been operating for more than 30 years —is declining at the rate of 7 to 8% a year. A major part of the company’s capital expenditure is spent in efforts to pump more oil and gas to set off the yearly decline.
For the fiscal year ended 31 March 2017, ONGC’s standalone crude oil production stood at 20.855 million metric tonnes (417,000 bpd), a one percent fall from the previous year.
Once the final contractor is chosen in May, the winning service company will be responsible for maintaining production at current levels, and also for boosting output incrementally from the two mature fields, the ONGC executive said.
“We will reimburse the operational expenses incurred and share some pre-determined amount on each barrel of incremental crude that the contractor will produce,"" the executive said.
Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes will get access to ONGC’s data rooms pertaining to its Kalol field in Gujarat and the Geleki field in Assam before submitting a final bid, according to the bidding document.
ONGC might replicate the model for other fields if this pilot exercise is a success, the executive said.
ONGC explored a similar move in 2016 and had signed agreements with Halliburton and Schlumberger aimed at enhancing production, but the agreements were later cancelled, according to reports in local media. Reuters"
149,2018-02-25,ONGC,"ONGC Videsh has shelved plans to build a $5 billion LNG export facility in Iran and has instead opted to only invest in developing a giant gas field in the Persian Gulf

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd has shelved plans to build a $5 billion LNG export facility in Iran and has instead opted to only invest in developing a giant gas field in the Persian Gulf, for which a revised cost is being worked out, an official said.  
New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd has shelved plans to build a $5 billion LNG export facility in Iran and has instead opted to only invest in developing a giant gas field in the Persian Gulf, for which a revised cost is being worked out, an official said. 
ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had last year made its ‘best’ offer to spend $11 billion in developing the Farzad-B field in the Persian Gulf as well as in building the infrastructure to export the gas but Iran deterred on awarding the rights of the field to the Indian firm owing to differences over investments and price of gas. 
The company has now agreed to do just the upstream field development part, leaving the marketing of the fuel to Iran, the official said. As had been agreed during the visit of Iranian President Hassam Rouhani earlier this month, a team of ONGC Videsh officials will be visiting Tehran this week to discuss modalities of the upstream development. 
“We had initially thought that the upstream field development would cost $6.2 billion. But, this is not the final cost. We will be able to arrive at a final cost only after we do at least well to appraise the discovery we had made about a decade back,"" he said. 
Only after the appraisal well is drilled and data analysed to see the extent of the field and recoverable reserves can a final cost be put, he said, adding that ONGC Videsh would put forth the idea of being allowed to drill an appraisal well on the field. The appraisal well, he said, may take 9-10 months to be drilled and completed. Farzad-B was discovered by ONGC Videsh in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. 
The project has so far cost the ONGC Videsh-led consortium, which also includes Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corp (IOC), over $80 million. The field has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 trillion cubic feet, of which 12.5 Tcf are believed to be recoverable. The official said the field as high sulphur content and separate facility would be needed to separate gas from it. 
Costs of these facilities can be established only after appraisal well is drilled. In the master development plan ONGC Videsh submitted to Iran last year, it estimated the upstream part to cost $6.2 billion while another $5 billion will be required to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export facility. While Iran believes the upstream investment should not be more than $5.5 billion, it wanted India to buy all of the natural gas produced from the Persian Gulf block at a price equivalent to the rate Qatar charges for selling LNG to India under a long-term deal. 
Qatar, as per a revised formula agreed upon in December 2015, sells 7.5 million tonnes a year of LNG to Petronet LNG Ltd—India’s biggest gas importer—at a price of $7-plus per million British thermal unit. The rate being sought by Iran was triple of $2.3 per mmBtu rate ONGC Videsh is willing to pay for the gas during low global oil prices. If global rates rise, ONGC Videsh was willing to pay $4.3 per mmBtu, the official said. 
ONGC Videsh, he said, was willing to negotiate on the upstream cost but wants Iran to take up the marketing of the fuel, including building of LNG terminal, if it believes it can get a better price for the natural gas elsewhere. India and Iran were initially targeting concluding a deal on Farzad-B field development by November 2016 but later mutually agreed to push the timeline to February 2017. 
The deadline to wrap up negotiations later targeted for September 2017. But, with deal stuck over pricing of gas, no new deadlines have been proposed. Last year, India cut Iranian crude oil imports by about a quarter to 18.5 million tonnes in 2017-18 fiscal to put pressure on Tehran to quickly wrap up negotiations. It has so far not finalised the volumes it will buy in 2018-19 fiscal."
148,2018-02-27,ONGC,"Core Offshore had dragged ONGC to court saying that its tender was accepted by the state-owned firm but later cancelled without giving it an opportunity to present its case

The Bombay High Court has ruled in favour of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) after a vendor sued the energy firm for cancelling a Rs1,000 crore contract. 
The Bombay High Court has ruled in favour of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) after a vendor sued the energy firm for cancelling a Rs1,000 crore contract.
Core Offshore Services Pvt. Ltd had dragged ONGC to court saying that its tender was accepted by the state-owned energy firm and later cancelled without giving the vendor an opportunity to present its case.
The genesis of the dispute lies in the tender floated by ONGC for charter hire of barges and tugs for its operation near its Mumbai offshore in January 2015. According to Core Offshore, in October 2015, it had received a letter from ONGC which confirmed that their offer was shortlisted. 
However, another bidder Halani Shipping Pvt Ltd had complained about the entire tender process to the Independent External Monitor (IEM) appointed by the government under the integrity pact program to maintain transparency in high stake bids. After hearing Halani, the external monitor had observed that the sanctity of the tender process had compromised.
Later, Core Offshore also sought IEM’s permission to present its case. The independent monitor heard the company but did not change its views. Subsequently, ONGC decided to issue fresh tenders inviting offers only for hiring barges. 
On October 2016, Core Offshore had approached the Bombay High Court seeking its intervention in the entire process. Its counsel argued that the hearing by the external monitor was a mere formality and the decision had already been reached. 
“ONGC has not blacklisted the petitioner and Core Offshore is free to participate in the fresh tender process,"" argued the energy firm’s counsel adding that there is a significant change in the scope of work and it is a settled principle that re-tendering is permissible when there is a change in the scope of work. 
 When contacted, Nishit Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP & Partners, who was representing ONGC in the matter along with senior counsel Dr Birendra Saraf confirmed the development. Email queries to ONGC and Core Offshore did not elicit any response. 
State-owned ONGC is not new to disputes with its contractors and vendors. 
In another dispute in October 2016, the Bombay high court had asked ONGC to release nearly $20 million to Singapore-based Swiber Holdings Ltd, an oilfield services provider. Swiber, which was working on three projects for the company, had filed for liquidation in July. Worried that Swiber would not be able to complete its work, ONGC in August invoked bank guarantees totaling $105 million.
Similarly, in 2012, Essar Group had also filed a suit against ONGC after it decided to keep the business house out of its offshore oil services tenders worth $2 billion. However, state-run firm later reversed the decision."

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, Oil India Ltd and their partners have received the Mozambique government’s nod for bringing to production a giant gas field in the prolific Rovuma Area-1, off the coast of the African nation. Partners in the block plan to turn the gas into LNG for exports.  
New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, Oil India Ltd and their partners have received the Mozambique government’s nod for bringing to production a giant gas field in the prolific Rovuma Area-1, off the coast of the African nation. Partners in the block plan to turn the gas into LNG for exports. 
In a press statement, state-owned Oil India Ltd said the Mozambique government has “accorded approval for the development plan for the Golfinho-Atum natural gas field in the Area-1 block located in the Rovuma offshore basin of Mozambique"". 
The Area 1 block is estimated to hold recoverable gas resources of about 75 trillion cubic feet, more than the combined resource in all of the gas fields in India. 
“The approval of the Development Plan is the culmination of several years of progress on technical and commercial aspects of the development,"" OIL said without giving details of the investment planned. The Golfino-Atum project will be Mozambique’s first onshore LNG development. 
“The plan outlines the integrated development of the Golfinho-Atum field through an initial two-train onshore liquefaction (LNG) plant with a total processing capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum,"" it said adding volumes in future may rise up to 50 million tonnes a year. 
The project will also supply initial volumes of about 100 million cubic feet of natural gas per day for domestic sales in Mozambique. ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), holds 16% stake in the block while OIL has 4%. 
US energy major Anadarko Petroleum Corp. is the operator with 26.5% interest, while Mitsui of Japan has 20%, Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of state-owned BPCL) 10% and ENH 15%. OIL said the approval of the development plan is a significant milestone in achieving final investment decision (FID) for the project. 
The nod paves way for legal and contractual framework agreements, commencement of resettlement implementation activities, site preparation, efforts to secure long-term LNG sales/offtake agreement and work towards project financing. 
Last month, Anadarko had stated that Mozambique LNG1 Company Pvt. Ltd, the jointly owned sales entity of the Mozambique Area 1 co-venturers, has sold 1.2 million tonnes per annum of LNG from the project to French electricity utility EDF for a term of 15 years. 
The LNG project will initially consist of two LNG trains with a total nameplate capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum to support the development of the Golfinho/Atum fields located entirely within Offshore Area 1."

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), has signed a pact with Iran’s IDRO Oil to jointly bid for a $1 billion contract for development of Susangerd oilfield in southern Iran.  
New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), has signed a pact with Iran’s IDRO Oil to jointly bid for a $1 billion contract for development of Susangerd oilfield in southern Iran. 
The onland Susangerd field in the Khuzestan province is one of the newest finds, which Iran hopes will produce around 30,000 barrels per day of oil in two development phases. 
OVL signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to collaborate with IDRO Oil, which is a subsidiary of state-run Iranian Development and Renovation Organisation, in developing Susangerd field, official sources said. 
IDRO Oil had last month signed a similar pact with Russia’s Zarubezhneft to jointly bid for a contract to develop the Susangerd field. 
The Iranian firm is looking at forming a consortium to make a case with the state-owned National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) for a contract for Susangerd, according to an Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) report citing IDRO CEO Nasrollah Zarei. 
IDRO Oil is one of 17 eligible contractors that have received the Iranian oil ministry’s nod to be a lead partner in joint ventures to work in the country’s energy sector. 
In May last year, it signed an agreement with NIOC, which is the owner of all oil and gas in Iran, to study three fields including Susangerd. 
In December, IDRO Oil signed up Austrian consulting company HOT Engineering to prepare a master development plan for Susangerd. 
HOT Engineering Company will provide consultancy services, technical support and a master development plan. 
Another Iranian contractor, Pasargad Energy, has also studied Susangerd. Zarei expected $900 million would be required for the development of the oilfield. 
Susangerd, located 45-kilometres west of the city of Ahvaz i Khuzestan, is estimated to hold more than 5 billion barrels of in-place oil reserves discovered in 2009. Of these, 500 million barrels are recoverable. 
Separately, OVL is also bidding for development rights of Iran’s giant South Azadegan Oilfield in direct competition with the likes of global giants like Shell, France’s Total, Petronas of Malaysia and Russia’s Gazprom. 
It is also reworking a $6.2 billion cost it had estimated for developing the Farzad-B gas field in the Persian Gulf. 
OVL is doing recalculations to win rights to development the field it had discovered a decade back. 
OVL is one of the 34 companies Iran pre-qualified last year for development of South Azadegan field, which contains an estimated 33 billion barrels of oil in place, of which 6 billion barrels are deemed recoverable. 
The field currently produces about 80,000 barrels of oil per day (4 million tonnes per annum) and output is envisaged to touch 320,000 barrels a day (16 million tonnes). 
Farzad B was discovered by OVL in the Farsi block about 10 years ago. The field in the Farsi block has an in-place gas reserve of 21.7 trillion cubic feet, of which 12.5 tcf are recoverable."

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) may sell stake in its mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to fund acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), a senior official said. 
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) may sell stake in its mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to fund acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), a senior official said.
ONGC had borrowed money from banks to buy government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL for Rs36,915 crore. “We traditionally have been a debt-free company and would like to return to that status as soon as possible. We have assets which can be monetised to payoff the debt,"" he said.
ONGC holds 13.77% stake in nation’s biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp. (IOC), which at Friday’s trading price is worth close to Rs26,000 crore. It also holds 4.86% stake in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, which is worth over Rs3,600 crore.
“We will sell sales in IOC and GAIL only when the price is right. And it is not possible to sell all the shares in one go,"" he said, adding that an alternative to it is selling stake in ONGC-Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL). OPaL’s 1.1 million tonnes capacity petrochem plant at Dahej in Gujarat was commissioned last year and has reached 100% capacity in February.
“We have invested Rs30,000 crore in the project and always had plans to sell a minimum of 26% stake in the project to a strategic investor,"" the official said. “Now that the plant has come up well and stabilised, this is the time to monetise it.""
The official said several companies including some global giants have evinced interest in taking equity in the project. He however refused to name the firms due to commercial reasons.
Saudi and Kuwaiti firms are said to be interested in taking a stake in the project. The project was originally conceived in 2006 and has witnessed cost and time overruns. It was initially planned to be built at a cost of Rs12,440 crore but ended up with actual investment of Rs30,000 crore.
ONGC was originally supposed to keep just 26% stake while gas utility GAIL was to take 19%. 5% was to be taken by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. (GSPC) and the remaining was to be sold to a strategic investor. But GAIL ended up paying for only 9% and GSPC for only 0.2%. The remaining cost was borne by ONGC.
The official said ONGC already has government approval to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares. ONGC, which completed HPCL acquisition at the end of January, has been a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status.
The short-term loan it availed of has provision to pre-pay without any penalty. It will pre-pay the one-year tenure loan fro sale of one or more of its assets, he said."

Mumbai: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Essar Oil Ltd, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Torrent Power Ltd are among companies planning to bid for the ninth round of city gas distribution (CGD), two people aware of the matter said. 
 The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) will offer compressed natural gas retailing licences in 100 cities shortly.  
RIL, Essar Oil and ONGC did not respond to emails sent on 15 March. 
The PNGRB has so far held eight rounds of bidding. The last few rounds of CGD bidding had seen lukewarm response.
This time around, the PNGRB is looking at a new model with a different bidding parameter. Last October, the regulatory body had called for industry comments on an alternative model of bidding criteria for CGD.
“To encourage wider participation, PNGRB has proposed to increase the exclusivity period and has pruned the minimum net worth criteria for bidders. This will encourage players to bid,"" said a CGD consultant on condition of anonymity. 
Companies with a net worth of not less than Rs150 crore can bid for cities with 5 million people, and those with Rs100 crore net worth can bid for cities with 2-5 million people. A Rs5 crore net worth company can bid for cities with less than 1 million people.  
Companies which win CGD licence for a city would have eight years of marketing exclusivity in that city, against the existing five years. Also, entities with experience of at least one year in operation and maintenance of a CGD network and with adequate number of technically qualified personnel would meet the eligibility criteria for bidding.  
“Also, companies securing a CGD licence will have to enter into a firm natural gas supply agreement with a natural gas producer or marketer and have to achieve financial closure within 270 days from the date of grant of licence,"" the second of the two people mentioned above said.  
The sixth round of bidding for 34 cities in 2015 saw only 20 bids. The seventh round for 11 cities received only one bid. Seven cities were offered in the eighth round last year but not all licences have been awarded so far.  
PNGRB in its notice dated 16 January 2018 on the draft bidding regulations had invited comments by 2 February after which it will finalise the criteria. Many companies have replied to PNGRB’s notice, which the regulator has uploaded on its website."

New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.  
New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant. 
GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat. 
But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs996.28 crore. 
This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility’s stake dropped first to 17%, then to 15.5% and now about 9%, sources privy to the development said. 
“It doesn’t make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,"" they said. 
The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs30,000 crore. 
After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19% stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date. 
People privy of the development said when project cost was revised to Rs19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17%. This was done because the company’s board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs1,000 crore. 
Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs996.28 crore towards the 17% stake, they said. But when the project cost went up further to Rs21,396 crore, the promoter’s equity contribution increased from Rs5,860.5 crore to Rs6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio. 
GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved—Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5% stake. Now that the project cost almost touched Rs30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9% stake. 
Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38% of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5% stake, did not make more equity contributions. 
ONGC had attributed the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit."

RIL is the operator of the CB-ONN-2003/1 block (also called CB-10 block) with a 70% participating interest while BP holds the rest. 
Reliance won the block in an auction in New Exploration and Licensing Policy (NELP). 
RIL did not reply to an email sent on 28 March. BP India declined to comment.
“We had seen the block’s data but are yet to take a call if we would bid for RIL and BP’s block,"" an official from state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, the first of the two people cited above said on condition of anonymity. 
The block covers 635 sq. km and is divided into two parts, A and B. 
In 2011, RIL had announced a “transformational"" deal with UK-based BP Plc, which picked up 30% stake in its 21 oil and gas blocks. However, since 2012, both companies have been pruning their portfolio, relinquishing unviable blocks.
RIL now holds only four blocks—KG-D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin; Mahanadi basin blocks NEC-25 and GS-01 in Saurashtra basin; and Panna-Mukta-Tapti oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea. 
“Crude oil prices are again on the rise and it may be difficult for RIL to find a buyer for the field now. Though we assessed the block’s data, we are not participating in the sale bids,"" the exploration director from an exploration and production company, the second person cited above, said on condition of anonymity.
RIL has also sold all its 16 overseas conventional oil and gas exploration blocks, that it acquired over the last few years. 
In its international portfolio, RIL now holds two shale gas assets in the US. In October 2017, RIL agreed to sell the first of its shale gas ventures—upstream Marcellus shale gas assets in North-Eastern and central Pennsylvania in the US—for $126 million. 
Between 2010 and 2013, RIL bought stakes in three upstream oil exploration joint ventures with Chevron, Pioneer Natural Resource, and Carrizo Oil and Gas; and a midstream joint venture with Pioneer. Midstream refers to the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of hydrocarbons. 
Last week, RIL through its subsidiaries Reliance Eagleford Upstream Holding LP and Reliance Holding USA, agreed to sell part of its interest in Eagle Ford shale assets to Sundance Energy Inc. for $100 million.
“With an investment of Rs40,000 crore in KG block lined up, RIL and BP have decided to focus on their KG basin block,"" said an analyst tracking RIL. 
He spoke on condition of anonymity as he is not allowed to speak to the media."

Singapore: ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd (OMPL) has purchased 105,000 tonnes of heavy cut naphtha for its petrochemical plant from Vitol, making this the company’s first import tender purchase since 2015, traders familiar with the matter said on Friday. 
Singapore: ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd (OMPL) has purchased 105,000 tonnes of heavy cut naphtha for its petrochemical plant from Vitol, making this the company’s first import tender purchase since 2015, traders familiar with the matter said on Friday.
The total volume, comprising 7 cargoes at 15,000 tonnes each, will be supplied between May and August.
The price of the tender was unknown, but the purchase came at a time when demand for different grades of naphtha is strong.
It was unclear why OMPL needed to import the heavy grade naphtha for its paraxylene plant, which has a capacity of more than 900,000 tonnes a year (tpy).
The petrochemical firm, owned by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd and parent company Oil and Natural Gas Corp., gets most of its feedstock from the former.
At 3.05pm, ONGC shares were down 0.14% to Rs176.90, while Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals shares gained 2.15% to Rs113.80."

New Delhi: Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) and Reliance Industries Ltd have started discussions with buyers to sell natural gas from their fields in the Bay of Bengal that are expected to start production over the next three years. 
New Delhi: Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) and Reliance Industries Ltd have started discussions with buyers to sell natural gas from their fields in the Bay of Bengal that are expected to start production over the next three years.
The plan is to transport the gas from the east coast to the industrial heart belt of Gujarat, an ONGC executive told Reuters.
“We want to use the pipeline to reach customers in West India to sell gas from the KG basin. We are talking to some of them for contracts,"" Shashi Shankar, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said on the margins of the International Energy Forum.
ONGC plans to use Reliance Industries’ 1,375 km pipeline connecting Kakinada on the east coast to Bharuch in Gujarat in the west. 
Shankar said ONGC is committed to bring east coast gas onstream by 2019 onwards and ramp up production to around 15 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd).
“We are discussing with customers on a regular basis...,"" he said.
Reliance built the pipeline in 2009, but has been operating at very low capacity utilisation for several years due to a drastic fall in output from the company’s venture in the Krishna-Godavari basin in the Bay of Bengal.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries and partner BP Plc, which together own three natural gas fields next to ONGC’s in the east coast, has also started discussions with customers to market the natural gas, Sashi Mukundan, BP’s country head and regional president for India, told Reuters last week.
The RIL-BP joint venture is offering customers contracts ranging from a 10-year tenure, to 5- and 3-year, Mukundan said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to increase the share of gas in India’s energy mix to 15% by 2030 from below 6.5% now.
The government in February approved a plan by Reliance Industries and its partner BP to develop two new fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.
This approval followed an earlier clearance to develop another field called R-Series in the basin.
“At peak, 2022, we will produce 35 mscmd and would contribute almost 10% to country’s demand,"" Mukundan said.
The long term contracts that Reliance-BP joint venture is offering is a sign the companies are committed to fulfilling their contracts, Mukundan said.
“If we cannot deliver from our field, we will import and deliver,"" he said. Between 2021 and 2023, India would be hitting at a level which will be 50 mscmd incremental. So India would be producing in the range of 140 mscmd per day, said Atanu Chakraborty, said the head of Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), India’s upstream regulator.
India’s current total consumption of natural gas at end of March 2018 stood at 145 mscmd. Reuters"

New Delhi: The foreign acquisition unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd’s (ONGC) has filed an arbitration claim against the government of Sudan in a London court, a company official said, seeking to recover dues pending for years from a project hit by the breakaway of South Sudan in 2011. 
New Delhi: The foreign acquisition unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd’s (ONGC) has filed an arbitration claim against the government of Sudan in a London court, a company official said, seeking to recover dues pending for years from a project hit by the breakaway of South Sudan in 2011.
People familiar with the matter in India and Sudan said ONGC had filed a claim for $98.94 million, in what they said was a first for the South Asian nation’s top oil and gas explorer against any government. They declined to be identified because they weren’t authorised to discuss the matter with media.
At the centre of the dispute is ONGC’s 25% stake the company acquired in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) in Sudan in 2003. Other stakeholders include China’s China National Petroleum Corp. with a 40% stake and Malaysia’s Petronas with a 30% share.
“Yes, we have filed an arbitration as our dues have been pending for years,"" said N. K. Verma, managing director of ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL). “Notwithstanding this arbitration we will continue to work with Sudan going forward,"" he said, declining to provide details on the timing and location of any hearings, or the amount being sought.
The current arbitration is only for a part of pending dues that add up to about $425 million, sources said, adding ONGC has sued the government as the contracts were backed by sovereign guarantees.
ONGC will also file arbitrations for the remaining outstanding amount in due course, said a company official, who declined to be identified.
Officials in Sudan said contacts and negotiations with ONGC were being lined up.
“We have addressed the company (ONGC) to show our commitment to serious negotiation and we (have) set up a committee to determine the time frame to pay back the sum in installments,"" said Bekheet Ahmed Abdullah, under-secretary for Sudan’s petroleum ministry.
Sanctions impact
OVL’s stake in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) comprised Blocks 1, 2 and 4, and the firm also agreed to build a 1,500-kilometre pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. But in 2011 South Sudan broke away from Sudan, after decades of civil war, and took control of blocks 1A, 1B and a part of block 4.
Meanwhile, because of years of trade sanctions imposed on Sudan by the US—only lifted in 2017—Khartoum found it difficult to secure oil for its refineries, and asked foreign companies including OVL to sell their share of oil from the blocks to the African nation. 
In 2016, OVL signed a separate agreement with Sudan for the sale of its share of GNOP oil. Sudan has not yet paid $90.81 million to ONGC for purchases of oil in 2016 and 2017, according to people familiar with the matter.
ONGC Videsh had expected Sudan to clear the dues after lifting of the US sanctions last year. 
“We are committed to pay the money but due to the sanctions imposed on Sudan, we are facing problems in making payment,"" said Sirajuddin Hamid Yousuf, Sudan’s ambassador to India. “The sanctions were eased on Oct. 12, 2017 but we still cannot have normal banking transactions with India and others,"" he said.

133,2018-04-18,ONGC,"Norway's Statoil may enter India's upstream hydrocarbon space in partnership with ONGC for deep-water exploration of oil and gas fields

New Delhi: Norway’s Statoil ASA may enter India’s upstream hydrocarbon space in partnership with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) for deep-water exploration, said a top Indian government official aware of the development. 
New Delhi: Norway’s Statoil ASA may enter India’s upstream hydrocarbon space in partnership with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) for deep-water exploration, said a top Indian government official aware of the development.
Statoil’s move is guided by a favourable policy landscape, especially in exploration and production (E&P) of deep water blocks. 
The Norwegian state-run firm, with expertise in such tricky blocks, is also looking at investing in offshore wind projects here, with the Indian government last week calling for expression of interest (EoI) for the first such project, off the Gujarat coast. 
“We have had very good discussions with the Norwegian government representatives and Statoil as well. We can do a long-term technology partnership with them. There can be many things. In the coming days, E&P in India will happen in deep waters. So, if we get Norway and Statoil as a partner, there can’t be nothing better than that,"" said the senior official, requesting anonymity.
To be sure, Statoil had an Indian presence earlier through Norway’s Norsk Hydro, whose oil and gas operations merged with Statoil in 2007. Norsk Hydro and Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) had a 10% and 15% stake, respectively in ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin off the coast of Andhra Pradesh. 
Statoil and Petrobras quit their partnership in 2010 over government delays in approving their participation in the development of India’s key gas find. The government of Norway holds around 67% stake in the world’s largest offshore operator. 
Ingvil Smines Tybring-Gjedde, Norway’s deputy minister of petroleum and energy, declined to comment on the proposed partnership between Statoil and ONGC.
Tor Martin Anfinnsen, senior vice-president (marketing and supply) at Statoil, declined to comment on the proposed partnership. He said: “But suffice to say that in the upstream space, we constantly screen both what we say to be perspective areas and assess the regulatory frameworks in those areas. What we are positive to is the development that we have seen of late in the licensing conditions in India. That we find interesting.""
India has introduced a new liberal licensing regime under an open acreage licensing policy that ensures greater industry involvement in auction design and is a departure from the earlier regime, in which pre-determined blocks were auctioned. 
“As we speak, there is no agreement or deal between Statoil and ONGC. But it’s natural for Statoil to particularly access deep-water where we have acknowledged expertise worldwide,"" Tor Martin Anfinnsen added.
ONGC, on its part, has been scouting abroad for opportunities to plug technology gaps and leverage the strengths of large oil companies. The search for partners is important for ONGC given the concerns about its production capabilities. While most of the company’s domestic fields are old, its plans to produce gas from the Krishna Godavari field is yet to fructify.
While queries emailed to an ONGC spokesperson remained unanswered, a senior ONGC executive requesting anonymity said, “Earlier Statoil was our partner. They have deep-water experience. Going forward, deep-water discoveries at around 2,900m will have to be brought to production. Experience of a firm such as Statoil will help de-risk our portfolio."""

New Delhi: Mining moghul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd and state-owned ONGC were top bidders on Wednesday for 55 oil and gas blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction that was shunned by domestic private and international energy majors. 
New Delhi: Mining moghul Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd and state-owned ONGC were top bidders on Wednesday for 55 oil and gas blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction that was shunned by domestic private and international energy majors.
Vedanta bid for all the 55 blocks while ONGC bid for ‎37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. State-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion. Vedanta was sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as direct competitor in the remaining. 
Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders. Reliance Industries and its partner BP Plc. did not bid for a single area. Essar Oil and Russia’s Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy also abstained from the round. 
No foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had touted the maiden auction under the open acreage licensing policy (OALP) as game changer. 
DGH said a total of 110 bids were received from a total of nine companies—five state-run and four private firms. Besides Vedanta’s oil unit, Cairn India, other private players bidding included Selan Exploration, HOEC and Sun Petro. 
Bidding in the auction of 55 exploration blocks on offer for prospecting of oil and gas under the OALP closed on Wednesday. People in the know said Cairn put in very aggressive bids for 13 blocks and a little less aggressive bids for another nine. The remaining bids were mostly routine, they said. 
DGH, the upstream technical arm of the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, began opening of offers received under the OALP bid round being held under the new Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (Help). 
India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq. km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in any area that is presently not under any production or exploration licence. 
The EoIs can be put in anytime of the year but their are accumulated twice annually. As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, 
Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and OIL, and private sector Cairn India by the end of the first EoI cycle on 15 November 2017, they said. The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage. 
The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq. km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq. km being under exploration currently, they said. Blocks would be awarded to the company which offers highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. Increased exploration would lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030. Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target. India currently imports 81% of its oil needs. 
People in the know said ONGC and Cairn India had put in 41 out of 57 bids received in November last year. Private player Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) bid for one area in a round. Of the 57 EOIs put up, only 55 blocks were cleared for bidding after eliminating areas that are under no-go zone or overlapping with existing mining lease. 
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue sharing model where companies offering maximum share of oil and gas to government are awarded the block. 
The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round. So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospects."

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) registered a 6.3% increase in natural gas production in 2017-18 and is on track to double the output by 2022, a top company official said.
ONGC produced 23.484 billion cubic metres of gas in 2017-18 as against 22.088 bcm in 2016-17, he said. This is the highest gas output by the company in five years and the growth rate is higher than the global average of 3-4% year-on-year.
ONGC has stepped up on bringing newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10% by 2022. India currently imports over 80% of its oil needs.
The overall gas production, which includes production from the joint ventures, registered a growth of 5.8% at 24.610 bcm, as against 23.270 bcm in the previous year. “This is the highest ever overall growth in percentage terms since 2001-02,"" he said.
The company is targeting gas production of 24.41 bcm during the current financial year and incur an investment of around Rs7,000 crore. While the main incremental growth stand-alone basis came from western offshore, the onshore fields have also contributed substantially despite natural decline coupled with several other constraints.
During the last financial year, ONGC’s offshore gas production stood at 17.845 bcm against 16.883 bcm produced in 2016-17. The onshore registered a production of 5639 bcm gas in the last fiscal year against the production of 5.205 in the previous fiscal. The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, he said.
From the onshore fields, there has been an increase in production particularly from Ramnad area in Cauvery Asset. There has also been a considerable increase in associated gas production from Ankleshwar and Assam Assets.
When reached for comments, ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker said the company has been aggressively pursuing the gas production growth in line with the government’s drive for cleaner gas economy.
He said the company has charted out a mission to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22. “The production growth last year is only a testimony to that goal,"" he said, adding the company was on track to meet the target.
The total investment in the ONGC’s ambitious gas projects stands at Rs57,000 crores, which is one of the highest investments in the world as far as the gas projects are concerned. This investment includes the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project which is being implemented on a fast track basis.
First gas from the project is targeted for 2019. The job for the early monetisation of discoveries both from the west and the east coast has been rigorously monitored at the highest level in order to ensure that the company’s ambitious gas production goal is achieved on schedule, Shanker said.
The official said ONGC has drastically reduced gas flaring during the last fiscal, leading to considerable savings. The gas flaring stood at 1.92% in 2017-18, lowest since 1999-2000. This is only technical flaring and due to non-availability of customers like in the previous years."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked Vedanta Ltd to approach the Centre under the revised March 2017 policy for an extension of its production sharing contract (PSC) with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd for the Barmer block in Rajasthan which is set to expire on 14 May 2020. 
New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday asked Vedanta Ltd to approach the Centre under the revised March 2017 policy for an extension of its production sharing contract (PSC) with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd for the Barmer block in Rajasthan which is set to expire on 14 May 2020.
An application for extension of a PSC has to be made two years before its expiration date, the court was informed. 
The bench of Justice Rajiv Shakdhar was hearing Vedanta’s plea seeking a direction from the court about the policy under which an extension was to be preferred, without affecting a pending litigation between Vedanta, ONGC and the Centre with respect to the terms and conditions that would apply to the period so extended.
Cairn India, which is part of the Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Group, had moved the high court in December 2015 seeking an extension of the PSC for the Barmer block.
However, the union cabinet had in March 2017 granted extension of 10 years or the economic life of the field, whichever is earlier, to PSCs for 10 oil and gas blocks, including the PSC between Cairn India and ONGC for the Barmer block, under different terms and conditions. 
The new policy mandated higher profit sharing with the government, a no-litigation clause and a compulsory clause on arbitration, among others.
During the course of hearing, ONGC supported the government, arguing that the terms and conditions as per the new policy of March 2017 should be applied as the mutual agreement to extend the PSC on existing terms was before the new policy came in.
The PSC between Cairn India and ONGC for the project was signed on 15 May 1995 for 25 years. While Cairn India operates the block with 70% participating interest, ONGC has the remaining 30%. The Barmer block comprises the Mangala, Bhagyam, Aishwariya and Raageshwari oil and gas fields.
The decision of the court on application of the revised policy to the extended PSC is pending."

“The net impact of the subsidy sharing will be manageable for ONGC and OIL, even if the two companies are required to bear the entire shortfall between budgeted and actual amounts for the fiscal year ending March 2019,"" added Halan. 
Moody’s added that if ONGC and OIL are obligated to contribute the entire subsidised amount exceeding the government’s budgeted figure for the fiscal year ending March 2019, such a requirement would constrain their net realised prices to $52-$56 per barrel. This is only marginally lower than or equal to the $56 for fiscal 2018. 
Moody’s estimates that fuel subsidies could total Rs34,000-53,000 crore in fiscal 2019, the highest since fiscal 2015, assuming Brent crude oil prices average $60-$80 per barrel. The government has budgeted for Rs25,000 crore of fuel subsidies in fiscal 2019, leaving a shortfall of Rs9,000-28,000 crore. This could be met by ONGC and OIL entirely, or in part, if the government increases the budget allocation for these subsidies.
According to Moody’s, the oil marketing companies—Indian Oil Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd—have been asked to share less than 1% of the total fuel subsidies since fiscal 2012 and it is unlikely that the proportion will rise.
The rating agency says that the government is unlikely to reverse fuel pricing deregulation because it remains committed to reforms. However, it could intervene to address record high prices of petrol and diesel by reducing the excise duty on these products, especially if oil prices stay high. These taxes make up more than 20% of the retail selling prices and were increased in 2016 when oil prices fell. Most petroleum products are sold at market-linked prices in India, except liquefied petroleum gas and kerosene."
124,2018-05-24,ONGC,"In a regulatory filing, RIL said the government had on May 2017 sought $3.8 billion as its share from the western offshore field and has 'recently repeated its demand'

New Delhi:The government has reiterated a demand for $3.8 billion dollars from Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC following an English court ruling over government share from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields in western offshore.  
New Delhi:The government has reiterated a demand for $3.8 billion dollars from Reliance Industries, Shell and ONGC following an English court ruling over government share from the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields in western offshore. 
In a regulatory filing, RIL said the government had on May 2017 sought $3.8 billion as its share from the western offshore field and has “recently repeated its demand"". 
The liability is to be split between the three companies in proportion to their stake in PMT. State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has 40% interest while RIL and Shell hold 30% apiece. 
The demand pertains to interpretation of the contract for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) oil and gas fields in the Arabian Sea. 
In December 2010, BG Exploration & Production India Ltd and RIL initiated an arbitration against the Government of India (GoI) after a dispute over the state’s share of profit and royalty from Panna-Mukta and Mid and South Tapti contract areas off the west coast. 
“The Arbitration Tribunal determined a number of disputes in a final partial award on 12 October, 2016, which was accompanied by two dissenting opinions,"" RIL said in the filing. 
BG, which was subsequently acquired by Shell, and RIL initiated proceedings under English Arbitration Act 1996 to challenge the arbitration award before the English Commercial Court in November 2016. 
On 2 May, 2018, the Court delivered its final judgement, remitting a significant issue for redetermination by the Tribunal within three months while disposing off eight other issues, RIL said without giving details. 
The Arbitration Tribunal has scheduled a hearing to determine the remitted issue and will thereafter deliver an award, it said. “On May 25, 2017, GoI, in disregard to the arbitration proceedings and pending English court proceeding, claimed - $3.8 billion from the contractor consortium of BG, ONGC and RIL (RIL share being $1.15 billion). This amount was calculated by GOI on its own purported interpretation of the arbitration award,"" RIL said. 
It insisted that before taking up the issue of quantification of liability, the Tribunal has to decide the issue which is remitted by the English court to it. BG-RIL propose to file an application to the Tribunal for increase of Cost Recovery Limit which they are entitled to do under the Production Sharing Contracts.
“Tribunal can consider the issue of quantification of liability (if any) only after these two issues are decided,"" RIL said. “Several issues relating to the claim made by GOI are subject to pending arbitration proceedings."""

New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), today reported a 29% jump in its net profit for the fiscal year ending 31 March as it produced more crude oil and natural gas.  
New Delhi: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), today reported a 29% jump in its net profit for the fiscal year ending 31 March as it produced more crude oil and natural gas. 
Consolidated net profit in 2017-18 fiscal at Rs981 crore was 29.6% higher than Rs757 crore in the previous fiscal year, the company said in a statement. OVL is an unlisted company and as such is not obligated to release quarterly earnings numbers. 
The firm, which has 41 projects in 20 countries spanning from Venezuela to New Zealand, produced 11% more crude at 9.35 million tonnes in FY18. Natural gas output was also up 10% at 4.81 billion cu. m. 
“The incremental production was mainly from Vankorneft and Sakhalin-1 projects in Russia; Brazil’s BC-10 project, CPO-5 block of Colombia and due to the acquisition of 4 per cent stake in the Lower Zakum Concession project in UAE during the year,"" the statement said. 
The board of directors of the company proposed a final dividend of Rs2 per share for the 2017-18 fiscal, up from Rs1.4 a share paid in the previous year. OVL said it along with Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and Bharat Petro Resources Ltd in February acquired 10% stake in Lower Zakum Concession, offshore Abu Dhabi."
126,2018-05-24,ONGC,"The windfall tax, which may come in form of a cess, will kick in the moment oil prices cross $70 per barrel

New Delhi: The government may levy a windfall tax on oil producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) as part of a permanent solution it is working on for moderating the spiralling retail prices of petrol and diesel. 
New Delhi: The government may levy a windfall tax on oil producers like Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) as part of a permanent solution it is working on for moderating the spiralling retail prices of petrol and diesel.
The tax, which may come in form of a cess, will kick in the moment oil prices cross $70 per barrel, sources privy to the development said.
At 2.26pm, ONGC shares were trading 8.26% lower at Rs161.05, while Oil India Ltd fell 9.78% to Rs208.
Under the scheme, oil producers, who get paid international rates for the oil they produce from domestic fields, would have to part with any revenue they earn from prices crossing $70 per barrel mark.
The revenues so collected would be used to pay fuel retailers so that they absorb spikes beyond the threshold levels, they said. This may be accompanied by a minor tinkering with excise duty rates to give immediate relief to consumers.
States too would be asked to cut sales tax or VAT to show a visible impact on retail prices.
Sources said the thinking in the government is to levy cess on all oil producers—both public and private sector—so as not to attract criticism of stifling state-owned explorers. A similar tax was considered in 2008 when oil prices were on the rise but the idea was dropped after stiff opposition from private sector firms like Cairn India.
Windfall tax, they said, is levied in some of the developed countries globally. The UK in 2011 raised the tax rate to be applied to North Sea oil and gas profits when the price is above $75 per barrel. China on 1 April 2006 began levying the special upstream profit tax on domestic oil producers to redistribute and allocate the windfall income enjoyed by the oil companies and subsidise disadvantaged industry and social groups that are most affected by soaring crude oil prices. It in 2012 raised the windfall tax threshold to $55 per barrel.
Sources said the windfall tax is one of the options being considered by the government as a permanent solution to dealing with the problem of spike in oil prices. This follows reluctance on part of the finance ministry to cut excise duty as it has to ensure adequate funds are available to social welfare schemes in the election year.
In particular, resources have to be arranged for the National Health Protection Scheme (NHPS) that aims to provide health insurance cover of Rs5 lakh to every eligible household.
Yesterday, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had stated that the government will take a long-term view on the retail prices of petrol and diesel, which have touched record high, instead of having an ad hoc measure.
Petrol and diesel prices were raised for the 11th day in succession today as the state-owned oil firms gradually passed on to the consumer the increased cost of international oil that had accumulated since a 19-day freeze was imposed just before Karnataka elections.
Since the time the hiatus ended on 14 May, rates have gone up by Rs2.84 a litre in case of petrol and Rs2.60 in diesel. Petrol costs Rs77.47 a litre in Delhi and diesel Rs68.53.
Sources said a $70 per barrel threshold for the windfall tax is sufficient to cover for capital expenditure requirement of ONGC and other oil producers. Incidentally, ONGC and OIL had till June 2015 provided for up to 40% of the annual fuel subsidy bill, which they did by way of providing discounts on crude sold to downstream refining and marketing companies, IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. This discount helped the retailers make good a part of the losses they incurred on selling petrol and diesel below cost.
The government raised excise duty nine times between November 2014 and January 2016 to shore up finances as global oil prices fell, but then cut the tax just once in October last year by Rs2 a litre. 
The Centre levies Rs19.48 as excise duty on a litre of petrol and Rs15.33 on diesel. State sales tax or VAT varies from state to state. Unlike excise duty, VAT is ad valorem and results in higher revenues for the state when rates move up."

The tax, which may come in form of a cess, will kick in the moment oil prices cross $70 per barrel, reported PTI, citing people familiar to the development. Under the scheme, oil producers, who get paid international rates for the oil they produce from domestic fields, would have to part with any revenue they earn from prices crossing $70 per barrel mark.
The revenues so collected would be used to pay fuel retailers so that they absorb spikes beyond the threshold levels, added the report. This may be accompanied by a minor tinkering with excise duty rates to give immediate relief to consumers. States too would be asked to cut sales tax or VAT to show a visible impact on retail prices, noted the PTI report.
Last week, Brent crude topped $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014. The spike in oil prices is due to a combination of factors such as President Donald Trump pulling the US out of the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran, Opec and Russia cutting supplies, falling production in Venezuela and geopolitical tensions.
Earlier Moody’s Investor Service had said that the ONGC and Oil India face increasing risk that the government will once again require them to share in the country’s fuel-subsidy burden as oil prices rise.
“Because of the government’s widening fiscal deficit, ONGC and OIL could be asked to bear part of the Indian government’s fuel subsidy for oil, if prices stay above $60 per barrel for the fiscal year ending March 2019,"" Moody’s analyst Vikas Halan said in a 22 May report.
The report also noted that the two companies have not contributed to fuel subsidies since June 2015, but have in previous years paid for over 40% of the country’s annual subsidy bill."

New Delhi/Singapore: India’s top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has awarded its first mini-term tender to sell Brazil’s heavy crude oil Ostra in June-November to Shell, three people familiar with the matter said. 
New Delhi/Singapore: India’s top explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has awarded its first mini-term tender to sell Brazil’s heavy crude oil Ostra in June-November to Shell, three people familiar with the matter said.
ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC, owns a 27% stake in Brazil’s BC-10 block, and would sell its entire Ostra crude entitlement from the block over the period of the contract.
In the tender, ONGC offered to sell 750,000 barrels for lifting in June, but it specified no quantities for the remaining months of the period, according to a tender document seen by Reuters.
ONGC Videsh’s managing director N.K. Verma did not respond to Reuters calls seeking comment. Shell does not typically comment on commercial matters.
Royal Dutch Shell is the operator of the BC-10 block, which produces Ostra oil, and would be able to combine the ONGC volumes with its equity oil to form a standard cargo.
The standard cargo size that the FPSO at BC-10 can support is 950,000 barrels, also according to the tender document.
Shell has offered to pay a premium of about $2 a barrel to the term pricing formula that is linked to the prices of ICE Brent, and the average of spot differentials for Columbian Castilla Blend and Vasconia.
The BC-10 block produces about 40,000 barrels per day of Ostra crude. Shell has a 50% share in the block."

MUMBAI: India’s state-owned exploration company Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) will by early 2019 quadruple the output from an offshore gas block in the Bay of Bengal that it spent a billion dollars on last year, according to a senior ONGC official. 
MUMBAI: India’s state-owned exploration company Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) will by early 2019 quadruple the output from an offshore gas block in the Bay of Bengal that it spent a billion dollars on last year, according to a senior ONGC official.
Output from the Deendayal natural gas block off India’s east coast will reach as high as a million standard cubic metres per day by January 2019, according to Rajesh Kakkar, head of ONGC’s offshore division.
ONGC bought the Deendayal field in 2017 from state-owned company Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (GSPC) while it was still undergoing test runs for commercial gas production.
The increase in production is marginal against India’s total consumption, although Kakkar said the field has a potential to go up to 3 million cubic metres a day, which would make up about 4% of ONGC’s total output.
“The project will also help us in developing the adjoining gas fields in the KG (Krishna-Godavari) basin at lesser capex (capital expenditure) and time,"" said Kakkar.
ONGC and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), along with partner BP Plc, are developing several natural gas discoveries in the KG basin. These discoveries could contribute up to 50 million cubic metres of daily output, or about a third of India’s current demand.
ONGC, which meets up to 40% of India’s total natural gas demand, had been saddled with ageing fields and dropping production for almost a decade.
But the company registered a marginal jump in production in fiscal 2016/17, and then production increased by another 6 percent last year in the year through March 2018.
Analysts said the increase in output from the Deendayal gas block will help ONGC in clocking an increased overall output in the current fiscal year as well.
The Deendayal gas field was discovered in 2005. The project was a flagship gas initiative of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who at the time was chief minister of Gujarat state on India’s west coast.
Modi said then that the field held up to 20 trillion cubic feet (560 billion cubic meters) of natural gas, although delays and cost overruns in developing the field had some analysts questioning the quality of the investment for ONGC.
ONGC, however, will be able to monetise the gas at a higher price and with more marketing freedom under new rules meant to encourage the development of frontier offshore reserves.
Prime Minister Modi has set a target of increasing the share of natural gas in India’s energy mix to 15% by 2030, from 6.5% now. Modi also wants to cut down on energy imports, especially crude oil.
India consumed around 145 million cubic metres of natural gas a day, nearly 50 percent of it imported, in 2017-18. The government has projected India’s potential demand at nearly 500 million cubic metres of gas a day."

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to adopt stringent reporting standard on environment, social and corporate governance (ESG) to help improve its credit rating, top company officials said. 
ONGC, India’s top oil and gas producer, will be the first public sector company to adopt reporting standards that are at par with international benchmarks, which will bring greater transparency. 
Officials said the new ESG reporting would help raise the company’s credit rating, which will increase its capacity to raise funds—both debt and equity—from markets worldwide. 
Under the new reporting format, the three parameters of environment, social and corporate governance are extensively studied. 
Under the environment head, factors such as energy and emissions, preservation of the ecosystem, water utilisation and waste management are covered. 
Under the social head, key factors such as community engagement, local employment, human rights and workforce inclusiveness are emphasised. 
Under the corporate governance head, parameters like health and safety, ethics and compliance and customer protection are covered. 
ONGC plans to hire a consultant shortly to revamp its integrated reporting system to strengthen its corporate governance policy and ensure greater transparency in its business, they said. 
ONGC chairman and managing director, Shashi Shanker, said the company is continuously striving to improve its statutory reporting system in order to strengthen its policies pertaining to sustainability and corporate governance. 
“The ESG reporting will be benchmarked with the world’s best practices in terms of sustainability reporting. As an energy company, ONGC relentlessly pursues to promote environmental consciousness and protect the ecosystem,"" he said. 
“Corporate governance and sustainability factor high in ONGC’s business model and with this new reporting standard, ONGC would pave the way for aligning itself with global best practices,"" he added. 
A.K. Dwivedi, director (Exploration) and director incharge HSE at ONGC said, “Globally, the ESG reporting system is emerging as the latest trend in integrated reporting. 
The system embraces sustainability factors to help identify companies with superior business model and is said to offer investors long-term performance advantages"". 
Officials said ONGC is committed towards the goal set by the prime minister for environmental protection and climate change. It is one of the foremost companies in terms of initiatives for carbon footprint mitigation, with 15 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects registered with the UNFCCC, and 4 more projects in the pipeline. 
“We are leaving no stone unturned to live up to the clarion call of the Prime Minister to ensure seamless coexistence of development and sustainability,"" Shanker said."

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has replaced a government nominee director on board of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) with its nominee as it consolidates control over the company it recently acquired. 
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has replaced a government nominee director on board of Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) with its nominee as it consolidates control over the company it recently acquired.
ONGC, which had in January completed the acquisition of the government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL for Rs36,915 crore, has appointed its director (finance) Subhash Kumar on the company board, people familiar with the matter said. He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, joint secretary in ministry of petroleum and natural gas. 
Till now HPCL had two government nominee directors—Rath and Sandeep Poundrik, joint secretary (refineries) of the oil ministry. After the appointment of Kumar, there remains only one government nominee director on HPCL. 
The people said ONGC wants the one government nominee director on HPCL board to be the same person as on its board. ONGC board has two government directors—Amar Nath, joint secretary - exploration in the oil ministry, and Rajiv Bansal, additional secretary & financial adviser in the ministry. It wants Bansal to be appointed on HPCL board in place of Poundrik to have a common link between the two boards, they said. 
After acquiring government’s stake, HPCL is now a subsidiary of ONGC. Like its other major subsidiaries—Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) and ONGC Videsh Ltd, ONGC decided to nominate just one director on the board of HPCL, the people said. 
HPCL board currently has four functional directors besides the chairman and managing director. It also has two government nominee directors and six independent directors. The people with knowledge of the matter said the articles of association of HPCL provide for the board to be made up of a maximum of 20 directors, including independent ones. 
ONGC could theoretically speaking, nominate more than one director but such nomination would have to be matched by an appointment of an equal number of independent directors. So, while ONGC can nominate three directors, it decided to name only one, they added. MRPL and OVL both have just the ONGC chairman and managing director on their board. 
Both MRPL and OVL have managing director and functional directors. Since HPCL by virtue of 51% shareholding of ONGC, continues to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), its board members would continue to be appointed by the government. The people said the only question that remains is of the status of HPCL chairman and managing director. 
While ONGC’s present subsidiaries MRPL and OVL are headed by managing directors with ONGC chairman being the company chairman, there is a thought that HPCL chairman and managing director Mukesh Kumar Surana may be allowed to hold his designation and the Coal India Ltd (CIL) model for governance of subsidiaries is followed. 
CIL, the world’s largest coal producer, is the holding company whose board is headed by a chairman and managing director. It has eight subsidiaries like Eastern Coalfields Ltd and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, all of which have a board headed by chairman and managing director. 
The CMDs of the subsidiaries report to CIL head. The people said if this model is followed, Surana will continue as chairman and managing director of HPCL and would report to ONGC head Shashi Shanker. 
Prior to the stake sale, the government made it clear that HPCL would continue to be a central public sector enterprise (CPSE), retaining its separate identity and brand and will be independently run by its board. The alternate governance model has been thrown up as a large section in ONGC feels that HPCL should be governed on lines of the company’s other subsidiaries like ONGC Videsh Ltd, which have an independent board and a managing director or CEO as heads. These heads of subsidiaries report to ONGC chairman and managing director. 
The people said following the CIL-model of governance will save Surana, who is senior to Shanker, from a designation downgrade."

New Delhi: Shares of State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) gained 2% on Thursday after the company reported its highest profit in 17 quarters on back of higher oil prices.
Fourth-quarter net profit jumped 37% to Rs5,915.12 crore compared to a profit of Rs4,340.18 crore in the same period last year, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
ONGC shares closed at Rs177.35 per share, up 1.95% from its previous close.
The company realised $66.71 for every barrel of crude oil it produced from nominated fields in the quarter, up from $54.91 a barrel it got in 2017 quarter. Gas price realisation was also up 15.6% at $2.89 per million British thermal unit. ONGC’s oil production declined 3% at 6.2 million tonnes in the quarter.

New Delhi: Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) has for the second year in a row beaten Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to become India’s most profitable state-owned company, raising questions over calls for the explorer to subsidise retailers amid soaring petrol and diesel rates. 
New Delhi: Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) has for the second year in a row beaten Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to become India’s most profitable state-owned company, raising questions over calls for the explorer to subsidise retailers amid soaring petrol and diesel rates.
IOC, which has for decades been India’s biggest company by turnover, last week posted a record net profit of Rs21,346 crore in the fiscal year ended 31 March (FY 2017-18), up 12% from Rs19,106 crore in the last fiscal. 
 ONGC on Wednesday reported its FY18 numbers—11.4% rise in net profit to Rs19,945 crore.
Billionaire Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) retained the crown of being India’s most profitable company for the third year in a row, posting highest ever net profit of Rs36,075 crore. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS,)India’s largest software services exporter, with a net profit of Rs25,880 crore was the second most profitable company in the country.
ONGC was for long India’s most profitable company but lost the crown to private sector Reliance and TCS three years back. In fact, its profit was higher than the combined net profit of the three state-owned fuel retailers—IOC, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) but now it is behind IOC.
For 2017-18, HPCL last week reported its highest ever net profit of Rs6,357 crore on a turnover of Rs2.43 trillion. BPCL earlier this week reported a net profit of Rs7,919 crore for the fiscal.
The sustained profitability of the refining and marketing companies has led to some questioning the rationale of asking ONGC to subsidise fuel that IOC, BPCL and HPCL sell. “Look at their profits. They don’t need any subsidy support,"" said a senior ONGC official.
“We are in the capital-intensive business of oil and gas exploration and production which has to be necessarily funded through internal accruals. Unlike refiners, we cannot get loans for risk E&P business,"" he said.
ONGC is investing Rs30,000 crore to Rs35,000 crore annually, which cannot be sustained if it is again asked to subsidise fuel, he insisted. Upstream oil producers, ONGC and Oil India Ltd had until June 2015 provided for up to 40% of the annual fuel subsidy bill. This they did this by way of providing discounts on crude sold to downstream refining and marketing companies, IOC, BPCL, and HPCL. This discount helped the retailers make good a part of the losses they incurred on selling petrol and diesel below cost. 
The idea of upstream producers again subsidising fuel has been mooted after petrol and diesel prices earlier this week hit a record high of Rs78.43 per litre and Rs69.31 respectively. Rates have since marginally cooled but the threat still remains."
115,2018-06-01,ONGC,"The government may ask ONGC to bear fuel subsidy to help cut petrol and diesel prices as it does not want to cut excise duty

New Delhi: The government may ask state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to bear fuel subsidy to help cut petrol and diesel prices, sources said on Thursday. 
New Delhi: The government may ask state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to bear fuel subsidy to help cut petrol and diesel prices, sources said on Thursday.
The government does not want to cut excise duty and is looking at alternative means to reduce petrol and diesel prices that had on Tuesday touched an all-time high of Rs78.43 per litre and Rs69.31 a litre, respectively.
Sources said the alternative in works is to ask ONGC give subsidy to fuel retailers so that they can sell petrol and diesel at below market rates.
Oil producers ONGC and Oil India Ltd had till June 2015 made good as much as 40% of the under-recoveries or subsidy arising out of selling fuel at below market price. The same subsidy sharing in some form is being brought back, they said.
Sources said that meetings to decide on the subsidy sharing mechanism were on and an announcement may come as early as Friday.
ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker, before the news of meeting came to light, said that the company has not heard anything from the government on subsidy sharing.
Petrol and diesel prices have in the last two days have been cut by 8 paisa and 6 paisa a litre, and the government is keen to show a visible reduction which can be possible only if retailers are subsidised. In the previous subsidy sharing scheme, ONGC sold oil to refiners at a discount."
114,2018-06-04,ONGC,"Fears of fuel subsidy sharing are weighing of ONGC share prices even as higher costs blunt impact of elevated crude oil prices

Firm crude oil prices should be good for oil producers. But state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) seems to be an exception. 
Firm crude oil prices should be good for oil producers. But state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) seems to be an exception.
Despite increasing crude prices, ONGC shares have underperformed the Sensex so far in 2018. The stock is hardly pricey at a valuation of 7.3 times estimated earnings, based on Bloomberg data. But, as one analyst points out, “Valuations are immaterial right now given investor fears that subsidy sharing nightmares have emerged again for ONGC given elevated crude oil prices.""
Fears that the company would be asked to bear a part of the subsidy burden weigh on the stock. The government’s budgetary provision for LPG and kerosene for financial year 2019 is  ₹ 20,800 crore. That is inadequate, making it likely that it would lean on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to share the burden, said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. It is also likely that downstream SOEs (BPCL, HPCL and IOC) share a non-trivial portion like they did in FY03-07, added the brokerage.
Uncertainty on this matter will keep investor sentiments jittery, capping gains in ONGC’s share price in the near future. Recent news reports indicate the government is mulling a windfall tax on oil producers at crude prices over $70 a barrel.
Meanwhile, ONGC’s March quarter results announced last week fell short of expectations. Stand-alone net profit at  ₹ 5,915 crore was lower than Street estimates. Higher year-on-year operating costs and exploratory costs written off took a toll on earnings. Higher operating costs were on account of increase in work-over activities and an increase in provisioning for decommissioning of the Panna-Mukta-Tapti field. Workover refers to methods used to improve the productivity of oil wells that have produced for some time.
Further, ONGC’s other income declined by a fifth compared to that of last year, though it was much higher sequentially. Collectively, these factors took away the benefits from better crude oil prices during the quarter. Net crude oil price realizations were $66.7 a barrel, in keeping with expectations and aligned with the general increase in crude prices.
Production performance was discouraging. Crude production declined by 3% last quarter. For financial year 2018, ONGC’s crude production declined marginally by 0.4%. Gas production increased 2.2% for the March quarter, but was a tad lower than expectations. For fiscal 2018, gas production rose 5.8%.
For the stock, while crude prices are the key factor, investors would do well to watch production performance and costs too."

Mumbai/New Delhi: India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), which once had $4.3 billion of funds, is now bleeding cash. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), which once had $4.3 billion of funds, is now bleeding cash.
The state-run company’s cash reserves have shrunk by more than 90% in the past year, after it was ordered to purchase the administration’s stake in a refiner and it paid a record dividend. ONGC’s reserves dropped to about Rs1,000 crore as on 31 March from nearly Rs13,000 crore a year earlier, according to data complied by Bloomberg.
ONGC’s largest shareholder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, has been tapping state-run companies including India’s biggest energy explorer to bridge its fiscal deficit. That’s left the company with depleting cash at a time when it has been ordered to boost investment to help cut the nation’s crude imports. ONGC paid Rs42,600 crore last fiscal year as dividend to the government and to buy its stake in the refiner.
“ONGC is heavily leveraged now,"" Aloke Kumar Banerjee, the company’s former finance head, said in an interview. “It’s important for exploration companies to have sizable cash balance as buffer. It’s a high-risk business.""
The energy explorer’s shares have fallen 17% from a January high. They dropped as much as 0.6% at 9:51 am in Mumbai, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex gained 0.4%. The company’s spokesman declined to comment on its falling cash levels.
ONGC aims to spend Rs86,000 crore on 31 big projects to boost oil and gas production, according to its website. The company has started work on its largest-ever exploration project that will require investments of more than $5 billion over about four years.
Earlier this year, ONGC sold debt for the first time to pay for the Rs36,920 crore acquisition of the government’s holding in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL). Its capital expenditure swelled to a record Rs72,900 crore in the year ended 31 March as it also invested Rs28,350 crore on exploration and production, and Rs7,480 crore to buy a stake in a block operated by Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.(GSPC), according to the company’s website.
ONGC has about Rs25,000 crore of one-year loans maturing in January, according to company officials, who asked not to be identified as they are not allowed to speak to the media. It used up cash it had for capital expenditure and the acquisitions and needs about Rs2,100 crore more for the final dividend payout for the year ended March, the officials said.
The company officials said that ONGC has no plans to raise more debt to fund its capital expenditure of Rs32,000 crore in the current fiscal that started 1 April. Cash flows through the year will suffice, they said.
In the past, ONGC has been asked to share fuel subsidies by selling oil to refiners at a discount, a burden that was taken entirely off its back only in the year ended March 2017.
Despite these pressures ONGC ’s credit rating remains good, primarily because it is majority owned by the government, which means a sovereign assurance and easier access to the domestic banking system.
Moody’s Investors Service has a very high investment grade rating on ONGC, Vikas Halan, senior vice president at the ratings company said in an interview. “In terms of financial ability, they have access to the banking sector in India unlike anybody else."""

The investors would get a 2.5% discount over the Bharat-22 price.
“The government is aiming at mopping up  ₹ 6,000 crore, with a green-shoe option to retain another  ₹ 2,400 crore from the Bharat-22 ETF follow on offer to be launched on 19 June,"" a finance ministry official said.
The second part of Bharat-22 ETF would also help the government in meeting the minimum public holding norm in PSUs like Coal India Ltd.
The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC Ltd, Axis Bank Ltd and Larsen and Toubro Ltd. The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs14,500 crore.
The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat-22 ETF stock include Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), Indian Oil Ltd, State Bank of India, Coal India and Nalco.
The other PSUs on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks—SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda—figure in the Bharat-22 index.
The government plans to raise Rs80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs1 trillion raised last year.
On Tuesday, the government had through a public notice said it will divest 12% stake in railway consultancy firm RITES through an IPO which will be launched on 20 June.
Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 blue-chip stocks—ONGC, Coal India, Indian Oil, GAIL (India) Ltd, Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.
Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised  ₹ 11,500 crore in three tranches— ₹ 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014,  ₹ 6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and  ₹ 2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."

New Delhi: The government has deferred the bidding for 60 oil and gas fields being offered in the second round of bidding for discovered small field (DSF) by a month. DSF-II was supposed to be launched around mid-June, but it won’t happen before July, a senior government official said.  
New Delhi: The government has deferred the bidding for 60 oil and gas fields being offered in the second round of bidding for discovered small field (DSF) by a month. DSF-II was supposed to be launched around mid-June, but it won’t happen before July, a senior government official said. 
He, however, did not give a reason for delaying the bid round. The government had in 2016 brought a new DSF policy, offering “idle"" small discovered fields of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) in an auction on liberalised terms including marketing and pricing freedom and lower taxes. 
The union cabinet had in February approved the second round of DSF auctions, under which the government is offering a total of 60 discovered small fields with an estimated 194.65 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MMtoe). These discoveries have been clubbed into 26 contract areas spread over 8 sedimentary basins, he said. “DSF-II will be launched soon."" 
Features of DSF-II include a single licence for conventional and unconventional hydrocarbon and prior technical experience not being a pre-qualification criterion. Also, there is no payment of upfront signature bonus, and fields would be awarded to the bidder agreeing to pay the highest share of oil and gas produced from the fields. 
Besides, full marketing and pricing freedom has been guaranteed and royalty rates have been cut, he said. Of the 60 fields which will be up for auctions, 22 fields belong to ONGC, five to OIL and 12 are relinquished discovered fields from the new exploration and licensing policy (NELP) blocks. 
In DSF-I launched in May 2016, 46 contract areas consisting of 67 discovered fields spread across nine sedimentary basins were auctioned. The auctions attracted 134 e-bids for 34 contact areas of the 46 offered. 
Later, 22 companies were shortlisted for 31 contract areas of which 15 companies were new entrants with no prior experience in the sector. 
The official said 21 fields which did not receive any investor interest in DSF-I will also be part of the second DSF round. 
Post the February decision of the cabinet, an empowered committee of secretaries (ECS) comprising of secretary (petroleum & natural gas), secretary (expenditure) and law secretary were to finalise and approve model revenue sharing contract, notice inviting offer (NIO) and other documents for DSF round-II. Not all the documents have been approved by the competent authority, the official added. 
To expedite award, the cabinet had authorised minister of petroleum and natural gas and minister of finance to approve of the winners based on the recommendations of the ECS."

New Delhi: The board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has given in-principle approval for exploring options for a restructuring of the group firms including the merger of subsidiaries MRPL and HPCL.  
New Delhi: The board of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has given in-principle approval for exploring options for a restructuring of the group firms including the merger of subsidiaries MRPL and HPCL. 
The India’s largest oil and gas producer, ONGC has several subsidiaries and joint ventures including two in refining sector—Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd and two petrochemical units—ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL) and ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd. It also has an overseas investment arm in ONGC Videsh Ltd. 
“The board of directors of ONGC, at the 308th meeting held on 29 June, accorded its in-principle approval for exploring options for the restructuring of ONGC group companies,"" the company said in a regulatory filing. 
While ONGC did not provide details of the proposed restructuring, people aware of the development in the company said an advisor would be appointed to suggest possible options. 
The board of the company will take a call on the options suggested by the advisor. ONGC is looking at trimming down the structure by merging some of the subsidiaries. 
While MRPL operates a 15 million tonnes a year refinery at Mangalore in Karnataka, HPCL has two refineries at Mumbai and Vizag. OPaL has built at Rs32,000 crore petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat, while ONGC Tripura Power Co Ltd (OTPC) operates a 726 MW power plant at Palatana in Tripura.
It also has two SEZ companies—Dahej SEZ Ltd and Mangalore SEZ Ltd. Also, it has a pipeline company in Petronet MHB Ltd and a stake in helicopter service operator, Pawan Hans Ltd as well as Petronet LNG Ltd. 
People privy of the matter said while there is certainly a case for merger of MRPL with HPCL for not just business synergies but also help avoid penalties from market regulator SEBI for not meeting public float requirement in case of the former. 
Also, some other units too can be combined. In the regulatory filing, ONGC referred to the acquisition of government’s stake in HPCL earlier this year as part of government’s proposal to create a public sector ‘oil major’ which will be able to match the performance of international and domestic private sector oil and gas companies. 
ONGC has in past spoken of benefits of bringing all refining business under one company. HPCL management too has supported taking over MRPL to create India’s second-biggest public sector oil refining firm. 
“The restructuring proposal shall safeguard the overall interest of the public shareholders of all ONGC group companies,"" ONGC said. The restructuring, it said, would be done taking into account the need for better value creation and synergy among group firms. 
Also, it would be done to meet the minimum public shareholding requirement in case of MRPL. SEBI’s listing rules require a minimum public float of 25 per cent. In case of MRPL, the float is less than 11.5%. 
“The implementation of any such restructuring proposal shall be subject to the approval of the Government of India, the board of directors of the relevant companies and other stakeholders of such companies in terms of applicable laws,"" ONGC said."
109,2018-07-09,ONGC,"ONGC is targeting a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day within two years of the start of production

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has pushed back the start of natural gas production from its biggest project in KG basin to December 2019 as it reworked the $5.07 billion development to accommodate new policies like goods and services tax (GST) and local purchase preference rules.  
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) has pushed back the start of natural gas production from its biggest project in KG basin to December 2019 as it reworked the $5.07 billion development to accommodate new policies like goods and services tax (GST) and local purchase preference rules. 
When ONGC Board had on 28 March 2016, approved investing $5.07 billion in bringing to production a cluster of discoveries in Bay of Bengal block KG-DWN-98/2 or KG-D5, the first gas was targeted for June 2019 and first oil was to flow by March 2020. But now, first gas is expected by December 2019 and oil by March 2021, according to the revised dates presented to the company’s board late last month. 
“These are not new dates. They were out a couple of months back and we gave an update of the project to the board at its meeting on 29 June,"" ONGC director (Offshore) Rajesh Kakkar said. 
The revised dates were set when ONGC spudded the first of the 34 wells under the project on 8 April this year. While the ONGC Board had in March 2016 approved a field development plan for Cluster-II discoveries in the block that sits next to Reliance Industries’ flagging KG-D6 block in Krishna Godavari basin, new policies like local purchase preference rules, including the one that mandates PSUs to source domestic iron and steel for infrastructure projects were formulated last year. 
GST, which made sweeping changes in indirect taxation regime, was rolled out in July 2017. Also, a policy has been formulated to give public enterprises purchase preference if their bid is within 10% of the lowest price, officials said. 
ONGC is targeting a peak oil output of 77,305 barrels per day within two years of the start of production. Gas output is slated to peak to 16.56 million standard cubic metres per day by 2022. This the second time that target deadlines for KG-D5 production have been pushed back. 
 ONGC had in 2014 announced plans to start gas production from 2018 and oil by 2019 but a final investment decision was made contingent upon government approving a remunerative price for the deep-sea block as the prevalent rates were uneconomical. 
But, it was not before March 2016 that the government announced a new pricing formula for difficult areas, giving developers of deep sea fields like KG-D5 more than double the domestic rate. 
Immediately after that ONGC Board approved the investment plan for Cluster-II group of discoveries in KG-D5. 
The 7,294.6 sq km deepsea KG-D5 block has been broadly categorised into Northern Discovery Area (NDA - 3,800.6 sq km) and Southern Discovery Area (SDA - 3,494 sq km). The NDA has 11 oil and gas discoveries, while SDA has the nation’s only ultra-deepsea gas find of UD-1. 
These finds have been clubbed in three groups—Cluster-1, Cluster-II and Cluster-III. Gas discovery in Cluster-I is to be tied up with finds in neighbouring G-4 block for production but this is not being taken up because of a dispute with RIL over the migration of gas from ONGC blocks. 
For now, Cluster-II is being developed at a cost of $5.07 billion, officials said, adding that completion of the entire development plans is expected by August 2021. Cluster-2A mainly comprises oil finds of A2, P1, M3, M1 and G-2-2 in NDA which can produce 77,305 bpd (3.86 million tonnes per annum) and 3.81 mmscmd of gas. Cluster 2B, which is made up of four gas finds—R1, U3, U1, and A1 in NDA—envisages a peak output of 12.75 mmscmd of gas. Peak output is likely to last 7 years.
Cluster-3 is the UD-1 gas discovery in SDA. UD-1 lies in the water depth of 2,400-3,200 metres and its development would be taken up after an appropriate technology is found."
108,2018-07-18,ONGC,"The  ONGC board has approved exiting helicopter service provider Pawan Hans by selling its entire 49% stake as it looks to cut debt and consolidate resources in its core oil and gas business

New Delhi/Mumbai: The board of ONGC has approved exiting helicopter service provider Pawan Hans by selling its entire 49% stake as it looks to cut debt and consolidate resources in its core oil and gas business, officials with direct knowledge of the development said.  
New Delhi/Mumbai: The board of ONGC has approved exiting helicopter service provider Pawan Hans by selling its entire 49% stake as it looks to cut debt and consolidate resources in its core oil and gas business, officials with direct knowledge of the development said. 
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) wants its interest to be clubbed with the 51% government stake that is already on offer for sale, they said. 
The Department of Disinvestment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which floated the offer for sale for the government’s 51% stake in Pawan Hans twice in the last 10 months, is likely to issue an amended expression of interest (EoI) shortly. 
Officials said ONGC of the view that its investment in Pawan Hans is no longer strategic as it charter hires helicopters to ferry staff to its oil and gas locations, mostly offshore, through competitive bidding. Of the 22 helicopters it currently has on hire, just seven or less than a third are from Pawan Hans. Pawan Hans owns a fleet of 46 helicopters. 
“The board of directors of ONGC, at the 308th meeting held on 29 June, accorded its in-principle approval for exploring options for the restructuring of ONGC group companies, including exiting some with a view to consolidating business,"" an official said. “The idea being to focus resources on core oil and gas exploration and production business and not scatter bandwidth of the management in unrelated businesses,"" the official added. 
Officials said when the government had first floated an offer to sell its 51% stake in October last year, ONGC made an offer to DIPAM that its 49% stake be also sold on the same terms. At that time, the company was told to get its board to approve. 
The government in early April withdrew its offer for sale as only two bidders, Indian helicopter major Global Vectra Helicorp and US-based Continental Helicopters, made an offer. A revised offer for sale was floated later that month, which fetched about half-a-dozen bidders. 
ONGC, they said, has written to the government that its stake can be sold on the same terms, but the DIPAM was of the view that a revised offer for sale would have to be floated as some bidders will now prefer to bid when 100% stake is being offered. 
Sources said the re-floating the offer for sale is likely to delay further the government’s plans to offload its entire 51% holding in the profit-making JV. “ONGC has written to the civil aviation ministry that it does not want to continue in the joint venture and would want to sell its entire holding in it along with the government,"" a Pawan Hans source said. 
Pawan Hans operates seven Dauphin N3 Helicopters for ONGC’s offshore operations. These helicopters, based at Juhu airport, Mumbai, and Rajahmundry, undertake passenger crew change service and production trips on a regular basis to meet the offshore requirements of the state-owned oil and gas producer. 
“ONGC wanted to exit the JV along with the government, but it was told to first get its board approval, which is now in place. The government will now modify the EoI and include ONGC stake sale along with its own,"" an ONGC official said."
107,2018-07-18,ONGC,"Income tax benefits have now been extended to all the 28 oil and gas fields awarded before the advent of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1999

New Delhi: The cabinet on Wednesday tweaked pre-1999 oil and gas contracts to provide for proportionate sharing of statutory levies like royalty and cess among the operators of an area, and not put the entire burden on state-owned ONGC. 
New Delhi: The cabinet on Wednesday tweaked pre-1999 oil and gas contracts to provide for proportionate sharing of statutory levies like royalty and cess among the operators of an area, and not put the entire burden on state-owned ONGC.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) also extended the special dispensation of marketing and pricing freedom to natural gas produced from areas in the northeastern region, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan told reporters in New Delhi.
Besides, income tax benefits have now been extended to all the 28 oil and gas fields awarded before the advent of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) in 1999.
The decisions would unlock investments and boost oil and gas production, Pradhan said.
The government, he said, had awarded some discovered oil and gas fields to private firms in the 1990s with a view to attracting investments in the country. To incentivise such investments, the liability of payment of statutory levies like royalty and cess was placed on state-owned firms, which were made licensees of the blocks.
ONGC and Oil India Ltd were allowed to take interest of 30-40% in the fields, but were liable to pay 100% of the statutory levies. This, Pradhan said, led to fresh investments being stalled as the state-owned firms were not keen on incurring bigger liabilities.
To correct this, the CCEA has decided that “statutory levies, including royalty and cess, will now be shared in proportion to the participating interest of the contractor in pre-NELP exploration blocks"", he said and added that this would affect seven such fields.
Also, the levy has been made cost recoverable with prospective effect. Like capital and operating expense, the statutory levies can now be first recovered from the sale of hydrocarbons before sharing profits with the government.
These are the conditions that ONGC had insisted upon in 2010 when Vedanta bought Cairn Energy’s 70% stake in the Barmer basin oil block in Rajasthan. ONGC, which held a 30% stake in the block, gave its approval to the deal only after Vedanta agreed to pay its share of royalty and cess.
The royalty for an on-land block is 20%. An equivalent amount of cess is also levied."

104,2018-08-01,ONGC,"The dispute pertains to a $1.55 billion penalty imposed on RIL and its partners by the Indian government over allegedly exploiting gas reserves belonging to ONGC in the course of their own drilling activities

New Delhi: In a major victory for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), controlled by Mukesh Ambani, and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources Ltd, an international tribunal has awarded in their favour in the gas migration dispute with the Indian government. 
New Delhi: In a major victory for Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), controlled by Mukesh Ambani, and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources Ltd, an international tribunal has awarded in their favour in the gas migration dispute with the Indian government.
In addition, the tribunal also awarded costs of $8.3 million to be paid by the government to the consortium.
The dispute pertains to a $1.55 billion penalty imposed on RIL and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources Ltd by the Indian government over allegedly exploiting gas reserves belonging to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. (ONGC) in the course of their own drilling activities. The adjacent deepwater fields in question are RIL’s D6 field (KG-DWN-98/3) coast and ONGC’s KG-DWN-98/2 block, in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin off India’s east coast. RIL and its partners BP Plc and Niko Resources Ltd together own the D6 block. 
“All the contentions of the consortium have been upheld by the majority with a finding that the consortium was entitled to produce all gas from its contract area and all claims made by the Government of India have been rejected. The consortium is not liable to pay any amount to the Government of India,"" RIL said in a filing to the stock exchanges on late Tuesday evening. 
The petroleum ministry had raised the demand on 4 November 2016, giving RIL one month to pay up, after the justice A.P. Shah panel told the ministry on 31 August that RIL should make up for the “unfair enrichment"" it had obtained by way of retaining the gains of gas that seeped into its field from that of ONGC.
“An international arbitration panel has issued an award in favour of Reliance, BP & Niko (Consortium) rejecting completely the claims of the Government of India against the Consortium in respect of migrated gas, by a majority of 2 to 1,"" the RIL statement added.
While an ONGC spokesperson did not immediately comment on the issue, a petroleum ministry spokesperson couldn’t be reached. 
According to a report by DeGolyer and MacNaughton, a US-based consultancy selected by both ONGC and RIL, which was relied upon by the Shah panel for confirmation of the gas flow between the blocks, about 11 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas migrated to KG D6 from adjacent fields between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2015, of which 8.9 bcm was tapped by RIL.
ONGC has been unable to produce from the deepwater field off the coast of Andhra Pradesh and is scouting for a partner after Norway’s Statoil ASA and Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) quit the consortium. ONGC has been battling concerns over its production capabilities and diminishing yields at its ageing oil fields. Most of the company’s domestic fields are more than 30 years old."

New Delhi: State-owned ONGC on Thursday reported its highest quarterly net profit in over four-and-a-half-years on sharp rise in prices for oil and gas it produced. 
New Delhi: State-owned ONGC on Thursday reported its highest quarterly net profit in over four-and-a-half-years on sharp rise in prices for oil and gas it produced.
Its net profit of  ₹ 6,143.88 crore in the first quarter of the 2018-19 fiscal was 58.1% higher than  ₹ 3,884.73 crore in the year-ago period, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) said in a statement here. The net profit is highest since December 2013 when earnings had hit  ₹ 7,126 crore.
 ONGC realised $71.48 for every barrel of crude oil it produced in the April-June quarter of the current fiscal, up 47.6% over $48.42 a barrel in the year-ago period.
For natural gas, it got  ₹ 3.06 per million British thermal unit as compared to  ₹ 2.48 per mmBtu. ONGC said its crude oil production dropped 5.3% to 5 million tonnes in the quarter. This was partly made up by a 2.5% rise in output from joint venture fields, that pumped 0.8 million tonnes oil. 
Natural gas production was however 3.4% higher at 5.9 billion cubic metres. Its revenue from operations rose 42.7% to  ₹ 27,212.83 crore for the quarter under review.
The country’s largest oil and gas producer said it deposited  ₹ 2,695 crore service tax and GST under protest as it believes such taxes are not applicable on royalty paid by the firm to the government. 
Oil producers like ONGC are required to pay 12.5% royalty on crude oil to the state governments for on-land areas and at 10% to the central government for shallow water areas. The tax department is seeking payment of service tax on these royalty payments.
“In the year 2017-18, the company had received show-cause notices at various work centres on account of service tax along with interest and penalty, on royalty on crude oil and natural gas levied under Oil Field (Regulation & Development) Act, 1948,"" ONGC said.
ONGC said it had worked out service tax for the period from 1 April 2016 to 30 June 2017 along with interest of  ₹ 2,294 crore. Further, GST along with interest thereon has been worked out of  ₹ 1,608 crore.
“Based on legal opinion obtained by the company, service tax/GST on royalty is not applicable. The company is contesting the same at appropriate authorities and accordingly the same is considered as a contingent liability. However, as an abundant caution, the company has deposited service tax, GST, and interest under protest amounting to  ₹ 2,695 crore,"" ONGC said."
102,2018-08-05,ONGC,"ONGC is ready to sell its entire 49% stake Pawan Hans, which is 51% held by the government

New Delhi: The government will soon invite fresh bids for 100% stake sale in Pawan Hans by issuing an addendum to the disinvestment document as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. of India Ltd (ONGC) is ready to sell its entire stake in the company, an official said. Helicopter services provider Pawan Hans is a joint venture of the government, which holds 51% stake, and state-owned ONGC, which owns the remaining 49% shareholding. Pawans Hans has a fleet of 46 choppers. 
New Delhi: The government will soon invite fresh bids for 100% stake sale in Pawan Hans by issuing an addendum to the disinvestment document as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. of India Ltd (ONGC) is ready to sell its entire stake in the company, an official said. Helicopter services provider Pawan Hans is a joint venture of the government, which holds 51% stake, and state-owned ONGC, which owns the remaining 49% shareholding. Pawans Hans has a fleet of 46 choppers.
On 13 April, the government had issued the information memorandum for the 51% strategic stake sale in Pawan Hans and had sought Expression of Interest (EoI) from interested bidders by 18 June. About half a dozen bidders are believed to have submitted bids.
On 2 July, ONGC wrote to the government saying that its board has resolved that it would prefer to exit Pawan Hans simultaneously with the government. Against this backdrop, the senior government official said an addendum to the existing document would be issued soon, seeking bids for 100% stake in Pawan Hans.
“An addendum would be issued to the EoI (Expression of Interest) document issued on 13 April. The addendum would state that ONGC has expressed its interest in selling its 49% holding and fresh bids can be put in for the entire 100% stake,"" the official told PTI.
According to the official, the existing bids for the government’s 51% stake would stay. “We want to give other investors a chance in case they want to bid for entire 100% stake,"" the official added.
SBI Capital Markets is the transaction advisor for strategic disinvestment of Pawan Hans.
The government had first floated an offer to sell its 51% stake in October last year, but in view of subdued response from bidders, the EoI was withdrawn in April this year. At that time, some investors had suggested that the government and ONGC should sell their stakes together.
“Potential investors had then suggested that ONGC’s 49% stake too should be sold along with government’s 51%. They feared that ONGC holding 49% could mean government interference in some way,"" the official said.
Later on 13 April, the government came out with a fresh information memorandum for the strategic sale of Pawan Hans wherein bidders need to have a minimum net worth of  ₹  500 crore.
Among others, Pawan Hans provides seven choppers to ONGC for its offshore helicopter requirements for crew change and production tasks, including night ambulance."
100,2018-08-07,ONGC,"The Empowered Committee of Secretaries has cleared award of blocks offered in OALP-1, the recommendations will now go to ministers of finance and petroleum for approval

New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd is likely to bag as many as 40 oil and gas exploration blocks in India’s maiden open acreage auction, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 
New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd is likely to bag as many as 40 oil and gas exploration blocks in India’s maiden open acreage auction, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.
An Empowered Committee of Secretaries (ECS) has cleared award of blocks offered in OALP-1, bidding for which closed on 2 May. The recommendations of the panel will now go to ministers of finance and petroleum for approval, they said.
The Union Cabinet had in April delegated its power to ministers of finance and petroleum to award oil and gas blocks to their winners in the Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) auction.
At the close of the bidding on 2 May, Vedanta’s oil and gas arm, Cairn India had bid for all the 55 blocks on offer while state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. State-owned Oil India Ltd (OIL) bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion.
Sources said while Vedanta is likely to walk away with 40 blocks, ONGC may get two or a maximum of three areas. Hindustan Oil Exploration Co (HOEC) is likely to get one while OIL may get around half a dozen blocks. They said the award of the blocks is awaiting the finance minister’s nod. 
Piyush Goyal is officiating as the finance minister as Arun Jaitley recuperates from a renal transplant. It is being speculated that Jaitley may be back in office as early as next week and may clear the OALP-1 bids.
When the bids closed on 2 May, Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor in the remaining. Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders. 
Neither local giants Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. 
India had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice with a view to bringing about 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. 
Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is presently not under any production or exploration license. The EoIs can be put in any time of the year but they are accumulated twice annually. 
As many as 55 blocks were sought for prospecting of oil and gas by prospective bidders, mostly by state-owned explorers, ONGC and OIL, and private sector Vedanta by the end of the first EoI cycle on 15 November 2017, they said.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a 5-mark advantage.
The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to about 1,02,000 sq km being under exploration currently, they said. Blocks would be awarded to the company which offers highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells.
Increased exploration would lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030. Import dependence has increased since 2015 when Modi had set the target.
India currently imports 81% of its oil needs. The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from production sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block. The government till now has been selecting and demarcating areas it feels can be offered for bidding in an exploration licensing round.
 So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bid round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded. But as many as 156 have already been relinquished due to poor prospectivity."
101,2018-08-07,ONGC,"Reliance Naval tellsBombay high court that ONGC has refused to take delivery of eighth vessel, invokes a bank guarantee

Mumbai: Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd has approached the Bombay high court against Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) after the explorer ended a deal for the supply of a dozen vessels to support offshore oil exploration. In its petition, the firm controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd said ONGC has refused to take delivery of the eighth vessel and also invoked a bank guarantee. 
Mumbai: Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd has approached the Bombay high court against Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) after the explorer ended a deal for the supply of a dozen vessels to support offshore oil exploration. In its petition, the firm controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd said ONGC has refused to take delivery of the eighth vessel and also invoked a bank guarantee.
The company, a part of billionaire Anil Ambani’s diversified Reliance Group, is seeking a refund of more than $6.6 million (about  ₹  45 crore), which ONGC has invoked as performance bank guarantee, along with $15.46 million (about  ₹  105 crore) as payment for the eighth offshore support vessel (OSV) that it built for India’s largest explorer.
Reliance Naval also sought the court’s intervention to direct ONGC to take delivery of the eighth vessel.
Reliance Naval said in its plea that ONGC had in 2008 floated a tender to build and supply the dozen vessels. At that point in time, erstwhile private shipbuilder Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co. Ltd had entered into an agreement with Singapore-based Jurong Shipyard Pte Ltd to meet the eligibility criteria for technical support to build the vessels.
The contract was bagged by Pipavav in 2009. On 4 March 2015, Reliance Defence Systems, a unit of Reliance Infrastructure, acquired Pipavav Defence—then India’s largest shipyard with a licence to build warships—and rechristened it Reliance Naval and Engineering Ltd.
However, in June 2016, ONGC informed Reliance Naval that it needs to execute a fresh memorandum of understanding with Jurong Shipyard for continuing technical support. However, Reliance responded that all trials concerning the eighth ship have been completed and it also provided the progress report for the remaining four vessels.
Reliance Naval, in its subsequent responses, told ONGC the technical pact with Jurong Shipyard is still binding and, therefore, a new agreement isn’t needed. In June 2017, Jurong Shipyard and Reliance Naval entered into an amendment agreement with regards to technical support. The firm had also sought an extension of a year to June 2019 to deliver remaining vessels. However, ONGC categorically informed the shipbuilder that the only reason the eighth ship was not accepted because of change of name issue and the company’s “alleged inability to substantiate Jurong Shipyard’s contribution to the project"". Also, in June 2018, ONGC informed Reliance Naval that the name change has not been accepted by them and also the company is not in a position to give any further extension.
“We would like to inform that ONGC has issued a letter dated July 30, 2018, for termination of an old contract dated 16th October 2009 for the supply of 5 out of 12 offshore support vessels,"" Reliance Naval informed the stock exchanges on 2 August. “As advised, the termination of the aforesaid contract is arbitrary. The company has taken and will take all necessary steps and actions to protect its rights,"" it further added.
According to the Bombay high court’s website, a division bench of Justice R.M. Borde and Justice V.M. Deshpande will hear the matter on 9 August.
An emailed query to ONGC did not elicit any response. Nishit Dhruva, managing partner of law firm MDP and Partners who is advising ONGC along with senior counsel Kevic Setalvad, confirmed the filing of the case by Reliance Naval, but declined to divulge any details since the matter is sub judice.
A spokesperson for Reliance Naval declined to comment on the issue as the matter is in the court. Senior counsel, Venkatesh Dhond who is representing Reliance Naval along with law firm Mulla & Mulla & Craigie Blunt & Caroe said the company wants to fulfil the contract to deliver all 12 vessels but declined to elaborate.
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."

New Delhi: Virtually rejecting ONGC’s demand, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) has said it is acting as per its understanding of the statute in not recognising the new majority shareholder as its promoter.  
New Delhi: Virtually rejecting ONGC’s demand, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) has said it is acting as per its understanding of the statute in not recognising the new majority shareholder as its promoter. 
“Whatever we are doing, whatever we have done and whatever we will be doing will be as per our understanding of the statute and the guidelines and Companies Act and the SEBI guidelines... Beyond that who is interpreting whatever, it is his understanding of the situation. We need not subscribe to that,"" HPCL chairman and managing director Mukesh Kumar Surana told reporters here. 
He was asked about ONGC seeking recognition as the promoter of the company post-acquisition of majority stake in HPCL. Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had in January this year bought the government’s entire 51.11% stake in HPCL for  ₹ 36,915 crore. 
Post that, HPCL had become a subsidiary of ONGC. But HPCL in its regulatory filing to the stock exchanges, the latest being on July 12, still lists ‘President of India’ as the promoter with ‘zero’ % shareholding. ONGC, on the other hand, is listed under ‘Public Shareholder’. 
ONGC has written to HPCL management asking it to take steps to rectify the filings to reflect the true promoter of the company. Asked about ONGC’s request, Surana said, “Everybody is free to express their views... Our actions will be guided by what we think is right.""
Since ONGC takeover in January, HPCL has made two stock exchange filings about the shareholding pattern of the company -- the first on April 20 and then on July 12. In both, ONGC is shown as the public shareholder and President of India listed as the promoter. 
Sources said ONGC feels the HPCL management is bound to take corrective action to reflect the true picture. According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company. 
When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought government’s stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter’s promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL). 
Surana has retained the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs. ONGC’s overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. 
ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies. Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm’s board. ONGC has appointed its Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar to HPCL board. He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas. 
Prior to this, HPCL had two government nominee directors—Rath and Sandeep Poundrik, Joint Secretary (Refineries) of the Oil Ministry. After the appointment of Kumar, there remains only one government nominee director on HPCL board."

Mumbai: The country’s largest oil exploration and production company, Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), is in talks to buy five blocks from the Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (GSPC), according to two people aware of the development. 
The move comes against the backdrop of ONGC acquiring an 80% stake in GSPC’s Deen Dayal block in the Krishna Godavari Basin in December 2016 for  ₹ 7,738 crore. The Gujarat government owns an 87% in GSPC. 
“GSPC has decided to farm out all non-operated blocks and has thus approached ONGC to take complete ownership of the blocks that they are partners in. There are five such blocks. ONGC is evaluating the blocks,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity. He declined to comment on the valuation of the blocks as talks are still on. 
GSPC did not reply to an email till press time, while an ONGC spokesperson declined to comment. 
GSPC holds a participating interest in 24 blocks, of which 20 are onshore and four offshore. Seventeen onshore blocks are producing properties. Of the 24 blocks held, GSPC is an operator in six blocks and a non-operating partner in 18. The blocks under consideration include four in Gujarat’s Cambay basin—CB-ONN-2004/1 (ONGC 60%), CB-ONN-2004/2 (ONGC 55%), CB-ONN-2004/3 (ONGC 65%), and CB-ONN-2009/4 (ONGC 50%)—and one in Mumbai basin, MB-OSN-2005-1 (ONGC 80%). 
“ONGC has agreed to evaluate the blocks, but if it declines to buy, GSPC will seek the interest of other exploration and production companies. GSPC plans to close the sale by November,"" said the second person mentioned above, also requesting anonymity. 
The stake sale is part of GSPC’s attempt to reduce debt on its books. The company had invested $3.5 billion (approximately  ₹ 20,000 crore) in the Deen Dayal block, which burdened the company with debt. Sale proceeds from the block have been used to pare debt.
To further reduce debt, GSPC had revived its plans last August to sell stakes in 20 of its onshore oil and gas blocks. The company had in 2016, hired consulting firm EY to prepare a report on the blocks for the proposed stake sale. 
“GSPC has been undergoing a business restructuring, advised by investment banker SBI Capital Markets. The sale of these blocks could be part of the same process,"" the second person added. 
In March, GSPC sold a 28.4% stake in Gujarat Gas Ltd, its city gas distribution business, to its subsidiary Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL). This helped it reduce its  ₹ 16,500 crore debt by more than  ₹ 3,250 crore. Both Gujarat Gas and GSPL are subsidiaries of GSPC."

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) will not sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd and GAIL (India) Ltd in the near future as it has used internal resources to repay close to a third of the  ₹  24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), people with direct knowledge of the matter said. ONGC had in January received government approval to sell its 13.77% stake in Indian Oil and 4.86% stake in GAIL to help fund the  ₹  36,915 crore acquisition of HPCL.

Ltd and GAIL (India) Ltd in the near future as it has used internal resources to repay close to a third of the  ₹  24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL), people with direct knowledge of the matter said. ONGC had in January received government approval to sell its 13.77% stake in Indian Oil and 4.86% stake in GAIL to help fund the  ₹  36,915 crore acquisition of HPCL.
“Indian Oil shares were trading at around  ₹  195 in January and it is now at  ₹  159 (Friday’s closing). It doesn’t make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,"" this person said, requesting anonymity.
At Friday’s closing price of  ₹  159.60, ONGC’s shareholding in Indian Oil would be worth  ₹  21,343 crore as against  ₹  26,200 crore in January. At Friday’s closing price of  ₹  387.25, ONGC’s shareholding in GAIL was worth  ₹  4,244 crore.
“We are generating enough resources internally thanks to a rebound in oil prices. We used these to bring down the borrowing for HPCL acquisition to  ₹  20,000-21,000 crore in the first quarter and are repaying another  ₹  3,000-4,000 crore in the current quarter. Effectively, we have repaid  ₹  7,800 crore,"" the person said.
ONGC had borrowed  ₹  24,881 crores on a short-term loan to fund buying the government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.
According to the person quoted above, the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then.
Initially, ONGC considered selling its stake in Indian Oil and GAIL India to fund the acquisition, but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said.
The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.
ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for selling Indian Oil and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10% discount to the prevailing price. ONGC thus decided against the share sale.
ONGC’s purchase of HPCL created India’s first integrated oil company. This was ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its  ₹  7,738 crore acquisition of 80% stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.’s KG basin gas block.
HPCL added 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after Indian Oil and Reliance Industries Ltd.
ONGC already is majority owner of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which has a 15-million tonne refinery."

The move to float the unit—which has investments in 11 producing assets in countries including Russia, Brazil and Iran—is part of a government push to sell state-assets to raise funds. 
New Delhi: The government has asked its biggest state-owned firm Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to list its overseas unit ONGC Videsh Ltd, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The move to float the unit—which has investments in 11 producing assets in countries including Russia, Brazil and Iran—is part of a government push to sell state-assets to raise funds.
A listing would also help unlock value in the unit by improving its corporate governance and efficiency, the letter from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management to ONGC said. The letter, sent last week, did not state how much of ONGC should be offered to outside investors.
The letter said any state-owned firm with a positive net worth and no accumulated loss should be listed to unlock value. The listing would help the government meet its divestment targets and make up for a failed plan earlier this year to sell a stake in Air India.
The Narendra Modi-led government has a target to raise a record  ₹ 1 trillion from the sale of state assets in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019.
India holds a 67.45% stake in ONGC Videsh’s parent ONGC and gains from a listing could be transferred to the government via a special dividend.
At 12.04pm, ONGC shares rose 0.30% to  ₹ 169.05 per share on BSE.
ONGC Videsh, 100% owned by ONGC, suffered losses during the low crude price environment between 2014 and 2017 but its earnings have since recovered. The firm posted a net profit of $152 million and contributed 5% to ONGC’s overall net earnings in the latest fiscal year ended March 2018.
ONGC Videsh was formed in 1965 to help India expand its overseas footprint."

Mumbai: The impending merger of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) may put a break on MRPL’s fuel retailing expansion plans, leaving its parent Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to fulfil these ambitions through HPCL, said two officials aware of the development.  
Mumbai: The impending merger of state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) may put a break on MRPL’s fuel retailing expansion plans, leaving its parent Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) to fulfil these ambitions through HPCL, said two officials aware of the development. 
MRPL is a wholly owned subsidiary of ONGC and operates a 15 million tonnes per annum refinery in Mangalore, Karnataka. This January, ONGC acquired the government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL through an all-cash deal of  ₹ 36,915 crore. 
“MRPL has six fuel retail outlets. At best it can expand to a few more. But HPCL has 15,127 retail outlets. MRPL can never match that. Though MRPL is not competing with HPCL, in all probability, ONGC’s retail ambitions will be fulfilled with HPCL now onboard,"" said one of the officials mentioned above.
Post merger with HPCL, the fuel retail outlets of MRPL could be rebranded as HPCL’s. MRPL’s retail outlets are called HiQ, he said. 
Currently, MRPL relies on oil marketing companies (OMCs) Indian Oil Corp. Ld, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and HPCL to market its products in the fuel retail space. 
This results in lower offtake of products from MRPL with OMCs sometime preferring to bring in products from outside Karnataka to meet the state’s demand. As a result of this, MRPL is forced to rely on exports, resulting in marginally lower realization for the products. 
“MRPL is setting up retail outlets within its span of influence and expects to overcome this weakness in the medium term. Expected synergies from the acquisition of HPCL, by the parent company, ONGC are also expected to mitigate the lack of retail penetration,"" said MRPL in its annual report for 2017-18. 
MRPL entered the fuel retail segment in 2008 and till 2013 it had plans to roll out 120 fuel retail outlets in the first phase of its retail expansion strategy. The company has the approval to set up 500 retail outlets and its parent ONGC has an approval to set up 1,100 retail outlets. Setting up a fuel retail outlet, including the land cost, requires around Rs5 crore.
MRPL has gone slow on its retail plans as, like other OMCs, it was declined subsidy (compensation for selling fuels below market price). 
“MRPL wanted to be a significant player in fuel retailing, but being a standalone refinery, which is not part of any oil marketing company, it does not get compensated by the government for selling fuel below market price. The company fears that in the wake of higher oil prices, the government may once again require the OMCs to share the fuel subsidy burden. This will render MRPL’s retail outlets uncompetitive,"" said the second official mentioned above. 
Crude oil prices have climbed 11.5% and is currently hovering around $74.5 a barrel."
94,2018-08-28,ONGC,"Oil India won nine blocks, while ONGC managed to win two among the 55 oil and gas blocks on offer

New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd has bagged 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) said on Tuesday. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two. State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co received one block each, DGH said, while giving out the list of winners of Open Acreage licensing Policy (OALP) round-1.  
New Delhi: Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta Ltd has bagged 41 out of 55 oil and gas exploration blocks offered in India’s maiden open acreage auction, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) said on Tuesday. State-owned Oil India Ltd won nine blocks, while Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) managed to win just two. State gas utility GAIL, upstream arm of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd and Hindustan Oil Exploration Co received one block each, DGH said, while giving out the list of winners of Open Acreage licensing Policy (OALP) round-1. 
Vedanta, which had put in bids for all the 55 blocks, won right to explore and produce oil and gas in 41 of them. “We will work hard to make the best of this opportunity. We are an energy deficient country and policies like OALP will help reduce the country’s import dependence for oil from around 80% now to 67% by 2022, in line with (the) PM’s vision. The development further strengthens our vision to invest in India and contribute 50% of India’s domestic crude oil production,"" Agarwal said.
At the close of the bidding on May 2, ONGC had bid for 37 blocks either on its own or in consortium with other state-owned firms. OIL bid for 22 blocks in a similar fashion. Vedanta was the sole bidder for two blocks and had either ONGC or OIL as a direct competitor for the rest. Except for the two blocks that received three bids each, all the other 53 had just two bidders.
Neither Reliance Industries nor any foreign company participated in the auction, a first since India began offering oil and gas area for exploration and production through bids in 1999. The government had in July last year allowed companies to carve out blocks of their choice, with a view to bring around 2.8 million sq km of unexplored area in the country under exploration. Under this policy, companies are allowed to put in an expression of interest (EoI) for prospecting of oil and gas in an area that is currently not under any production or exploration licence. The EoIs can be put in any time of the year, but are accumulated twice annually.
The blocks or areas that receive EoIs at the end of a cycle are put up for auction with the originator or the firm that originally selected the area getting a five-mark advantage. The 55 blocks have a total area of 59,282 sq km. This compares to around 1,02,000 sq km that is currently under exploration. Blocks are awarded to the company which offers the highest share of oil and gas to the government as well as commits to do the maximum exploration work by way of shooting 2D and 3D seismic survey and drilling exploration wells. 
Increased exploration will lead to more oil and gas production, helping the world’s third largest oil importer to cut import dependence. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of cutting the country’s oil import bill by 10% to 67% by 2022 and to half by 2030. India currently imports 81% of its oil needs.
The new policy replaced the old system of government carving out areas and bidding them out. It guarantees marketing and pricing freedom and moves away from the production-sharing model of previous rounds to a revenue-sharing model, where companies offering the maximum share of oil and gas to the government are awarded the block. So far 256 blocks had been offered for exploration and production since 2000. The last bidding round happened in 2010. Of these, 254 blocks were awarded."

Mumbai/New Delhi: The government’s efforts to sell a $1.6 billion stake in Oil & Natural Gas Corp. has run into concerns that government policies on fuel pricing would weigh on the state-run explorer’s share price, according to people with knowledge of the situation. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: The government’s efforts to sell a $1.6 billion stake in Oil & Natural Gas Corp. has run into concerns that government policies on fuel pricing would weigh on the state-run explorer’s share price, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Investors and fund managers that met with Indian government officials during a US roadshow last month voiced concern that the government may reimpose fuel subsidies and that the nation’s state-set natural gas prices are too low, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the discussions were private.
The tepid response may further set back Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s plans to raise  ₹ 80,000 crore by selling holdings in state-run companies during the fiscal year ending in March. His government has only been able to pull in about  ₹ 9,200 crore as of 5 July. The 5% ONGC stake being marketed would be worth about  ₹ 11,150 crore as of Wednesday’s closing price.
Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik didn’t answer a call to his mobile phone, while an ONGC spokesman declined to comment.
Shares in the company have declined about 10% so far this year, while cash reserves have shrunk after it paid a record dividend and bought the administration’s stake in a refiner. In contrast, the benchmark index has rallied about 12%, making it Asia’s best performer, while Brent, the benchmark for half the world’s crude, has climbed about 16%. ONGC’s price-earnings ratio lag that of global peers such as BP Plc.
ONGC shares were trading down 1.2% to  ₹ 171.60 on the BSE on Thursday, while the benchmark index gained about 0.3%.
Rising crude prices coupled with the depreciation of the rupee is straining the government’s subsidy budget, ICICI Direct Research analysts said in a 3 August note. The government’s lower provisions for subsidies could lead to the possibility of ONGC sharing that burden, limiting the benefits of higher crude prices.
When fuel prices were set by the government, the explorer would share a portion of the subsidy burden by selling crude to refiners at a discount to compensate them partially for the loss in revenue. ONGC along with Oil India Ltd. has paid for over 40% of the country’s annual subsidy bill, Moody’s Investors Service analyst Vikas Halan said in a note in May. That ended when the government freed up retail prices of gasoline in 2010, followed by diesel in 2014.
The government still continues to control prices of kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas. The 208 billion rupees provision for kerosene and LPG subsidies in the year ending March is “clearly inadequate,"" Jefferies India analysts led by Somshankar Sinha said in a note last month.
The pattern of price changes by state-run refiners have also led to speculations that they may be influenced by political issues. Earlier this year, refiners didn’t change retail fuel prices for three weeks, despite higher international crude costs, and increased them only after elections in a southern state key to Modi’s coalition ended.
The government holds about 67.7% in the explorer followed by state-owned Life Insurance Corp.’s 9.2% stake. Two other government-owned companies Indian Oil Corp. and GAIL India Ltd. own about a combined 10% stake in ONGC. The government last sold a 5% stake in the company in 2012, most of which was bought by Life Insurance Corp. after interest from other buyers failed to materialise."

New Delhi: The government has extended the deadline to 19 September for submitting initial bids for 51% stake sale in helicopter services provider Pawan Hans Ltd, according to a communication. 
The previous deadline for Expression of Interest (EoI) was to end Wednesday. 
In August, the government said that along with government’s 51% stake, the bidders would have the option to buy ONGC’s 49% shareholding in the company. 
“The last date for submission of EoI for strategic disinvestment of PHL... has been extended up to 19 September, 2018,"" as per a notice posted on the website of the Civil Aviation Ministry. 
Timelines for all other subsequent activities would change accordingly, it added. On 13 April, the government issued the information memorandum for the 51% stake sale in Pawan Hans and had sought EoI from interested bidders by 18 June. 
About half a dozen bidders are believed to have submitted bids. Later, fresh bids were invited after ONGC board in July decided to combine its 49% stake in the offer for sale by the government."
91,2018-09-23,ONGC,"The tax department has slapped ONGC Videsh a service tax demand of 7,666.10 crore on remittance the firm makes to its overseas subsidiaries for  the past one decade

New Delhi: The tax department has slapped ONGC Videsh Ltd a service tax demand of  ₹ 7,666.10 crore on remittance the firm makes to its overseas subsidiaries for past one decade, sources in know of the development said. 
New Delhi: The tax department has slapped ONGC Videsh Ltd a service tax demand of  ₹ 7,666.10 crore on remittance the firm makes to its overseas subsidiaries for past one decade, sources in know of the development said.
OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), has stakes in 41 projects in 20 countries spanning from Venezuela to New Zealand. For the operations of these projects, the local units and joint ventures would raise a demand for money on the parent, OVL, which would transmit the funds.
The service tax department now contends that the overseas units are rendering a service to OVL and as such the company is liable to pay service tax at the full rate, sources said. The tax demand pertains to the period 2006 to 2017.
The service tax department had first issued a demand cum show-cause notice on 11 October 2011, requiring OVL to show cause why service tax amounting to  ₹ 2,816.31 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered.
The tax amount was calculated based on foreign currency expenditure reported in the company’s financial statements covering the period from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2010.
Sources said the tax department contends that these expenses represent business auxiliary services rendered by the foreign branches and operator of the joint venture/ consortium to OVL.
Subsequently, five more demand-cum-show cause notices have been issued based on similar contentions covering the period up to 31 March 2015, to show cause why service tax amounting to  ₹ 3,286.36 crore (including Education cess and SHE cess), the interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from the company.
A demand-cum-show cause notice has been issued based on similar contentions covering the period 1 April 2015, to 31 March 2017, to show cause why service tax amounting to  ₹ 1,563.32 crore plus interest on such amount and penalty should not be demanded and recovered from OVL.
Sources said OVL believes that no service tax is due or payable and is contesting the demand. According to OVL, investments made overseas through subsidiaries or branches or joint ventures do not constitute availing of any service.
The company operates the projects at an internal rate of return on investments of 12-13% and if it has to pay 14-15% service tax on such investments, the projects will give negative returns and would become infructuous. 
Also, it contends that service tax by law can be levied on services rendered within the country. And even if one were to assume that its branches or subsidiaries were rendering any service, they were all overseas and not within India and so cannot be subject to any service tax, sources said. Sources said OVL management is of the view that the disputed service-tax demands are not tenable in law. 
OVL had reported a net profit of  ₹ 981.5 crore in 2017-18 fiscal on a turnover of  ₹ 12,945.6 crore. It produced 9,353 million tonnes of oil in the fiscal, up from 8.434 million tonnes in the previous year. Gas output increased to 4.811 billion cubic meters in 2017-18 from 4.369 BCM in the previous year."
90,2018-09-28,ONGC,"Increasing tensions between the US and Venezuela, Iran sanctions and the rupee's performance have compounded the situation

New Delhi: State run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) expects crude oil prices to continue their upward trajectory in the backdrop of impending Iran sanctions and declining production in Venezuela. 
New Delhi: State run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) expects crude oil prices to continue their upward trajectory in the backdrop of impending Iran sanctions and declining production in Venezuela.
Speaking at India’s largest exploration and production firm’s annual general meeting on Friday, Shashi Shanker, chairman and managing director said, “Within a period of two years, the trajectory of prices changed dramatically. A barrel of crude in early 2016 fetched just about $30; by the end of 2017 it had already more than doubled.""
A high crude oil price projection by ONGC that accounts for 73% of India’s oil and gas production comes in the backdrop of Brent crude oil spot prices breeching the $80 per barrel mark. S&P Global Ratings said in a recent report that the agency expected Brent price to be at $70 for the rest of 2018, $65 for 2019 and $60 for 2020.
Also, retail diesel and petrol prices in India continue to set new records every other day. Transportation fuel prices touched a new high on Friday, with diesel and petrol prices reaching  ₹ 74.42 per litre and  ₹ 83.22 per litre in Delhi respectively at state run Indian Oil Corporation’s outlets. Petrol and diesel now cost  ₹ 90.57 per litre and  ₹ 79.01 per litre.
Increasing tensions between the US and Venezuela, the US demanding an end to all imports of Iranian oil by early November and the rupee’s performance as Asia’s worst performing currency of the year have compounded the situation and put India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, in a difficult spot.
“Today Brent crude is selling over $75 a barrel and could go even higher as Iran approaches another era of sanctions and Venezuela grapples with rapidly declining oil production,"" Shashi Shanker added.
The international crude oil prices had registered an all time high of $147 per barrel in July 2009.
The cost of the Indian basket of crude rose to $81.23 a barrel on 27 September, according to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell. To this, taxes at the central and state levels are added, besides dealers’ commission, to arrive at the retail price. The Indian basket represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude.
With the US sanctions on Iran looming, Moody’s Investors Service has estimated around $500 million decline in earnings for Indian state owned refiners—Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), on account of substituting crude oil imports from the Persian Gulf country.
According to Moody’s, India is one of the largest buyers of Iranian crude, accounting for about 30% of total crude exports from Iran during April to August 2018. Also, India imported 220.4 million metric tons (million MT) of crude oil in the year ended March 2018, out of which about 9.4% was from Iran. Between April and August 2018 India imported 94.9 million MT of crude, out of which about 14.4%, was from Iran. Exports to India accounted for 21% of Iran’s crude oil exports in fiscal year ended March 2018 and 30% from April to August 2018."

New Delhi:  State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is not in a hurry to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL (India) and will wait for the right price before offloading the shares, a senior company official said. 
New Delhi:  State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is not in a hurry to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL (India) and will wait for the right price before offloading the shares, a senior company official said.
ONGC holds 13.77% stake in oil refiner IOC and 4.86% in gas utility GAIL India.
“It is true that we are now a fully integrated company. We are India’s largest oil and gas producer and the acquisition of (oil refiner) HPCL has extended our presence in the downstream industries. “And so naturally, it now does not make sense for ONGC to hold stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC). But, we will wait for the right price,"" said the official.
ONGC, he said, got over  ₹ 3,000 crore in dividend income from investments in IOC and GAIL in 2017-18 financial year.
“This is a decent return on capital and can help me hold on to shares for long,"" he said. “I am in no hurry to sell the stake. We will wait for the right price.""ONGC’s 13.77% stake in IOC at Monday’s closing price of  ₹ 153.80 apiece on BSE is worth over  ₹ 20,500 crore. Its 4.86% stake in GAIL is worth close to  ₹ 4,200 crore at Monday’s closing price of  ₹ 380.75.
“IOC shares were trading at around  ₹ 195 in January and are now at  ₹ 153-154. It doesn’t make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,"" the official said.
ONGC, he said, is generating enough surplus mainly because of international oil prices spiking to four-year high and the rupee plummeting to an all-time low.
It is using these to pay off  ₹ 24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for  ₹ 36,915 crore.
A third of the loan has already been pre-paid, he said.
 ONGC had borrowed  ₹ 24,881 crore on a short-term loan to fund buying of the government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.
The official said the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then.
Initially, ONGC considered selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to fund the acquisition, but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said.
The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.
ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10% discount to the prevailing price. ONGC thus decided against the share sale.
ONGC’s purchase of HPCL created India’s first integrated oil company. This was ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its  ₹ 7,738 crore acquisition of 80% stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp’s KG basin gas block.
HPCL added 23.8 million tonne of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries.
ONGC already is majority owner of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals, which has a 15-million tonne refinery.

Mumbai: The trade union body of the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has accused the government of “interfering with decision making and breaking the economic backbone of the company"". 
In a four-page letter written on 4 September addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ONGC’s Employees Mazdoor Sabha general secretary A R Tadvi said, “Decisions taken over the past four-and-a-half years have broken the economic backbone of the company. The employees union has given a notice period of three months to give ONGC a free hand to take its own decisions."" Mint has a copy of the letter. 
Questioning the government’s decision of forcing ONGC to acquire a gas block from Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) for  ₹ 8,000 crore, the union said it was a clear case of ONGC being brought in to bail out GSPC.
“During 2016, the government forced ONGC to acquire GSPC’s gas blocks in the Krishna Godavari basin for a total consideration of  ₹ 8,000 crore… Even after GSPC spent large sums of money, hired foreign experts and imported sophisticated equipment, they could not find gas, then why was ONGC asked to pay  ₹ 8,000 crore to acquire this block?,"" the letter read.
Accusing the government of funding its fiscal deficit by forcing ONGC to buy a stake in HPCL, the letter said, “The government asked ONGC to buy the government’s entire 51.11% stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) for  ₹ 36,915 crore in an off-market deal, which was around 14% higher than the closing share price of HPCL for that day.""
With this acquisition, the ONGC group’s debt rose to  ₹ 1,11,533 crore in 2017-18 from  ₹ 55,619 crore in 2016-17, the letter added. 
Tadvi told Mint that constant interference by the government in ONGC’s business had led to curtailment of freedom of its chairman and managing director and directors’ decision-making process. 
“Such is the financial instability of ONGC now that it has to raise an overdraft facility to make the payment for pay and allowances of its employees,"" Tadvi said, adding that ONGC had never seen such a situation since inception. 
The letter also stated that the government had been exerting pressure on public sector undertakings to increase their corporate social responsibility (CSR) fundings on various projects, which otherwise should have been funded by the central government.
“The major projects conceived by the government -- LPG distribution, construction of toilets, adoption of villages for development, providing solar lights and distribution of sanitary napkins in girls’ school, to name a few -- are being funded by ONGC and similar public sector units, which leaves them with very little funds for the work concerned.""
Questioning the appointment of Sambit Patra as an independent director of ONGC, the letter stated any further interference in the activities of ONGC would be counterproductive and a great loss to the nation as well as the exchequer.
“Further interference in the internal affairs of ONGC shall be condemned in the strongest possible manner, including resorting to any direct action as deemed fit by the Confederation of Trades Unions in ONGC, without giving any further notice."""

On the anvil is some kind of extension of the discovered small field (DSF) bid round, where discovered and producing fields of ONGC are auctioned to private firms offering the maximum share of output to the government.
This is the second attempt by the oil ministry to take away some of the fields of ONGC for private and foreign companies.
In October last year, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH) had identified 15 producing fields with collective reserve of 791.2 million tonnes of crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope that they would improve upon the baseline estimate and its extraction.
The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own suggestion that it be allowed to outsource operations on same terms as the government plan.
The people quoted above said the current plan started as a follow-up of the 12 October meeting called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review domestic production profile of oil and gas and the roadmap for cutting import dependence by 10% by 2022.
At a meeting, the ministry made a presentation showing that while 95% of ONGC’s production was from 60 large fields, 149 smaller fields contributed a mere 5%.
It was suggested at the meeting that these smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements. Thereafter, a six-member committee under Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was set up to give a proposal on the same, the people said.
ONGC, however, is opposed to the plan as it feels it should be allowed the same terms that the government extends to private and foreign firms in DSF.
The government gave out 34 fields to private firms by offering them pricing and marketing freedom for oil and gas they produced from the fields in the first round of DSF. A second round of DSF with 25 fields on offer is currently under bidding.
The fields offered in DSF were taken away from ONGC and Oil India Ltd on the pretext that they were lying idle and unexploited. But under the present proposal, the government plans to take away discovered and producing fields.
The people said ONGC feels it too should be allowed to seek revenue sharing partnership for its fields. Field operations could be outsourced to foreign or private firms that offered the highest revenue or production share over and above a baseline production.
The ministry is reasoning that the areas where the fields discovered by ONGC were given to the state-owned firm on nomination basis.
In the proposal that was mooted in October last year, the plan was to give out 60% stake in 15 fields—11 of ONGC and four of Oil India. These included Kalok, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal—the big four oilfields of ONGC in Gujarat.
The DGH too had identified 44 fields of ONGC and Oil India, which could take on partners for production enhancement work where bidders would get the “tariff"" that they bid as a return for increasing the output ‘over the baseline production’ for an initial period of 10 years.
The oil ministry is unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital, sources said.
It has been tasked by the prime minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10% by 2022 from 77% in 2014-15, but the dependence has only increased and is now over 83%.
The privatization is repeat of the infamous round in 1992-93 when medium-sized discovered fields like Panna/Mukta and Tapti oil and gas field in the western offshore was given to now defunct Enron Corp. of the US and Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL).
As many as 28 fields were then awarded. Under this regime, ONGC was made licensee and given an option to farm in 40% of the stake. The controversial privatisation under the then oil minister Satish Sharma had resulted in an inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).z"
82,2018-11-13,ONGC,"A look at the rationale behind the government's plan to sell 149 small oil and gas fields of ONGC

New Delhi: The National Democratic Alliance government is said to be considering the sale of 149 small and marginal oil and gas fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC). Mint looks at the rationale behind the move. 
New Delhi: The National Democratic Alliance government is said to be considering the sale of 149 small and marginal oil and gas fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC). Mint looks at the rationale behind the move.
What is the big plan of the government?
Media reports say the government wants ONGC, which accounts for 73% of India’s oil and gas production, to focus on 60 big fields and consider selling 149 small and marginal oil and gas fields to those private and foreign firms that offer the maximum share of their output to the government. These fields were awarded to ONGC and Oil India Ltd on a nomination basis. The move is aimed at boosting domestic output and securing India’s energy needs. The state-run explorer has declined to comment. Till September, India imported 4.5 million barrels a day in the current fiscal.
What is the objective of the plan?
While ONGC received 95% of output from 60 large fields, 149 smaller fields contributed a mere 5%. The plan aims to leverage the expertise of private and foreign firms to grow domestic production and help meet India’s demand for energy. Between 2013 and 2017, India’s demand for petroleum products grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5.5%. In March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target of reducing import dependence on crude oil by 10 percentage points to 67% by 2022. According to Care Ratings, price of Brent crude could range from $68 per barrel to $73 per barrel in the next few months. 
How much is India’s share in the global oil demand?
Opec expects global demand to surge 33%, or 91 million barrels oil equivalent per day (mboed), between 2015 and 2040. Of this, 24%, or a 22 mboed jump, is expected from India.
Why does India need to reduce oil imports?
Any rally in global oil prices will hurt India’s oil import bill and trade deficit. Every dollar increase in oil prices has the potential to push up the import bill by about  ₹ 10,700 crore on an annual basis. While crude prices jumped 50% in dollar terms and 70% in rupee terms since last year, the prices have fallen from the four-year highs reached earlier last month. The benchmark Brent crude was trading at $71.11 per barrel on Monday as Saudi Arabia announced a cut in December supplies.

Will India depend less on imports in future?
With domestic production unable to cater to the ever-increasing demand, India will depend on imports in the foreseeable future. The government has opened up markets to the private sector for retail outlets, implemented the discovered small fields policy, the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy and the Open Acreage Licensing Policy and allowed marketing and pricing freedom for gas produced from deep and ultra deep water areas and coal-bed methane fields."
81,2018-11-21,ONGC,"ONGC produced about 64 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas in November last year

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) natural gas production has hit an all-time high of about 70 million standard cubic meters per day as it doubles up efforts to raise domestic output to curb imports, sources privy to the development said.ONGC produced about 64 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas in November last year and this year the output is close to touching 70 mmscmd, sources said. 
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) natural gas production has hit an all-time high of about 70 million standard cubic meters per day as it doubles up efforts to raise domestic output to curb imports, sources privy to the development said.ONGC produced about 64 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas in November last year and this year the output is close to touching 70 mmscmd, sources said.
After accounting for internal consumption, gas sales at about 56 mmscmd too are at an all-time high.
The output can rise by 24-25 mmscmd in next 1-2 years if the company gets market price, that will make about 35 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks economically viable.
Natural gas is the fastest growing primary energy source in the world. It is the cleanest burning petroleum-based fuel and has wide applications -- from being used to generate electricity to the running of automobiles (CNG) and firing kitchen stoves.
With a view to reducing dependence on imports for meeting energy needs and cutting greenhouse emissions, India is looking at increasing consumption of natural gas by more than doubling its share in energy basket to 15 per cent in next few years.
Sources said, ONGC has been constrained by the current USD 3.36 per million British thermal unit price of gas fixed by the government, which is a third of the rate at which India imports gas in its liquid form (LNG). This price is way below the cost of production for block GK-28/42 in Gulf of Kutch, off the Gujarat coast, Mumbai offshore block MB-OSN-2005/1 and Krishna Godavari basin block KG-OSN-2005/1, which cumulatively can produce about 10 mmscmd.
A similar amount of gas can come from onland discoveries and another 5 mmscmd can be added if investment to made in redevelopment projects of Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 cluster are made economical with the market price, they said.
ONGC had in 2017-18 fiscal year (April 2017 to March 2018) produced 23.484 billion cubic meters of natural gas, 6.3 per cent higher than 22.099 bcm output in the previous 2016-17 financial year.
This was the highest gas output by the company in five years and the growth rate was higher than the global average of 3-4 per cent year-on-year.
Sources said the company has stepped up efforts to bring newer fields into production after Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a stiff target of reducing oil import dependence by 10 per cent by 2022. India currently imports over 80 per cent of its oil needs.
The growth in output was largely contributed by C-26 Cluster fields, Daman and Vasai East fields in the western offshore as well as sub-sea well S2AB in the eastern offshore, sources said adding ONGC has charted out a plan to double the gas production at 42.7 bcm by 2021-22.
It is investing  ₹ 57,000 crore - one of the highest investments in the world in gas projects - in the high potential KG-DWN-98/2 project in the Bay of Bengal as well as in developing other discoveries on off the west coast.
First gas from the KG-DWN-98/2 project is targeted for end-2019 and peak output is envisaged at 16.56 mmscmd by 2022.

At the meeting, the Oil Ministry made a presentation showing that 149 smaller fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and other explorers accounted for just 5 per cent of the domestic crude oil production.
It was suggested at the meeting that these smaller fields could be given out to private and foreign firms and ONGC could concentrate on the big ones where it could rope in technology partners through production enhancement contracts (PEC) or technical service arrangements.
Sources said the ministry was of the view that ONGC should concentrate on the large fields as they contribute to 95 per cent of its production and leave out the rest for private firms.
On the anvil is some kind of extended version of the Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid round where discovered and producing fields of ONGC are auctioned to firms offering the maximum share of output to the government, sources said.

Mumbai :  A senior government official on Monday said the Centre has received “substantial"" interest for Pawan Hans stake sale and plans for Air India disinvestment also continues. The government owns 51% in Pawan Hans, which has a fleet of 46 choppers. The remaining 49% is with state-run ONGC. If the sale goes through, government will exit the chopper-maker. The disinvestment process is on, as ONGC refused to buy out the government’s stake when it was proposed last year.
“Pawan Hans (PHL) for which an RFP (request for proposal) has been invited, has got substantial competitive interest,"" department of investment and public asset management (Dipam) secretary Atanu Chakraborty told reporters on the sidelines of an NSE event.
SBI Capital is advising the government on the bidding process. In April, the government had issued the information memorandum for the 51% strategic stake sale in Pawan Hans and had sought expressions of interest (EoI) from interested bidders by 18 June.
Chakraborty denied that Air India’s disinvestment plans were put on the back burner saying the process is a continuing exercise.
“As a part of that, an expression of interest have been invited for Air India Air Transport Services (AIATSL). And, certain other assets of Air India are in the process of being sold,"" he added.
AIATSL is the profit-making ground handling arm of the national carrier. In 2016-17, AIATSL raked in a profit of Rs61.66 crore.
The government had in June 2017 unsuccessfully tried to offload 76% stake in the national carrier.
As part of the disinvestment, the government was planning to transfer most of the debt to a special purpose vehicle.
“There are practical problem in selling a company at a particular time. First set of interest didn’t come because of that back burners takes place...it will takes six more months... That is more to do with the mechanics of doing a thing, not with the intent of the government. Everything is on a front burner,"" he said.
Chakraborty expressed confidence that the government will be able to reach its disinvestment target of over Rs80,000 crore though it has so far been able to mop up only about Rs10,000 crore.
He said the government will continue to use exchange traded funds (ETF) as one of its preferred modes for disinvestment.
On the ongoing CPSE ETF, he said, against the Rs8,000 crore offering, a subscription of Rs30,000 crore has been received, but the government will retain only Rs17,000 crore.
He said the retail portion was fully subscribed, and there was a big interest shown by FPIs who offered almost Rs13,000 crore, both in anchor and non-anchor categories.
He said the work on debt ETF is also on progress.
Speaking on the same event, NSE managing director Vikram Limaye said despite ETFs being in existence for a long time, the assets linked to equity, debt and commodity ETFs aggregate to around  ₹ 94,100 crores (with equity ETFs alone having a share of close to 93% in the domestic ETF market) which is just 4% of mutual fund AUM.
Globally, the ETF industry accounts for nearly 6-7% of the mutual fund assets, he said.
“Despite a relatively slow start, domestic ETF assets grew at a rate of close to 28% CAGR over the last 11 years whereas the number of ETFs have increased eight-fold from nine in 2007 to 72 in October 2018,"" Limaye said."

(ONGC) after the oil explorer ended a deal for the supply of a dozen vessels to support offshore oil exploration. The ruling has come as a major relief for ONGC.
RNEL, which is controlled by Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, had in its petition said ONGC has refused to take delivery of the eighth vessel and also invoked a bank guarantee. The high court ruled that when there is a clause giving the parties to the agreement the option of going for arbitration, the companies must do so rather than filing cases in court. 
“We are of the considered view that this can be done in the arbitration proceedings, which are provided under the contract if the parties choose to do so or in the civil suit if the petitioner (RNEL) desires to take recourse to the same,"" ruled a bench comprising justices B.R. Gavai and Riyaz I. Chagla. “In that view of the matter petition is rejected, relegating petitioner to the ordinary remedy available to it in the law,"" it said.
The company, part of billionaire Anil Ambani’s diversified Reliance Group, was seeking a refund of more than $6.6 million (about  ₹ 45 crore), which ONGC invoked as performance bank guarantee, along with $15.46 million as payment for eighth offshore vessel that it built for India’s largest explorer. RNEL also sought court’s intervention to direct ONGC to take delivery of the eighth vessel.
“Undisputedly, in the present case, the vessels were not delivered to respondent (ONGC) within a period of 30 months as provided in the contract,"" the court observed in its order of 30 November. 
Email queries to ONGC and RNEL did not elicit any response till press time.

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL) spent over  ₹ 13,000 crore on 115 oil and gas discoveries which were taken away from them by the government for auctioning to private companies, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Monday. The present BJP-led NDA government took away so-called idle small and marginal discoveries of ONGC and OIL and auctioned them to private firms under Discovered Small Field (DSF) bid rounds.
Under DSF bid round-1, 67 discoveries, mostly of ONGC, were auctioned, while in the second round, bids for which are due next month, another 48 finds are being auctioned, he said in a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.
“As informed by ONGC, an amount of  ₹ 12,826 crore has been spent by ONGC on the discoveries/fields identified in the first and second round of Discovered Small Field Policy. An amount of  ₹ 224.27 crore has been spent by OIL in this regard,"" he said.
ONGC and OIL are not compensated for the amount they had spent on discoveries of these oil and gas reserves. Unlike state-owned firms, the private players are allowed pricing and marketing freedom to make these discoveries viable. ONGC and OIL have stated that they could not produce from the discoveries as they are uneconomically at current cap prices.
“With a view to increasing domestic production of oil and gas, the government in May 2016 launched Discovered Small Field Bid Round-I under which 67 discoveries of ONGC and OIL, which had not been put into production, were offered for auction through international competitive bidding,"" Pradhan said. “The policy has now been extended to its second round to include 48 un-monetised discoveries of ONGC and OIL under DSF Bid Round-II."" Under DSF-I, 47 companies participated in the bidding process, he said.
ONGC and OIL were also allowed to participate in the auction to get back their own discoveries.
“The 67 discoveries under DSF Bid Round-1 are estimated to have in place reserves of 86 million tonne of oil and gas equivalent. In DSF-II, 48 discoveries of ONGC/OIL offered for bid are estimated to have in place reserves of 163.08 million tonne of oil and gas equivalent,"" he said.
Pradhan said the government has notified the Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP) on March 30, 2016, which is based on revenue sharing model wherein explorers offering a higher share of oil and gas to the government are awarded blocks.
The salient feature of HELP include single license for exploration and production of conventional and unconventional hydrocarbons like shale oil, he said adding also included in HELP is an Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP) wherein investors can carve out the area of their interest for exploration and production of oil and gas and submit expression of interest throughout the year.
HELP has easy to administer revenue sharing model and marketing and pricing freedom for crude oil and natural gas has been guaranteed for operators, he said.
Also, it provides for zero royalty rates for deepwater and ultra-deepwater blocks for first seven years, he added."

Mumbai: The board of India’s top explorer, Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd, will consider a proposal this week to list its overseas investment arm, ONGC Videsh Ltd, on domestic bourses, two sources privy to the matter said on Wednesday.
The move to float the unit - which has investments in 11 producing assets in countries including Russia, Brazil, United Arab Emirates, Sudan and Venezuela - is part of a government push to sell state assets to raise funds.
“ONGC has a board meeting on Dec. 20 and 21. A proposal for listing of ONGC Videsh will be discussed,"" one of the sources said.
Reuters in August reported that the government has asked ONGC to list ONGC Videsh.
“We have to take up the proposal after the government asked ONGC to consider listing ONGC Videsh,"" another source said.
Both sources declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the issue.
No immediate response was available from ONGC.
One analyst said listing of ONGC Videsh will help in ascertaining the valuation of the company which does not report quarterly profit numbers.
“Once profit margins and operating profit numbers are known, and in-depth reporting of numbers are done, ONGC Videsh will obviously see higher valuations. Currently ONGC Videsh is given a value of 15 percent on ONGC’s share price,"" said Gagan Dixit, senior analyst with Elara Capital.
He said listing of ONGC Videsh will also help ONGC raise funds to buy back shares and pay dividends.
The ONGC board will also consider a share buyback proposal on Wednesday.
Listing will also help ONGC Videsh to reach a valuation which has mostly alluded it because so far it is only valued based on its reserves, Dixit said.
He, however, said that the right time to list ONGC Videsh was when the crude price was close to $80 per barrel. On Wednesday, Brent crude oil was $56.56.
“But being a government company, backed by ONGC and overseas assets showing good promise, ONGC Videsh will definitely be able to raise money,"" he said.
ONGC Videsh has stakes in 41 oil and gas assets in 20 countries and in the last fiscal year produced oil equivalent to 26.2 percent of India’s local output.
The company, fully owned by ONGC, produced 11 percent more oil at 9.35 million tonnes in the last fiscal year while its gas output increased by about 10 percent at 4.81 billion cubic metres.
ONGC Videsh holds reserves of 711.362 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent gas as on April 1, 2018, according to the company website.

The government has been pushing cash-rich public sector undertakings (PSUs) to use their funds to buyback shares or pay a higher dividend, to achieve its fiscal deficit target of 3.3% for 2018-19.
Share buybacks refer to the repurchasing of shares by the company that issued them. A buyback occurs when the issuing company pays shareholders the market value per share and re-absorbs that portion of its ownership that was previously distributed among public and private investors.
Last week, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) said it will buy back 29.76 crore shares for about  ₹ 4,435 crore and spend another  ₹ 6,556 crore on paying an interim dividend to shareholders. The government aims to raise at least  ₹ 5,000 crore through share buyback offers of state-owned firms like Coal India Ltd, BHEL and Oil India Ltd.
Besides Indian Oil, at least half a dozen other PSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. Prominent among these include NHPC, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard and KIOCL that could fetch the government a little over  ₹ 3,000 crore. The government is expected to participate in each of the share buyback programme of these PSUs.
Last month, Oil India Ltd announced a buyback of 5.04 crore of its share for a little over  ₹ 1,085 crore.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), which has been set a target to raise  ₹ 80,000 crore for the government through stake sale in PSUs, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks. PSUs having a net worth of at least   ₹  2,000 crore and a cash balance of more than   ₹  1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buyback.
Of the  ₹ 80,000 crore government disinvestment target, the government has so far raised just over  ₹ 15,000 crore through minority stake sale in PSUs.

The government stands to benefit most from this buyback programme, considering it owns 67.5% of ONGC. This, and similar other share buyback programmes, will help the government meet the fiscal deficit target for this financial year. ONGC’s cash has been tapped by the government in the past as well. Earlier this year, ONGC purchased the government’s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) for about  ₹ 37,000 crore. ONGC had to take a debt of  ₹ 25,000 crore to fund this acquisition.
The fact that ONGC’s debt will only increase due to the buyback programme isn’t good news for investors.
What’s more, this comes at a time when the company has a sizable capex plan. In its annual report for financial year 2018, ONGC had said the capex for FY19 would be about  ₹ 32,000 crore.
In any case, investors have seen value erosion in the stock.
Fears that ONGC may have to share subsidy burden of the oil sector has led to underperformance. Sure, with crude oil prices having corrected from their highs in October, there should be some relief on the overall under-recoveries of the sector. But the picture isn’t all that rosy.
Liquefied petroleum gas/ kerosene under-recoveries may have eased, but may still rise 45% year-on-year to  ₹ 37,000 crore in financial year 2019, said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a 17 December report. With fiscal space constrained, we assume that upstream state-run enterprises take about a third of the burden, added the broker.
The faint silver lining for investors is that the underperformance of the stock has rendered valuations attractive. Currently, ONGC shares trade at about six times estimated earnings for the next financial year, based on data from Bloomberg. While that may mean that downside is limited, there are hardly triggers for outperformance in sight either."

72,2019-01-02,ONGC,"ONGC has some reservations about an ONGC Videsh IPO and has conveyed this to the government, CMD Shashi Shanker says

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) Wednesday said the government has not yet asked it to reconsider listing its overseas arm ONGC Videsh Ltd on bourses. The board of ONGC had on 21 December considered a government demand to list its profitable overseas investment arm but opined that it was not the right to go for an initial public offering (IPO). 
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) Wednesday said the government has not yet asked it to reconsider listing its overseas arm ONGC Videsh Ltd on bourses. The board of ONGC had on 21 December considered a government demand to list its profitable overseas investment arm but opined that it was not the right to go for an initial public offering (IPO).
ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker said the company has communicated its views on ONGC Videsh’s listing to the government. After that “we have not received any request to reconsider (listing of )"", he told reporters here.
The company will reconsider it if and when such a request is made, he said.
According to people familiar with developments, the ONGC board had on 21 December deliberated on the demand from the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) for the listing of ONGC Videsh but felt that the market conditions are not right for an oil and gas exploration and production company to list. Also, there were several complexities involved in getting the firm listed.
ONGC Videsh, they said, has assets in countries like Venezuela, Iran, and Sudan, which are exposed to some or other Western sanctions.
These assets will have to be first separated from the company. While this may not be a difficult task, it would involve issues of capital gains and tax thereon, they said.
Also, ONGC Videsh is heavily under debt and such a move would require taking approval of all the lenders—yet another tedious job.
A third of its $28.45 billion (₹1.51 trillion) investment in 41 projects in 20 countries has been financed by loans.
More importantly, ONGC Videsh has been only in acquisition mode till now and has not yet reached an economic model where it can stand on its own feet. The company is dependent on its parent for even guarantees for taking loans.
ONGC Videsh has great assets and it would reach that economic model once couple of its assets like the giant gas field in Mozambique starts production, the people said. ONGC Videsh projects are in the development stage and an IPO will get the best value when these projects are monetised, they said.
ONGC Videsh’s giant gas field in Mozambique will start production sometime in 2022 when two LNG trains of 12 million tonnes per annum capacity are set up and gas exported in cryogenic ships.
Its Farzad-B gas field in Iran is on hold in view of US sanctions on the Persian Gulf nation. Also, its Venezuelan oilfields are producing much less than their potential.
According to a letter DIPAM wrote to ONGC management in August, ONGC Videsh IPO would help unlock value by improving its corporate governance and efficiency.
ONGC had helped the government meet its disinvestment target last fiscal when it bought a 51.11% stake in state-owned Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for  ₹ 36,915 crore.
After failing to find a buyer for Air India, DIPAM is again looking at ONGC to meet the  ₹ 80,000 crore government disinvestment target set in the budget for 2018-19 from PSU stake sales. In the letter, DIPAM said PSUs with a positive net worth and no accumulated losses should be listed to unlock value. It, however, did not state how much stake in ONGC Videsh should be sold for its listing.
Market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) calls for a minimum 25% public float for a listed company.
The people quoted above said proceeds of from a potential ONGC Videsh IPO would accrue to its parent ONGC but the government would seek a special dividend to reap that.
The government owns 67.45% stake in ONGC. If ONGC were to declare entire proceeds of ONGC Videsh listing as a special dividend, the government would get 67.45% of the amount.
The government had in 2015 as well asked ONGC to list ONGC Videsh. But the state-owned firm had at that time told the government that it was not the right time to list as oil prices were subdued and the company would not get the right value.
Oil prices have since rebounded and the government is looking to cash in on that.
Under its portfolio, ONGC Videsh has reserves of 711 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent natural gas.
In 2017-18, it produced 9.35 million tonnes of crude oil, up from 8.43 million tonnes in the previous year. Together with natural gas, the output was 14.16 million tonnes of oil equivalent, up from 12.80 million tonnes in the previous year.
It reported a net profit of  ₹ 981 crore on a turnover of  ₹ 10,418 crore in 2017-18 fiscal. This compared with a net profit of  ₹ 701 crore on a turnover of  ₹ 10,080 crore in the previous fiscal. It had reported a net loss of  ₹ 3,633 crore in 2015-16 due to a sharp drop in oil prices.‎"

Guwahati: State-run oil behemoth ONGC on Sunday said it will pump in  ₹ 6,000 crore in drilling 200 wells over the next seven years in Assam in order to increase the output from the state.
The investment will take place Sivasagar and Charaideo districts of Upper Assam, besides planning to hire over 300 persons in the state, ONGC Director (Onshore) S K Moitra said “The ONGC would be investing about  ₹ 6,000 crore in drilling 200 developmental wells across fields under ONGC Assam Asset in Sivasagar and Charaideo districts,"" Moitra said in a statement.

70,2019-01-07,ONGC,"Dharmendra Pradhan said ONGC and OIL will have the freedom to decide which of their currently producing fields they want to retain and in the ones where they would like to induct a partner

New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the government will allow state-owned ONGC and Oil India to induct private and foreign partners in oilfields to raise output and also give special incentive to make their discoveries in difficult areas viable. 
New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Monday said the government will allow state-owned ONGC and Oil India to induct private and foreign partners in oilfields to raise output and also give special incentive to make their discoveries in difficult areas viable.
Speaking at the launch of second bid round for 14 exploration blocks under open acreage licensing policy, Pradhan said Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) and OIL will have the freedom to decide which of their currently producing fields they want to retain and in the ones where they would like to induct a partner.
This is a climb down from the 2017 position where the oil ministry’s upstream technical advisory body Directorate General of Hydrocarbons identified 15 fields -- 11 of ONGC and four of OIL -- for giving out 60 per cent stake to foreign and private companies. The move couldn’t go through because of tough resistance from the state-owned firms.
Then again in October last year, the ministry wanted ONGC to concentrate on large fields as they contribute to 95 per cent of its production and leave out the rest for private firms.
“They can decide on the fields they want to retain and the stake they want to give (to foreign and private firms),"" he said.
Pradhan said “special incentive besides the incentive already provided"" will be given to difficult fields of ONGC.
“Previously, the government objective was revenue maximisation but now enhancing production is the only motive,"" he said.
He, however, did not elaborate on the special incentive. Natural gas discoveries in difficult areas like deepsea currently command a higher price but this is applicable only for future finds and not currently discoveries of ONGC.
ONGC and OIL haven’t been able to develop some of their discoveries or bring them to production as the current gas price of USD 3.36 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) is way lower than the cost of production.
ONGC has about 35 billion cubic metres of recoverable reserves in discoveries in the shallow sea off Andhra Pradesh on the east and off Gujarat and Mumbai on the west coast blocks.
The three blocks in Krishna Godavari basin, Gulf of Kutch and Mumbai offshore can produce about 10 mmscmd of gas and an equivalent amount can be produced from its onshore discoveries in blocks like Bantumili, Mandapeta and Bhuvanagiri. About 5 mmscmd of production can be added by making some investment in existing fields like Mumbai High South, Neelam and B-127 Cluster in the Arabian Sea.
Oil India has an onland discovery in the Krishna Godavari basin in Andhra Pradesh with over 3 billion cubic metres of recoverable reserves but needs a higher price to bring it to production.
Pradhan said ONGC and OIL will soon come out with production enhancement contracts (PECs) wherein foreign or private companies will be allowed to take a stake in identified currently producing fields in return for raising output beyond an agreed level.
The state-owned firms, he said, would device the contracts and implement them.
“They will be given autonomy and freedom but will have greater accountability,"" he said.
In October 2017, the DGH had identified 15 producing fields with a combined reserve of 791.2 million tonne crude oil and 333.46 billion cubic metres of gas of national oil companies for handing over to private firms in the hope they would improve upon the baseline estimate and their extraction.
The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly countered the DGH proposal with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan, which involved pricing and marketing freedom.
The fields identified in 2017 Kalol, Ankleshwar, Gandhar and Santhal -- the big four oil fields of ONGC in Gujarat.
The DGH also had identified 44 other fields of ONGC and OIL which could take on partners for production enhancement work where bidders would get the ‘tariff’ that they bid as a return for increasing the output ‘over the baseline production’ for an initial period of 10 years.
The oil ministry has been unhappy with the near stagnant oil and gas production and believes giving out the discovered fields to private firms would help raise output as they can bring in technology and capital.
It has been tasked by the prime minister to cut dependence on oil imports by 10 per cent by 2022 from the over 77 per cent dependence in 2014-15. But the dependence has only increased and is now over 83 per cent.

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp's (ONGC)  ₹4,022-crore share buyback programme will open on 29 January and close on 11 February, the company said in its offer letter to shareholders.
ONGC's board had, on 20 December, approved the buyback of 25.29 crore shares for  ₹159 apiece as part of the government's plan to get cash-rich PSUs to part with their surplus. The government, which holds 65.64% stake in the company, stands to gain around  ₹2,640 crore from tendering some of its shares in the buyback programme.
""The funds for the buyback will be met out of internally generated cash resources of the company,"" it said.
A buyback is an efficient form of returning surplus cash to members holding equity shares of the company.
After considering the mutual benefits to the company and equity shareholders, ""the board decided to recommend buyback of not exceeding 25.29 crore equity shares representing 1.97% of the total number of equity shares in the paid-up share capital of the company at a price of  ₹159 per share for an aggregate consideration of not exceeding  ₹4,022 crore,"" it said.
The buyback is unlikely to cause any material impact on the profitability/earnings of the company and would not, in any manner, impair its ability to pursue growth opportunities or meet its cash requirement for business operations, according to the letter. ""The buyback is expected to contribute to the overall enhancement of shareholder value and result in an increase in the return on equity of the company.""
The government is pushing cash-rich PSUs to use their funds to buy back shares or pay a higher dividend. The Centre is looking to bridge the budgetary deficit through higher receipts of dividend as well as selling its shares in public sector units in the buyback programme.
ONGC will, however, not pay an interim dividend for now since it had almost no surplus left after accounting for its capital expenditure, sources with knowledge of the development said.
Last month, Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said it will buy back 29.76 crore shares for about  ₹4,435 crore and spend another  ₹6,556 crore on paying interim dividend to shareholders. The board of IOC, the country's largest oil firm, also approved buyback of up to 29.76 crore equity shares, or 3.06%, at  ₹149 per share.
Beside ONGC and IOC, at least half a dozen other central PSUs have disclosed share buyback programmes. Prominent among these are NHPC, NMDC, Coal India, Oil India, BHEL, NALCO, NLC, Cochin Shipyard, and KIOCL.
The government is expected to participate in each of the share buyback programme.
IOC had also declared an interim dividend of 67.5%, or  ₹6.75 per share, for 2018-19. The total dividend payout, excluding tax, will be around  ₹6,556 crore, of which the government will get  ₹3,544 crore plus the dividend distribution tax.
Oil India, too, had announced a buyback of 5.04 crore of its shares for a little over  ₹1,085 crore.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), mandated to raise  ₹80,000 crore through PSU stake sale in the current fiscal year, had prodded all cash-rich PSUs to go for share buybacks. PSUs with a net worth of at least  ₹2,000 crore and a cash balance of more than  ₹1,000 crore have to mandatorily go in for share buyback.
Of the  ₹80,000-crore disinvestment target, the government had so far raised just over  ₹15,000 crore through minority stake sale in PSUs.

NEW DELHI :
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd's (HPCL)  ₹43,129-crore refinery project in Barmer district of Rajasthan has achieved financial closure with tying up of a  ₹28,753-crore loan from a consortium of lenders, the company said Monday.
HPCL, a subsidiary of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), signed a debt syndication agreement with the consortium of nine lenders led by State Bank of India, a company statement said.
""SBI is the lead lender with more than 50% share in the consortium,"" it said. ""This is one of the largest project debt syndications in India.""
The project, where HPCL owns 74% stake and the balance is held by the Rajasthan government, will cost  ₹43,129 crore. Two-thirds of the project cost is being funded through loans and the remaining through equity by promoters.
It comprises a 9-million tonne a year oil refinery and a 2-million tonne per annum petrochemicals unit.
SBI Caps was the debt arranger, it added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 16, 2018, started work on the project that will be completed by 2022-23.
Originally, then Congress president Sonia Gandhi had laid foundation stone of the refinery on September 22, 2013.
The state government is giving  ₹1,123 crore per annum for 15 years as an interest-free loan instead of previously envisaged tax breaks. This has resulted in reducing the financial burden on the state government from  ₹56,040 crore to  ₹16,845 crore.
As much as 4,400,40 acres of land is required for the project, out of which, 1,454 acres will be developed as a green belt.

""All transactions are in place to meet the  ₹80,000 crore target set for current fiscal,"" Chakraborty said.
The government is expected to raise around  ₹12,000 crore from share buyback offerings by CPSEs, including ONGC, Coal India and IOC. In addition, about  ₹15,000 crore would come in from PFC buying out government equity in REC.
Further, the strategic disinvestment of Pawan Hans is also expected to be completed by March 2019.
For the next fiscal beginning April, Chakraborty said DIPAM has already prepared a blueprint to achieve the target of mopping up  ₹90,000 crore from disinvestment.
With ETF emerging as the most viable route for offloading CPSE stake in the market, he said the department would conduct a study to provide risk-free investment option to retail investors in the form of sector-specific ETFs.
Most of income tax relief, benefit of second house effective from 2020
The government has already floated two ETFs — CPSE ETF and Bharat-22 ETF — which have mopped up  ₹17,000 crore and  ₹8,325 crore respectively this fiscal.
""You should not see ETF as an individual share. In an ETF, we bring all the shares together to reduce the systemic risk,"" he said, adding that DIPAM is looking at the possibility of forming basket of shares from the same sector and design an index.

65,2019-02-04,ONGC,"Oil explorer awaits dividends overdue from the San Cristobal oil projectOil comprises 97% of the South American nation’s export revenue

NEW DELHI :
India’s ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL), the overseas arm of state-owned Oil & Natural Gas Corp., will stay the course in Venezuela even as it awaits dividends overdue from the San Cristobal oil exploration project there, said a person aware of the Indian government’s strategy.
This comes against the backdrop of the US administration imposing sanctions on state-owned oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) as there is growing pressure on President Nicolas Maduro of Venezuela to cede control to National Assembly leader Juan Guaido. The government has been criticised for using PDVSA as a political tool.
Mint reported on 23 April 2015 about unpaid dividends due from the San Cristobal oil exploration project to OVL crossing more than half-a-billion dollars.
Queries emailed to a spokesperson for ONGC on Saturday remained unanswered.
Any instability in Venezuela also holds significance for India, which counts Venezuela as among its largest suppliers of crude oil. India’s total crude imports surged more than 25% in 2017-18 to $109 billion.
“The United States has taken necessary action to prevent the illegitimate former Maduro regime from further plundering Venezuela’s assets and natural resources. The United States has determined that persons operating in Venezuela’s oil sector may now be subject to sanctions pursuant to Executive Order 13850 signed by (US) President (Donald) Trump on November 1, 2018. Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. has been designated for operating within this sector,"" US secretary of state Michael R. Pompeo said on 28 January in a statement.
“Maduro and his cronies have used state-owned PDVSA to control, manipulate, and steal from the Venezuelan people for too long, destroying it in the process,"" Pompeo said.
India, the world’s third-largest oil importer, has maintained that it adheres only to sanctions imposed by the United Nations and not unilateral strictures placed by countries.
This comes in the wake of Trump pulling the US out of a historic 2015 accord with energy-rich Iran that was inked to curb the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme in return for ending sanctions. However, oil importers in India have secured temporary reprieve from the US sanctions.
Oil comprises 97% of the South American nation’s export revenue. OVL bought a 40% stake in the San Cristobal project in 2008. Corporación Venezolana del Petróleo (CVP), a unit of PDVSA, owns the remaining stake.
The joint venture Petrolera IndoVenezolana SA (PIVSA), which operates the 160.18km acreage in the Orinoco Heavy Oil belt. OVL, along with other Indian companies, is also part of a global consortium developing the Carabobo 1 Norte and Carabobo 1 Centro blocks in the Orinoco region. OVL has invested $355.7 million in the San Cristobal project. The dues have been piling up since the term of late President Hugo Chávez, which had appropriated earnings from PDVSA to finance social spending."

63,2019-02-05,ONGC,"ONGC’s plan comes in the wake of sanctions on Russia, where it owns stakes in significant hydrocarbon assetsThe plan involves an equity swap under which OVL gets a stake in another asset of the Russian firm

NEW DELHI :
State run-ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) is exploring the transfer of its stake in Imperial Energy Corp. Plc’s Siberian deposits to a Russian firm to reduce potential losses from the $2.1-billion acquisition, said a person aware of the development. 
The plan involves an equity swap under which OVL gets a stake in another asset of the Russian firm, in lieu of its stake in Imperial. Mint could not ascertain the name of the Russian firm.
ONGC’s move comes against the backdrop of sanctions on Russia, where India’s biggest oil and gas explorer owns stakes in significant hydrocarbon assets. 
“Western firms had to exit working on our assets because of the sanctions imposed by the US. The local service providers have not been effective,"" the person mentioned above said on condition of anonymity.
Mint reported on 7 April 2015 about oilfield service contractors such as Halliburton and Baker Hughes Inc. withdrawing from the hydrocarbon assets of OVL in Russia after the US and the European Union (EU) imposed sanctions on the Vladimir Putin government.
Queries emailed to spokespersons of ONGC and OVL on Sunday evening remained unanswered till time of going to press.
ONGC has also set aside around $600 million to cover the impairment of Imperial’s asset value. The state-owned firm has decided to not invest more money in Imperial Energy until it has a suitable strategy in place. Russian conglomerate Sistema JSFC had valued Imperial Energy’s assets at $500 million, a quarter of the sum ONGC paid for the acquisition. 
OVL’s acquisition of Imperial in 2009 to secure the Siberian deposits and reduce India’s dependence on imports failed to meet projections because of falling oil production, and prompted the Comptroller and Auditor General of India to fault the purchase in 2011. Mint reported on 17 June 2010 that OVL’s miscalculation was likely to raise doubts about the processes followed in the acquisition that was completed in 2009. 
Imperial’s main asset is its Siberian fields with an acreage of around 16,800 sq. km.
ONGC has had a tenuous experience with Imperial, with the plan to acquire a 25% stake in the entity formed after the proposed merger of JSFC Sistema’s units JSC Bashneft and OAO RussNeft with UK-based explorer Imperial Energy coming unstuck. Also, OVL’s offer to Liberty Resources Llc of a stake of up to 30% in Imperial subject to Denver-based Liberty striking success in the Bazhenov shale formation in the region didn’t work out. Bazhenov may hold around 360 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. 
OVL has invested $28 billion in 41 projects across 20 countries. It has probable reserves of 711.362 million metric tonnes of oil equivalent."
62,2019-02-05,ONGC,"HPCL has stuck to its guns and has refused to recognise ONGC as its promoterWhen the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL

NEW DELHI :
The government has asked Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company has sought further clarifications before adhering to the direction, a top company official said.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) had in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore. Thereafter it sought to be identified as the company promoter but HPCL continues to list ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC is listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11%"" shareholding of the company.
HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh K Surana acknowledged that the government has written to the company asking it to recognise ONGC as co-promoter but ""we have asked for certain clarifications"" on the said directive.
He sidestepped regulatory issues like insider trading regulations not applying on ONGC because of it not being listed as a promoter. It has a nominee on HPCL board but the SEBI's insider trading regulations are not applied to it because it is not classified as a promoter.
Surana said the transaction which was aimed at meeting the government's disinvestment target was based on the premise that ""HPCL will maintain its separate identity, its separate brand, its separate culture and it will be independently board managed Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE).""
""To that extent there were statements made by ministers in Parliament as well,"" he said.
Also, it was said that the government will continue to have control of HPCL. ""That fundamentally remains. So everything else is only technicality and modality of how do we go through that. So HPCL will continue to be a listed, board managed CPSE, having separate brand and culture,"" he said.
But for ONGC, which had to borrow  ₹24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, wanted to be recognised as a promoter of HPCL. After all, no one spends  ₹36,915 crore without getting anything for its shareholders and so it wrote a strongly worded letter to HPCL, warning of regulatory consequences of not recognising the majority shareholder as the promoter.
HPCL, however, has stuck to its guns and has refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.
When the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.
ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.
But HPCL refused to acknowledge ONGC as its promoter as evident from its shareholding filing with stock exchanges, the latest being on January 21.
Surana said there is a distinction between ownership and management and ownership is segregated from shareholding. ""Shareholders are not owners of assets of the company,"" he said.
""As far as promoter issue is concerned, it has never been in doubt that the Government of India will continue to be the promoter of HPCL. The issue was whether ONGC should also be added as co-promoter. We had asked certain clarification and the government has advised that the Government of India is the promoter of HPCL and ONGC can also be added as a promoter of HPCL. But to add ONGC as a promoter, there is a certain procedure to be followed and certain clarification required. We have asked for clarifications on those,"" he said.
Without elaborating on the clarifications sought, he said listing rules and Companies Act defines the procedure and certain requirements of who could be called a promoter.
""We have asked certain clarifications. Once we receive clarification, we will do that. We are maintaining status quo till then,"" he said.
There is a procedure defined to the classification of promoters and HPCL will follow that procedure, he said.
Surana said all appointments on HPCL board are done by the government and ONGC as a promoter has no say in that.
After ONGC bought out government stake, HPCL became its subsidiary. Since ONGC takeover in January 2018, HPCL has made four stock exchange filings about the shareholding pattern of the company -- the first on April 20, 2018, then on July 12, 2018, then on October 19, 2018, and finally on January 21, 2019. In all four, ONGC is shown as the public shareholder and President of India listed as the promoter.
According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.
When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).
Surana has retained the title of Chairman and Managing Director despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.
ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.
Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.
ONGC has appointed its Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar to HPCL board. He has replaced Sushma Taishete Rath, Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas.
Prior to this, HPCL had two government nominee directors -- Rath and Sandeep Poundrik, Joint Secretary (Refineries) of the Oil Ministry. After the appointment of Kumar, there remains only one government nominee director on HPCL board."

60,2019-02-07,ONGC,"The intent of CHRB’s rankings’ list is excellent, but it’s hollowed by naïveté

This is about perception management in the domain of business and human rights.
Vale SA, a Brazilian transnational metals and mining giant, is among the world’s largest producers of iron ore and nickel. You may have heard of the 25 January disaster. One of Vale’s iron ore tailings—mining waste—dams collapsed near its Córrego do Feijão mine operations in the state of Minas Gerais, north of Rio de Janeiro. More than 80 people died. Many are missing. The countryside—land, water sources, forests—is devastated.
Vale just got kicked off the 2018 list prepared by Corporate Human Rights Benchmark (CHRB), a notable cross-industry effort. Vale had scored well, leaping by 30% to arrive at the 60-70% band, near the top end of a grading of 101 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the world on various human rights indicators. At present, the list covers agricultural products, extractives and apparels, three sectors that count some of the worst human rights offenders. (Coal India Ltd is in the 20-30% band and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd in the 0-10% band. More on that shortly).
Governance and policy are given a score out of 10, respect and due diligence have a maximum score of 25, remedy and grievance mechanisms are at 15, performance: practices is at 20, as is performance: responses, and transparency maxes out at 10.
As to Vale: “Most of the improvements in scores were related to high level commitments/systems and better disclosure,"" noted an explanation from CHRB dated 28 January, “but they were also backed up in part by conversations around a positive change in attitude within the company...""
That’s the problem with CHRB’s list. The intent is excellent, but it’s hollowed by naïveté. While unveiling its 2017 ranking, which graded 98 companies, CHRB urged the list’s laggards to “act decisively"" so that they could upgrade themselves with regard to “the moral imperative, business case, and commercial viability of taking action on human rights"". CHRB is also fond of phrases such as “race to the top"".
“Moral imperative"" is twaddle. Phrases such as “race to the top"" for companies to remain competitive in the rankings are also disconcerting, especially as it is no secret that races to the top of feel-good rankings are helped along by public relations.
Glib corporate commitment and outreach has saved more than one company. However, it could undermine CHRB’s rankings.
Take Vale. In November 2015, a tailings dam of Samarco Mineração SA in Minas Gerais state collapsed. It killed 19 people, devastated the village of Bento Rodrigues, polluted a river, and displaced several hundred people. Samarco is a joint venture of Vale and BHP Billiton Ltd (now BHP). In June 2018, Reuters reported that “Samarco and parent companies Vale SA and BHP Billiton Ltd have signed a deal with Brazilian authorities that settles a 20 billion reais ($5.30 billion) lawsuit"" over the 2015 disaster.
BHP scored in the 60-69% band in CHRB’s 2017 list. In the 2018 list, it’s in the 70-80% band along with another extractives major with an iffy business and human rights application, Rio Tinto Plc.
CHRB’s removal of Vale is hardly going to make amends, which is a shame. Early plans had called for extending its list to 500 companies by mid-2018 and to include finance, engineering, pharmaceuticals, and the information and communication technology sectors. That’s now history. Hiccups with the 2018 list are only going to delay things—perhaps, alas, even jeopardize the project.
The project brings together the Institute for Human Rights and Business, and the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre. These UK-based organizations are joined by Calvert Investments Inc., Aviva Investors, VBDO (The Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development) and Eiris Foundation. The last two focus on advising responsible investment. Stockholm-based Nordea Wealth Management is part of the project. Representatives from these organizations form CHRB’s steering committee, with Steve Waygood, Aviva’s chief responsible investment officer—there’s a mouthful of politically-correct designation—chairing.
There will now have to be much tweaking of methodology and mind.

59,2019-06-11,ONGC,"The government must no longer eviscerate state-run enterprises to fulfil its budgetary needs

It has been apparent for a while now that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not a great believer in privatization, except at the margins of the public sector universe. While half-hearted attempts were made to privatize Air India last year—which should hopefully be implemented this fiscal—Modi quite likely believes that a large and efficient state sector is important to his scheme of things.
One does not have to agree with his economic philosophy or orientation to examine whether his policies have succeeded. If you believe that we need a robust public sector presence in sectors like banking, petroleum or telecom, you need to do many things to strengthen it. But has Modi done that?
The answer has to be no. Reason: the public sector has been used to milk it of resources for budgetary, social and political needs, not strengthened. What is called disinvestment, as has been frequently pointed out, is nothing more than the sale of a minority of shares for managing budget deficits.
Over the last three years, for example, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) was asked to pay cash to buy a majority stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL), Power Finance Corporation for Rural Electrification Corporation, and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for IDBI Bank. A cashless share swap would have been the best way to strengthen synergies within the public sector stable, and the government, too, would have benefited in the medium term from the rising share valuations of the merged entities. Instead, it opted to weaken them financially.
LIC is playing with policyholders’ money and when it is repeatedly asked to bail out failing public sector initial public offerings, you are invariably weakening India’s biggest financial behemoth and insurer to the nation. One shudders to think what will happen if, god forbid, LIC needed a bailout some time in the future as its investments turn rancid. LIC is too big to fail or bail.
Over the last 18 months, as the need to meet disinvestment targets became urgent, such ideas ended up destroying 18-20% of the Nifty Public Sector Enterprise (PSE) index value even while the overall stock market has risen. The ONGC scrip, for example, has tanked more than 20% since it was asked to buy out HPCL in January 2018.
Public sector banks, despite carrying the biggest burden of bad loans on their books, because of mindless United Progressive Alliance-era munificence, were loaded with additional burdens such as extending Jan Dhan accounts to all households or handling the demonetization process. It is well-known that low-balance accounts are not just unprofitable but also carry an annual cost for banks.
In 2018-19, as tax revenues tanked far below the levels indicated in the budget, other public sector players, from Food Corporation of India to Nabard, were asked to borrow to finance their operations when the outlays had actually been budgeted for. To maintain a mythical fiscal deficit target of 3.4%, the final budget numbers indicate that the centre’s costs were effectively shifted to public sector units. Even though they may ultimately be compensated, there is little doubt that both the public sector and the fisc have been weakened with such dodgy fiscal management.
One of the things we misunderstood about Modi when he said that government should not be in business was to jump to the conclusion that he was a committed privatizer. While Modi will certainly privatize some loss-making units, including possibly Air India if the scheme is sufficiently attractive to investors, he clearly does not intend to privatize companies that are core to his welfarist strategies, including banks and petroleum companies.
However, even if one agrees with his goals, one cannot agree with his government’s methods. If you want to maintain a strong public sector in some spheres, the least you can do is capitalize them properly and make sure that they are run efficiently and, where needed, given direct budgetary support to get the job done.
You may want an LIC or State Bank of India to remain in the public sector forever but, in that event, you must ensure that they always have the budgetary support and capital they need for doing your job. You cannot emasculate them and then expect them to bail your budgets out.
The issue is not an ideological one about left and right, socialism and market-orientation. Whatever ideology you believe in, you must be willing to put your money where your mouth (or heart) is. You cannot expect to endlessly extract money from the goose that has so far laid golden eggs and financed your schemes at great cost to themselves.
Modi has done a lot to reduce the pressure of cronyism on banks and other PSEs, but it can be no one’s case that his policies have strengthened the parts of the public sector he wants to retain in the public domain.
Modi may not have started the trend towards eviscerating the public sector, but he hasn’t stopped the process either. Modi 2.0 needs to reverse this slide, assuming he does not now openly adopt privatization as strategy.

58,2019-06-14,ONGC,"India and UAE were considered among the top 10 most important sources of FDI for the 2019 to 2021 periodIndia’s FDI outflows more than doubled in 2017 to $11.3 bn, mostly led by ONGC, which bought a 15% stake in an offshore field in Namibia from Tullow Oil

NEW DELHI :
Once a minnow, India may break into the league of top 20 countries for outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) as early as end-2019, according to a survey of investment promotion agencies (IPAs) by United Nations Conference on Trade and Investment (UNCTAD).
In 2018, outward foreign investment by India was flat at $11 billion.
“India and the United Arab Emirates, not traditionally in the top 20 outward investor countries, were also considered among the top 10 most important sources of FDI for the 2019 to 2021 period,"" UNCTAD says in its latest World Investment Report.
India’s FDI outflows more than doubled in 2017 to $11.3 billion, mostly led by public sector enterprise Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), which bought a 15% stake in an offshore field in Namibia from Tullow Oil, which was founded in Ireland and headquartered in the UK.
IPAs rank the US and China–in a joint first place–as the most likely sources of foreign investment to their countries. Three large European economies– the UK, Germany and France–were considered the next most important sources of FDI.
After declining 9% in 2017, FDI inflows into India rose 6% in 2018 to $42 billion, according to the report. However, India’s rank as a source country for FDI fell one notch to 10th position, as Spain raced ahead of India.
Notable megadeals in 2018 included the acquisition of Flipkart, India’s biggest e-commerce platform, by US-headquartered retail major Walmart. Besides, telecommunication deals involving Vodafone (United Kingdom) and American Tower (United States) amounted to $2 billion.
Announced greenfield investment into India doubled to $56 billion in 2018, with projects in a number of manufacturing industries, including automotive, attracting funds.
According to the India Brand Equity Foundation, outbound investments from India have undergone a considerable change in the last decade not only in terms of magnitude, but also in terms of geographical spread and sectorial composition.
“While in the first half (of the last decade), overseas investments were directed to resource-rich countries, such as Australia, the UAE and Sudan, in the latter half, OID was channelled into countries providing higher tax benefits such as Mauritius, Singapore, British Virgin Islands, and the Netherlands,"" it says.
Some of the major overseas investments by Indian firms in recent times include Infosys acquiring a 75% stake in ABN AMRO’s subsidiary in March, and Sun Pharma raising its stake in Russia’s PJSC Biosintez to 96.06% in the same month. In February, auto components major JBM Group had purchased a majority stake in Linde-Wiemann, a German structural components and assemblies producer."
56,2019-06-16,ONGC,"Advisory services firm KPMG has received the mandate to run PEC process for ONGCThe marginal and small fields will be auctioned under the PEC mechanism, to enhance production

MUMBAI :
Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) will shortly auction more than 60 of its discovered small and marginal fields to private companies, said two people aware of the development.
The fields will be auctioned under the production enhancement contracts (PEC) mechanism, followed by global energy firms to enhance production from mature oil fields. Under PEC, the private company invests and introduces comprehensive technologies to improve production, while the ownership of the fields rests with ONGC. In January this year, the government allowed state-owned explorers to rope in the private sector to raise production to better exploit its hydrocarbon resources and cut dependence on foreign oil.
“Global advisory services firm KPMG has received the mandate to run the PEC process for ONGC,"" said the first person cited above. “PEC is a priority as the government is attributing an enormous amount of importance to it. Besides, stagnating domestic production of oil and gas is a major concern. So, as a consequence of that, ONGC has decided to offer its hydrocarbon blocks to other explorers,"" this person said.
ONGC and KPMG did not respond to emails sent on Friday.
The small and marginal fields are said to contribute only 5% to ONGC’s total production while 95% of its production comes from 60 large fields. Marginal fields are discovered fields but are considered uneconomical for development at the government-mandated price of $3.69 per million British thermal units for the April and September 2019 period, which is below the cost of production for most fields to be given for PEC.
Thus, ONGC prefers to concentrate on producing from its large fields and outsource production from the small and marginal fields to private players, saving its time, effort and investments.
During the March quarter, ONGC’s net profit fell the most in 13 quarters due to lower crude oil prices and higher costs. Net profit slumped 51% sequentially to  ₹4,045 crore in the January-March period. Its net realization was at $61.29 a barrel versus $66.4 in the previous quarter. While crude sales were down 4.9% year-on-year to 5.9 million metric tonnes, gas sales rose 7.9% to 6.558 billion cubic metres.
In November 2017, as a production enhancement measure, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), a regulatory body under the ministry of petroleum and natural Gas, had proposed to sell a 60% stake in the hydrocarbon fields of ONGC and
Oil India Ltd (OIL) to private exploration firms. The two firms would retain the rest 40%. The plan was expected to include 15 blocks—11 of ONGC and four of OIL.
The plan, however, could not go through as ONGC strongly opposed the DGH proposal, countering it with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan.
“While the terms of the condition of the PEC are still being worked out, ONGC is looking at something that is more holistic than what it has attempted in the past,"" said the second person, adding that the PEC process is underway for some time. “The idea is to look at a broader set of assets and investors. So, attracting new investors, inducting new technology and talent is part of this plan in addition to enhancing production,"" he said. The first person said ONGC feels it should be allowed to seek revenue-sharing partnership for its fields. Field operations could be outsourced to foreign or private firms that offered the highest revenue or production share over and above a baseline production."
54,2019-06-23,ONGC,"Govt headhunter PESB on 17 June called ONGC MD Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new director (finance) of HPCLOil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore

NEW DELHI :
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has for the last 15 months refused to recognise its majority shareholder ONGC as its promoter but the government has now for all practical purposes started giving the company its due recognition.
Government headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17 called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL, a move seen as a stamp of approval for ONGC being the parent of HPCL, sources in know of the development said.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore. HPCL thereafter became its subsidiary but HPCL management has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.
In regulatory filings for five consecutive quarters, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 per cent"" shareholding of the company.
Sources said the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director and that would in a way end all the wrangling over the promoter issue.
HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28 and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.
For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake, a PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.
The Department of Personnel guidelines state that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding Company is invited to assist the Board.""
Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance). HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana, who till now used to sit on the interview panels to select directors of the company, was not called.
They said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.
Coal India Ltd is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited.
Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.
While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it get full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price sensitive information.
ONGC, which had to borrow  ₹24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, first raised the issue of being formally recognised as a promoter of HPCL in August last year.
When the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.
ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.
According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.
When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).
HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana has retained the title of CMD despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.
ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.
Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

MUMBAI :
Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) may buy  ₹5,615 crore worth of compulsorily convertible debentures (CCDs) of ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL) after failing to find an equity investor for its petrochemicals arm, said two people directly aware of the matter.
The planned tranche of CCDs issued in 2016 is part of a  ₹7,286-crore CCD programme of OPal, a joint venture between ONGC (49.4%), GAIL (India) Ltd ( 49.2%), and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (1.4%). OPaL used the proceeds to partially finance project expenditures and repay loans.
CCDs are financial instruments that have the feature of compulsory conversion into equity as per terms and are treated as quasi-equity.
The CCDs have an unconditional and irrevocable mandatory put option on OPaL’s sponsors, ONGC, for the buy-out of the CCDs at the end of the 35th month from the deemed date of allotment, as well as the undertaking to fund the coupon payment, according to the terms of issuance.
The sponsor would also have the right to buy out the CCDs at the end of the 24th, 30th, and 35th months from the deemed date of allotment, according to corporate filings. The CCDs have a tenor of 36 months from the deemed date of allotment and do not have any conversion option for the period it is held.
The ONGC board could, however, also consider extending the tenor of the CCDs, said the people cited above.
“Extending the tenor of the CCDs is also being deliberated upon. In case it is not approved by the board, ONGC may have to exercise the put option. CCDs will allow OPaL to maintain status quo on its equity structure and equity investor process induction process bringing in an investor by selling stake in the company will smoothen,"" said one of the persons mentioned above on condition of anonymity.
For more than three years, ONGC has maintained that it is in talks with interested potential petrochemical companies to sell a 25% stake in OPaL. The process has, however, faced unexplained delays.
“The potential investors are carrying out due diligence, including site visits and management interactions with OPaL and ONGC. However, the equity induction transaction may take time because of which ONGC has to buy back the CCDs,"" said an official from a professional services firm, requesting anonymity.
ONGC did not reply to an email sent on 19 June. An ONGC official dealing with the matter did not comment.
“There could be concern regarding valuation. Plus for Indian petrochemicals companies cost of capital is high and there is a lack of adequate infrastructure which puts our petrochemical manufacturers at a significant disadvantage compared to their counterparts in other countries,"" said the second person cited above, requesting anonymity.
OPaL is a $4.5 billion mega petrochemical project located at Dahej, Gujarat. It started production in 2016-17 and has been ramping up its production in phases. OPaL’s petrochemical complex houses India’s largest greenfield single-location, dual-feed cracker unit.
It has a capacity of cracking gaseous and liquid feed to produce 1,100 kilo tonnes of ethylene per annum (ktpa), which can produce a wide spectrum of chemicals.
OPaL competes with Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd, ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd (OMPL), and Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, which export petrochemical products in the international market. Reliance Industries is among the world’s largest producers of petrochemicals.
Petrochemicals account for nearly 30% of the Indian chemicals industry. An increase in consumption of plastics has lifted domestic demand in the past decade with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-9%.
In the past five years, domestic demand has logged a 7-8% CAGR amid healthy demand from end-use applications such as packaging, automobiles, and electricals and electronics.
India needs to actively encourage foreign direct investment in the petrochemical sector instead of free trade agreements to utilise growing domestic demand to create value within the country, according to a white paper titled Impact of Free Trade Agreements on Indian Petrochemical Industry, released in May by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry,"

52,2019-06-28,ONGC,"ONGC looks for partners to boost output of 64 oilfieldsIn 2015, PM Modi set a target of reducing import dependence on crude oil to 67% by 2022

NEW DELHI :
State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which accounts for 73% of India’s oil and gas output, has called for bids seeking partners to develop its 64 discovered small and marginal fields.
These so-called marginal fields were awarded to the state-owned firm on a nomination basis but remained undeveloped because they lie in tough terrain or had low reserves. In January this year, the government asked state-owned explorers to rope in the private sector to raise production to better exploit its hydrocarbon resources and cut dependence on foreign oil.
“ONGC announces Notice Inviting Offer (NIO) seeking partners for enhancement of oil and gas production from its 64 marginal nomination fields with the intention to maximize recovery from these fields by infusion of new technology,"" the public sector unit said in a statement on Friday.
The planned auction, reported by Mint on 21 November 2014, comes at a time when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government aims to increase domestic production to reduce import dependence to buffer its consumers from the spike in global prices. The plan aims to leverage the expertise of private and foreign firms to grow domestic production and help meet India’s demand for energy. Between 2013 and 2017, India’s demand for petroleum products grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5.5%. In March 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a target of reducing import dependence on crude oil by 10 percentage points to 67% by 2022.
“Companies, either alone or in consortium or joint ventures, may bid for one or more contract areas. The bidders are required to fulfil the requisite technical and financial criteria and the bids would be evaluated on the basis of revenue sharing from the incremental oil and gas production,"" the statement added.
The contract period will be for 15 years which can be extended by another five years, with the successful bidders allowed completing marketing freedom for sale of oil and gas on arms length basis.
Since India imports over 80% of its crude needs and 18% of natural gas, higher energy prices stoke inflation and hurt the country’s economic growth. The price of the Indian crude basket, which represents the average of Oman, Dubai and Brent crude, has been firming up. Any spike in global crude prices will impact India’s oil import bill and trade deficit. Every dollar increase in the price of oil raises the import bill by around Rs10,700 crore on an annual basis.
“The offer shall allow interested companies to participate in the International Competitive Bidding (ICB) process announced for 17 onshore contract areas comprising of 64 oil and gas producing fields with total in-place O+OEG volume of about 300 MMTOE,"" the ONGC statement said.
In November 2017, as a production enhancement measure, the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), a regulatory body under the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, had proposed to sell 60% stake in the hydrocarbon fields of ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) to private exploration firms. The two firms would retain the rest 40%. The plan was expected to include 15 blocks --11 of ONGC and four of OIL.
The plan, however, failed as ONGC strongly opposed the DGH proposal, countering it with its own proposal that it be allowed to outsource operations on the same terms as the government plan.
Opec expects global demand to surge 33%, or 91 million barrels oil equivalent per day (mboed), between 2015 and 2040. Of this, 24%, or a 22 mboed jump, is expected from India. With domestic production unable to meet the ever-increasing demand, India will depend on imports in the foreseeable future.
The NDA government has opened up markets to the private sector for retail outlets, implemented the discovered small fields policy, the Hydrocarbon Exploration Licensing Policy and the Open Acreage Licensing Policy and allowed marketing and pricing freedom for gas produced from deep and ultra deep water areas and coal-bed methane fields."

New Delhi: As part of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’s strategy of reducing import dependence, state run Oil India Ltd (OIL) has called for bids seeking partners for its two discovered marginal fields in Assam and Rajasthan to enhance production.
The OIL’s call for bids follows state run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation’ (ONGC) tender seeking partners for its 64 discovered small and marginal fields to enhance production on Friday. The last date for submitting bids for OIL’s Digboi and Baggitibba fields is 20 December.
The total in place hydrocarbon volume of the two fields is of the order of 49 MMTOE.
The offer would provide an opportunity to oil and gas service providers and operators to partner with OIL on a revenue sharing model. However, the Petroleum Mining Lease and Ownership of the fields will remain with OIL. The new technology partner will infuse new and appropriate fit for purpose technology to increase the production,"" OIL said in a statement on Saturday.
These so-called marginal fields were awarded to the state-owned firms on a nomination basis but remained undeveloped because they lie in tough terrain or had low reserves. In January this year, the government asked state-owned explorers to rope in the private sector to raise production to better exploit its hydrocarbon resources and cut dependence on foreign oil.
These call for bids by Indian state run firms comes in the backdrop of tightening US sanctions on Iran, and production curbs by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and Russia. The Monday meeting of Opec in Vienna is expected to decide on continuing with the production curbs even as the tensions in Persian Gulf escalate.
With Opec accounting for around 40% of global production, any decision will have a wide-ranging impact on energy markets. The decision of the Saudi Arabia led cartel will have a bearing on India, the world’s third largest oil importer. India’s energy needs are mainly met through imports, and Opec accounts for around 83% of the country’s total crude oil imports.

New Delhi: India will likely give up direct control of its most-profitable state-run behemoths as Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeks to keep budget deficit in check, while reviving investments to spur economic growth.
The government has identified the biggest energy companies such as Oil & Natural Gas Corp, Indian Oil Corp, NTPC Ltd. and GAIL India Ltd as probable candidates for cutting its direct holding to below 51%, Atanu Chakraborty, who steers Modi’s asset sale department, said in an interview in New Delhi. “Government’s indirect holding, through arms such as Life Insurance Corp. of India, will stay above 51%.""

49,2019-07-11,ONGC,"A total of combined 100% stake in Pawan Hans is now available to the bidders. The last date for submitting bids is 22 AugustThe government holds 51% stake in Pawan Hans and the rest is held by ONGC, Mumbai

Mumbai: After previous unsuccessful attempts to sell the country's biggest public sector helicopter operator, Pawan Hans Ltd (PHL), the government on Thursday invited fresh bids for offloading its stake in the company.
The government holds 51% stake in PHL and the rest is held by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Mumbai, in what now ranks as South Asia's largest helicopter company.
However, in a huge embarrassment after the government announced its intention to sell PHL, the company's performance has nosedived sharply and the 33-year-old firm will record its first-ever loss at over  ₹75 crore during fiscal 2018-2019.
A senior aviation official said that such multiple attempts to sell the company has actually proved detrimental to its image.
""The government has already merged certain public sector entities with excellent results. It must consider the option of merging PHL with the Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL), which will be mutually beneficial to both. Such a measure could create a truly world-class and profitable company,"" the official, requesting anonymity, told IANS.
Industry players express doubts over the expectations of earning around  ₹1,000 crore from the sale, pointing to PHL's loss and the ongoing huge turbulence in the country's aviation sector that has not spared even Air India.
In April 2018, the government had first announced the proposed strategic sale in PHL and sought Expression of Interest (EoI) from prospective bidders.
In August 2018, the ONGC board decided to unconditionally offer its entire stake of 273,166 shares (49%) in PHL at the same price and similar terms and conditions as decided by the government for sale of its 51% shareholding.
Accordingly, a total of combined 100% stake in the PHL is now available to the bidders. The last date for submitting bids is 22 August.
However, in case state-run ONGC is unable to sell its 49% stake for any reason, the government's stake sale would remain unaffected and the successful bidder would have to execute a shareholders' agreement with ONGC.
Launched in October 1985 as the Helicopter Corporation of India (HCI), PHL is a 'Mini-Ratna 1' category company with around 42 helicopters providing varied services.
These include offshore operations, mainly to ONGC at the Bombay High oilfields, inter-island transportation, remote or inaccessible areas, rescue works, corporate and VVIP charters, tourism and other special services.
It had charted out a massive expansion plan to become a 100-helicopter company by 2027, diversify into seaplanes, small fixed-wing aircraft, take up foreign projects and create infrastructure like helipads and heliports.
In January 2017, the government approved the privatisation of PHL after which it was put up for sale for the first time last year, and a renewed attempt is now being made after the matter went into cold storage because of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.
Significantly, until last year, PHL maintained a profitable balance sheet and has so far paid over  ₹270 crore as dividends to the government, before slipping into the red this year.

NEW DELHI :
The government wants Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) to sell its golf courses in Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat, sending the company into a tizzy as one of them has two producing oil wells, sources said.
The Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) has deemed golf courses and sports clubs owned by central public sector enterprises as 'non-core' assets and wants to monetise them.
A recent exercise by DIPAM to assess land banks and other non-core assets of government departments as well as central PSUs identified two of ONGC's golf courses in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, as also a sports club owned by Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) in Chembur, Mumbai.
Sources said the exercise identified only properties with real estate potential in prime cities while leaving out golf courses ONGC has in Ankleshwar in Gujarat and Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh. It also did not prioritise the grand golf course Oil India Ltd (OIL) has in Assam and one ONGC has in the North-East.
While the golf courses are used by executives of the PSUs for playing the leisurely game and hosting their business partners, ONGC had built the one in Ahmedabad after it struck oil in the city more than two decades back.
After the Motera field was discovered in Ahmedabad, ONGC was wary of encroachment around the oil wells in a city that was developing into a megapolis. So it built a golf course around the wells to ward off encroachers, they said.
The golf course identified by DIPAM has two producing oil wells, sources said, adding the field exists in a nomination block that according to rules ONGC cannot sell off or farm-out to outsiders.
The DIPAM diktat has sent the company into a tizzy as selling the golf course would mean the buyer also gets ownership of the two oil wells -- something which is not allowed as per rules, they said.
A recent meeting of officials from DIPAM, NITI Aayog, Oil Ministry and other departments gave its nod to monetising non-core assets of ONGC and BPCL. The proceeds will go to the PSUs and not to the exchequer, they said, adding the aim of the exercise is to rationalise resource utilisation in the public sector.
The field may be one of the 64 that ONGC has identified for involving private and foreign firms for raising output. But even in that exercise, ONGC is retaining the ownership of the field and its licence and only getting the private partner for raising output beyond a pre-agreed threshold.
The incremental output beyond the agreed baseline will be shared with the private or foreign partner, sources said, adding ONGC as the licensee would be responsible for statutory payments such as cess on the entire oil produced.

45,2019-07-23,ONGC,"In a regulatory filing HPCL made to stock exchanges on July 21, HPCL again listed ONGC as 'public shareholder' and not as its promoterThe government too has been treating HPCL as ONGC subsidiary

New Delhi: Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has for the last one-and-half-years refused to recognise its majority shareholder ONGC as a promoter, according to stock exchange filings.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore. Following which, HPCL became ONGC's subsidiary.
HPCL management however, has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.
In a regulatory filing HPCL made to stock exchanges on July 21, in the shareholding for the quarter ending June 30, 2019, HPCL again listed ONGC as ""public shareholder"" and not as its promoter.
Just like the previous five quarterly filings, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 per cent"" shareholding of the company.
Sources close to ONGC said, IT company Mindtree recognised Larsen and Toubro as its promoter within a day of the engineering giant acquiring a majority stake, but HPCL has steadfastly refused to acknowledge its new promoter, ONGC.
An email sent to HPCL spokesperson seeking comments remained answered.
While HPCL management has been unrelenting, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan in written replies to questions in Parliament had listed the company as a subsidiary of ONGC.
The government too has been treating HPCL as ONGC subsidiary and its headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17, called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL.
Sources said, the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director.
Till now, HPCL Chairman and Managing Director Mukesh K Surana would sit on the PESB interview panels for selecting directors.
HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28, and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.
For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake, PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.
The Department of Personnel guidelines states that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding company is invited to assist the Board."" Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance).
Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.
While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it gets full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price-sensitive information.
According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.
When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).
Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.
Sources said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited to allow Surana retain the Chairman and Managing Director designation, even though there cannot be two Chairmen within a group, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.
Coal India is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited.

42,2019-08-01,ONGC,"Rolls-Royce provided engine spare parts to HAL for servicing gas turbines used by GAIL and ONGCCBI said officials from HAL, ONGC and GAIL may have been involved in improper procurement from Rolls-Royce

NEW DELHI :
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has opened an investigation into Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, alleging the UK-based engine maker and its Indian arm improperly used a third-party to conduct business with three Indian state-owned companies.
In a report published on Tuesday, the CBI also said officials from the Indian companies - Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), ONGC and GAIL - may have been involved in improper procurement from Rolls-Royce.
Rolls-Royce provided engine spare parts to HAL for servicing gas turbines used by GAIL and ONGC, both of which are involved in the oil and gas sector, the report said.
The report said Rolls-Royce's appointment of Ashok Patni, director at a Singapore-based firm called Aashmore Private Ltd, as a commercial adviser in dealing with the three government-owned firms violated regulations and the arrangement may have been used for paying kickbacks to officials.
In an emailed statement, a Rolls-Royce spokesperson said that the police report related to the use of intermediaries by company’s erstwhile energy business in India, and that no current employee had been involved in those deals.
""We await contact from the CBI and will respond appropriately,"" the spokesperson said.
Spokesmen for GAIL and ONGC did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. Gopal Sutar, a spokesman for HAL, declined to comment.
Aashmore and Patni could not be immediately reached for comment.

41,2019-08-04,ONGC,"The complaint was filed by Indian National Shipowners' Association (INSA), a representative body of various ship ownersWith drastic fall in oil prices, ONGC in April 2016 issued de-hiring notice to 27 vessels by invoking the unilateral termination clause

NEW DELHI :
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has dismissed a complaint against ONGC alleging abuse of dominant position with regard to certain contractual provisions for hiring offshore support vessels.
The fair trade regulator had ordered a probe against Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) in June 2018 after prima-facie finding the oil major in violation of competition norms.
The complaint was filed by Indian National Shipowners' Association (INSA), a representative body of various ship owners.
To support its offshore exploration and production activities, ONGC requires offshore support vessels (OSV). In this regard, it issues tenders for OSV suppliers with detailed technical eligibility requirements and special contract conditions (SCC), among others, collectively referred to as CHA.
INSA had complained about the Charter Hire Agreement (CHA) of ONGC which had a particular clause that gave unilateral right to the state-owned firm to terminate the agreement. The said clause was one-sided and abusive in nature, INSA alleged.
By terminating the agreement unilaterally, ONGC violated Section 4 of the Competition Act which pertains to abuse of dominant position in the relevant market, INSA alleged.
For the case, CCI considered ""market for charter hire of OSVs in the Indian EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone)"" as the relevant one and found that ONGC was dominant in it.
The prevailing circumstances also need to be taken into consideration to establish whether the firm abused its dominant position or not, CCI said.
It is an undisputed fact that the crude oil prices started falling drastically from mid-2014, from over USD 100 per barrel to under USD 30 per barrel by January 2016, which affected oil companies worldwide, including ONGC, the fair trade regulator said.
With drastic fall in oil prices, ONGC in April 2016 issued de-hiring notice to 27 vessels by invoking the unilateral termination clause.
Regarding invoking of the clause, CCI said that there was an objective necessity to bring down the costs in new market circumstances and the termination was driven solely by this necessity and obligation.
Besides, the clause was invoked by ONGC in an exceptional situation which was not an ordinary change of circumstance, it added.
The clause ""which gives unilateral right of termination without assigning any reasons to ONGC, in itself is not found abusive given the disproportionate risk that ONGC has to bear in case of such termination by the OSV, especially when the Commission has found, in the given facts and circumstances, that the invocation of such clause was not in bad-faith"", CCI said in an order dated August 2.
The regulator further said that had it been found that ONGC invoked the clause frequently in order to make illegitimate gains at the expense of the other contracting party, the Commission may have had the occasion to look at this case differently.
No such situation seems to exist in the present case, it added.
Accordingly, the ""Commission is of the considered view that in the present case the conduct of ONGC does not tantamount to an abuse of dominant position within the meaning of Section 4 of the Act"", CCI said and directed the case to be closed."

Mumbai: The State Bank of India (SBI) has invited bids for overseas oil and gas assets of Videocon Industries Ltd, a newspaper advertisement showed on Monday, as India seeks to recover billions of dollars in loans from the beleaguered private firm.
Consumer electronics firm Videocon Industries is one of the most indebted companies in India, with outstanding loans worth around  ₹60,000 crore ($8.53 billion) from its financial and operational creditors.
In October, SBI Caps, the investment banking arm of State Bank of India, was appointed to start the process of valuation and monetisation of the firm's oil and gas assets overseas.
SBI said it had appointed consultant Deloitte to find buyers for Videocon's exploration assets in Brazil and Indonesia.
""It is a process where qualified parties from India and overseas will be invited to bid for the assets,"" said a banker involved in the process, adding that expressions of interest would be received until 22 August.
Videocon did not immediately reply to calls seeking comment.
Videocon Industries has oil and gas assets in India, Brazil and Indonesia, in addition to its now-defunct consumer electronics business in India.
The company ventured into Brazil and Mozambique oil and gas assets over a decade ago, buoyed by its experience in oil production in India's east coast.
However, burgeoning debt forced the company to sell its coveted asset in Mozambique to a consortium of Indian state-owned companies led by Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd in 2014 for $2.4 billion.

New Delhi: After a rap from market regulator Sebi, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has re-filed shareholding pattern of the company for last six quarters, listing its majority owner Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) as a 'promoter'.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had asked HPCL to re-file shareholding pattern to stock exchanges by 13 August 2019 for all quarters since Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) acquired government's entire stake in the refiner in January 2018.
HPCL has re-filed with the stock exchanges shareholding pattern of last six quarters beginning March 2018, the company said in a regulatory filing.
In the revised shareholding, under the 'statement showing the shareholding pattern of the Promoter and Promoter Group', it listed ONGC as a promoter with 77.88 crore shares or 51.11% stake just below President of India with 'zero' shares.
ONGC in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore but continued to be mentioned under ""public shareholder"" in the filings by the oil marketing company.
President of India, in six shareholding pattern filings of HPCL made since then, remained as ""promoter"" without any stake in the company.
All these have now been rectified to mention ONGC as a promoter below President of India.
Sebi had in an 6 August letter asked HPCL to re-file ""the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges revising the status of ONGC as 'promoter'.""""Further, as informed by HPCL vide its email dated 27 June 2019, Government of India has also advised HPCL that 'President of India' will continue to be the promoter of HPCL and ONGC to be added as a Promoter below 'President of India.
""However, HPCL has not abided by the aforesaid direction to revise the status of ONGC as 'promoter' till now,"" the regulator had said.
The regulator said its response to the informal guidance request was ""clear and self-explanatory"".
""Hence any further request for clarification on the issue does not arise,"" it said. ""Accordingly, you are once again advised to re-file the shareholding pattern to the stock exchanges for all quarters since the acquisition of shares by ONGC, while revising the status of ONGC as a 'promoter' by 13 August 2019, failing which appropriate action will be initiated as per SEBI Act. ""After the stern message, HPCL fell in line and replied back saying it ""intends to rectify the shareholding pattern and classification of promoters by the stipulated date as per the direction from SEBI."" It subsequently filed a revised shareholding pattern.
While HPCL dragged its feet in tagging ONGC as its promoter for unspecified reasons, IT company Mindtree recognised Larsen and Toubro as its promoter within a day after the engineering giant acquired a majority stake.
Last month, an HPCL spokesperson had stated that the company needed ""clarifications /details"" from ""multiple agencies/ authorities to ensure compliance to various stipulations applicable to listed companies including Companies Act, SEBI Regulations, etc"" before doing so.
""As soon as all the clarifications/details are received from concerned agencies /authorities, necessary amendments as required will be made in the regulatory filings after following due process. Till such time, the status quo is being maintained in the regulatory filings,"" the spokesperson had said.
According to the Sebi's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as a promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.
When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).
Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

34,2019-08-15,ONGC,"Even as the stock may be pricing in the worst, the June quarter results aren’t bringing any brownie pointsAs such, the company’s valuations at around five times estimated earnings for FY20 are terribly low

For state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd’s (ONGC’s) investors, the fact that the stock’s valuations are inexpensive, is perhaps, the only bright spot. The shares have declined about 20% so far this fiscal year.
In comparison, the Nifty 100 index has declined at a slower rate of 5.5%. As such, the company’s valuations at around five times estimated earnings for FY20 are terribly low.
However, with prospects appearing dull, lower valuations by itself are unlikely to enthuse investors. Analysts from Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a report on 13 August: “We are underweight on ONGC due to lack of triggers, weak oil output, commodity volatility and a significant divestment overhang.""
Having said that, the undemanding valuation is one reason why many analysts have a positive view on the ONGC stock. Even as the stock may be pricing in the worst, the recently announced June quarter results aren’t bringing any brownie points.
In the June quarter, revenues fell by 2% year-on-year to  ₹26,555 crore, lower than the consensus estimate of  ₹27,440.60 crore. This was driven by a 7% drop in net crude oil realizations to $66.3 per barrel. Crude oil production declined by 5.6% and this was disappointing considering that the output had fallen by 4.7% in FY19 already. Even as gas production increased by 3.7% year-on-year, it declined by 2% compared to the March quarter.
Overall, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization declined on a year-on-year basis, thanks to higher operating expenses. Net profit fell by 4% to  ₹5,904 crore.
Post-June quarter results, some analysts have trimmed their earnings per share (EPS) expectations. “We had cut EPS by 8-10% earlier in July, therefore, and trim FY20-21E EPS by another 2-4%,"" said analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 13 August.
The sharp decline in the share price suggests investors are baking in the concerns adequately. ONGC’s shares traded at a new 52 week low on Tuesday, ahead of its June quarter earnings announcement. Investors will do well to keep a tab on crude oil prices hereon, as realization remains relatively more crucial from the earnings point of view. Unfortunately, outlook on prices appears tepid. “We recently reset our second half of 2019-2020 Brent forecasts down to $58-60 a barrel amid softer demand-supply outlook,"" pointed out Jefferies India. It also expected domestic gas prices to fall 10% in the second half of FY20, weighed down by lower prices in Europe.
In sum, ONGC’s valuations may be compelling, but its earnings outlook remains far from inspiring, and that should ensure the muted valuations sustain from a near- to medium-term perspective, at least."

The 1,656-km North-East Natural Gas Pipeline Grid will connect Guwahati in Assam to major cities in the region such as Itanagar, Dimapur, Kohima, Imphal, Aizwal, Agartala, Shillong, Silchar, Gangtok, and Numaligarh.
However, in the absence of anchor customers, the  ₹9,000 crore pipeline is not economically viable.
""A viability gap funding of 60% of the project cost has been sought,"" an official.
The oil ministry is supporting the proposal and it is likely to be considered by the Cabinet soon, he said.
The Northeast pipeline grid is to be implemented by Indradhanush Gas Grid, a joint venture of state-owned GAIL India, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL).
The consortium has pitched for a 60% funding support from the government and would raise the rest via equity and debt, the official said.
Without the government support, the pipeline would not be viable.
This is a second time that a gas pipeline project in the country would be funded by the government.
In 2016, the government provided a capital grant of  ₹5,176 crore, or 40% of the project cost, of the 2,655-km Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra (JHBDPL) gas pipeline project, which GAIL is currently executing.
GAIL is also laying a 750-km line from Barauni to Guwahati as part of the  ₹12,940 crore JHBDPL project, which is also known as the 'Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga' project. This is proposed to be connected to the Northeast via the Indradhanush grid.
All other pipelines in the country have been funded by public or private sector companies.
The official said oil companies will not be able to execute the Northeast grid project without the viability gap funding.
The project is critical towards implementing the government's Hydrocarbon Vision 2030 for Northeast. The Vision envisages the development of the region by leveraging its hydrocarbon potential, enhancing access to clean fuel and accelerating the growth.
This is a part of a broader goal of the government to raise the share of natural gas in the country's energy mix to 15% by 2030 from current 6.2%.
The government has envisaged developing the National Gas Grid. At present, about 16,788 km natural gas pipeline is operational and about 14,239 km gas pipelines are being developed to increase the availability of natural gas across the country.

32,2019-08-30,ONGC,"The company is investing around  ₹86,000 crore in 27 major projects to boost oil and gas productionONGC has been under pressure to reverse the falling output from its ageing fields

NEW DELHI :
India's top oil and gas producer ONGC on Friday unveiled a $15-16 billion investment plan to double output from its domestic and overseas fields, expand its refining capacity three folds and diversify into renewables to earn four times higher net profit by 2040.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), which has seen crude oil production stagnate as a majority of its prime fields are ageing and are past their prime, has adopted a new 'Energy Strategy 2040', company Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker told reporters here.
The company, which started with an equity infusion of  ₹343 crore by the government more than six decades back, has generated a wealth of over  ₹9 lakh crore since then and is now venturing on a new road to further enhance value.
It has already seen a turnaround in natural gas with output rising for the fourth successive year to 24.75 billion cubic meters and is further slated to go up to 32 bcm by FY24, he said. ""We see gas production rising to 40 bcm by 2040,"" he said.
The new Energy Strategy 2040, which was adopted by the board a few weeks back, sets target of ""three-time revenue distributed across exploration and production (E&P), refining and marketing; 4 times current PAT with 10 per cent contribution from non-oil and gas business; and 5-6 times current market capitalisation,"" he said.
ONGC, he said, will still remain strongly invested in oil and gas but it also looks beyond hydrocarbons.
""The new strategy document aims to transform ONGC in a new 'avatar' in this new energy landscape as a diversified energy company with a strong contribution from non-E&P businesses,"" he said.
The firm produced 24.23 million tonnes of crude oil in the 2018-19 fiscal year and 25.81 billion cubic metres of natural gas from its domestic fields. Another 10.1 million tonnes of oil and 4.736 bcm of gas was produced from its overseas assets.
It had a turnover of  ₹1,09,654 crore and a net profit of  ₹26,715 crore in the year ended March 31, 2019. It has a market capitalisation of  ₹1.55 lakh crore as on date.
""Our fields are old and ageing, 30-50 years old and have reached a plateau. So we are investing in re-development projects to arrest the fall and extend the life,"" he said.
The company is investing around  ₹86,000 crore in 27 major projects to boost oil and gas production, which has stagnated over the last few years.
These projects will yield 76 million tonnes of oil and 121 bcm of gas.
The overall plan, which includes overseas projects, expanding refining capacity and investing in renewables, will entail $ 15-16 billion investment.
""These numbers will change as we progress with some projects being advanced and finances undergoing changes,"" ONGC Director (Finance) Subhash Kumar said.
Shanker said its investments in new frontiers - primarily to hedge against disruption in existing portfolio, will include carbon capture and storage, artificial intelligence for exploration, hydrogen fuel, lithium mining and biofuels.
Oil and oil equivalent natural gas production is seen rising from 65 million tonnes to 135 million tonnes by 2040, he said.
""The strategic roadmap envisions a future-ready organization whose growth is predicated on a few important planks: consolidation of our core upstream business (domestic and international); expansion into value accreting adjacencies in the oil and gas value chain (downstream and petrochemicals) and diversification into renewables (offshore wind) and select new frontier plays through dedicated venture fund,"" he said.
‎It targets cumulative upstream output (local and overseas) almost doubling from current levels with 2% and 5% CAGR in domestic and international operations respectively.
With two 35 million tonnes per annum of oil refining capacity vested in its two subsidiaries -- HPCL and MRPL, ONGC is targeting to raise this capacity to around 90-100 million tonnes. Also, expansion is petrochemicals will be prioritised.
Besides, ONGC plans to make investments in renewables energy sources with a target to create 5-10 gigawatts portfolio with a focus on offshore wind power, he said.
ONGC has been under pressure to reverse the falling output from its ageing fields, where the natural decline has set in. It is investing heavily to arrest the domestic fall while at the same time aggressively look for assets overseas.
""The strategic roadmap also looks to create long-term optionality through investor play (venture fund corpus of about USD 1 billion) in select frontier themes such as clean energy, artificial intelligence (AI) or reservoir/field services technology,"" he said.
In upstream oil and gas exploration and production (E&P), priority would be accorded to select difficult plays (high-pressure high temperature, ultra-deepwater) with high-prospectivity and low stretch from current core, development of in-house enhanced oil recovery solutions to maximize legacy production, exploration-focused technology partnerships, dedicated marginal fields unit as well as building decommissioning capabilities.
He said there was significant room for deriving operational synergies between HPCL and MRPL through integrated crude sourcing, centralised trading, capability and infrastructure sharing.
Expansion in petchem is based on the robust demand of outlook of 8-9 per cent CAGR for the country as well as ONGC's significant presence in the market through its subsidiaries."
31,2019-09-01,ONGC,"Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was in Moscow last week in preparation for the Prime Minister's visit﻿OVL's stake in Vankor cluster will be in proportion to 26% stake in had bought in the main Vankor oilfield

New Delhi: A preliminary pact for a consortium of Indian companies led by ONGC Videsh (OVL) for acquiring about 49% stake in Russia's Vankor cluster oilfields may be signed during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's annual summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin this week.
Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan was in Moscow last week in preparation for the Prime Minister's visit.
Modi will be the chief guest at this year's Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok between September 4 and 6 and would also meet the Russian President for their annual summit.
A host of agreements is expected to be signed during the visit and one of them could be on cooperation in oil and gas, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.
This cooperation agreement may include Indian state-owned firms picking up 49% stake in Vankor cluster oilfields, they said.
Indian firms have been in dialogue with Russia since 2017 for a possible stake in the oilfields that will consolidate their presence in the energy-rich Arctic region.
Mid-way through the negotiations, Rosneft had offered to club five more fields in the same region to the three that were already on the table, the sources said.
OVL, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), may hold 26% stake in Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields -- collectively known as Vankor cluster, while Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Oil India Ltd and Bharat PetroResources Ltd (a unit of Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd or BPCL) would split the rest 23%, they said.
Rosneft, Russia's national oil company that owns the fields, wants to retain a majority stake and is keen to sell only up to 49.9% stake.
Energy-hungry India is keen on sourcing one million barrels per day of oil and oil-equivalent gas from Russia and had identified Sakhalin-3 in the Far East, Vankor in East Siberia, and Terbs and Titov oilfields in Timan Pechora region as fields for potential collaboration. But for Vankor, it has so far not been successful in its attempts.
OVL already has 20% stake in Sakhalin-1 oil and gas field in Far East Russia, and in 2009 acquired Imperial Energy, which has fields in Siberia, for $2.1 billion.
Russia is wooing Indian investments in its Far East region ahead of Modi's Vladivostok visit to balance China's expanding presence in the resource-rich region.
OVL's stake in Vankor cluster will be in proportion to 26% stake in had bought in the main Vankor oilfield. OIL-IOC-BPRL have 23.9% in the main Vankor field.
Vankorneft, a subsidiary of Rosneft, is developing the Vankor oil and gas condensate field, situated in the northern part of Eastern Siberia.
In 2013, Vankorneft was chosen as an operator on development of new fields of Vankor cluster -- Suzunskoye, Tagulskoye and Lodochnoye fields, located close to the Vankor field.
The reserves of Suzunskoye field exceed 56 million tonnes of oil and condensate, and 35 billion cubic metres of gas.
In 2016, OVL first acquired 15% stake in Russia’s second-biggest oilfield of Vankor for $1.268 billion and then bought another 11% for $930 million. The 26% stake would give OVL 7.31 million tonnes of oil.
The consortium of OIL-IOC-BPRL acquired 23.9% stake in the field at a cost of USD 2.02 billion, giving them 6.56 million tonnes of oil.
Rosneft continues to hold the remaining 50.1% shares of JSC Vankorneft. The field has recoverable reserves of 2.5 billion barrels.
Besides, the OIL-IOC-BPRL consortium has taken another 29.9% stake in a separate Taas-Yuryakh oilfield in East Siberia for $1.12 billion. The investments had taken the total outlay in Russia in that year to $5.46 billion.
These investments will give India 15.18 million tonnes of oil equivalent. The investment made compares to $28.48 billion investment by Indian oil and gas companies overseas in the past 50 years, giving it about 10 million tonnes of oil equivalent.
While Vankor produces about 442,000 barrels of oil per day (4% of Russian crude oil production), Taas currently produces about 21,000 barrels per day of oil, and a peak of 1,00,000 bpd is expected by 2021.

26,2019-09-04,ONGC,"While the benchmark Nifty lost 0.6%, CPSE ETF shed 13.5% so far this yearNIFTY CPSE ETF is heavily skewed towards energy, which has 65.83% of entire composition

An exchange traded fund (ETF) tracking 10 central government owned companies has underperformed the National Stock Exchange’s benchmark 50-stock Nifty index this year, thanks in part to its concentration of energy stocks that have shed value.
The Central Public Sector Enterprises Exchange Traded Fund (CPSE ETF) index tracks the NSE Central Public Sector Enterprises (NSE CPSE index) of 10 public sector enterprises. According to Bloomberg data, the Nifty CPSE index lost 13.35% in 2019, while the Nifty is down just 0.6%. In August alone, the Nifty CPSE index fell 8.49%, while the Nifty is marginally down by 0.85%. Similarly, for the one year ended 3 September, Nifty CPSE index was down 24.68%, while the benchmark Nifty was down 6.77%.
A key reason is the ETF’s concentration of energy stocks, said analysts. According to HDFC Securities, currently, the scheme is concentrated around energy and oil sectors and, hence, risks arising from government-related actions, as well as company-specific risks, may affect its performance.
“Together with the advantages, investors should also keep in mind that it is not a diversified index and is skewed towards the energy sector. Any untoward global or domestic event impacting this sector will act as a negative trigger for the entire portfolio,"" said HDFC Securities Ltd in a note on 17 July.
The broking firm had also said that returns from the securities comprising Nifty CPSE may underperform returns from the general securities markets, or different asset classes, as different types of securities tend to go through cycles of out-performance and under-performance in comparison to the securities markets. The CPSE ETF is an open-ended, semi-diversified, thematic and passively managed ETF, which tracks and provide returns corresponding to the Nifty CPSE Index.
The Nifty CPSE ETF index is loaded with energy stocks, which make up 65.83% of its total composition, followed by metals (18.90%), financial services (7.37%), industrial manufacturing (6.37%) and construction (1.53%). Out of the 10 stocks on the CPSE ETF, energy stocks, such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) and Oil India Ltd (OIL), are down 14.5%, 21.9% and 18.2%, respectively, so far this year. IOC and ONGC have 20.77% and 19.57% weightage on the index, respectively, while OIL has 3.11% weightage. NTPC Ltd, which has the highest weightage of 20.97% in the Nifty CPSE ETF index, is down 5.3% so far this year. NBCC India Ltd, which has fallen 41.65%—the most out of the 10 stocks—have 1.53% weightage on the index.
Dhaval Kapadia, director, portfolio specialist, Morningstar Investment Adviser India Pvt. Ltd, said that the last one to one-and-a-half years have been tough for actively managed funds particularly in the large-cap space, with most of them underperforming benchmarks. “On analysis of the performance of large-cap indices, such as the Nifty or Sensex, one can see that a limited number of stocks have been the main drivers of this outperformance, while other stocks have lagged. Funds that were underweight such stocks due to valuation or other concerns have underperformed these benchmarks. For calendar years prior to 2018, large-cap funds on an average have outperformed benchmark indices,"" he said.
Another reason for the decline in the Nifty CPSE ETF index is redemptions. “There was a redemption pressure seen in the fund as one-month lock-in period for anchor institutional investors in the fifth FFO (further fund offer) of the CPSE ETF last month expired on 24 August. This could be one reason for the weakness in the fund performance,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.

25,2019-09-08,ONGC,"ED said the Rolls Royce made a payment of over  ₹77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from PSUs HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11The CBI complaint alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around  ₹4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013

New Delhi: The ED has filed a criminal case to probe money laundering charges in an alleged corruption case involving London-based Rolls Royce that is said to have made a payment of over  ₹77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from PSUs HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11, officials said on Sunday.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has booked the case under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after going through a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR, which was registered in the case in July this year, they said. 
Rolls Royce and its Indian subsidiary, Singapore-based Ashok Patni and his company Aashmore Pvt Ltd, and Mumbai-based Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd, besides unidentified officials of public sector units (PSUs) Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and GAIL were booked by the CBI for criminal conspiracy and bribery.
The CBI complaint alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around  ₹4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013.
It is alleged that Rolls Royce paid  ₹18 crore to Patni as ""commercial advisor"" in the 100 supply orders of Avon and Allison engines' spare parts to HAL between 2007-11, the bureau's FIR stated. The CBI action came after a five-year-long inquiry conducted by it. The inquiry was initiated on the basis of a complaint from the defence ministry that had received a letter about the engagement of Patni and his company by Rolls Royce. The ED will probe if these alleged corrupt practices led to the generation of slush funds which were laundered to create personal assets, the officials said. It will also investigate if the integrity pact was violated and kick backs were generated, they said. Rollys Royce, after registration of the CBI case, had said it will not tolerate business misconduct of any sort and it is committed to maintain high ethical standards.
""No one currently working for Rolls-Royce in India played any part in these energy deals. ""India is an important market for Rolls-Royce and the company has a valued workforce of skilled people in the country,"" a company spokesperson had said.
The CBI has charged that Patni was also engaged in direct contracts of Rolls Royce with ONGC and GAIL for the supply of spare parts.
Although contracts with ONGC and GAIL allowed services of an agent but it was mandatory to declare the name at the time of bidding, a condition violated by Rolls Royce, it said.
The company declared the name of its agent to the oil and gas sector behemoths in 2013, CBI alleged.
It is alleged that Roll Royce paid  ₹29.81 crore in 73 purchase orders from 2007 to 2011 for procurement of material and spare parts pertaining to the engines for ONGC, but the company declared it in 2013, it said. Roll Royce also paid one million British pounds with regard to 68 purchase orders from GAIL for spare parts from 2007 to 2010, it said.
The company entered in an arrangement with Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd and another company, Infinity, also owned by Patni, to which extra commission was paid, but not declared to GAIL, the CBI said.
The total commission paid by Rolls Royce comes to the tune of  ₹28.09 crore during the period 2007-10 for supplies to GAIL, it alleged.
There was an alleged conspiracy by Rolls Royce Plc and its subsidiary Rolls Royce India Pvt Ltd to misrepresent the facts before HAL regarding the engagement of the agent in order to win contracts with the public sector unit with ""deception"", it said.
The Indian Marine Gas Turbine unit of the HAL provides support in areas of inspection, spare parts, maintenance, equipment overhaul and assembly for industrial and marine gas turbines under licence from reputed manufactures.
The unit provides overhaul and repair of Avon and Allison engines for ONGC and GAIL for which spare parts are supplied by the energy division of Rolls Royce, it said.
The contract between Rolls Royce Power Engineering Plc and HAL was signed in June 2007, which was valid till December 2011, to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services for units owned by the GAIL and ONGC under above licence from Rolls Royce.
""The purchase order condition specifically mentioned that Rolls Royce is not supposed to appoint any agent in India to promote this contract and no commission is payable to such agent,"" the CBI FIR has alleged.
It is alleged that Rolls Royce violated the condition of purchase order and integrity pact by engaging Patni and his company as commercial advisor from 2007 to 2011, and paid a commission ranging from 10 per cent to 11.3 per cent for supply of spare parts for the Avon and Allison engines.
The commission amount comes to the tune of  ₹18.32 crore during the period from 2007 to 2011 for the 100 purchase order, the CBI FIR alleged."

Ltd and CNOOC Ltd rose 4.3% and 7.4% respectively on Monday. As it is, ONGC shares trade at only about six times estimated earnings for the current fiscal. With oil prices spiking by over 10% and experts estimating that an increase in geopolitical risk will keep prices elevated, it’s surprising that investors aren’t expecting any gains for India’s oil producers. Evidently, the worry is that these companies’ gains will be re-routed to help the government balance its budgets in some way.
But the worries may be overdone, especially since petrol and diesel are no longer subsidised. “We see only limited risk of subsidy burdens returning on India's state-owned oil companies, leaving ONGC and Oil India as beneficiaries... With petrol and diesel out of the subsidy mix, the fiscal impact of higher prices is also manageable,"" said analysts at Jefferies in a note to clients.
Still, the fact that investors are restraining themselves from pricing in the gains from higher oil prices is telling.
Meanwhile, shares of state-run Indian oil marketing companies (OMCs), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) fell by 5.7% and 7% respectively, while shares of the more diversified Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) fell by a little over 1%.
Given the weak global economic environment, investors are worried whether product prices will keep pace with the increase in the price of feedstock. “The refining environment could turn challenging if product prices do not track crude price changes amid sluggish demand. For India's OMCs, any likely increase in Middle East premiums could hurt as well - especially for the lighter grades that would likely get impacted from Abqaiq,"" points out Jefferies. Indian OMCs use the lighter grades produced in Saudi as feedstock in their refineries.
In addition, there is the risk of a fall in their marketing margins. The last time crude had spiked, these companies were effectively told to curtail their marketing margins, to prevent a sharp increase in the price of auto fuels. “We do not rule out a possibility of moderation in marketing margins on auto fuels—a US$10/bbl rise in global crude and product prices may require OMCs to increase retail price of diesel and gasoline by Rs5-6/litre in the following fortnight,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.
As such, while shares of ONGC may not have risen enough, shares of OMCs may not have fallen enough. Of course, investors will get a better sense of the impact over the next few weeks as product prices adjust to the reality of the new supply shock.
According to International Energy Agency’s estimates, even before the current disruption in supply, there was expected to be a shortfall in supply in the second half of 2019. “The incremental disruption of 5.7 million barrels per day (~6% of global oil supplies) from Saudi, even if for a short period, will accelerate the anticipated drawdown in global inventories,"" analysts at Kotak say.
While the supply shock is expected to offset partly by tapping into strategic reserves of countries and commercial stocks, only time will tell how far the shock can be absorbed. In any case, higher crude prices are a reality investors have to live with. “This attack has material implications for the oil market, as a loss of 5 million barrels per day of supplies from Saudi Arabia cannot be met for long by existing inventories and the limited spare capacity of the other OPEC+ group members. A geopolitical risk premium will return to the oil price,"" said Alan Gelder, vice president for Refining, Chemicals and Oil Markets, Wood Mackenzie, a global energy, chemicals, renewables, metals and mining research and consultancy group."
22,2019-09-17,ONGC,"This year’s disinvestment target may prove elusive if New Delhi waits for a stock market upturn to offload its equity. Sell-offs must simply be investor-friendly for them to succeed

The government is reportedly drawing up plans to sell its stake in several state-run companies as part of its disinvestment programme for this financial year. A clutch of companies has been identified for the sale of minority stakes, and a list of companies for strategic disinvestment—where the government hopes to reduce its ownership to a minority holding—has also been sent to the Prime Minister’s Office for approval. Now that half this financial year is almost over, the urgency to fast-track these sales couldn’t have been any higher. Of the  ₹1.05 trillion disinvestment target set for 2019-20, only  ₹12,357 crore, or 12%, has been raised so far. Of course, the government could always engineer a last-minute rescue, by having one state-run company buy the stake of another—like the ONGC-HPCL deal last year—or by having Life Insurance Corporation subscribe to share offerings, but such a strategy could erode the agenda’s credibility. It’s best if disinvestment is done to achieve efficiency aims. Firms that would perform better in private hands than public should be allowed to change owners.
For better price realizations on its shares, the government may be tempted to wait for market conditions to improve. But markets are subject to various vagaries, and there is no saying what would be an appropriate time for disinvestment. If a more efficient economy is the objective, then government equity should be offloaded regardless of market index levels. More importantly, the government should resist imposing conditions that make stake sales unattractive. A strategic buyer of a firm would need a free hand to reorganize operations as it deems fit. In the case of Air India, for instance, the Centre had stiff riders on matters such as the retention of employees, mergers of ancillary businesses, and so on; it also insisted on retaining a 24% stake in the airline. With a heavy debt burden thrown in, it was little surprise that Air India failed to attract even a single bid despite two attempts.
Not only does the disinvestment process demand clarity on its main goal, it needs to be made investor-friendly. If this means that some state-owned companies need to be privatized outright, with no strings attached, then that should be the way ahead. The assurance that the government would cease to exert control may well be necessary for prospective buyers to see value in taking over. Private turnaround plans often include staff downsizing; this should not pose a political problem if the government explains that such decisions are for a company’s new owner to take. In the case of profitable public sector units, sell-offs tend to meet even more resistance, most fiercely from employees who fear for their jobs. Yet, many of these are likely to do better under private management. Also, investor appetite for such companies is likely to be higher. The successful sale of a high-profile profit maker could even generate enthusiasm for the entire programme. Much depends on the government’s advocacy of the idea. “The government has no business being in business"", for example, may sound extreme, but could help win popular approval, especially if combined with the rationale that the state should focus on governance, not on activities that private parties are better equipped to handle. Of course, companies that are vital to the state’s strategic interests cannot be sold off. But most businesses owned by the government surely can."
21,2019-10-01,ONGC,"The PSU hopes to land overseas business under the aegis of International Solar AllianceSECI has been leading NDA government’ efforts rejig its energy mix in favour of green energy sources by conducting the bid process

New Delhi: In an attempt to facilitate its overseas foray, state run Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) plans to change its article of association to do business in solar rich countries.
The public sector unit (PSU) hopes to land overseas business under the aegis of International Solar Alliance (ISA). ISA, the first treaty-based international government organization headquartered in India will see the number of inducted countries that have signed its framework agreement reach 100 nations at its second general assembly to be held from 30 October—2 November.
“There was a plan earlier to float SECI Videsh on the lines of ONGC Videsh. However, it lost traction. Lets see, how does the plan unfolds this time,"" said a senior Indian government official requesting anonymity.
SECI has been leading the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government’ efforts rejig its energy mix in favour of green energy sources by conducting the bid process. This has helped India emerge as a clean energy champion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi also recently gifted $1 million ‘Gandhi Solar Park’ to the United Nations when he attended the Climate Action Summit 2019 in New York.
“The plan to facilitate SECI’s overseas foray is at a preliminary stage,"" said a second Indian government official who also did not want to be named.
The International Solar Alliance initially envisaged a group of 121 sunshine countries situated between the tropics of Cancer and Capricorn as its members. However, later all United Nations members were made eligible for ISA membership. With 76 countries currently signatories to the landmark agreement, ISA has become India’s calling card on climate change and is increasingly being viewed as a foreign policy tool, especially with India and France front-ending efforts to set up the ISA.
At present, India has an installed power generation capacity of 357,875MW, of which around 22%, or 80.47 GW, is generated through clean energy projects. Of this solar and wind comprises 29.55 GW and 36.37 GW respectively. With addition of large hydro projects to clean energy segment, India is poised to have 225 GW of renewable energy by 2022.
Queries emailed to Jatindra Nath Swain, managing director, SECI and a spokesperson for India’s ministry of new and renewable energy on Sunday evening remained unanswered.
India also plans to help set up a global electricity grid that may initially aim to link countries such as Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam with the sub-continent as part of an evolving energy security architecture. The proposals for the same will be presented at the second general assembly of the ISA.
There are also new plans in the works. Mint reported on 12 September about the central government’ plan of making state-run companies build massive clean energy parks to help developers achieve economies of scale and further bring down solar and wind power tariffs.
These include state-run companies present in the conventional power space such as NTPC Ltd, NLC India Ltd (earlier known as Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd) ,and Power Grid Corp. of India Ltd (PGCIL). The NDA government’s push may also see participation from other hydropower public sector units (PSUs) such as North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco), NHPC Ltd, Tehri Hydro Development Corp. Ltd (THDC), SJVN Ltd (SJVNL), and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC).
Setting up such parks will provide heft to India at the world stage specifically in the view of a rapidly evolving global energy landscape and a fundamental change in the global investment culture.
These proposed ultra mega renewable energy power parks (UMREPP) of 2,000 megawatts (MW) involving a cost of around $2 billion each, are to be set up in wind and solar resource rich states such as Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.
India, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China, has been pushing for a clean energy fuelled economy. India plans to reduce its carbon emissions by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030, as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in 2015."
20,2019-10-01,ONGC,"Among PSU stocks, Shipping Corp of India rose 7.8%, BPCL gained 6.6%The stake sell will help the government to keep its fiscal deficit target in check

Mumbai: India's state run companies were trading higher on Monday after government approved sale of its entire shareholding in four public sector companies.
A Reuters report said that the government plans to sell its stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp, Shipping Corp Of India, THDC India and NEEPCO. The government will also sell 30% stake in Container Corp Of India, Reuters report added.
The government currently holds 53.3% stake in BPCL and with current market price center may get around  ₹54,000 crore. From SCI where government holds 63.8% stake, will get  ₹1,283 crore while from CONCOR it will get  ₹6,056 crore from 30% stake sell.
The stake sell will help the government to keep its fiscal deficit target in check after weak tax revenues and expected loss of  ₹1.45 trillion due to cut corporate tax.
""We see limited upside to BPCL stock, post the recent sharp outperformance against other OMCs, which effectively prices in potential rerating of valuation multiple from strategic privatization; any further upside will be contingent on improvement in earnings that may take time to percolate. A non-strategic privatization or transaction like ONGC-HPCL may optimize time/value equation for the government but may lead to de-rating of the stock"", said Kotak Institutional Equities in a 25 September note. The brokerage has reiterate its sell rating amid adverse risk reward balance.
Among PSU stocks, Shipping Corp of India rose 7.8%, BPCL gained 6.6%, Hindustan Petroleum Corp 5.8%, MRPL 4.7%, RCF 4.3%, Indian Oil Corp 4.1%, Concor 4%, ITDC 3.3%, MMTC 3%. BSE PSU Index rose 1.6%."
19,2019-10-09,ONGC,"The gain in BSE’s total market capitalization since the tax cut now stands at only 2.7%This is despite the fact that earnings of Indian firms were expected to rise 7-8% as a result of the cut

In hindsight, the massive rally in Indian equities soon after the sharp cut in corporate tax rates was a case of much ado about nothing. In the two trading sessions after the tax cut, about three-fourths of all traded stocks on BSE rose. The market capitalization of the stocks listed on BSE rose 7.5% in these two trading sessions to  ₹148.9 trillion.
But the markets have since given up nearly two-thirds of those gains, and the increase in total market capitalization since the tax cut now stands at only 2.7%. What’s more, nearly 65% of all traded stocks on BSE are now below where they were before the tax cut was announced.
“It’s been two weeks since the initial euphoria; and it’s clear that the markets are now pricing stocks almost as if the tax cuts didn’t happen. It’s back to fundamentals of companies and sectors,"" says the head of research at a multinational brokerage firm, who declined to be named.
A case in point is the stark difference in the movement of shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC). While RIL shares have risen more than 11% since the tax cuts, those of ONGC have increased by only 1.7%. This is strange because the latter has a higher effective tax rate and is expected to gain more from the corporate tax cut.
“RIL shares have gained more because of the possibility of strong Q2 results,"" says the head of research mentioned above.
Also note that all else remaining the same, earnings of Indian companies were expected to rise 7-8% as a result of the tax cuts. The fact that cumulative market capitalization has risen by less than 3% shows that investors clearly don’t see the government’s move as a panacea.
Some of the near-term gains are expected to be offset by the continued softening in consumer demand, as well as the possibility of price discounts to pass benefits of the tax cuts to consumers. As far as the medium- to long-term impact of higher capital investments by Indian companies goes, it must be noted that this typically takes a long time to play out. For now, investors don’t seem to have ascribed any value on this count. Instead, they are perturbed by the continuing crisis in the banking and financial sector, and the weak data in recent surveys.
All that the corporate tax cuts seem to have done is improve investor sentiment for some stocks in the short term. In continuation of the trend seen since early 2018, most of the gains are restricted to a top few stocks. Leave out the top 2% of the stocks, and the market capitalization of the remaining vast majority is more or less at the same level compared to the pre-tax levels.
For the tiniest of the lot in terms of market cap, which constitute the vast majority of the stocks, there has been value erosion despite the largesse from the government."
18,2019-10-13,ONGC,"ONGC may now charge buyers $6-7 per mmBtu as gas prices remain subdued due to a global supply glutONGC plans to begin natural gas production from the deepwater block KG-DWN-98/2 in about two to three months

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) may be forced to sell natural gas at a discount to its originally expected price from its newest deepwater block in the Krishna-Godavari basin as gas prices remain subdued due to a supply glut internationally, three people directly aware of ONGC’s discussions said requesting anonymity.
ONGC plans to begin natural gas production from the deepwater block KG-DWN-98/2 in about two to three months and is expected to finalize shortly agreements for the sale of gas from the asset.
The company, according to the people cited above, has been in talks since August to assess demand potential from buyers which include Gail India and several city gas distribution companies. “Several buyers who have met ONGC have expressed reservations at buying gas at the upper ceiling, which was initially proposed by ONGC,"" said the first person cited above.
KG-DWN-98/2 is an ultra-deepwater, high-temperature and high-pressure field and according to a pre-determined pricing formula, ONGC can charge customers up to $8.43 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) fixed for the second half of this fiscal. This current ceiling price is 9.5% lower than the ceiling price of $9.32 per mmBtu fixed for the first half of this fiscal. Situated 35km off the Andhra Pradesh coast in the Bay of Bengal, the block would cumulatively produce around 25 million metric tonnes (mmt) of oil and 45 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas with peak production of 78,000 barrels per day of oil and 15mmscmd of gas. ONGC expects to bring first gas from this project to market by December-end and oil in 2020. “Given the pricing constraints, ONGC may now price the gas at around $6-7 per mmBtu, factoring in the current LNG spot price plus a markup price,"" said the first person cited above.
For the second half of this fiscal year, the government has notified a domestic gas price of $3.23 per mmBtu, a decline of 12.5% from $3.69 per mmBtu applicable in the fiscal first half.
This is expected to dampen the profitability of the gas producers, rating agency Icra said in a note on 1 October. The decline in domestic gas price is in line with the decline in global gas indices primarily Henry Hub over the fiscal first half. Also, with prices of gas at various international hubs remaining low, domestic gas prices are expected to remain depressed.
“At such low gas prices, gas production remains loss-making proposition for most fields for the upstream producers notwithstanding some decline in oil field services or equipment. Nonetheless, the depreciation of Indian rupee against the US dollar in the past few months provides some support to the realisations of the gas producers,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and group head, Corporate Ratings, Icra, adding that with several new gas liquefaction capacities coming online globally, the supply glut is expected to keep prices of domestic gas low in the near to medium term, leading to poor returns even as domestic gas producers such as ONGC and RIL-BP ramp up gas production significantly.
Lower gas prices at international hubs has been further accentuated by the commissioning of new gas liquefaction capacities with about 35 million tonnes coming online in 2018 and another about 30 million tonnes expected to come online in 2019. Moreover, shale gas production continues to be healthy in the US. Accordingly, Asian spot LNG prices which remained at $9-11 per mmBtu during the winters of 2018-2019 have already declined to $5-6 per mmBtu.
For ONGC, a gas price lower than the ceiling of $8.43 per mmBtu would mean it has to take a hit on its profitability as buyers may prefer lifting gas from the spot market at $4-5 per mmBtu.
“Even if ONGC gets buyers at $7 per mmBtu, it will be a decent price for the company. More than that, it will be a case of opportunity lost for ONGC,"" said one of the three persons mentioned above."

New Delhi: State-owned ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has discovered oil and gas in its exploration blocks in Colombia and Brazil respectively.
“ONGC Videsh has recorded discoveries of oil in its onshore exploration block CPO-5, Colombia in the Llanos basin and major gas in the deep offshore exploration block BM-SEAL-4, Brazil in the Sergipe Alagoas Basin,"" OVL said in a statement on Wednesday.
ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, has invested $28 billion in 41 projects across 20 countries and has probable reserves of 711.36 million tonnes of oil equivalent.
“ONGC Videsh has a significant presence in oil & gas sector of Brazil and Colombia. It holds stakes in seven exploratory blocks.

Till now, Indian energy firms have invested around $38 billion to buy equity energy stakes in 28 countries, including Australia, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Russia.
This comes in the backdrop of Russia and Saudi Arabia extending the crude oil supply cut. The extension of supply cuts will have wide-ranging impact on energy markets, given that Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries or Opec accounts for around 40% of global production.
New Delhi has been trying to buffer its consumers from fluctuations in global prices. The unfolding events in West Asia have raised the spectre of a spike in transportation of fuel prices in India, with traders worldwide speculating if oil will cross the $100-mark yet again. Any sudden increase in global prices will affect India’s oil import bill and its trade deficit. Every dollar increase in the price of oil raises India’s import bill by  ₹10,700 crore on an annualised basis. India spent $111.9 billion on crude oil imports of 207.3 million tonnes in 2018-19.

NEW DELHI :
Here is a list of top 10 stocks that are likely to be in focus on Thursday:
DHFL: Lenders to the company hope they will be able to pass the resolution plan even as mutual funds abstain from signing the inter-creditor agreement, Union Bank of India Chief Executive Officer Rajkiran Rai G said. Union Bank is leading the consortium of lenders working on the debt-restructuring plan for Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd.
Mindtree: The Bengaluru-based IT services firm posted its earnings for the September quarter after market hours on Wednesday. The mid-sized company’s second-quarter growth improved sequentially both in terms of revenue and profit margins. Mindtree’s revenues were up 3.2% quarter on quarter in constant currency terms and up 11.1% year-on-year in line with the Street’s estimates.
Zee Entertainment: The company, surrounded by concerns over financial stress, will announce its earnings for the September quarter today. In another development, Russia’s VTB Capital Plc said it has acquired rights to sell Essel Media Ventures Ltd’s 10.71% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd to recover loan dues. VTB Capital is in talks with two potential investors to sell the said stake.
Bharti Airtel: Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson on Wednesday signed a deal with Bharti Airtel Ltd to deploy its 5G-ready Cloud packet core in the domestic telecom major's network in the country. The deployment would enhance capacity in Airtel's network and enable it to address the rapidly-growing demand for high-speed data services, Ericsson said in a statement.
TVS Motor: Investors will watch this space as the two-wheeler manufacturing company will post its September quarter earnings today. Demand slowdown in the auto sector has impacted sales of the company, with sales declining more than 25% to 315,912 units in September as against 423,939 units in the same month last year.
Bajaj Auto: India's second largest motorcycle manufacturer on Wednesday announced that it will again foray into the scooter market with the launch of electronic scooter Chetak. This after the auto company stopped manufacturing scooters a decade ago. The Pune-based company did not reveal the price of the product and will announce it before beginning dispatches.
HDIL: Promoters of bankrupt real estate firm Housing Development Infrastructure Ltd have written a letter to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and other agencies to sell their assets and repay the loans owed to Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative Bank Ltd (PMC). HDIL promoters have allegedly siphoned off funds worth Ra 6,500 crore with the help of PMC Bank management.
HPCL: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) is likely to sell its stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) as the company is reportedly grappling with the latter’s cost and not able to derive profit from HPCL’s acquisition. Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan also said ONGC, which last year acquired HPCL for a massive  ₹36,915 crore, was free to divest its stake.
ONGC: The government plans to get ONGC to sell it entire 51.11% stake in HPCL as it can fetch high dividend for the government. Despite being the majority stakeholder in the company, ONGC has only got one member on the board and no say in the management. The government has repealed the act that had nationalised both HPCL and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd."
13,2019-10-17,ONGC,"State-run oil marketing companies BPCL, IOC and HPCL are expected to cough up a good set of numbers for the September quarterA sequential recovery in refining margin should help RIL’s refining business earnings

Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) have increased as much as 18% since its annual general meeting on 12 August where chairman and managing director, Mukesh Ambani, said the company will be a zero net debt one within the next 18 months by 31 March 2021. In that backdrop, when RIL announces its September quarter results on Friday, “any signs of decline in capex intensity should increase confidence in our view,"" said analysts from HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India) Pvt. Ltd.
That apart, the sequential recovery in refining margin, should help RIL’s refining business earnings. For perspective, benchmark Singapore GRMs have averaged to $6.5 a barrel for the September quarter from $3.5 a barrel during the June quarter. “A sharp recovery in refining margins coupled with lower ethane and LNG prices, and higher petchem volumes should partly offset weakness in benchmark chemical margins and deliver a 7% qoq growth in standalone earnings,"" said HSBC analysts in a report on 8 October.
Separately, state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) are expected to cough up a good set of numbers for the September quarter. OMCs include Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC). Performance of these companies will get a boost from the rebound in refining margin. Further, auto fuel marketing margins have remained resilient. These two factors are likely to set off inventory and forex losses to some extent.
Analysts from Kotak Institutional Equities expect BPCL and HPCL to report 20-23% qoq increase in Ebitda, despite accounting for  ₹1000-1100 crore of inventory and forex losses. The broker expects IOC to report 20% qoq decline in Ebitda, impacted by  ₹3300 crore of inventory and forex losses. Ebitda, a key measure of profitability, is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. IOC’s profitability is expected to be relatively weaker than its peers, HPCL and BPCL, mainly owing to higher inventory losses.
Meanwhile, crude oil prices have declined by about 18% on a year-on-year basis. This is expected to drag down profits of oil producers such as Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd as price realisation gets adversely affected.
In keeping with the optimism in broader markets, shares of all these companies have run up after the corporate tax rate cuts. As such, September quarter results are not expected to fuel big jumps in share prices. “The stock prices, in our view, are unlikely to move on earnings but would be news flow dependent,"" wrote analysts from J.P. Morgan India in a report on 7 October. “For the broader state owned enterprises space, how the government moves on the potential BPCL privatization would be an important driver for stocks. For Reliance, the key events that investors are focused on are the completion of various deleveraging deals,"" add J.P. Morgan analysts."

NEW DELHI :
Not one but two oil companies - BPCL and HPCL - may go under the hammer this fiscal with state-owned oil and gas explorer ONGC now looking to sell its stake in recently-acquired refiner HPCL to a strategic investor, possibly an overseas oil company, to regain debt-free status of the company existing prior to the expensive buy.
The plan for Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) follows the government's go ahead to invite a strategic investor for Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) where the Centre owns 53 per cent stake.
Government sources indicated that the board of ONGC has informally debated on continuing to hold on to HPCL as its subsidiary since no synergy was flowing from its acquisition but the expensive buy had only added debt burden on the parent. ""The matter may be brought up again before the board to finalise future course of action,"" sources added.
An ONGC spokesperson could not be contacted and a questionnaire mailed to the company on the issues remained unanswered.
In of its most expensive buys, ONGC last year paid  ₹36,915 crore to purchase the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL. The acquisition turned the character of ONGC from being a debt-free company to one with no cash and loads of debt on its books. ONGC took loan of close to  ₹25,000 crore to buy the government's equity in HPCL.
In addition, HPCL's acquisition has so far not worked to the advantage of ONGC as synergies have not flowed in. Moreover, HPCL failed to recognize ONGC as its promoter till recently. Only after the SEBI's intervention, HPCL decided to recognize its majority shareholder as promoter. ONGC has just one member on the HPCL board.
""With the government repealing the acts that nationalised HPCL and BPCL, hurdles have been removed for divestment of share in the two companies. ONGC can take advantage of this to sell either full or part of its holding in HPCL to a strategic investor,"" said the government source quoted earlier.
ONGC's 51.11% stake at current share prices of HPCL on the BSE would fetch the oil explorer close to  ₹25,000 crore. Even a lower state sale would substantially improve the company's ability to reduce its debt.
With regard to BPCL, disinvestment department DIPAM is working out a plan to offload entire government equity of 53.29 per cent in the fuel refiner and retailer to a strategic partner, possibly a large overseas oil entity like Saudi Aramco, Total, ExxonMobil, and Shell. However, with oil market globally facing a slowdown with demand not picking up despite supply squeeze, the appetite for a large acquisition becomes difficult.
The government's stake in HPCL is worth over  ₹60,000 crore at prevailing price of BPCL shares on BSE. If the buyer has to further acquire 25 per cent share in an open offer as per takeover code, the total amount will rise close to  ₹1 lakh crore. This is considered too high even by international standards.
""Government would have to stagger the equity dilution or decide to keep certain shareholding intact with it to make BPCL's disinvestment possible this fiscal,"" said an oil sector expert asking not to be named.
While no Indian company looks like mobilising such huge funds for BPCL's buy, industry experts hinted that companies from Russia and the Gulf region could be targeted to get the necessary investment. This, sources said, could be done through government to government talks as most oil companies in the region are state-controlled.
BPCL, in present times, will be an attractive buy for companies ranging from Saudi Aramco of Saudi Arabia to French energy giant Total SA which are vying to enter the world's fastest-growing fuel retail market including entry in retail space where BPCL has significant presence.
Alternatively, the government could also keep other oil PSUs such as Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), or OIL India on a standby to go in for share buybacks in the event strategic sale to a private partner met with little success.
BPCL operates four refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala, Bina in Madhya Pradesh and Numaligarh in Assam with a combined capacity to convert 38.3 million tonnes of crude oil into fuel. It has 15,078 petrol pumps and 6,004 LPG distributors.
The government proposes to raise  ₹1.05 lakh crore from disinvestment in the current financial year. It had exceeded asset-sale targets of  ₹1 lakh crore in FY18 and  ₹80,000 crore in FY19."

NEW DELHI :
The government is looking into state-owned Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd's (BPCL) investments in a gas block in Mozambique and has not yet formally given its approval to the firm for further spendings, sources said.
Bharat PetroResources Ltd (BPRL), an exploration and production subsidiary of BPCL, had in August 2008 bought a 10 per cent stake in Area-1 Offshore of the Rovuma Block from the US energy major Anadarko Petroleum Corp for USD 75 million. That same month Videocon through its subsidiary acquired a 10 per cent stake in the same block for an equivalent block.
Sources privy to the development said Anadarko had originally offered a 20 per cent stake in Area-1 to BPCL but the state-owned firm bought only half of it and the rest was picked up by Videocon.
Videocon in 2013 sold the same stake to ONGC Videsh Ltd for USD 2.475 billion.
Sources said the government is looking into reasons why BPCL did not buy the entire 20 per cent stake offered to it by Anadarko. Also, why it did not get other state-owned firms like ONGC involved if it wanted the exploration risk to be shared by splitting the 20 per cent stake.
These inquests have led to the government not formally according approval to BPCL to invest a further USD 2.2-2.4 billion in the development of a giant gas field discovered in Area-1.
The proposal was reviewed by an informal ministerial panel headed by Home Minister Amit Shah in June this year.
The BJP-led NDA government since first coming to power in 2014 has been critical of the nearly USD 6 billion spent by the Indian public sector firms to take 30 per cent stake in the Rovuma Offshore Area-1 in Mozambique during the Congress-led UPA regime, as falling oil and gas prices did not justify such huge investments.
Besides buying Videocon's 10 per cent stake for USD 2.475 billion, ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), had bought another 10 per cent stake from project operator Anadarko of US for USD 2.64 billion.
It later gave 4 per cent out of the stake bought from Videocon to Oil India Ltd.
Sources said even the OVL deal had in the first term of Modi government come under the scanner following allegations that the company might have overpaid Videocon.
Videocon was in 2012 willing to sell its stake to OVL at a small premium to the price Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production paid for acquiring an 8.5 per cent stake in the same block from Cove Energy for £1.22 billion (USD 1.9 billion at the exchange rate prevalent at that time).
The 10 per cent stake, they said, was available to OVL for about USD 2.3 billion or so but the company a year later paid USD 2.475 billion to Videocon.
OVL had strongly refuted the allegations then and it isn't known what happened to that scrutiny.
Woodlands, Texas-based energy exploration company Anadarko, which was later acquired by Occidental, is the operator of the block. Other partners in Area 1 include Mitsui with 20 per cent stake, ENH (15 per cent) and PTTEP (8.5 per cent).
Gas from the block is to be converted into liquefied natural gas (LNG) for transportation by ships to markets like India.

9,2019-11-18,ONGC,"Firm revises guidance for its largest KG Basin block, suggesting execution challengestotal crude oil and gas production of ONGC declined 4% and 2%, respectively, in the Sep quarter

Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may produce as much as 20% less natural gas than its original estimate from its largest block in the Krishna Godavari (KG) basin because of higher reservoir complexity and execution challenges
The management of the state-run explorer has cut its guidance for the KG-DWN-98/2 block to 32-34 billion cubic metres by FY24E from an earlier expectation of 38-40 billion cubic metres, suggesting higher reservoir complexity and execution challenges from this large asset, said a company official, requesting anonymity.
The KG project in the Bay of Bengal is one of ONGC’s biggest and most ambitious projects, wherein it aims to invest up to $5 billion during the entire lifecycle of the asset. ONGC did not respond to queries emailed on Saturday till press time.
KG-DWN-98/2 is an ultra-deepwater, high-temperature and high-pressure field.
Though ONGC posted a stand-alone net profit of  ₹6,263 crore for the July-September period, its total crude oil and gas production declined 4% and 2%, respectively, on a year-on-year (y-o-y) basis. While oil production fell for the eight consecutive quarter in the September quarter, the period also its first drop in gas production in 13 quarters.
The management at ONGC, however, is optimistic about deregulation of gas prices, which it hopes will offset shortfall in revenue due to lower production. “The management has stated that the government is considering NITI Aayog’s proposal to deregulate gas price and it is hopeful of a deregulated regime sooner than later to make gas production more viable. However, this might not boost gas production significantly in the medium-term as there are only a couple of gas discoveries in which the development is put on hold as it needed above $6 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) to make it viable,"" said SBICap Securities in a 15 November report.
Mint had reported on 13 October that ONGC may be forced to sell natural gas at a discount to its originally expected price from its newest deepwater block in the KG basin as gas prices remain subdued due to a supply glut internationally.
ONGC will begin production from the KG basin fields from next month and is seeking buyers for the first gas from the fields. The company is auctioning 0.75 million metric standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) of gas for three years from the fields. It has set a reserve price of $5.61 per mmBtu with a minimum bid quantity at 0.05 mmscmd. Bidders will have to bid electronically.
Reliance and BP combine, which will also begin production from April 2020 at its R-cluster field in KG-D6 block, have offered 5 mmscmd of gas to buyers.
Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought a majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries’ new fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of $5.04-5.16 per unit, news agency PTI reported on 17 November.
Analysts said ONGC may also seek bidders at a price similar to that of RIL and BP. With several new gas liquefaction capacities coming online globally, the supply glut is expected to keep prices of domestic gas depressed in the near- to medium-term, leading to poor returns."

MUMBAI :
State-run oil and gas producer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd’s (ONGC’s) September quarter results did not impress the Street. Even as the company’s stand-alone net profit of  ₹6,263 crore was in line with the estimates of a Bloomberg poll of analysts, there were some disappointing factors.
Stand-alone net crude oil price realizations declined by 17% year-on-year to $60.33 a barrel, disappointing some analysts. Crude oil realization was lower sequentially as well, declining by 9%. Moreover, production performance was rather discouraging. ONGC’s total crude oil and gas production declined 4% and 2%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. “Oil production has seen year-on-year decline in successive eight quarters while this is the first decline seen in gas production in 13 quarters,"" said analysts at Centrum Broking Ltd in a report on 15 November.
On a consolidated basis, “production is unlikely to rebound soon, ONGC’s optimism notwithstanding, but we were more disappointed by the weak consolidated earnings"", said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 14 November. Consolidated performance includes the financials of ONGC’s subsidiaries, and associates and joint ventures. The downstream ventures (HPCL, MRPL, OPaL, OMPL) were expectedly weak, but so was ONGC Videsh Ltd, which saw net profit decline 76% compared to the June quarter, pointed out Jefferies India.
Post-results, the company’s shares declined by 0.5% on the National Stock Exchange on Friday—a day when the broader markets were marginally up. In any case, investors haven’t had much luck with the stock. While the stock has recovered from its 52-week low seen on 4 September, it has declined by 15% so far this fiscal year.
For the half-year ended September, ONGC’s crude oil production declined by 4.7%, while gas production increased marginally by 1%, year-on-year. Needless to say, recovery on the production front remains crucial. In general, for oil producers, a higher crude oil price is helpful to ensure higher realizations. Additionally, investors would do well to keep a tab on news flow and developments on gas price reforms.
Meanwhile, it is comforting that valuations are not demanding. Currently, the ONGC stock trades at about six times estimated earnings for FY20, according to Bloomberg data. “ONGC is cheap mainly due to lack of positive triggers and stock overhang due to possible GoI divestment by way of ETF,"" said ICICI Securities Ltd analysts, commenting on valuations. ONGC’s share price discounts long-term oil realization of just $31 per barrel, added ICICI Securities in a report on 15 November."

Government to sell BPCL in mega push for privatization
The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) cleared one of the government’s largest asset-sale exercises involving five companies, including the privatization of Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) and Shipping Corp. of India (SCI), Mint reported. Other companies in which the government will sell stakes include Container Corp, of India Ltd (Concor), THDC India Ltd (THDC) and North Eastern Electric Power Corp. Ltd (Neepco). As part of a consolidation exercise of the state run hydropower firms, the GoI will sell its 74.23% and 100% stake in THDC and Neepco respectively along with management control to state run India’s largest power generation company-NTPC Ltd. In 2014, a concept paper on the possibility of a merger of all state-owned hydroelectric companies recommended a phased approach, starting with North Eastern Electric Power Corp Ltd (Neepco) to be combined with NHPC Ltd, followed by THDC India Ltd and SJVN Ltd. Also, the government will sell its 63.75% and 30.8% stake share in Shipping Corporation of India and Container Corporation of India respectively along with management control to a strategic buyer. In the case of BPCL, the government will sell its 53.29% stake to a strategic buyer, ceding management control, according to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. The proposed sale will, however, exclude the strategic Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) in Assam, which will be later sold to another state-run firm, given India’s need to secure fuel supplies for security forces in the north-east.

The conglomerate plans to sell an additional 16.5% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) to meet repayment obligations. The deal includes a 2.3% stake, which is in the process of being sold. Pursuant to the aforementioned transactions, the post-transaction overall holdings of the group in ZEEL will be about 5%, out of which encumbered holdings of the group will reduce to approximately 1.1% of ZEEL. The Essel Group said the development reaffirms the “positive progress on its overall asset divestment approach, undertaken to generate adequate liquidity for the repayment process.""

Cube Highways wins third TOT bundle with  ₹5,011 crore bid
Road developer Cube Highways and Infrastructure Pte Ltd has emerged as the highest bidder in round three of road auctions under the toll-operate-transfer (TOT) model, although its price offer was marginally more than the reserve price set by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Mint reported citing two people close to the development. Cube Highways, which is backed by global infrastructure fund I Squared Capital and the International Finance Corp. (IFC), offered  ₹5,011 crore to the government for a 30-year concession period. This is against the initial estimated concession value (IECV), or reserve price, of  ₹4,995.48 crore set by the NHAI for the road bundle. The state-run highway developer had put up nine stretches of roads, totaling 566.27km across Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu, in the third round. It had deferred the deadline for bids twice—from mid-September to 31 October—as potential investors sought more time. National Infrastructure and Investment Fund and IRB Infrastructure Developers also bid for the assets, quoting  ₹4,230 crore and  ₹3,510 crore, respectively. Even before the bidding for the third round was completed, the NHAI started the process to invite expressions of interest for the fourth round of TOT auctions, as it seeks to meet divestment targets and raise funds for new projects. The NHAI, which is the nodal agency of the ministry of road transport and highways, has set an initial estimated concession value of  ₹4,170 crore for the fourth bundle. Bidding is expected to close by 14 January.

Varde Partners may invest  ₹ 1,000 crore in Altico Capital
In a day of mixed developments at stressed home financier Altico Capital, one of its three owners— Varde Partners, would lead the equity infusion of up to  ₹1,000 crore, while the company said its chief executive officer is quitting and would cease to be in that role as early as next week, The Economic Times reported. The company is likely to submit a resolution plan at the lenders’ steering committee meeting to be held next week. According to the plan, US-based Varde will repay the lenders in full and seek additional credit lines from them. The financier is also in advanced talks with SBI Capital. Further, the firm may seek another  ₹1,000 crore of new loans from lenders as it will collectively help finish all those stalled builders’ projects. To be sure, one of the existing investors in Altico bonds reportedly sold the debt recently at yields beyond 71%. Separately, Altico told BSE that CEO Sanjeev Agrawal has “tendered his resignation"" and that November 26 will be his last working day as chief executive. Abu Dhabi Investment Council, Clearwater Capital and Varde are the three sponsors of the property-focused financier. The US-based private equity firm owns about 22%, ADIC holds about 33% and the remainder is in the hands of Singapore-based Clearwater Capital. Altico’s credit exposure is yet to turn into a non-performing asset in bank books. The company has about  ₹800 crore of repayment liabilities until December. Its total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.5 crore.
ONGC plans to raise $500 million via dollar bond sale
Oil & Natural Gas Corp (ONGC), India’s largest fuel explorer, plans to raise at least $500 million in a dollar bond sale as soon as next week to refinance part of its debt through cheaper funds, The Economic Times reported citing three people familiar with the matter. This is the state-owned company’s first sale of overseas bonds, although its subsidiary ONGC Videsh has raised dollar funds before. ONGC launched a $2 billion medium-term note programme in August, which allows the company to tap the overseas bond market when needed, subject to market conditions. The bonds are likely to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. The company’s capital expenditure over the past five years totalled  ₹1,45,915 crore and it plans to invest  ₹32,921 crore in the current financial year. If demand for the bond is strong, the company may choose to retain as much as $1billion, the people said. DBS Bank from Singapore, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Standard Chartered are some of the banks involved in the issue.
SBI raises  ₹ 3,800 crore via perpetual bond sale
State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s biggest mass-lender, has raised  ₹3,800 crore by selling perpetual bonds at 8.50% yield to several institutional investors, such as mutual funds, insurance companies and pension funds, The Economic Times reported. The money raised will augment the bank’s Tier I capital ratio, likely easing pressure on the lender to raise cash soon through a qualified institutional placement (QIP). HDFC Mutual Fund is said to have bought a large amount of these bonds that are rated AAA/ Stable by Crisil. Nippon India Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Mutual Fund, Edelweiss Mutual Fund and ICICI Primary Dealership were among the buyers. According to Basel III capital norms, the systemically important SBI needs to maintain a capital adequacy of 12.10%, which includes 8.60% of common equity, 1.5% of Tier I bonds like the perpetual debt raised by the bank on Wednesday and 2% of Tier II bonds. Capital adequacy at 13.59% was higher than required as of September. “With this sale, our capital adequacy improves further to 14%, which means we are more than 150 basis points above what is required by April 2020. This is a cost-effective way of raising capital compared to equity. We expect internal accruals to also add to capital; so there is no urgent need to dilute equity as of now,"" the official cited above said. Earlier this year, the bank had mandated Bank of America Merrill Lynch, CLSA, Kotak Mahindra Capital, and SBI Capital Markets to raise what was touted to be the largest QIP at about  ₹18,000 crore. However, the bank’s shares have fallen from a peak of  ₹372 apiece in July to  ₹329 on Wednesday.

7,2019-11-24,ONGC,"The government is looks to further consolidate operations of public sector enterprisesThe government is likely to ask all oil sector PSUs would be asked to exit from their investments made in equity shares of other state-owned entities

NEW DELHI :
The government may end the cross-holding structure existing in the oil sector as it looks to further consolidate operations of public sector enterprises and go ahead with its privatisation plan by getting a fair valuation of assets.
Official sources said that that all oil sector PSUs would be asked to exit from their investments made in equity shares of other state-owned entities. This could be done in phases, depending on the market conditions, so that the shares get maximum valuation.
The cross-holding structure among oil PSUs was built in the late 1990s as the government sold its shares in Oil India Ltd (OIL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in a bid to raise funds.
Consequently, while GAIL and IOC hold 7.84 and 2.45 per cent stake, respectively, in ONGC, ONGC and OIL hold 14.20 and 5.16 per cent stake, respectively, in IOC. Also, IOC and ONGC hold 2.44 and 4.87 per cent stake, respectively, in GAIL India, and BPCL (2.42 per cent), HPCL (2.47 per cent) and IOC (4.93 per cent) together own equity partial equity in OIL.
Estimates suggest that if the government divests its stake by taking the entire proceeds from sale of shares cross-held by oil PSUs, it could mobilise upwards of  ₹40,000- ₹50,000 crore. However, it is likely that companies may plough back the money raised through equity sale to the government by declaring a special dividend.
""The government wants to end cross-holding in the oil sector as its consolidation and privatisation roadmap would create two to three large integrated entities. This would create a situation where cross-holding could be seen as anti-competitive and aiding conflict of interest,"" said one of the source quoted above.
Analysts also believe that offloading listed investments could make sense even for strategic investors looking to buy into Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) as it would reduce the risk of any future government intervention. Since a listed investment is as good as cash equivalent, it can be sold before disinvestment and the proceeds given as one-time special dividend. Under the cross-holding structure, BPCL continues to hold 2.47 per cent stake worth around  ₹400 crore in OIL.
To its advantage, BPCL has no cross-holding by any other PSUs that could have created problems in its valuation and sale to a strategic investor. Similarly, HPCL also does not have a cross-holding structure, one reason why its acquisition by ONGC last year proceeded smoothly.
According to analysts, ""other income"" as a percentage of profit before tax of the oil marketing companies ranged between 13 per cent and 28 per cent last fiscal. And this high level of income could impact valuation of companies as markets usually discounts 20-30 per cent as holding company discount to the listed investment.
Sources said that the Oil Ministry has already indicated to ONGC to exit from its investments in oil refiner and marketer IOC and gas transportation utility GAIL India, while the other two would also sell all their equity in the upstream company.
""Each oil PSU has to take a call when the time is right to offload stakes held in others as cross-holding investments are dividend paying and exits should only be made at the right value and when market conditions are stable. Hopefully this call could be exercised in the last quarter of current fiscal,"" said a top official of a PSU oil company.
It is not that companies have made major gains from cross-holdings. In fact, with volatility in the oil market and the government's decision to seek OMCs take up some burden to soften the rise in petrol and diesel prices have taken a toll on OMC shares in the past and has thus reduced the value of their investments."
6,2019-11-25,ONGC,"In January this year, HPCL signed a debt syndication agreement with a consortium of nine lenders led by SBI for its refinery project in BarmerLenders seek exemption from RBI to relax the large exposure framework requirements for state-run firms

Mumbai: A Reserve Bank of India (RBI) regulation meant to reduce concentration risk for banks is gradually choking the flow of funds to some large public sector enterprises, especially the oil marketing companies that have substantial debt requirements to meet capital expansion commitments, said two people aware of the development.
Lenders have sought an exemption from the central bank to relax the large exposure framework requirements for public sector companies, said these two people who spoke on condition of anonymity. The RBI is yet to respond to their request, they said.
“There are cases where funds have been sanctioned but the company is unable to draw it because of the regulations. As the exposure limit is based on 20% of a bank’s capital base, a possible solution seems to be for banks to raise more funds or (wait for) the upcoming mergers (of state-run banks to grow their capital base),"" said one of the people mentioned above.
A refinery project of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) in Barmer district of Rajasthan and a few upcoming second-generation (2G) ethanol or bio-refineries are currently incomplete as banks have their hands tied by the new norms.
In January this year, HPCL, a unit of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC), signed a debt syndication agreement with a consortium of nine lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) for its refinery project in Barmer. The total cost of the project is  ₹43,129 crore. HPCL holds a 74% stake in the refinery, while the Rajasthan government owns the rest.
Two-thirds of the project is being funded through loans and the remainder through promoters’ equity. The company has already achieved financial closure by tying up for a  ₹28,753-crore loan from lenders. This project comprises a 9-million tonne a year oil refinery and a 2-million tonne per annum petrochemical unit.
“While the loans have been sanctioned by the banks, HPCL is unable to draw down the funds as lenders are near the end of their exposure limits and do not have further headroom,"" said the second person quoted above. The large exposure framework, effective 1 April 2019, seeks to reduce concentration risk in the banking industry, already saddled with bad loans. It aims to align with the standards on supervisory framework for measuring and controlling large exposures issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. As of September, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of all banks was more than  ₹9.5 trillion. What has worsened the issue is the merger of ONGC and HPCL last year, resulting in exposures in two separate entities being clubbed as one. Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and HPCL, did not reply to emails sent on Friday.
A senior executive from an oil marketing company said there is liquidity in the system but the companies are unable to tap it because of certain regulations.
All these entities are exceptions and only a few such companies are there with such large requirements and RBI’s objective is to de-risk large exposures of banks, said former RBI deputy governor R. Gandhi. “These entities are to raise capital and debt directly from the market. They have good ratings and can raise funds at competitive terms. Further, the merger of banks into international-size can also help take care of these large requirements. These merged banks will have higher net-worth and, therefore, would be able to sanction larger limits to these entities,"" he said.
Meanwhile, RBI had last October allowed OMCs to raise up to $10 billion through the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route for working capital needs. However, this does not cover loans required for capital expenditure or capex. Companies did not avail much of the ECB facility as lending rates are better domestically, said the OMC executive quoted above.
In a 16 October note, Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser, SBI said recent stake sales by the government as a part of the disinvestment programme has resulted in some central public sector undertakings (CPSUs) becoming a part of connected counterparties and hence there might be little headroom for bank lending to individual CPSUs.
“In fact, even if such lending were to happen it would result in additional bank capital or higher risk weights resulting in elevated rates,"" said Ghosh. It is, however, pertinent to add that public sector companies are not alone in their struggle for funds. Outstanding bank loans to industries grew by only 2.7% on a year-on-year basis in September to  ₹27.74 trillion. On a year-to-date basis, these loans were 3.8% lower than March 2019. Credit has to flow and move and while there is  ₹2 trillion in the system, banks and the financial sector are sitting on extra credit, said R. Shankar Raman, chief financial officer, Larsen and Toubro, at the company’s second-quarter earnings on 23 October. “It is important that they get diverted. NPAs are part and parcel of any credit delivery system but that cannot be allowed to paralyse the flow of money,"" he said."
5,2019-11-26,ONGC,"Staff from IOC, ONGC, HPCL, MTNL, BSNL may join protestsBPCL employees plan to go on strike on 28 Nov against the govt’s decision to privatize the firm

MUMBAI :
Over 12,000 employees of state-run Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) who have threatened to go on strike on 28 November against the Union government’s decision to privatise the company may see workers’ unions of other public sector entities join them in solidarity.
Senior BPCL workers’ union functionaries told Mint that unions cutting across political affiliations from other public sector undertakings (PSUs) such as Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), Indian Railways, Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Ltd (MTNL), and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will join them in planned nationwide protests.
“If the government does not reconsider its decision on BPCL’s privatization, we would be joined by employees of other oil companies in our strike which will go on for multiple days,"" said Praveen Kumar P., general secretary of Cochin Refineries Employees Association, an affiliate of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC). In an emailed response, a BPCL spokesperson said, “BPCL employee unions have given a strike notice that they plan to observe a day’s strike on 28 November. All efforts are being made to ensure that the refineries and marketing locations are running normal.""
As of 31 March, BPCL had 11,971 permanent and 22,267 temporary, contractual or casual employees. The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) on 20 November approved the sale of government’s entire stake in BPCL. As part of the privatisation process, potential bidders will have to submit an expression of interest (EoI) and after due diligence will be asked to submit price bids. The government has set a 50-day deadline for an outside “asset valuer"" to carry out the valuation of BPCL’s assets.
The privatisation of BPCL is expected to attract global energy majors, given that India is the world’s fastest-growing major oil market. The proceeds from the sale will also be crucial for the government to contain its fiscal deficit amid lower-than-expected goods and services tax collections and a corporate tax cut that will cost the exchequer  ₹1.45 trillion. The government plans to sell its 53.3% stake in the company which may fetch  ₹60,000 crore.
“We feel cheated by the government now. We had joined BPCL on the security of a government job but with privatization, our livelihoods are threatened. We are protesting for our rights,"" said a BPCL employee on the condition of anonymity.
BPCL was nationalised by an Act of Parliament in 1976 after being set up in the 1920s as Burmah Shell -- an alliance between Royal Dutch Shell, Burmah Oil Co. and Asiatic Petroleum (India).
This is not the first time that a Bharatiya Janata Party-led government has mooted the privatisation of BPCL. A similar attempt in 2003 by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was scuttled by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the privatisation required parliamentary approval. The Narendra Modi government, which enjoys a majority, has repealed the law, clearing the way for the stake sale."

SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, the credit card unit of the country’s largest lender, on Wednesday, filed initial share sale documents that could see the company sell shares worth around  ₹9,600 crore.
The share sale is poised to become the fifth-largest IPO in the country after Coal India Ltd, Reliance Power Ltd, GIC Re, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp and will help parent State Bank of India (SBI) raise funds to boost credit growth.
SBI, which holds 74% stake in the unit, along with private equity firm Carlyle Group, which holds the rest 26% through its subsidiary CA Rover Holdings, will together sell 130.5 million shares through the IPO.
“The secondary component of the IPO could be  ₹9,100 crore and will give a partial exit to both its shareholders. While Carlyle is looking to sell 10% stake via the IPO, SBI would sell 4% stake in the company,"" two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
The company is looking to list within the next 3-4 months at a pre-money valuation of  ₹65,000 crore, one of the two people said.
The initial share sale also includes a fresh issue of shares that will see the company raise  ₹500 crore to augment its capital base and for business growth.
“The secondary markets have seen bit of a recovery and that has also spurred some activity in the IPO market. But the positive response is still restricted to good quality companies that have a retail consumer franchise. Many small-cap companies are still finding it tough to get the desired pricing. That said, in the past nine months, the sentiment was really negative and IPO activity was consequently very slow, but it is likely to see some pickup in the coming quarters,"" said Mukund Ranganathan, executive director at Motilal Oswal Investment Banking.
The book running lead merchants to the issue are Axis Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Nomura, Kotak Mahindra Capital and SBI Capital.
SBI Cards is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country with 9.46 million credit cards, and had a 18% share of the Indian credit card market as on 30 September. The company started operations in 1998 as a joint venture with GE Capital Corp. In December 2017, GE Capital sold its 40% stake in the company to SBI and Carlyle.
HDFC Bank has the largest credit cards business in the country with 13.3 million cards issued, while ICICI Bank stood third with 7.9 million credit cards, as of 30 September, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India.
For the six months to September, SBI Cards reported a revenue jump of 36% to  ₹4,363.9 crore from a year ago. Its profit jumped 78% to  ₹1,034.58 crore during the period."

Unable to attract a strategic partner for ONGC Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. has shelved its stake sale plans for the petrochemical unit, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
OPaL, a joint venture between ONGC (49.4%), GAIL (India) Ltd ( 49.2%) and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (1.4%), has set up a grass root mega petrochemical complex at Dahej, Gujarat.
For over four years, ONGC has maintained that it was in talks with Saudi Arabia’s Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (Sabic) and Saudi Aramco for selling a 26% stake in OPaL.
“The stake sale process is not going ahead as it did not yield any result. So, for the time being, ONGC has decided to make OPaL a subsidiary,"" said a banker aware of the development, adding that ONGC will now have to convert its share warrants and debenture into equity.
If ONGC converts share warrants worth  ₹2,600 crore into equity, its share in the project could rise to 70%. Besides, if it also decides to convert debentures worth  ₹7,778 crore into equity, its share could rise to about 93%. After turning OPaL into a subsidiary, ONGC could consider listing it in two years.
OPaL is a $4.5 billion petrochemical project.
It began operations in 2016-17 and has been ramping up production in phases. OPaL’s complex houses India’s largest greenfield single-location, dual-feed cracker unit. The company primarily manufactures polymer, a chemical compound used in various products ranging from textiles to plastics.
ONGC and OPaL did not respond to an email query sent on Monday.
However, a senior ONGC official said: “Offtake from OPaL is increasing and, even if OPaL is technically a separate entity, all feedstock is taken from ONGC. We see the contribution from petrochemicals to increase (in ONGC’s topline) and, thus, we may convert OPaL into a subsidiary."" Though OPaL was meant to export most of its products, it is currently exporting less than 15%. So, considering the increased domestic demand, ONGC had said in October that it was working towards getting the domestic tariff area (DTA) access against its present Special Economic Zone (SEZ) tag.
Petrochemicals make up nearly 30% of India’s chemicals industry. An increase in plastic consumption has led to domestic demand rising at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-9% over the past decade."

Warburg Pincus to raise up to $1.5 billion for first India-focused fund
Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC is looking to raise up to $1.5 billion for its first fund targeting deals in India, Reuters reported citing two people familiar with the matter, betting on a surge in investment opportunities in Asia's third-largest economy. Warburg plans finish fundraising on its India-focussed fund, which will target industrial sectors such as financial, manufacturing and consumer, by the first half of next year, said one of the people. Launches of India-focused private equity funds are rare, and big global buyout firms such as KKR & Co Inc, Bain Capital and Blackstone Group Inc typically invest in a country mainly from their regional funds. Private equity-backed deals in India have risen to a record $16.8 billion so far this year, rising up from the previous high of $12.4 billion last year, according to data compiled by Refinitiv. The news of Warburg's India fundraising plan comes as rival KKR is looking to raise a record $15 billion in 2020 for its latest Asia-focussed buyout fund, which will include India investments.

SBI refuses to fund Patanjali’s Ruchi Soya buyout on its own
Pantajali Ayurved’s attempt to buy out edible oil maker Ruchi Soya under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) for  ₹4,350 crore has ran into a road block as the State Bank of India (SBI) has refused to fund the transaction on its own and demanded that other lenders who also benefit from the deal chip in, too, The Economic Times reported. As much as  ₹3,700 crore of the acquisition cost was supposed to have been funded by bank loans with Patanjali infusing  ₹600 crore from its own internal accruals, according to the resolution plan submitted by the company in August. Bankers were hoping that SBI, which had the maximum exposure of  ₹1,800 crore and hence would benefit the most by the adoption of the resolution plan, would take a disproportionate share and help the deal go through. Now there are doubts being raised on the deal. Patanjali had mostly approached public sector banks for the funding. However, bankers are wary of giving more loans. “SBI cannot force any lender to give loans for this deal. This is a purely a commercial decision and each lender will have to take a call. Gone are the days when all banks use to follow the lead lender and give loans in a consortium. Now everyone takes their own call. Patanjali had to tie up the funding while submitting the bid which they have not done. If this does not work out banks will have to think about invoking the guarantee given by the company,"" said a public sector banker. Bankers are also wary of funding the home-grown consumer goods company after rating downgrades by rating agencies Care and ICRA in October."
1,2019-12-20,ONGC,"In the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) joint venture, ONGC held 40% stake, while RIL and BG Exploration owned 30% stake eachAt its peak, Panna-Mukta has contributed to nearly 6% of India’s oil production

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Shell India-owned BG Exploration and Production India Ltd (BGEPIL) will transfer their entire stake in Panna-Mukta oil and gas fields to state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd (ONGC) on 21 December. RIL, BG Exploration and ONGC have been operating the Panna-Mukta fields in a joint venture for the past 25 years.
In the Panna-Mukta and Tapti (PMT) joint venture, ONGC held 40% stake, while RIL and BG Exploration owned 30% stake each. BG Exploration is a subsidiary of Shell India.
“The production sharing contracts (PSC) for the Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields, which were executed by the PMT JV with the government of India in 1994, will expire on 21 December 2019. The Tapti fields had ceased production earlier in 2016 and the Tapti process platform facilities were handed over to ONGC (a government nominee) in 2016,"" RIL said in a regulatory filing.
The PMT joint venture, under India’s first offshore decommissioning and site restoration project, is currently carrying out decommissioning and site restoration of residual Tapti facilities, including five unmanned platforms and in-field pipelines, RIL said. The Tapti decommissioning and other commercial activities would continue in BG Exploration even after handover of stake in the Panna-Mukta fields, RIL added.
“At its peak, Panna-Mukta has contributed to nearly 6% of India’s oil production and almost 7% of India’s gas production in the year 2007-08. Reliance has been a part of this journey and contributed, by providing energy, to the growth and development of India’s oil and gas sector,"" said B Ganguly, president at RIL’s exploration and production vertical.
“The PMT JV is a great example of a successful partnership between India’s largest national oil company (ONGC), India’s largest private company (Reliance) and an international oil company (Shell). Shell is proud to have been part of this journey and privileged to have partnered with Reliance, ONGC and the government of India,"" BGEPIL Managing Director Trivikram Arun said. “Our teams have worked relentlessly to ensure a safe handover of the producing fields from the PMT JV to ONGC at the end of the term.""
The PMT fields were the first fields in India to be operated under a joint operatorship model. The Panna-Mukta fields, located off the Mumbai coast, have produced 211 million barrels of oil and 1.25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas since December 1994.
In 2019, the average monthly production from the fields was 10,000 barrels per day of crude oil and 140 million standard cubic feet per day of natural gas."
0,2019-12-31,ONGC,"For one, production performance has been nothing to write home aboutFor the six months ended September, standalone gas production rose by a mere 1% year-on-year, while crude oil production declined by 4.7%

Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) lacked the energy in 2019. The stock has declined by nearly 15% so far this year, while the Nifty 100 index has increased by 11%. What gives?
For one, production performance has been nothing to write home about. For the six months ended September, standalone gas production rose by a mere 1% year-on-year, while crude oil production declined by 4.7%. Second, outlook on crude oil prices isn’t spectacular, as global oil demand is not expected to be robust from a near to medium term perspective. Brent crude oil prices are currently hovering around $68 a barrel and analysts don’t expect meaningful upsides from these levels.
The good news is that valuations are not demanding, what with the stock trading at 5.4 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data.
What should investors watch out for in the coming year? “Any divestment in government’s stake in ONGC via offer for sales or ETF would hit its stock performance,"" said analysts from ICICI Securities Ltd in a 12 December report. Further, muted outlook on crude prices is another risk for ONGC. Investors will watch production trajectory closely, too. Meanwhile, news reports indicated that the government was contemplating gas price deregulation. News flow on that remains crucial.
ICICI Securities expects ONGC to benefit if gas prices are deregulated. “ONGC would be a hedge against investment in city gas distribution (CGD) firms as it would gain the most from gas price deregulation, while CGD firms would be hit by it,"" the broking firm said."
