566,2018-01-03,Airtel,"Reliance Jio had complained to Trai that a majority of calls on its network were failing as Airtel, Vodafone and Idea, among others, were not providing sufficient points of interconnection (PoI)

New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued new guidelines that require telecom operators to sign an interconnection agreement on a non-discriminatory basis within 30 days of receipt of a network connectivity request from a rival service provider. 
New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has issued new guidelines that require telecom operators to sign an interconnection agreement on a non-discriminatory basis within 30 days of receipt of a network connectivity request from a rival service provider.
The new rules formulated by Trai also provide for a penalty of a maximum of Rs1 lakh a day per circle for operators that violate these rules. There are 22 telecom circles in the country and most top operators are now present in all of them.
The regulations, effective 1 February, assume significance since there were no clear guidelines on the time frame for entering into such network connectivity pacts.
In addition, the previous interconnect agreement rules did not provide for any penalties on defaulting operators.
Interconnection means the commercial and technical arrangements under which service providers connect their equipment, network and services for the benefit of customers across their networks.
Point of interconnect (PoI) is a mutually agreed point of demarcation where the exchange of traffic between the two operators takes place.
After it started commercial services in September 2016, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, complained to the regulator that a majority of calls on its network were failing as rival operators were not providing sufficient PoIs.
The other operators had then said the free voice calls offered by Reliance Jio had led to a “tsunami"" of traffic on their networks.
Trai had in May defended its earlier stand to recommend to the department of telecommunications the imposition of a cumulative fine of Rs3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd for allegedly denying PoIs to Reliance Jio.
Trai had recommended this penalty as it believed that the three operators had violated the licence agreement which mandates that the licensee will be responsible for maintaining the quality of service and any violation is liable to be treated as breach of terms and conditions of the licence.
The department of telecommunications is currently meeting Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone India to decide on this matter.
Trai does not have penal powers and can only recommend penalties for violation of regulations.
The new rules also outline a framework for provisioning and augmenting of interconnectivity ports, laying down a step-by-step process for provisioning of such ports.
“For a period of two years from the date of establishment of initial interconnection, the service provider, who made the request for entering into interconnection agreement, shall seek ports at PoI from the other service provider to meet the demand of incoming and outgoing traffic at the PoI,"" Trai said.
“At the end of two years from the date of establishment of initial interconnection or on 1 February, 2018, whichever is later, the total ports existing at a PoI shall be converted for carrying one way traffic in such a manner that the number of ports for sending the outgoing traffic of each service provider to the other service provider are in proportion to their outgoing traffics averaged over a period of preceding three months,"" Trai added."
565,2018-01-03,Airtel,"Top brokerages expect the revenue of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular to decline in the third quarter as revenue from interconnect usage charges has added to their sales historically

New Delhi: Telecom operators Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which are facing stiff competition after the advent of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, are expected to take a further hit to their earnings for October-December because of the impact of the cut in interconnect usage charges. 
New Delhi: Telecom operators Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which are facing stiff competition after the advent of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, are expected to take a further hit to their earnings for October-December because of the impact of the cut in interconnect usage charges.
Top brokerages expect the revenue of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular to decline in the third quarter as revenue from interconnect usage charges has added to their sales historically.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had in September slashed interconnect usage charges from 14 paise a minute to 6 paise a minute effective 1 October. Interconnect usage charges (IUC) or mobile termination charges (MTC) are what an operator pays another for landing calls on the latter’s network.
“Our math suggests that mobile termination contributed to as much as 14-15% to Bharti’s India wireless revenues and a similar proportion to the segment’s Ebitda in July-September,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report dated 1 January.
Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
A 57% cut in mobile termination charges, keeping all other variables constant, should result in around 8% sequential decline in India wireless revenues for Bharti Airtel, Kotak Institutional Equities added.
“Adjusted for IUC cuts, we believe competitive pressure on telcos will continue,"" Credit Suisse said in a report.
Credit Suisse expects Bharti Airtel’s revenue to drop to Rs21,026 crore in October-December, down 9.9% from a year earlier. On a sequential basis, revenue is expected to fall 3.4%.
For Idea Cellular, IUC’s contribution to revenue and Ebitda in July-September was 14-15% and 20-21%, respectively, Kotak Institutional Equities said in the report, adding that the cut in IUC would mean an 8% decline in revenue and nearly 11-12% impact on Ebitda on a quarter-on-quarter basis.
Credit Suisse expects Idea Cellular’s revenue to drop to Rs6,850 crore in October-December, down 20.9% year-on year. On a sequential basis, revenue is expected to drop 8.2%.
Idea Cellular has been posting a loss for the past three quarters.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch expects a sharper impact of the IUC rate cut on Idea Cellular with its October-December revenue declining 15.4% sequentially.
At the time of Trai’s announcement of the IUC cut, Vodafone and Bharti Airtel had said they were disappointed with the decision as this would worsen the health of the telecom sector.
The suggested rate, which has been arrived at in a “completely non-transparent fashion"", benefits only one operator which enjoys a huge traffic asymmetry in its favour, Bharti Airtel had said then, without naming Reliance Jio.
Vodafone India had at that time said that the Indian telecom industry was already experiencing the greatest period of financial stress in its history and this was yet another retrograde regulatory measure that would significantly benefit the new entrant alone while adversely affecting the rest of the industry as a whole.
The cut in interconnect usage charges will help Reliance Jio “generate additional $200-450 million Ebitda during FY18-20,"" Goldman Sachs had said in a note in September.
CLSA in a September note had said it expects Reliance Jio’s 2018-19 Ebitda to rise by 20% due to the cut in interconnect usage charges.
Interconnect usage charges in India have been brought down over time - from 30 paise in 2004 to 20 paise in 2009, and to 14 paise in 2015.
The IUC will be scrapped from 1 January 2020.
Idea Cellular managing director Himanshu Kapania at the India Mobile Congress in September said the telecom regulator’s decision to cut interconnect charges had created an inter-operator imbalance and would push the sector to a level where only one technology survives."
564,2018-01-12,Airtel,"UIDAI, however, maintains that Airtel Payments Bank's eKYC licence will remain suspended till final inquiry and audit report

New Delhi: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has extended the conditional permission given to Bharti Airtel Ltd to resume Aadhaar-based e-KYC verification of telecom subscribers till 31 March, from the initial date of 10 January. 
New Delhi: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has extended the conditional permission given to Bharti Airtel Ltd to resume Aadhaar-based e-KYC verification of telecom subscribers till 31 March, from the initial date of 10 January.
The move is aimed at facilitating the linking of Aadhaar with mobile SIMs. Coincidentally, the new deadline for this is also 31 March, as directed by the Supreme Court.
However, the suspension of the e-KYC licence of Airtel Payments Bank has still not been revoked.
UIDAI had asked Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the department of telecom (DoT) and audit and consultancy firm PwC India to conduct an audit of Airtel with respect to its systems, processes, applications, documentations and any other aspect as may be identified by the RBI and DoT to ensure that the firm complies with its licence conditions.
UIDAI will take a view on the issue on 10 February after taking into account the final audit report of the DoT, the RBI and others on the matter, said a report by PTI on Thursday, quoting officials.
When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson said, “We can confirm that the UIDAI has permitted Bharti Airtel to continue Aadhaar based e-KYC till March 31, 2018, subject to compliance to guidelines laid down by the authority. We continue to engage with the authorities and have addressed all concerns that they have raised. Compliance to all guidelines is of paramount importance to us and we remain committed to this.""
The decision to provide a temporary reprieve to Airtel on 21 December was taken after Rs138 crore of funds under the direct benefit transfer scheme were credited back to the original accounts of 5.6 million beneficiaries. 
In September, UIDAI had sent a notice to Airtel after receiving complaints that it was opening payments bank accounts without the explicit consent of users. It was also alleged that government subsidies were being credited in these accounts without the knowledge of users.
Last month, UIDAI had issued strict rules asking banks and the National Payments Corp. of India (NPCI) to ensure prior consent of beneficiaries of various government welfare schemes before switching bank accounts in which they receive subsidies due to them under the direct benefits transfer scheme. 
While granting the temporary reprieve to Airtel in December, UIDAI had instructed the firm to use the e-KYC and authentication service only for the purpose of re-verification and issuance of SIM cards and not for obtaining consent of the Aadhaar holder for opening bank accounts, wallets, DTH or any other goods or services.
Both Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank were appointed as authentication user agencies (AUA) by UIDAI and had entered into an agreement with UIDAI in February 2015 and September 2016 respectively for the purposes of availing of authentication services provided by the authority.

562,2018-01-16,Airtel,"After Reliance Jio and Airtel, Vodafone is also rolling out voice calls that will be routed on the 4G network, for better bandwidth that will translate into clearer audio

The next chapter in the battle between the telecom operators in India seems to be well and truly underway. Vodafone announced on Monday that it was starting the rollout of VoLTE services in India, starting with Gujarat—Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Karnataka circles will be added soon. VoLTE, or Voice over Long-Term Evolution, is the method by which mobile service providers utilize the 4G network for voice calls as well, instead of just data.  
The next chapter in the battle between the telecom operators in India seems to be well and truly underway. Vodafone announced on Monday that it was starting the rollout of VoLTE services in India, starting with Gujarat—Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata and Karnataka circles will be added soon. VoLTE, or Voice over Long-Term Evolution, is the method by which mobile service providers utilize the 4G network for voice calls as well, instead of just data. 
We saw a sneak peek of this late last year, when Airtel announced that it was rolling out VoLTE services in some parts of the country to compete with the VoLTE services offered by Reliance Jio over their 4G network. Airtel currently offers VoLTE in Mumbai, Maharashtra, Goa, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh & Telangana, Karnataka and Chennai circles. 
So, what exactly is VoLTE? Most of us would have upgraded to 4G SIM cards for our phones by now, and taking advantage of perhaps the better speeds available for web browsing, video and music streaming as well as downloads, compared with 3G connections. Till now, the 4G network was used for just that—handling data. In parallel, the voice calls that you made and received were pushed via the 3G or 2G networks. 
The biggest advantage of handling voice calls over the 4G network is that the greater bandwidth allows for better quality voice calls. Operators claim that these are high definition (HD) quality voice calls. There will be lesser call drops, greater voice clarity, and operators also claim that calls get connected significantly faster, in comparison with standard voice calls over 3G and 2G networks. While battery life of the phone you use may somewhat improve as well if you have good 4G connectivity, it will surely have a positive impact overall as the phone will now not have to keep switching from 2G or 3G every time you make a call and back to 4G again when you start using an app or browsing the web. 
There are limitations too. The primary restriction would be on whether both participants in the call have VoLTE connectivity. If the call recipient doesn’t, then the call you make will still remain a standard voice call. 
Then there is the issue of charges. At present, Reliance Jio, Airtel and now Vodafone are not charging separately for VoLTE calls—the calls will be charged as per the existing voice plan and would not consume any additional data. 
Now for the most important question—will your existing phone work with VoLTE, if and when your mobile service provider rolls this option out in your telecom circle? Chances are, yes. Let us look at some examples of phones that are compatible with VoLTE to reaffirm that you may not necessarily need to buy an expensive new phone—the OnePlus 3/3T/5/5T, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4/Mi Max/Mi A1/Redmi Y1/MIX 2, Apple iPhone SE/6/6 Plus/7/7 Plus/8/8 Plus/X, Samsung Galaxy A5/A7/A8/A9/J2/J7/ON8/S6 and the Nokia 2/6/8, to name a few. To get VoLTE to work on your phone, you will need to have a SIM card that is 4G-capable (if you don’t have that already), and activate VoLTE services for your connection. 
VoLTE will be the next big feature that could significantly improve the voice calls experience this year, once the rollout is wide enough and users sign up in large numbers."
563,2018-01-16,Airtel,"Annual operating profit of Airtel and the Vodafone-Idea combine will take a hit of Rs500 crore and Rs620 crore, respectively, due to the cut in international call termination charges

New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) decision to reduce the international call termination charge from 53 paise a minute to 30 paise a minute will crimp the earnings of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd, analysts said. 
New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) decision to reduce the international call termination charge from 53 paise a minute to 30 paise a minute will crimp the earnings of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd, analysts said.
The move will also impact newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which was advocating a cut. 
The latest move by the telecom regulator is expected to result in an annualized Ebitda hit of Rs500 crore to Bharti Airtel and Rs620 crore to the proposed combined entity of Idea Cellular and Vodafone India, a report by Kotak Institutional Equities dated 15 January said. 
Ebitda—or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization—is a measure of operating profitability.
Idea Cellular and Vodafone India, which are currently negotiating a merger to create India’s largest telecom operator, are likely to start operating as a single unit from April, Mint reported on 15 January.
The new international call termination rate will be effective starting 1 February.
The cut in international call termination charge could result in Bharti Airtel’s Ebitda for the January-March quarter falling by Rs84 crore, according to Mint calculations, based on estimates by Kotak Institutional Equities.
The termination charge is payable by an international long-distance operator to the Indian telecom operator on whose network an overseas call terminates.
Kotak has derived the impact on telcos by pegging the annual international incoming traffic into India at around 75 billion minutes, which implies annualized revenue of roughly Rs4,000 crore for the access providers and a 43% cut in international call termination charge would result in an impact of roughly Rs1,700 crore on industry revenue, of which Bharti Airtel has a 33% share, Vodafone India 23% and Idea Cellular 18%.
“The cut is negative, but will not have a huge impact on the sector as such because the volume of incoming voice traffic is not that much,"" an analyst said, requesting anonymity.
“The hit to operators could be even lower than this if you take into account the demand elasticity benefits arising due to the cut,"" another analyst said, also on condition of anonymity.
The cut follows a steep reduction in the domestic interconnection usage charge—paid by one operator to another for calls made to the latter’s network—to 6 paise a minute from 14 paise, effective 1 October.
The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI), a lobby group, had sought a hike in the international call termination charge from 53 paise a minute to Rs3.5 a minute. Reliance Jio had pushed for a cut to 6 paise.
“COAI is of the view that the reduction in international termination charge is against national interest, as the country will lose precious foreign exchange,"" Rajan S. Mathews, director general of the lobby group, said in a statement on Friday.
The resulting loss to telecom service providers is expected to be approximately Rs2,000 crore annually, and this will also lead to a loss in revenue to the exchequer, from both licence fees and goods and services tax, Mathews said.
COAI also conceded that its member Jio has a divergent view on this issue.
“That Jio was the only major access provider in India to support a cut in international termination charge is interesting to note. We understand that Jio has a minuscule market share of the current international termination market in India; however, this would have changed over time as Jio gained share, we believe,"" said the report by Kotak Institutional Equities.
“While this cut makes incumbents weaker and caps their cash flows, it is also negative for Jio. When Jio attains some more market share, this will come haunting them. But it has to get to that market share level so this is the strategy (to weaken incumbents),"" said the second analyst cited earlier.
Supporting the cut does not have any direct cost reduction benefit for Jio unlike the domestic interconnect usage charge cut, nor does it gain Jio any customer goodwill, the report by Kotak Institutional Equities said, adding that the cost-benefit equation in front of Jio was causing incumbents immediate hurt at the cost of shrinking a high-profitability source of industry revenue in which Jio would have participated at some point."

560,2018-01-17,Airtel,"Tata Sons plans to use the ECB funds to partly subscribe to the forthcoming rights issue of Tata Steel and repay part of the outstanding debt of Tata Teleservices ahead of its merger with Bharti Airtel

Mumbai: Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the Tata group, is looking to raise up to $1.5 billion in external commercial borrowing (ECB) in the next few weeks, two people directly aware of its fund-raising plans said. 
Mumbai: Tata Sons Ltd, the holding company of the Tata group, is looking to raise up to $1.5 billion in external commercial borrowing (ECB) in the next few weeks, two people directly aware of its fund-raising plans said.
Tata Sons plans to use the funds partly to subscribe to the forthcoming rights issue of Tata Steel Ltd and also repay a part of the outstanding debt of Tata Teleservices (TTSL), which is in the process of merging with Bharti Airtel Ltd, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.
“Tata Sons has received approval from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for the proposed ECB and has begun discussions with foreign lenders to raise the funds,"" said the first person cited above.
ECBs are loans given by non-resident lenders to Indian borrowers in foreign currency. Under the current regulatory framework, ECBs can be raised either through the automatic route, which is limited to certain sectors, or under the approval route, for which the RBI’s permission is necessary.
In December, Tata Steel’s board approved a rights issue of Rs12,800 crore, primarily to fund the expansion of its Kalinganagar facility by 5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 8 mtpa. The company has said the expansion will be completed in four years and funded through a mix of debt and equity.
“Post the rights issue, Tata Sons wants to retain its stake in Tata Steel at the current level for which it will have to infuse additional equity,"" said the second person cited above. “Apart from subscribing to the rights issue, the funds raised through ECB will be also used to repay a part of the Rs22,000 crore debt of Tata Teleservices,"" the second person said. 
“We do not comment on market speculation,"" a Tata Sons spokesperson said.
In October, Tata Sons agreed to sell its consumer mobile business to India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel in a debt-free, cash-free deal.
On 11 January, a report in The Economic Times, citing people aware of the matter, said that the Tata group had repaid around Rs17,000 crore to various banks towards the outstanding debt of Tata Teleservices.
Tata Sons, founded in 1917 by Tata group’s founder J.N. Tata, is the principal holding company for the Tata group and owner of the Tata brand, and income from dividends and profit generated on sale of investments constitute the principal revenue source for the company, along with royalty fees earned from group companies. 
Tata Sons’ equity investments are spread across seven major industry segments and include flagship concerns such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Tata Steel, Tata Power Co. Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd, Tata Chemicals Ltd, Tata Teleservices Ltd, and Tata Global Beverages Ltd, among others. 
Mint had reported in September that the Tata group under chairman N. Chandrasekaran has begun a process of rationalization, drastically pruning the number of firms in its portfolio and exiting non-performing and non-profitable businesses and consolidating holdings in some group companies under the ‘One Tata Plan’.
Tata Sons spent close to Rs4,000 crore in acquiring additional stakes in various group firms since the removal of former group chairman Cyrus Mistry in September 2016, Mint reported in September.
According to recent corporate filings, for the 12 months to March 2017, Tata Sons reported a profit after tax of Rs824 crore on an operating income of Rs9,950.4 crore. The firm reported a profit of Rs3,013.1 crore against Rs7,973.5 crore the year before."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s quarterly profit plunged 39%, missing analysts’ estimates, as India’s telecom regulator more than halved interconnection fees and a pricing war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continued unabated. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s quarterly profit plunged 39%, missing analysts’ estimates, as India’s telecom regulator more than halved interconnection fees and a pricing war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continued unabated.
Net profit fell to Rs306 crore in the three months ended 31 December from Rs504 crore in the year earlier, India’s largest telecom operator said in a statement on Thursday. That compares with the Rs398 crore profit estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the telecom regulator’s decision to slash interconnection usage charges (IUC) levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) cut IUC from 14 paise a minute to 6 paise effective 1 October.
“Although the company faced pressure from Reliance Jio, the impact of the IUC cut is the biggest hit,"" a Mumbai-based telecom analyst said on condition of anonymity. “With consolidation in the sector, it is still the best placed among all operators.""
Revenue dropped 12.9% to Rs20,319 crore in the December quarter from Rs23,335 crore in the year earlier. Pricing pressure is evident from the fact that Airtel’s mobile data traffic rose more than five-fold to 1.18 billion megabytes (MBs) in the quarter.
“Regulatory fiat in the form of a cut in domestic IUC rates has exacerbated the industry ARPU (average revenue per user) decline in Q3’18. The recent announcement of reduction in international termination rates will further accentuate this decline and benefit foreign operators with no commensurate benefit to customers,"" Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive officer (India and South Asia) at Bharti Airtel, said in a statement.
The IUC cut has worsened the already strained health of telecom operators. Things started souring after Reliance Jio started commercial services in September 2016 with six months of free services, followed by rock-bottom tariffs. Airtel has since recorded a fall in net profit for five straight quarters as it cut tariffs to take on Jio.
Consolidated Ebitda fell 11.5% year-on-year to Rs7,587 crore in the quarter ended December, Airtel said. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Airtel’s December quarter revenues from India fell 11.3% year on year to Rs15,294 crore on an underlying basis, adjusted for the impact in reduction of domestic termination rates, primarily led by a drop in the mobile segment, the company said.
Airtel’s monthly ARPU (in India) fell sharply to Rs123 in the December quarter from Rs172 a year ago. The number of minutes spent on calls on its network, however, grew 49.8% in India during the quarter while the total data consumed on its network rose more than six-fold.

1. Airtel’s revenues and net profit drop for 6th straight quarter 
1. Airtel’s revenues and net profit drop for 6th straight quarter
The long shadow of Reliance Jio continued to linger on the Indian telecom sector. On Thursday, Bharti Airtel, India’s biggest telecom service provider, reported a decline in revenues and net profit for the sixth straight quarter. On a year-on-year basis, its revenues declined 12.9% and net profit 39%. The dip is mainly due to the continuing effect of Reliance Jio’s tariff wars initiated over a year ago and the impact of the telecom regulator more than halving the interconnection fees.
2. 39% of 14-18 year olds in school or college also work
They are expected to go to school, and learn well there. But they are not: as many as 25% of rural Indian youth in the 14-18 years age group were unable to read basic text fluently in their own language. This is among the many findings of the Annual Status of Education (ASER) Report 2017, which focused on 14-18 year olds, and collected information in four domains: activity, ability, awareness and aspirations. Part of the problem is they also have to work: as many as two in five youth enrolled in school or college also worked 15 days a month. And three out of five who were not enrolled were working.
3. India diesel prices at all-time high
Prices of Brent crude oil topped $70 to a barrel, a three-year high. And, in India, the price of diesel followed suit, rising to Rs62.25 per litre in Delhi—its highest ever. In the last six months, the increase in the price of diesel has been 13%, a quantum that will have a trickle-down effect as the transportation sector is hugely reliant on this fuel. Diesel was once a controlled fuel, and governments, citing public interest, would subsidise it heavily.
4. World’s fifth-largest diamond found in Lesotho
London-based miner Gem Diamonds said it had found a diamond weighing 910 carats in Lesotho in Southern Africa, which would make it the world’s fifth-largest diamond. It is said to be the size of about two golf balls, and could be worth about $40 million. Shares of Gem Diamonds climbed as much as 12% after the announcement. They cooled off, but were still up 5.3% for the week on Thursday. The largest diamond, Cullinan, weighs 3.4 times that of Gem’s latest discovery, and was found near Pretoria in South Africa in 1905.
5. IDFC Bank, Capital First to merge
Three months after an aborted attempt to acquire financial services companies of the Shriram Group, IDFC Bank announced it was merging with Capital First, a non-banking finance company (NBFC) in an all-stock deal. Shareholders of Capital First will receive 139 shares of IDFC Bank for every 10 shares held by them. IDFC Bank is paying top money to buy growth and scale, especially on the retail side: a day before the deal was announced, the market capitalization of Capital First stood at Rs8,266 crore and that of IDFC Bank at Rs23,019 crore. Post the deal, stocks of both companies have lost ground.
6. India’s away quest off to bad start with South Africa loss
India’s quest to cement its status as the number one test side by winning challenging away series is off to a bad start. In the ongoing series in South Africa, the hosts beat India in the second test to clinch the series. In the process, they extended their unbeaten series record against India in South Africa to 26 years and seven test series. Since 2010, while India has registered series wins in West Indies, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, it hasn’t won a series against the four tough sides (Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa), all of which it plays in the next 12 months.
7. Financial upswing in European club football continues
European club football is in better shape than ever, according to UEFA’s Club Licensing Benchmarking Report for financial year 2016 that aggregates data for 681 top-division clubs across 50 leagues. This set reported aggregate operating profits of €832 million in 2016, an increase of 15% over 2015 and the highest since UEFA began this exercise in 2008. Europe’s clubs have now generated about €2.7 billion in operating profits in the last four years, against a combined operating loss of €830 million between 2010 and 2012. Aggregate net loss—after player transfers, and non-operating, financing, tax and divestment activities—shrunk to €269 million in 2016.
8. Hindustan Unilever net profit up 28%
FMCG major Hindustan Unilever posted a net profit of Rs1,326 crore in the quarter to December 2017, a year-on-year increase of 28%. Volumes grew 11% on a year-on-year basis. Although this increase requires tempering as the December quarter of 2016 bore the brunt of demonetisation, experts said it augurs well for consumer demand. In the December quarter, HUL registered higher revenues in all its four main segments, namely personal care, home care, refreshments and foods.
9. Government scraps Haj subsidy before time
In 2012, a Supreme Court order asked the government to phase out in 10 years the so-called subsidy for Haj pilgrims. Six years on, the government has done so. The Haj subsidy was being given to Muslim pilgrims going on Haj—an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca, in Saudi Arabia—and took the form of discounted airfares on state-run airline Air India. This subsidy, given to Air India for operations of Haj charters, has been on a downward trend since 2012-13.
10. Retail inflation in December at 17-month high
India’s retail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased to 5.2% in December, from 4.9% in November. Its December reading, a 17-month high, was also above the central bank’s medium-term inflation target of 4% for the second consecutive month. The increase was mainly due to a rise in the prices of food, fuel and housing. Meanwhile, wholesale prices, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI), eased to 3.6% in December, against 3.9% in November, as food prices grew at a slower rate. Economists say this could trickle down to the retail level, and pull down the CPI.

553,2018-01-22,Airtel,"Fitch Ratings has called the current low telecom tariffs as 'unsustainable' and expects them to rise in 2018, as Reliance Jio switches gear from gaining customers to making returns from its investments

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd’s weak earnings may have marked a low point for Indian telecom firms, but some bit of pressure could lift this year as Reliance Jio-triggered market competition starts to ease, according to Fitch Ratings. 
New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd’s weak earnings may have marked a low point for Indian telecom firms, but some bit of pressure could lift this year as Reliance Jio-triggered market competition starts to ease, according to Fitch Ratings.
The statement comes after Airtel last week posted over 39% fall in consolidated net profit to about Rs306 crore for the third quarter ended 31 December 2017. Fitch termed the current low industry tariffs as “unsustainable"" and said it expects them to rise in 2018, as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd switches gear from gaining customers to making reasonable returns on its investments in the sector.
“Bharti Airtel’s rating headroom will narrow due to lower cash generation and high capex requirements in the financial year ending March 2018 (FY18),"" Fitch Ratings said in a statement. That said, Fitch pointed out that pressure on Bharti and other incumbent Indian telcos “should begin to fade this year"" as the competition triggered by Reliance Jio’s 2016 market entry begins to ease.
It noted that Bharti is committed to maintaining an investment-grade rating and intends to sell a larger stake in its telecom tower arm, Bharti Infratel Ltd, in FY19. In the last one year, it has sold 18.5% in Bharti Infratel for about $1.9 billion.
“We forecast annual negative free cash flow $600 million-$800 million during FY18-19, as Bharti’s cash flow from operations will be insufficient to fund large capex requirements,"" Fitch said.
Stating that the company has raised its capex guidance to bolster its 4G network, Fitch said that the proposal to allow telecom firms more time to pay for the spectrum they bought in auctions would “only partially ease cash flow pressures"".
Fitch predicts that Airtel’s revenue and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation will “rebound"" in FY19 driven by a likely improvement in the blended average revenue per user in the Indian mobile sector as data usage and tariffs rise.
Fitch said that the outlook for the Indian telecom sector is “improving"" and that the results in just-concluded quarter could have been the a low point for Bharti and other established players.
“We revised the sector outlook to stable in 2018 from negative in 2017, as we expect competition to ease now that industry consolidation is all but completed,"" it said. The industry revenue growth is likely to be in the mid- single-digits, after a decline in 2017."

Shares of Indian telecom service providers fell on Wednesday after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd cut tariffs to counter bigger rival Bharti Airtel Ltd’s revision in data plans. 
Shares of Indian telecom service providers fell on Wednesday after Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd cut tariffs to counter bigger rival Bharti Airtel Ltd’s revision in data plans.
Jio, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, said on Tuesday the revision was “a response to Airtel’s tariff changes"", which would help it maintain “its price leadership"".
Bharti Airtel, India’s No.1 mobile carrier, revised its data plans earlier this week. Airtel shares declined as much as 6.22% to Rs461.5 on Wednesday, their lowest since 18 October 2017.
Idea Cellular Ltd, India’s third-biggest telecom network operator, dropped as much as 5.7% to its lowest since 18 December 2017 ahead of its quarterly results later in the day.
Debt-ridden Reliance Communications Ltd slipped as much as 2.2%.
Reliance Jio entered India’s highly-competitive telecom market in late 2016 and disrupted the space with free-voice and cut-price data plans, forcing rivals to match its tariffs and dragging their margins lower."

New Delhi: The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has moved the Supreme Court, challenging an order of the Bombay high court setting aside a probe against Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The matter will come up for hearing before a bench headed by justice Rohinton F. Nariman on Thursday.
On 21 September, the Bombay high court had ruled that the CCI had no jurisdiction to interpret contract conditions or policies of the telecom sector, which was governed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Act, 1997.
The order was passed on a plea by Idea, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking quashing of the CCI order directing an investigation into allegations of cartelisation made by Reliance Jio.
Reliance Jio had questioned the jurisdiction of the Bombay high court and said the case must be heard by the Delhi high court since the CCI order was passed in Delhi. This was rejected by the court.

Among the telecom companies that have survived the relentless onslaught of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd is the most precariously placed. Its pre-tax loss rose to 32% of revenue in the December quarter, and its Ebitda of Rs1,223 crore was barely enough to take care of financing costs (Rs1,149 crore). 
Among the telecom companies that have survived the relentless onslaught of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd is the most precariously placed. Its pre-tax loss rose to 32% of revenue in the December quarter, and its Ebitda of Rs1,223 crore was barely enough to take care of financing costs (Rs1,149 crore).
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. 
So it wasn’t entirely surprising when Idea Cellular’s management suggested on a call with analysts that it wants nothing to do with the latest downward tariff revisions. “We do not want to be a price warrior,"" Himanshu Kapania, managing director of Idea, said on the call. 
Explaining its latest tariff revisions, Jio said last week that if competitors matched its tariffs, it would give its customers 20% more value. Some incumbents had tried to match the company’s tariffs in the December quarter. 
A moot question is what happens if incumbents keep trying to match Jio’s tariffs. Almost as if he were addressing the question, Kapania said on the call, “We will keep a reasonable distance...we will be competitive, but we will not be a discount warrior."" 
Idea may have raised the white flag, but it’s another matter if this will help. The big boys, Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd, need to call a truce. 
Meanwhile, relatively smaller companies such as Idea are caught between the proverbial devil and the deep sea. 
If they cut tariffs, it will lead to Arpu (average revenue per user) erosion and impact profitability further. If they don’t match prevailing tariffs, there can be subscriber and revenue loss, which will again result in profit erosion. 
In short, it’s clearly premature to call the December quarter as a bottom. Apart from the impact of Jio’s latest price revisions, incumbents will also be hit by a reduction in international termination rates. 
Idea’s only hope is that things reverse quickly on the tariff front. “We believe this is a minor aberration and should correct itself in a short period of time,"" Kapania said on the call. 
But it’s far more important what Jio thinks. “Investors believe Jio can out-invest its competition, expand the lead on data capacity and leverage its position to drive revenue-share,"" analysts at Deutsche Bank said in a 24 January note to clients. 
Jio spent Rs7,000 crore in capital expenditure in the December quarter alone, which amounts to Idea’s annual capex. 
Thus far, absorbing high levels of cash burn has been part of Jio’s strategy, and there seems to be no end in sight to this strategy. 
In fact, some analysts are wondering what exactly is driving Jio’s pricing strategy, considering that it is now the market leader in the mobile broadband category. Every pricing change in bundled voice and data plans impacts it the most. Whatever Jio’s motivation, the fact remains that highly leveraged companies such as Idea will be the worst hit by the tariff war. 
The company’s merger agreement with Vodafone India Ltd includes a clause that each company can only bring a reasonable pre-agreed level of debt (or a maximum leverage ratio, to be precise) into the merged company. 
With profits eroding at a fast clip, leverage ratios have gone haywire, and it remains to be seen how the two companies tackle this dilemma. 
Against this backdrop, it’s little wonder Idea is desperate for peace and wants the price war to end."

Mumbai: Less than a week after Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched a Rs49 monthly pack for existing subscribers, equity analysts tracking telecom companies say the ensuing price wars have made it impossible to fairly value firms in their coverage. 
In a note dated 25 January, Kotak Institutional Equities said Jio’s “relentless aggression"" has left analysts with no fair basis on which to value stocks of telecom operators including Bharti Airtel Ltd – India’s largest telecom firm – and Idea Cellular Ltd – which is merging with rival Vodafone Plc.’s India arm. Kotak has dropped its rating on the Airtel stock. 
“At the core of all of the above is the biggest qualitative aspect we have no way of forming a view on, anymore – what does Jio want?,"" Kotak said in the note. “Even as the company’s actions thus far are suggestive of a drive to domination and willingness to be as aggressive as it takes to get there, our challenge is to figure out what level of domination Jio is seeking to achieve. All of this makes Bharti’s fair valuation a more-than-tricky exercise,"" it said. 
Kotak has revised revenue estimates for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Bharti Infratel Ltd, the telecom tower arm of the operator, predicting a drop in revenues of both firms between FY18 and FY19 year on year. 
This comes at a time when Jio is also rolling out 4G data at aggressive prices, undercutting competition in a bid to attract a larger subscriber base. 
“We wonder if the incumbents should seriously consider shutting down their 2G and 3G networks ahead of their current plans,"" the note said. “The ultra-expensive 900 MHz spectrum that the incumbents are using for 2G in several circles would fail the impairment test as 2G spectrum, in our view. This move would, of course, need the incumbents to roll out VoLTE (Voice Over LTE) on a war footing. Even if they don’t, we wonder if there is an economic case to keep the 2G networks running if the JioPhone sees even modest success. The MTR cut has anyway killed the incoming ARPU leg of the 2G network economics.""
This is not the first time that analysts have flagged off the spectre of price wars on the earnings of India’s telecom operators. In a note dated 24 January, equities brokerage firm Nomura said it was putting estimates of Bharti Airtel’s earnings under review, saying the firm’s ARPUs (average revenue per user) is already slipping back to levels seen before October 2017, before the industry took a round of price hikes. Airtel’s new data packs lower the company’s ARPU by nearly 29%, as per Nomura’s note. “Subpar 3QFY18 financials/metrics of the India mobile business and the mobile tariff revisions in January pose a risk to our forecast earnings for Bharti,"" the note said. 
“BHIN (Bharti Infratel Limited) 3QFY18 is expected to be weak with tenancy losses from Rcom’s wireless business exit and shutdown of operations by Aircel in six circles,"" equities brokerage firm HDFC Securities said in a note dated 8 Jan. “Further, as Voda-Idea merge their operations, their overlapping tenancies would get accounted as loading (6-8% rental/tenant) instead of separate tenancies. A potential reduction of 60-65k tenancies is likely from the merged entities. These could impact BHIN’s EBITDA (Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortization) by ~15% and EPS (earnings per share) by 25%,"" it said. 
“We expect EBITDA to decline further and likely bottom-out in 4Q (quarter ending March 2018),"" said equities brokerage firm JM Financial in a note dated 24 January. “We anticipate a 7-8% cut in our FY18 EBITDA forecast, and expect Idea stock to remain range-bound, because of renewed aggression by Jio (and Bharti). The promoters (AB Group, Voda Plc) may need to ‘signal’ greater commitment in our view, to pre-empt Jio/Bharti from pushing the industry into a war of attrition,"" the note said."

Lagos: India’s largest telecoms operator, Bharti Airtel does not see much value in buying debt-laden Nigerian rival 9mobile and withdrew from submitting a firm bid before the deadline, two industry sources with knowledge of the deal told Reuters.
Barclays Africa is examining takeover bids from prospective buyers for 9mobile. However, a deal may take a few months as it will involve restructuring 9mobile’s debt after a default last year. Airtel had expressed an interest to acquire the Nigerian firm as part of plans to consolidate its position in Africa’s biggest telecoms market, but it declined to submit a financial bid before a 16 January deadline.
“Airtel is not interested in 9mobile because it sees little value in the company,"" one source said.
Another source said the Indian company did not have sufficient information to make an informed bid but added that privately-held Nigerian telecoms firm Globacom had submitted a financial bid.
No-one at Bharti Airtel in Nigeria or India was immediately available to comment. Bharti Airtel, headed by Indian billionaire Sunil Mittal, last year reported a 30.8% fall in first-quarter net profit, blaming an adverse foreign exchange impact in Nigeria. 
Previously known as Etisalat Nigeria, 9mobile took out a $1.2 billion syndicated loan from a group of 13 local banks in 2013 but struggled to make repayments last year, forcing its lenders to step in. The central bank then intervened to stop creditors from putting it into receivership, leading to a change in its board and management, as well as its new company name.
The crisis forced parent company Etisalat to terminate its management agreement with the Nigerian business and surrender its 45% stake to a trustee after the central bank intervention.
Since the debt problems came to light, 9mobile, the country’s fourth-biggest operator, has rapidly lost subscribers. In October its users numbered 17.1 million, giving it a 12.2% market share, down from 20 million earlier last year, Nigerian telecoms regulator said. Reuters"

India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd has urged the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to start fresh consultations to bring out rules that will define whether a particular tariff is non-discriminatory, non-predatory and compliant with the principles of interconnect usage charge (IUC). 
India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd has urged the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to start fresh consultations to bring out rules that will define whether a particular tariff is non-discriminatory, non-predatory and compliant with the principles of interconnect usage charge (IUC).
In a letter dated 8 February, Airtel has sought fresh consultations after a recent ruling by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) directed the regulator to issue clear guidelines for performing self-checks for consistency with principles of IUC-compliance. 
The tribunal had on 1 February also directed Trai to issue rules that can be applied “for ascertaining consistency with principles of non-predation"".
“...the above issues and pricing norms, in respect of which the Hon’ble TDSAT has directed Trai to issue necessary guidelines, have neither been dealt with in any past consultation paper nor have the same been discussed in a open house discussion,"" Airtel said in its letter. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
These issues are critical, Airtel said, adding that Trai should issue a fresh consultation paper to seek inputs and hold an open house discussion before finalizing and issuing any rules.
Trai chairman R.S. Sharma declined to comment.
The controversy had erupted when Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which entered the telecom sector in September 2016, announced a ‘welcome offer’ giving free voice and data for three months starting 5 September 2016. 
Jio on 1 December 2016 announced extension of these free services till 31 March 2017 under its ‘happy new year’ offer.
Incumbent operators had then contended that existing regulations stated that any promotional offer by a telecom operator must be limited to 90 days. Idea Cellular and Bharti Airtel had, over a year ago, moved TDSAT against Trai and Reliance Jio on the extension of free services by the latter.
During that time, Reliance Jio had written to the regulator contesting the view of its rivals and had said that its free data offer was not predatory as the firm was not a significant market player in the cellular mobile services category.
Moreover, Reliance Jio had also told Trai that the second offer could in no way be construed as an extension of the first as current regulations consider two plans to be distinct even if there is only a minor difference in terms and conditions. The ‘welcome offer’ was a fully free offer, whereas the ‘happy new year’ offer had a different data limit with the option of paying to avail of a higher speed after exhaustion of the said limit, it had contended.
While Trai had then ruled that Reliance Jio’s plans were not violative of current norms, it faced a backlash from rival operators and subsequently issued a consultation paper on Regulatory Principles of Tariff Assessment in February 2017, through which it had sought views on the matter, including which tariff offers should qualify as promotional offers and what should be the features of such an offer. 
The paper had also sought inputs on the criteria for determination of dominance of an operator in a relevant market and processes for Trai to assess predatory pricing by an operator in the relevant market. The regulator had held an open house discussion on the matter on 30 May 2017.
While TDSAT, in its 31-page order on 1 February, upheld Trai’s decision and ruled that Reliance Jio’s ‘welcome offer’ and ‘happy new year’ offers were IUC-compliant, non-discriminatory and non-predatory, the tribunal had also said that under the current regulatory regime there was no specified period to measure IUC compliance.
“...if such offers continue in some form or the other for a longer period, open-ended provision may make every tariff justifiable, thereby making this provision itself irrelevant. Open-ended provisions also make the verification of IUC-compliance difficult, if not impossible. We therefore direct Trai to issue clear guidelines/benchmarks/methodology for performing self-check for consistency with the principles of IUC compliance,"" TDSAT had said in the order.
IUC consistency of tariffs implies that the operator should be able to meet IUC expenses on a weighted average basis. Reliance Jio had argued that since its tariff comprised of voice and data services, it will be able to recoup the IUC expenses in a short period after the promotional offers.
IUC is what an operator pays another to land calls on the latter’s network.
TDSAT had also observed that the ‘all services free’ offer was an extreme form of below-cost tariff and therefore rigorous tests must be applied for regulatory compliance. “Till Trai issues the required guidelines, we further direct that no ‘all services free’ offer in any manner will be launched by (Reliance) Jio or any other similarly placed telecom service provider without making written submissions to Trai for self-check for consistency with regulatory principles of non-predation,"" the order said.
The Trai chairman had said in an interview on 4 January that the regulator would soon issue rules that will define whether a tariff announced by an operator is transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory."

544,2018-02-15,Airtel,"An Airtel Africa IPO will monetize telecom firm's operations in the continent, at a time when it is engaged in a bruising battle with Reliance Jio in India

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd on Wednesday said the unit managing its Africa operations is considering a potential initial public offering (IPO). 
New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel Ltd on Wednesday said the unit managing its Africa operations is considering a potential initial public offering (IPO).
In a stock exchange filing, Bharti Airtel said the board of Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV has authorized the management to begin non-binding exploratory discussions with banks and intermediaries to evaluate the possibility of a public listing.
“The above discussions are at an exploratory/preliminary stage and at this juncture, there is no certainty of any final decision or outcome,"" the company added.
Analysts believe an IPO will monetize Bharti Airtel’s Africa operations, at a time when it is engaged in a bruising battle with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in India.
The company, which is locked in a price war since the launch of Reliance Jio in September 2016, was hit hard when the telecom regulator in September decided to slash interconnection usage charges levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. As a result, Bharti Airtel’s quarterly profit plunged 39% to Rs306 crore in the December quarter.
While revenues from India operations fell 11.3% year on year to Rs15,294 crore, the performance of its Africa unit saved some blushes. In constant currency terms, Africa revenues grew by 5.3% year-on-year to $783 million during the quarter compared with $744 million a year ago. This was largely led by strong growth in data and Airtel money transaction value.
“They have made Africa business profitable; so, the (company’s) plan is to get value out of it. In most markets in Africa, they are either number one or number two, so the valuation of Africa business will be attractive,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said on the condition of anonymity.
The company’s aggregate customer base in Africa too increased from 84.1 million as of December end from 76.9 million in the corresponding quarter last year, an increase of 9.4%. It offers 3G services and Airtel Money across 14 countries in Africa and 4G services in four countries in the continent.
“With sustained competitive pressure from Jio, Bharti Airtel’s EBITDA is expected to see further decline for the next few quarters. If their net debt to EBITDA ratio goes beyond three times, it could risk the chance of a rating downgrade. The valuation of Africa business may insulate the company from a potential rating downgrade,"" the analyst cited above said.
Bharti Airtel entered Africa in 2010 when it purchased Zain’s operations in the continent for $10.7 billion. Over the past few years, it has been trying to capture the African market through local deals. It has made three small-ticket acquisitions in Uganda, Congo Brazzaville and Kenya.
In October, Airtel inked a deal with Millicom, which operates the brand Tigo, to combine their operations in Ghana. After this deal, in December, Airtel’s subsidiary in Rwanda announced the acquisition of Tigo Rwanda Ltd, making Airtel the second largest telecom firm in that country.
“Airtel has taken proactive steps in Africa to consolidate and realign the market structure in the last few remaining countries where its operations are lagging on account of lower market share and presence of too many operators,"" Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said in a statement on 19 December.
“We are also committed to the long-term viability of our operations in Kenya and Tanzania, to ensure that in 2018, all our 15 operations in Africa start contributing positive margins and cash flows towards a healthy and profitable Airtel Africa,"" Mittal had said then.
In India too, the company is taking steps to reduce debt. On 5 February, the company announced that Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) will indirectly raise its stake in Bharti Airtel by investing Rs2,649 crore in Bharti Telecom Ltd, the promoter company of Airtel, through a preferential allotment of shares. The money will be used to reduce debt.
Bharti announced in December that it, along with another group entity, will sell a combined 20% in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia Ltd to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million."
542,2018-02-16,Airtel,"The growth in telecom subscriber base was led by the mobile segment,with net additions of 4.97 million customers by Reliance Jio, Idea Cellular, Vodafone, Airtel and BSNL during the month

New Delhi: Telecom subscriber base in India reached 1.19 billion at the end of December 2017 with Reliance Jio adding over 8 million new customers alone during the month, according to data published by telecom regulator Trai. 
New Delhi: Telecom subscriber base in India reached 1.19 billion at the end of December 2017 with Reliance Jio adding over 8 million new customers alone during the month, according to data published by telecom regulator Trai.
“The number of telephone subscribers in India increased from 1,185.88 million at the end of November 2017 to 1,190.67 million at the end of December 2017, thereby showing a monthly growth rate of 0.4%,"" Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said in a monthly subscribers’ report.
The growth was led by the mobile telephony segment with net additions of 4.97 million customers by five telecom operators Reliance Jio, Idea Cellular, Vodafone, Bharti Airtel and BSNL during the month. Reliance Jio led the growth in mobile segment by adding over 8 million new customers—three fold more than it closest competitor Idea which added 2.43 million subscribers in the reported month. 
Idea was followed by Vodafone which added 1.5 million new mobile subscribers, Airtel 576,575 and BSNL added 421,836 subscribers. Telecom operator Aircel lost over 2.65 million customers, Reliance Communications (RCom) 2.3 million, Telenor 1.71 million, Tata Teleservices 1.3 million and MTNL lost 6,561 mobile customers.
Despite closure of mobile services, RCom was left with over 33.16 million customers.
Trai has asked RCom to refund unspent money of customers who have not been able to port their number or exhaust their balance. 
The subscriber base in wireline segment declined to 23.23 million at the end of December from 23.41 million at the end of November 2017. BSNL, which dominates the market with 53.5% market share, lost 127,842 fixed line customers while private operators Tata Teleservices added 8,294 new connections, Vodafone added 7,625 and Bharti Airtel added 5,995 new fixed-line customers in December.
The number of broadband subscribers increased to 362.87 million at the end of December from 350.7 million in November. “Top five service providers constituted 93.8% market share of the total broadband subscribers at the end of December 2017. These service providers were Reliance Jio Infocom Ltd (160.09 million), Bharti Airtel (71.09 million), Vodafone (52.44 million), Idea Cellular (34.81 million) and BSNL (21.95 million),"" the report said. 
Mobile devices accounted for 344.57 million subscribers in December. The top-five wired broadband service providers in December were BSNL (9.38 million), Bharti Airtel (2.15 million), Atria Convergence Technologies (1.28 million), MTNL (0.91 million) and Hathway Cable & Datacom (0.73 million). The overall tele-density in India increased to 91.90 at the end of December from 91.61 at the end of November 2017."
541,2018-02-20,Airtel,"Trai's latest order on tariff rules has given a green signal to Reliance Jio to continue with its promotional offers, but it will now face strengthened competitors in Airtel and the Vodafone-Idea combine

New Delhi: In the past 18 months, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has triggered a bloody consolidation in the telecom sector, forcing incumbents to either match Reliance Jio’s offers or exit the market completely.  
New Delhi: In the past 18 months, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has triggered a bloody consolidation in the telecom sector, forcing incumbents to either match Reliance Jio’s offers or exit the market completely. 
Among the last ones to exit the market will be Aircel Ltd, which, according to a report in The Economic Times, plans to file for bankruptcy at the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
Reliance Jio’s entry strategy has already worked for Mukesh Ambani, with the latest data made available by the telecom regulator showing that its market share has doubled to 13.71% by December end 2017, from 6.40% a year ago.
Trai’s latest order on tariff rules has given the green signal to Reliance Jio to continue with its promotional offers. But experts say Reliance Jio will now face strengthened competitors in Bharti Airtel Ltd and the Vodafone-Idea combine. 
“Earlier, subscriber additions were equated with the success of the business. Now with consolidation almost over and with the three top players reaching a sizeable market share, the focus now must shift to retaining customers and how to ensure growth,"" said Amresh Nandan, research director at Gartner.
Significantly, Airtel, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India have retained their respective market shares, which implies that Reliance Jio has grown partly at the cost of these smaller players and largely by grabbing a chunk of the new subscriber additions to the overall base.
As of 31 December 2017, Airtel had 24.85% of subscriber market share, Vodafone had 18.2%, Idea had 16.83% and Reliance Jio had 13.71%.
“Operators now cannot rely on selling packets of data to individual consumers and will need to focus on ‘solution sales’ for enterprise businesses, apart from looking at 5G use cases—smart city applications such as traffic management, waste management, apart from telemedicine, etc.,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of COAI.
With the advent of these new offerings, what could also work to Reliance Jio’s advantage is that it is the newest entrant in the sector.
“Networks that were earlier designed to offer primarily voice and data need to be transformed to offer these new products. To that extent, Reliance Jio, with a greenfield network, has an advantage over other operators who need to focus on cost effectiveness, put in investment in infrastructure and be willing to take a hit on Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in the short run to win the long-term battle,"" Nandan said.
This advantage would, however, be short-lived, with incumbent operators such as Airtel looking to monetize their assets, while the Idea-Vodafone combine gets ready to benefit from cost synergies once the merger is completed. Bharti Airtel is already considering a potential initial public offering for its Africa unit.
“A new incumbent always has an edge. But how long can this advantage be sustained? It will quickly be replicated by incumbents. Airtel, Idea and Vodafone, they all are catching up very quickly in the 4G rollouts,"" Mathews said.
What is, however, clear from the recent tariff changes in the past two months is that Reliance Jio will lead other operators in offering cheap tariffs. RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said in February last year that Reliance Jio would monitor all publicly announced plans from all operators and not only match the highest selling tariffs but also provide 20% more data in each of these plans.
“Reliance Jio has 160 million subscribers today. Its internal target is 500 million. The price war will continue till Reliance Jio gets at least 35% market share. Also, with the latest Trai order on tariff assessment, the regulator has given a green signal to Reliance Jio to go ahead with its aggressive pricing,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said on condition of anonymity.
Trai, in an order issued on 16 February, said there was no need to place restrictions on the number of promotional offers from telecom firms as long as they were transparent, non-predatory and non-discriminatory.
“We expect it (Reliance Jio) to continue with brutal pricing and incumbents to match it,"" the analyst cited above said."
540,2018-02-21,Airtel,"Airtel, in its reply to a challenge by CCI to setting aside a probe, says a dispute between two telecom service providers would fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the two telecom bodiesTrai and TDSAT

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd opposed a challenge by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to setting aside of a probe against telcos on allegations of cartelisation and termed it as being “misconceived and frivolous"". 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd opposed a challenge by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to setting aside of a probe against telcos on allegations of cartelisation and termed it as being “misconceived and frivolous"".
The telecom major, in its reply said that a dispute between two telecom service providers would fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the two telecom bodies—Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the CCI.
It further claimed that Reliance Jio had made unreasonable demands from other telecom companies regarding points of interconnection (PoI) and wrongly utilized the test phase by offering free services by which it was able to obtain a large number of customers even before its commercial launch, an issue that should be dealt with by the expert sectoral regulator, Trai and its appellate body.
Airtel was responding to a challenge by CCI to setting aside a probe on allegations of cartelisation. The Supreme Court has not granted an interim stay on the probe order and is hearing the case on merits.
CCI had moved the apex court on 24 January in appeal against an order of the Bombay HC setting aside a probe against the three telecom companies on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
On 21 September, the Bombay HC had ruled that the CCI had no jurisdiction to interpret contract conditions or policies of the telecom sector, which was governed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Act, 1997.
The order was passed on a plea by Idea, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking quashing of the CCI order directing an investigation into allegations of cartelisation made by Reliance Jio.
Reliance Jio had questioned the jurisdiction of the Bombay HC and said the case must be heard by the Delhi HC since the CCI order was passed in Delhi. This was rejected by the court."
539,2018-02-21,Airtel,"RBI has directed payments banks to get their KYC information verified by third parties, in a blow to Airtel Payments Bank that uses Airtel's telecom business to authenticate customers

Mumbai/New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday directed payments banks to get their customers’ information verified by third parties, in a blow to Bharti Airtel Ltd which runs a payments bank with customer data verified by its own telecom business. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday directed payments banks to get their customers’ information verified by third parties, in a blow to Bharti Airtel Ltd which runs a payments bank with customer data verified by its own telecom business.
An RBI letter sent to chief executive officers of payments banks said “reliance on KYC (know-your-customer) done by telecom companies is not permissible"". Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
The third party has to be regulated, supervised, monitored and should have steps in place for compliance with customer due diligence and record-keeping requirements, in line with the requirements of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, RBI said.
The letter also said payments banks must comply with RBI Master Direction on KYC, which is amended time to time, for all its customers, “including existing customers of telecom companies onboarded by the PB"".
The move comes after Airtel was penalized by UIDAI for allegedly opening payments bank accounts without the explicit consent of users. Both Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank were barred from conducting Aadhaar-based SIM verification of mobile customers using eKYC process as well as e-KYC of payments bank clients, following allegations that Bharti Airtel was using the Aadhaar-eKYC based SIM verification process to open payments bank accounts of its subscribers without their ‘informed consent’. Following this, Airtel Payments Bank CEO Shashi Arora had resigned.
Until now, telcos such as Airtel had an edge over payments banks from India Post and Paytm, as the old norms allowed KYC done for mobile connections to be extended to opening bank accounts. This allowed telecom operators with payments bank licences to provide bank accounts to all of their existing telco customers with minimum effort and no extra cost. However, the latest direction puts all payments firms on par and could prove to be costly for telcos.
According to industry estimates, currently, KYC could cost companies $1-2 per customer. Mint could not immediately ascertain the financial impact of this move on the companies.
An email sent to Airtel remained unanswered.
“This is going to be an additional operational and cost burden for the telcos,"" said Vivek Belgavi, partner (India Fintech Business) at PwC India. While this could be a setback, it is still not late for the telcos to start afresh, Belgavi said. He also added that this could be an opportunity for a third party service providers to emerge.

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Monday said it has joined a new global collaboration to bring high-speed and uninterrupted in-flight data connectivity to mobile customers.  
New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Monday said it has joined a new global collaboration to bring high-speed and uninterrupted in-flight data connectivity to mobile customers. 
The global partnership Seamless Alliance, whose other founding members include OneWeb, Airbus, Delta and Sprint, will work towards leveraging satellite technology to offer high-speed data connectivity to mobile users even when they are up in the air, an Airtel statement said. 
“Airtel has joined the Seamless Alliance which will usher in a new era of open innovation for mobile operators and airlines by empowering mobile operators to extend their services into airline cabins,"" the statement added. 
The global initiative, announced on Monday in Barcelona, will also look at bringing into its fold other industry operators beyond the five founding members. Together, these members hope to “eliminate the immense costs and hurdles commonly associated with acquisition, installation, and operation of data access infrastructure"". 
This will be done by streamlining system integration and certification, providing open specifications for interoperability, increasing accessibility for passengers, and enabling simple and integrated billing, the statement added. “We are delighted to be a founding member of this innovative technology platform to bring seamless connectivity to customers in the true sense,"" Gopal Vittal, chief executive officer (India & South Asia), Bharti Airtel, said. 
Over 370 million mobile customers across Airtel’s global network will be able to enjoy uninterrupted access to high-speed data services even while they are in-flight, he added. Airtel is the third largest mobile operator in the world with operations in 16 countries across Asia and Africa. “We look forward to collaborating with all partner members to ensure this platform goes Live at the earliest,"" Vittal said."
537,2018-02-27,Airtel,"Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone are free to match Reliance Jio tariffs in circles where they have a dominant position, and such actions will not be seen as predatory pricing, says Trai

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd are free to match tariffs offered by newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in circles where they have a dominant position and such actions will not be seen as predatory, two officials at the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd are free to match tariffs offered by newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in circles where they have a dominant position and such actions will not be seen as predatory, two officials at the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said.
Trai’s view clears the air on what constitutes predatory pricing. The issue has deepened cracks within the industry, with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio on one side and the rest on the other. Operators on both sides have sparred publicly on issues ranging from points of interconnect to interconnect usage charges since September 2016, when Reliance Jio started commercial services.
“For example, if Airtel is a significant market player in a circle then its actions have to be watched. If Jio comes with an aggressive tariff in that circle then customers will flock to Jio. Any rational service provider will try to match it. The mere act of matching the Jio price cannot be considered predatory because it is reactive,"" one of the two Trai officials cited earlier said, requesting anonymity. “But if you are doing it to drive out competition then it is predatory.""
Trai issued new norms on 16 February under which it will examine tariffs of a significant market player (SMP)—which is an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market—to determine the existence of predatory pricing. It will also look at whether the tariff is below the firm’s average variable cost over a certain period. If the tariff is found predatory, an operator will be liable to pay a penalty of up to Rs50 lakh per tariff plan per telecom circle. The definition of “total activity"" is based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue.
If you take subscriber base as the parameter, as of 31 December, market leader Bharti Airtel is an SMP in nine circles and the Vodafone-Idea combine is dominant in 12 circles, data compiled by BloombergQuint showed. If you consider gross revenue market share, then Airtel is an SMP in 15 circles and the Vodafone-Idea combined in 13 circles. There are 22 circles, or licence areas, in the country.
Incumbent operators say that the new order takes away the flexibility to compete and retain customers in a circle in which they are SMPs. However, the Trai order also mentions that it will look at evidence of a specific intent to engage in predatory pricing.
“The SMP is free to match a price as long as it can justify it to Trai, that is make a business case with the reasons for bringing down the price. Being an SMP and offering below average variable cost alone would not make your pricing predatory,"" said another official, requesting not to be named.
Incumbent operators also say that the change in Trai’s definition of “total activity"" will result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio, which enjoys huge traffic on its network. The new definition of “total activity"" is based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue—while an earlier definition included subscriber base, revenue, switching capacity and volume of traffic.
“These parameters were a part of Trai’s own criteria in the past. As a result, victims have now been made the perpetrators. In a cruel twist of fate, one operator, who by its own admission is the world’s largest data network, may be free to offer any sort of predatory tariffs, while older operators are now subject to regulation and cannot compete without falling foul of a new definition of what constitutes predatory pricing,"" Rajan S. Mathews, director general of lobby group COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India), said in a statement on 20 February.
But the regulator claims that the earlier definition was for the purposes of interconnect, while the new definition is for tariff principles. “Earlier definition needed switching capacity and volume of traffic (as parameters) because it was for interconnect...networks have to talk to each other through interconnect points and hence it has to follow some technical criteria. But, this (tariff) is different. Definition has to serve a purpose in a particular context. By taking revenue and subscribers, Trai has not committed anything,"" the first official cited above said.
Meanwhile, Vodafone on Monday termed Trai’s new rules as ‘unfair’, according to a PTI report from Barcelona, where the Mobile World Congress is taking place. When asked if he believes that the latest rule favours new players and if the company will challenge it, Vodafone Group CEO Vittorio Colao responded affirmatively.
COAI too, without naming Reliance Jio, said Trai’s recent orders, including the latest tariff order amendment, “seem to be strengthening the ambitions of one particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators"". Responding to this, Jio on 23 February sought a public apology from COAI and asked it to immediately cease and desist from publishing false and defamatory imputations against Reliance Jio.
Reacting to Reliance Jio’s statement, COAI on 24 February, said its differences were with the orders of Trai and not with any specific operator. But, in fresh salvo fired on Monday, Reliance Jio, in a letter to COAI dated 26 February, reiterated its demand for an apology against “defamatory statement"" and stated once again that it reserves rights to initiate appropriate proceedings in accordance with law. Mint has seen a copy of the letter."

Barcelona: Bharti Airtel Ltd is exploring merger and sale options for its telecom towers businesses as chairman Sunil Mittal seeks to get out of the infrastructure game and focus on connectivity.
Airtel, the world’s No.3 mobile operator by subscribers, also wants to float a minority stake in its African operations and sees the London Stock Exchange as a potentially attractive venue.
Mittal, briefing reporters at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on Wednesday, backed the lead set by telecom firms in the US, now being followed in Europe, for specialists to roll up and run telecom tower assets.
“Our position is very clear: towers are steel and concrete. They are not the domain of mobile companies,"" said the 60-year-old Mittal, whose family fortune Forbes magazine puts at $8.8 billion.
His move to shed non-core assets follows the blockbuster entry into the Indian market by Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that has forced rivals to merge, creating three big players in India’s telecom industry.
Indian operators, despite their strapped finances, will need to prepare for the launch of 5G services, and Mittal said he expected Bharti Airtel to continue to commit $3-$4 billion a year to capex.
India will roll out 5G “in step"" with other parts of the world, he said, with first use cases likely to be industry applications, and in fixed-line and machine-to-machine communication.

Bharti Airtel controls Bharti Infratel Ltd, and also owns 42% stake in Indus Towers Ltd, India’s largest mobile infrastructure company with nearly 123,000 towers.
Bharti Infratel said last October it was considering buying the rest of Indus Towers that is owned by competitors Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which are in the process of merging.
Mittal said he had a flexible approach to exiting the towers business, and had also received board approval to pursue the alternative of reducing Bharti’s stake in Infratel to below majority control.
“We have gone down from 100% to 53%. And our board has decided: if you want to go and sell, then sell,"" said Mittal, who also chairs the GSMA industry group that hosts the annual Barcelona gathering.
Committed to Africa
Bharti Airtel, present in 20 countries, said in mid-February that it was exploring an initial public offering (IPO) for Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V. (BAIN), the holding company that owns its African interests.
A listing, if it does happen, would only be of a minority stake, said Mittal: “It will remain a Bharti subsidiary. That means we are staying (in Africa).""
Vice-Chairman Akhil Gupta said London was a potentially good venue but that Bharti would rely on the advice of investment bankers, yet to be appointed for the deal, before making up its mind.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch has said BAIN could be valued at an enterprise value of $6.6 billion, or six times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda). Gupta said he was looking for a higher price.

New Delhi: The telecom tribunal on Monday gave three weeks to Trai to file its reply in a petition by Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular challenging the regulator’s latest order on predatory pricing but did not stay the contentious decision. 
Trai’s predatory pricing rules have sparked off a furore in the industry with the older and established telecom carriers as well as industry body COAI slamming the new norms. 
The Cellular Operators’ Association of India (COAI) has indicated that the regulation favours Reliance Jio, and that the order has distorted the market, placing all other operators at a “serious disadvantage"". 
Both Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and Jio have dubbed the allegations as baseless. In its petition to the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), Bharti Airtel said that the tariff order “virtually permits a telecom service provider who is an effective significant market player (SMPs) to indulge in predatory pricing to the severe detriment of the appellants and the other operators"". 
“Thus, if the impugned tariff order is not stayed then it will cause severe detriment to the appellants as it will have no means to meet the predatory pricing and consequent loss of subscribers and business by another TSP (telecom service provider),"" Airtel said seeking a stay on Trai’s latest order. 
Airtel further argued that not staying the order would also “hamper consumer interest as they will be deprived of discounts and offers"". 
Last month, Trai said it will impose financial disincentive of up to Rs50 lakh per circle on operators if their service rates are found to be predatory in nature. 
A tariff will be considered predatory if in a “relevant market"", a telecom operator with over 30% market share offers services at a price which is below the average “variable cost"", with a view to reduce competition or eliminate the competitors in the “relevant market"". 
Trai will arrive at “variable cost"" after deducting fixed cost and share of fixed overheads borne by the company from total cost of incurred by it for running business during the period under review. 
The regulator has also said that telecom operators will have to provide services to all subscribers availing the same tariff plan in a non-discriminatory manner. 
The rules drew flak from the established operators. Industry body COAI has flagged the revised definition of Significant Market Power (SMP) that now excludes parameters like traffic volume and switching capacity, and said such changes will place older operators at a disadvantage and stop them from responding to “what may be actual predatory tariff plans"". 
It has also contended that the recent regulation has also taken away flexibility from the operators to offer benefits to customers. Last week, Bharti chairman, Sunil Mittal had said that the operators had no choice but to move court against the regulator’s order, which restrains them from retaining customers and conducting business. 
During the hearing on Monday, the TDSAT did not offer any immediate relief to the incumbent operators in the matter, but asked regulator to file its reply in three weeks. The next date of hearing is 17 April."

New Delhi: Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Tuesday said it has acquired India leg of Gulf Bridge International submarine cable which will boost its data carrying capacity. 
New Delhi: Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Tuesday said it has acquired India leg of Gulf Bridge International submarine cable which will boost its data carrying capacity.
“Under the agreement, Airtel will acquire the ownership of the India leg of GBI’s India-Middle East-Europe submarine cable. Airtel will also pick up a significant capacity on Middle East-Europe leg of GBI’s cable system,"" Airtel said in a statement. 
Submarine cables are considered backbone of internet. Airtel and GBI have also agreed to formulate joint “go to market"" strategies and leverage the footprint of their respective global networks to serve global customers.
“With this, we are adding a large capacity to meet the growing data, content demand in markets like India as well as serve the connectivity needs of global carriers and enterprise customers. This will also complement Airtel’s existing global network spanning 250,000 Rkms with presence in 50 countries and contribute to our vision of serving customers with a future ready network,"" Ajay Chitkara, director and CEO for Global Voice and Data Business, Bharti Airtel said.
With this new investment Airtel now has large capacities—owned and leased — on multiple international submarine cable systems and offers the multiple number of connectivity routes between India and Europe.
GBI’s cable asset comes in addition to Airtel’s existing global network — IMEWE, EIG, SMW4 and MENA submarine cables. GBI is a multilayer terrestrial and subsea cable meshed network bridges the east to the west through the Middle East.
“We are committed to build a sustainable network in partnership with global leaders, with an ultimate goal to offer the best user experience to our partners and end-users. In line with this objective, today, we are excited to onboard Airtel and together deliver greater value to customers,"" Abdulla Al Rwaili, executive vice chairman and managing director, GBI said."

In an effort to ease out the debt-laden sector, the government has approved has eased spectrum-holding caps and extended payment period for spectrum acquired in auctions to 16 years from 10 years, according to Mint.
After Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry triggering a price war, business of telecom firms were under severe pressure with the sector heading to a consolidation phase. So far this year, BSE Telecom index has slipped 18.93% with Bharti Airtel losing 21.73% while Idea Cellular slipped 25.84% in 2018. However, BSE Telecom index had rallied 49.47% last year while Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular gained 73.37% and 45.85% respectively.
In a January 10 report, Harsh Jagnani, sector head and vice president, corporate ratings, ICRA Ltd said the industry is undergoing structural changes with consolidation being at the forefront and relaxing of the spectrum caps will ease the consolidation transactions which are in advanced stages
“The merging telecom companies would not have to surrender any spectrum where earlier they could have breached the cap limits. In addition, the additional spectrum that now remains with the telecom companies will allow for better service quality. Moreover, with growing data consumption, spectrum requirements would remain high and thus relaxing the spectrum cap is beneficial for the industry. Also the extension of time period for the payment of spectrum bought in auctions to 16 years from the current 10 years was earlier approved by the Commission which would ease the cash outflow towards auction payments,"" he added. The spectrum caps were set at a time when there were 7 to 12 operators in each circle.
The ongoing consolidation is expected to result in significant reduction in number of operators, according to the rating agency."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Thursday approved the proposed merger of Telenor India with Bharti Airtel. The bench approved the scheme with certain conditions.
Airtel and Telenor had signed the agreement for merger on February 2017 under which Airtel will acquire Telenor India’s running operations in seven circles — Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam.
The proposed acquisition has already been cleared by Competition Commission of India (CCI), the market regulator Sebi and stock exchanges BSE and NSE, and it is awaiting telecom department’s nod.
The deal will include transfer of all of Telenor India’s assets and customers and is aimed at augmenting Airtel’s overall customer base and network. It will also enable Airtel to bolster its spectrum footprint in these seven circles, with the addition of 43.4 MHz spectrum in the 1800 MHz band."

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs5 crore on Airtel Payments Bank for violating operating guidelines and know your customer (KYC) norms. 
The fine was imposed after RBI scrutinised the bank’s documents relating to opening of accounts without any specific or clear consent from the customers. “The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed, on March 7, 2018, a monetary penalty of  ₹ 50 million on Airtel Payments Bank Limited (the bank) for contravening the ‘Operating Guidelines for Payments Banks’ and directions issued by RBI on Know Your Customer (KYC) norms,"" the central bank said in a statement. 
Based on the complaints and adverse media reports alleging that the bank had opened customer accounts without a clear/specific consent of the customers, RBI conducted a supervisory visit to the bank from 20-22 November 2017. 
According to reports, more than 23 lakh customers had reportedly received as many as Rs47 crore in their Airtel bank accounts, which they did not know had been opened. The supervisory visit report and other relevant documents, revealed contravention of ‘operating guidelines for payments banks’ and the directions issued by RBI on KYC norms, RBI said. 
Subsequently, RBI issued a show cause notice to the bank on 15 January saying why penalty should not be imposed for non-compliance with guidelines and directions issued by the central bank. “After considering the bank’s reply and oral submissions made in the personal hearing, RBI came to the conclusion that the aforesaid charges of non-compliance with RBI guidelines/directions were substantiated and warranted imposition of monetary penalty,"" RBI said. 
It further said that the action was based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and was not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the bank with its customers. Airtel Payments Bank had commenced operations in January last year."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd plans to issue non-convertible debentures (NCDs) worth up to Rs3,000 crore on a private placement basis, the company said in an exchange filing late on Thursday.
For this, a meeting of the committee of directors is scheduled for 13 March, it said.
“The company is seeking approvals in the usual course of business. Any funds raised under such approvals, if granted, are to be used for routine treasury activities including refinancing of debt and spectrum liabilities,"" a spokesperson for Bharti Airtel said in a statement on 9 March.
This is expected to boost the company’s funding plans to take on competition from Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Firms in the debt-laden telecom sector witnessed a double whammy after the entry of Jio brought tariffs to rock-bottom levels and hit revenue streams of other operators.
In February, Airtel had said the unit managing its Africa operations is considering a potential initial public offering. It has also announced several measures to reduce debt to be in a stronger position to combat competition from Reliance Jio.
Airtel recently announced that Singapore Telecommunications Ltd will indirectly raise its stake in it by investing Rs2,649 crore in Bharti Telecom Ltd, the promoter firm, through a preferential allotment of shares. The money will be used to reduce debt.
In December, Airtel had said that it, along with another group entity, will sell a combined 20% in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia Ltd to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million.
Airtel last year also said it may sell a controlling stake in tower arm Bharti Infratel Ltd. Bharti Airtel and its wholly-owned arms own 53.51% in the tower firm at present.
Meanwhile, its rival Idea Cellular Ltd too raised funds to build a war chest for the battle in the telecom sector.
The promoters of Idea—Birla TMT, Elaine Investments, Oriana Investments—have already invested Rs3,250 crore to strengthen its balance sheet amid intense competition and before a planned merger with Vodafone India Ltd. Following this equity infusion by Idea’s promoters, their stake in India’s third largest telecom operator will rise to 47.2% from 42.4% now. Idea Cellular has also raised Rs3,500 crore by way of a qualified institutional placement, or QIP, last month.
On Friday, shares of Bharti Airtel rose 0.19%, or  ₹ .75, to  ₹ 401.95 apiece on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex fell 0.13%, or 44.43 points, to end the day at 33,307.14 points."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd on Monday said its board has approved a plan to raise as much as Rs16,500 crore by selling non-convertible debentures and foreign currency bonds to refinance borrowings and pay spectrum-related dues to the government.
“Subject to the approval of the shareholders and other requisite approvals, the board of directors in its meeting held today approved the issuance of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of up to Rs10,000 crore on a private placement basis in such tranches and at such rates as may be approved from time to time on cumulative basis along with all NCDs issued by the company; and issuance of foreign currency bonds up to a limit of $1 billion or equivalent in one or more tranches,"" the company said in a filing to stock exchanges. 
The country’s largest telecom operator has in the last one year announced several measures to trim debt and defend its business under an onslaught from newest entrant Reliance Jio. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company hit the revenue streams of rivals, first through free offerings and later through cut-price data tariffs.
Bharti Airtel’s net profit plunged 39% to Rs306 crore in the three months ended 31 December, as India’s telecom regulator more than halved interconnection usage charges, levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, and the pricing war triggered by Jio’s entry continued unabated.
According to a Mumbai-based analyst, the borrowing does not fundamentally change anything for Bharti Airtel, and the company is merely refinancing debt. “Nothing changes. Also, interest rates are rising overall; so, maybe they want to raise funds right now before cost of borrowing goes up further,"" this analyst said on the condition of anonymity. 
Bharti Airtel’s consolidated net debt also increased to Rs91,714 crore as of 31 December from Rs91,480 crore in the previous quarter. Its net debt excluding the deferred payment liabilities to the department of telecommunications and finance lease stood at Rs44,677 crore which implies that its spectrum related obligations to the telecom department stood close to Rs47,037 crore as of 31 December. The company has an immediate upcoming payment to make for bonds worth €1 billion (which it previously issued at 4% annual coupon rate) which are due to mature in 2018.
The company, which is already mulling an initial public offering for the African unit, has also taken several steps as part of its debt-reduction spree.

New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has pulled up Bharti Airtel Ltd for failing to comply with tariff reporting requirements by not informing it about certain segmented tariffs offered to consumers to retain them. 
New Delhi: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has pulled up Bharti Airtel Ltd for failing to comply with tariff reporting requirements by not informing it about certain segmented tariffs offered to consumers to retain them.
Trai has sought a reply from the telecom operator within 10 days.
In a letter dated 15 March, Trai has sought responses from Airtel to queries ranging from circle-wise launch date of these tariffs, criteria for classification of consumers availing these tariffs and whether these were reported to the regulator.
Trai has also asked Airtel to furnish circle-wise data of consumers who have opted for these tariff offers and the benefits that accrue to them. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
“The regulator had earlier written a letter to Airtel on 23 February regarding the same after it received complaints from operators and consumers about 20-odd segmented tariffs. Airtel tried to delay its reply and said other operators were also doing it (offering segmented tariffs). Now Trai has given them 10 days to reply,"" a person familiar with the matter said, requesting anonymity.
When contacted, Airtel confirmed that it has received the notice. “The matter is sub judice and pending in the TDSAT"", it said.
Operators are required to report any new tariffs to Trai within seven working days from the date of their implementation after conducting a self-check to ensure the tariffs are transparent, non-discriminatory and non-predatory.
Trai’s rules also restrict operators from offering segregated or segmented offers or plans to retain customers, by making sure that all tariffs are displayed on a company’s website
The new norms on pricing released by Trai on 16 February also state that in case of violation of tariff reporting requirements, an operator can be penalised Rs5,000 for every day of delay, subject to a maximum of Rs2 lakh.
Under the new tariff order, Trai said it will also examine tariffs of a significant market player (SMP)—which is an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market—to determine the existence of predatory pricing by looking at whether the tariff is below the firm’s average variable cost over a certain period, and whether the operator has an intent to drive out competition. If the tariff is found predatory, an operator will be liable to pay a penalty of up to Rs50 lakh per tariff plan per telecom circle.
Incumbent operators have alleged that the change in Trai’s definition of “total activity"" will result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which enjoys huge traffic on its network. The new definition of “total activity"" is based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue—while an earlier definition included subscriber base, revenue, switching capacity and volume of traffic.
“These parameters were a part of Trai’s own criteria in the past. As a result, victims have now been made the perpetrators. In a cruel twist of fate, one operator, who by its own admission is the world’s largest data network, may be free to offer any sort of predatory tariffs, while older operators are now subject to regulation and cannot compete without falling foul of a new definition of what constitutes predatory pricing,"" Rajan S. Mathews, director general of lobby group COAI (Cellular Operators Association of India), said in a statement on 20 February.
Incumbent operators Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular had on 5 March approached TDSAT for a stay on Trai’s new tariff order. The tribunal has refused to grant an interim stay and given Trai three weeks to file its reasons on why the new tariff order should not be stayed. TDSAT has also asked Airtel and Idea to file their replies two weeks after that. The next hearing is on 17 April."

Chennai: Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Friday claimed that more than 1.50 million customers from Aircel has joined its network taking the total to over 20 million customers in Tamil Nadu. 
So far Bharti Airtel has got the highest share of approximately 50% of all “port-ins"" from Aircel customers across the country, said Bharti-Airtel Hub chief executive officer (CEO), Tamil Nadu and Kerala, Manoj Murali in a statement in Chennai.
“It is gratifying to see more Aircel customers choosing Airtel as their trusted network. We welcome them to the Airtel family and assure them of best-in-class services,"" he said. He said the company deployed over 13,000 new mobile broadband sites across the Tamil Nadu. 
Airtel’s total number of sites in the state stands at 33,000 covering 95% of the population. Telecom major Vodafone recently said it received over 10 lakh Aircel customers and added that all its retail touch points were kept operational seven days a week to help consumes with their requirement. 
State-owned BSNL too joined adding Aircel customers saying it registered more than one lakh customers of Aircel opting its network. Recently, Aircel said it has filed for bankruptcy as the company has been facing troubled times in the highly financially stressed industry.

521,2018-03-23,Airtel,"That Airtel, Vodafone and Idea are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst just rubs salt into their wounds

The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well.  
The general impression is that the woes of Indian telecom companies are largely because of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s cut-throat pricing. While Reliance Jio’s pricing strategy has played a big role in dragging all incumbents to losses in the December 2017 quarter, these companies are being squeezed at the other end as well. 
Reliance Jio’s relentless aggression isn’t limited to its pricing strategy; there is no end in sight to its capacity for investments in the telecom sector.
Based on recent data presented in the Lower House of Parliament, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate that Reliance Jio has a 62% share of the combined data capacity of the country’s big four mobile companies. In other words, its capacity is about 1.6 times the capacity of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd combined. 
But according to an analyst at another institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio also carries about two times the data traffic these three companies manage between themselves. 
As such, Reliance Jio too needs to augment capacity to support growth, which it indeed is busy doing. The company has told analysts it will increase the number of base stations to around 200,000 in the next few quarters, or by about 25% from current levels. The above-mentioned analyst says that channel checks with suppliers suggest the count will go up to as high as 250,000 eventually.
What all of this means is that incumbents need to step up investments to keep up pace.
“Even as we do not think incumbents need to match Jio on data capacity anytime soon, we do believe they need to accelerate their efforts in closing the gap. This may mean elevated levels of capex for the next two-three years, in our view, posing upside risks to capex forecasts,"" Kotak’s analysts wrote in a note to clients.
This comes at a time when cash flows are drying up. Idea generated next to nothing in terms of cash last quarter, and that was before a series of tariff cuts by Reliance Jio in January. Needless to say, the increasing gap between cash flow and capital expenditure needs to be funded through other means.
So it isn’t surprising that all operators are busy with asset sales, equity/bond issuances or a combination of both. Airtel has periodically sold stakes in its tower infrastructure company and is even considering listing its Africa business to generate funds. Idea has diluted equity, while Reliance Jio is raising over $2 billion (Rs13,000 crore) in debt to fund capital expenditure.
From the looks of it, the need for funds will remain high, given where analysts’ estimates are with respect to capex needs. The fact that some telecom firms are being forced to raise funds at a time when their financials are at their worst and their stocks are beaten down just rubs salt into their wounds."
520,2018-03-26,Airtel,"Airtel Digital TV said Star TV is indulging in 'arm twisting' tactics and that it has been forced to take Star India's channels at a high cost ahead of the IPL

New Delhi: Ahead of the start of popular T20 league IPL, Star India is at loggerheads with DTH operators Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV over subscription fee hike, with the broadcaster threatening to disconnect its channels.  
New Delhi: Ahead of the start of popular T20 league IPL, Star India is at loggerheads with DTH operators Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV over subscription fee hike, with the broadcaster threatening to disconnect its channels. 
Star India, which has a bouquet of nearly 50 channels, in a campaign has asked Airtel Digital TV subscribers to switch to new DTH/operators in order to continue watching its channels. The broadcaster blamed the DTH operator for ‘misleading’ consumers and ‘unilaterally’ increasing the prices of its channels. 
In response, Airtel Digital TV said Star TV is indulging in ‘arm twisting’ tactics and is demanding “an unreasonable hike in rates"" and it has been forced to take Star’s channels at a high cost. “It is public knowledge that Star TV recently made a massive bid to acquire exclusive rights to a popular sporting event and is now left with no option but to arm-twist and extract sunk cost from DTH/Cable operators and advertisers,"" Airtel Digital TV said in a statement. 
Similarly, Dish TV India chairman and managing director Jawahar Goel told PTI, “Star has been asking for around 20-40 per cent increase in fees for its channels."" Moreover, he said, “They are also not disclosing on what channels will the IPL be telecast. It doesn’t make sense for any customer to subscribe ten Star channels to watch IPL."" 
When contacted, a Star India spokesperson declined to comment saying the company has made its position public through its social media handles. In a post on 23 March on its twitter handle, Star India said, “Attention Airtel Digital TV subscribers! Star has not increased channel tariffs. Airtel Digital TV is misleading you and unilaterally increasing the prices of Star channels. To continue watching high-quality Star entertainment switch to new DTH/Cable operator NOW. #MakeTheSwitch"".
Star India had issued public notices that its channels were likely to be disconnected from Airtel Digital TV, Dish TV and Videocon d2H (now merged with Dish) for non-signing of subscription agreement. In case of Airtel Digital TV, the broadcaster also cited non-payment of subscription fees and non-submission of subscriber reports as other reasons for such a step. 
Earlier this month the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal had asked operator Bharti Telemedia and Star India to negotiate and settle their dispute that led to discontinuation of Star channels on Airtel Digital. 
The DTH operator has, however, insisted that all the standard definition channels of Star would continue to be available to its customers as part of their existing packs. However, the high definition channels of Star would be as part of select packs and “Airtel Digital TV will only charge what Star TV is charging it, not a rupee more"".

519,2018-03-27,Airtel,"Reliance Jio generates far more data traffic on its network than Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular combined

Prima facie, telecom sector incumbents Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have done well to protect market share despite Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s relentless aggression. Subscription numbers released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) show that the Vodafone-Idea combine improved their share of active subscribers from 39% in March 2017 to 40.2% in January 2018. Airtel did even better, increasing its share by 470 basis points to 30.9%. 
Prima facie, telecom sector incumbents Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd have done well to protect market share despite Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s relentless aggression. Subscription numbers released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) show that the Vodafone-Idea combine improved their share of active subscribers from 39% in March 2017 to 40.2% in January 2018. Airtel did even better, increasing its share by 470 basis points to 30.9%.
Reliance Jio increased its share by 580 basis points, which, of course, represents a much faster growth, given its low base. Its share in March stood at 7.8%. Each of these large companies gained at the expense of smaller firms.
One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
But holding on to subscriber market share, or even improving upon it, doesn’t count for much in a world where tariffs are declining. What really matters is the wallet share each telecom firm enjoys with customers who use more than one mobile connection.
From the looks of it, Reliance Jio is doing better than most incumbents on this count. It generates far more data traffic on its network than all of the other large telecom players combined. Pointing to this, analysts at JPMorgan India said in a 22 January note to clients, “Incumbents must do a lot more to become the data SIM of choice for a large mass of their sub-base; Jio may have well established this positioning.""
According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage firm, Reliance Jio is very likely to end up as the second largest telecom firm in terms of revenues in the March quarter. In the December quarter, it had already overtaken Idea’s revenues. Note that in terms of active subscribers, Reliance Jio was about 34-35% behind Vodafone and Idea at the end of December. This just goes to show that the active subscriber count has become less important in the current market environment.
In this backdrop, some analysts say it makes sense to look at trends in wireless broadband subscriptions more closely. The idea is that broadband customers generate higher ARPU (average revenue per user), besides which it is the segment which all telcos are looking to grow.
The data suggests Reliance Jio is leading the way here as well. So far this fiscal year, it has added 59.7 million customers, higher than what the other three large telcos have added cumulatively. Its share in the wireless broadband segment reached a high of 46.8% in January, up from 42.2% in March.
Analysts point out that over a third of Reliance Jio’s additions in January were likely on account of sales of its feature phone, where ARPU is lower than the company average. A clear picture of how market share battles have turned out will only come out when the telcos announce March quarter results.
For now, it is clear that the Reliance Jio juggernaut continues to roll on. The worrying bit is that the company is still miles away from its aspirational goal of a 50% revenue share of the market. As such, price competition can be expected to remain intense for some time to come."

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd has lost over a quarter of its market value this year, but little in terms of analyst confidence.
From its record in November, shares of the country’s largest wireless carrier have tumbled 27% and is now the worst stock on India’s benchmark index. And yet, more than 70% of analysts covering the company suggest buying the stock.
“With its strong balance sheet and spectrum/network footprint, we believe Bharti Airtel is likely to maintain its leading market share in an intensely competitive but consolidating market,"" Manish Adukia, an analyst at Goldman Sachs India, wrote last month.
Airtel has faced pressure from Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which disrupted India’s wireless industry in 2016 by launching free services. Reliance, owned by India’s richest man, Mukesh Abmani, has since started charging, but kept prices low to acquire subscribers. Last week it extended a membership program that offers lower tariffs and free content to subscribers.
“Competitive intensity is unlikely to abate anytime soon,"" Gaurav Malhotra, analyst with Citigroup Global Markets wrote in a note on 1 April. “We think a pricing recovery is unlikely in the near term.""
Nevertheless, for Goldman Sachs and many others, the stock remains a buy. Bloomberg"
517,2018-04-04,Airtel,"Reliance Jio's continued focus on expanding its subscriber base, via tariff cuts, offers and free Jio Prime membership, mayreflectin a weak quarter for Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular

Mumbai: Competition in the telecom industry, which has led to consolidation in the sector, is unlikely to abate in the coming quarters, as Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continues to focus on subscriber acquisition and retention, according to recent reports from top equity research firms. 
Mumbai: Competition in the telecom industry, which has led to consolidation in the sector, is unlikely to abate in the coming quarters, as Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continues to focus on subscriber acquisition and retention, according to recent reports from top equity research firms.
Jio’s ambition to gain and retain subscribers was evident in its aggressive pricing at the beginning of the year and the firm’s current move to extend Jio Prime benefits for no fee, said a 2 April Morgan Stanley research report on the Indian telecom sector.
Reliance Jio had on 30 March extended membership for the 175 million existing users of the Jio Prime loyalty programme for another year for free. Jio Prime membership costs Rs99 for new members.
Jio Prime membership gives registered Reliance Jio users access to a suite of applications and services for free, including live TV channels, movies and music, higher data benefits as well as lower tariffs.
“Clearly, Reliance Jio’s focus continues to be on subscriber acquisition and retention in the near term,"" the Morgan Stanley report said, adding, “Charging prime fee for existing users could have possibly resulted in some subscriber churn for Reliance Jio.""
Morgan Stanley expects a 7% impact on Reliance Jio’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) for financial year 2018-19, from extending Prime benefits to its existing subscriber base.
Reliance Jio, which currently has over 175 million customers, doubled its telecom market share to 13.71% as on 31 December 2017, from 6.40% a year ago, regulatory data shows.
A Reliance Jio spokesperson said most of its customers are Jio Prime members and non-Prime members account for a negligible part of the company’s subscriber base.
A report by Citi Research on 1 April said the competitive intensity of the telecom sector is unlikely to abate anytime soon.
“As the industry consolidates owing to smaller telco closures, we expect the top 3 telcos to continue to focus on grabbing subscriber share,"" said the Citi Research report on India Telecom.
“While the latest announcement from Jio doesn’t indicate another flare-up on pricing (it is broadly along expected lines), we think a pricing recovery is unlikely in the near term,"" it added.
Meanwhile, leading incumbents like Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd/Vodafone India Ltd have continued to match Reliance Jio’s tariffs for its existing 4G (fourth generation) users via segmented offers.
“Jio’s pricing moves in the month of January 2018, impact of international termination rate (ITR) cut effective February 1, 2018, and continued ARPU (average revenue per user) downtrading are likely to reflect in another quarter of sharp sequential revenue decline for the incumbents,"" said a Kotak Institutional Equities report on Telecom (India) dated 2 April.
We expect the January-March 2018 quarter to be another weak quarter for the wireless incumbents, the report said, adding that the brokerage expects a 8-9% quarter-on-quarter decline in ARPU for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular.
“Jio’s pricing moves in the month of January 2018, even as the incumbents (barring Bharti to some extent) have not responded with headline price cuts, each of them has been forced to cut prices selectively,"" the Kotak Institutional Equities report said, adding that the brokerage ARPU forecast for Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular for Jan-March 2018 quarter stands at Rs115 (down 8.6% on quarter) and Rs104 (down 9% on quarter) respectively.
A JP Morgan report on Reliance Industries Ltd (Jio’s parent company) dated 2 April states Reliance Jio’s investments in content are expected to remain elevated as currently most of the content is third party-owned.
Expect more spending on content, and hence overall capital expenditure for Jio should remain elevated, the report said.
“While Jio continues to add subscribers and the Jio Phone would allow it to gain a larger share of the lower end ARPU market, the focus has now shifted to monetizing the high-end subscriber base beyond the telecom tariffs,"" the JP Morgan report said. 
“While Jio’s subscriber base has very high data usage, the focus for Jio would now be to shift the data usage towards its content offerings and eventually monetize the content offering,"" the report added."

Mumbai: Companies owned by billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal may raise as much as Rs36,500 crore ($5.6 billion) selling bonds as the telecom titans build a war chest in what investors hope will be the home stretch in India’s bruising tariff war.
Mittal-controlled Bharti Airtel Ltd, which sold its first-ever rupee bond of Rs3,000 crore last month, has approval to raise Rs16,500 crore, according to a March 12 filing. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd announced days later that it plans to sell as much as Rs20,000 crore of notes, marking the disruptive upstart’s return to the onshore bond market after 20 months.
The fundraising amount—about 78% of the total outstanding bonds of India’s top four telecom firms—signal that the largest carrier and its rival Jio are gearing to roll out next-generation services and manage about Rs32,000 crore of debt due in the next five years. Jio stormed into the mobile-phone market in 2016 with free services that set off a tariff war and forced smaller players to merge or exit.
“After four years of intense price pain, the India telecom battle could be in its last stretch,"" said Raj Kothari, head of trading at Jay Capital Ltd in London. “It’s down to the big boys and they are piling up funds for that.""
Emails sent to Bharti Airtel and Jio spokesmen seeking details on use of funds went unanswered.
Bharti Airtel said in the filing that the money would be used for treasury activities, including refinancing, and for paying off spectrum dues. Jio hasn’t specified end use, though it has significant repayments due in the next few years, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Jio, being a new player, needs to spend aggressively to grab market share, while Bharti Airtel is investing more to retain its lead, said Mehul Sukkawala, senior director for corporate ratings at S&P Global Ratings. “This competition could move to the fibre-to-home business in the future and the related bundling of services with fibre.""
Jio secured AAA rating for 150 billion rupees of debentures last week from Crisil Ltd, a unit of S&P Global, which cited the “irrevocable and unconditional"" support from parent Reliance Industries Ltd. India’s most valuable company has invested at least $31 billion in the telecom venture. Crisil rates Bharti Airtel’s rupee notes at AA+.
Bharti and Jio won’t have a problem finding buyers, Jay Capital’s Kothari said. “Both have a good pedigree. Their debt will easily get consumed."" Bloomberg"

514,2018-04-10,Airtel,"Airtel and Telkom Kenya, which have a combined 23% share of Kenya's telecom market, have long struggled to compete with Safaricom that has a 71.9% market share

Nairobi: Telkom Kenya plans to merge operations with Indian-owned Bharti Airtel’s local unit as a first step to acquiring all of Airtel’s assets, people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, creating a stronger challenger to market leader Safaricom. 
Nairobi: Telkom Kenya plans to merge operations with Indian-owned Bharti Airtel’s local unit as a first step to acquiring all of Airtel’s assets, people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, creating a stronger challenger to market leader Safaricom.
The two operators have a combined 23% of Kenya’s 41 million mobile subscribers, but have long struggled to compete with Safaricom, which has a 71.9% market share. 
The disparity is even wider in revenue terms, with Safaricom, which is 35% held by South Africa’s Vodacom, enjoying more than 90% in both voice and short messages categories.
Data from the Communications Authority (CA) regulator showed Safaricom also has close to 90% of the annual revenue from the Internet access business. It also has a commanding lead in mobile phone money transfer with its M-Pesa service, which is regulated by the central bank.
A person at CA said the two firms have been engaging officials over the plan to share outlets and infrastructure like transmission assets, before Telkom acquires Airtel Kenya at an unspecified time. 
“They are yet to make a formal application (to the telecoms regulator) disclosing all the details,"" the person told Reuters.
Bulking up
Wang’ombe Kariuki, the director general of the Competition Authority of Kenya did not comment on the deal, saying both firms were yet to lodge a merger application. 
Telkom Kenya, which is controlled by Africa-focused, London-based Helios Investment declined to comment. Airtel Kenya also said it would not comment.
Industry executives said that if a deal to acquire all of Airtel Kenya’s assets goes through, it would help both firms make significant savings and acquire the scale to compete effectively with Safaricom.
“This is a cold, calculated business strategy,"" said a telecoms executive who did not wish to be named.
Bharti Airtel has been examining a flotation of a minority stake in its African operations but has said it remains committed to the continent. 
People in the know said the combined entity could however create concerns because it will enjoy a large slice of prime spectrum. A merger of Telkom and Airtel will result in a new company with 77 megahertz of spectrum, compared with just 47 for Safaricom.
They said that will create a new challenge for the sector regulator, which had commissioned consultants Analysys Mason to review competition in the industry. 
That study caused controversy after a leaked draft showed it recommended the breaking up of Safaricom to boost competition, forcing the government to pledge no operator would be broken up.
Executives said a joint venture between Telkom and Airtel could render the report useless. 
“The competition study they had done becomes toilet paper,"" said the industry official who did not wish to be named. Reuters"
513,2018-04-17,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular had sought interim relief in terms of reporting tariff requirements to the Trai

New Delhi: The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Tuesday reserved its interim order on pleas of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) recent regulation on tariff principles. 
New Delhi: The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) on Tuesday reserved its interim order on pleas of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd against the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) recent regulation on tariff principles.
The operators had sought interim relief in terms of reporting tariff requirements to the regulator.
Till the interim order is released, the regulator cannot seek details from Bharti Airtel on a showcause notice it had sent on 15 March where it pulled up the operator for failing to comply with tariff reporting requirements by not informing it about certain segmented tariffs offered to consumers to retain them.
The telecom tribunal had on 2 April granted temporary relief to Airtel in responding to the regulator’s queries ranging from circle-wise launch date of these segmented tariffs, criteria for classification of consumers availing these tariffs and whether these were reported to the regulator.
Operators are required to report any new tariffs to Trai within seven working days from the date of their implementation after conducting a self-check to ensure the tariffs are transparent, non-discriminatory and non-predatory.
Trai’s rules also restrict operators from offering segregated or segmented offers or plans to retain customers, by making sure that all tariffs are displayed on a company’s website.
The new norms on pricing released by Trai on 16 February also state that in case of violation of tariff reporting requirements, an operator can be penalised Rs5,000 for every day of delay, subject to a maximum of Rs2 lakh.
Moreover, discounts, rebates and waivers when applied to a tariff would give rise to a new and distinct tariff and this would mean that the offer of a discount is effectively the offer of a new tariff, Trai rules state.
While Airtel and Idea challenged the order in TDSAT, Vodafone moved the Madras high court.
“I don’t have a difficulty in reporting it (segmented tariffs) in-principle, the difficulty is in practice. This will apply to lakhs of consumers all over India. For everyone I have to report and put on my website within seven working days will be an impossibility. The basis for imposing this is only that it amounts to a new tariff.... our submission is giving a discount or concession does not amount to a new tariff,"" the legal counsel for Idea Cellular said on Tuesday.
Airtel’s counsel argued that there was a change in policy which essentially was a direct intrusion to the choice and flexibility of customer retention.
Even as it reserved its interim order, the three-member bench raised an observation as to whether Trai was sticking to ‘light-touch regulation’ or was there a case of regulatory over-reach.
“We want you to understand the significance of how much this issue of non-discrimination, what lies under it, what is the purpose to be achieved...you want to regulate only for benefit to the customer,"" TDSAT chairperson Shiva Kirti Singh observed.
The bench also observed whether offering a segmented tariff to retain a customer was a business right of an operator.
“Why do you want to regulate whether this (a particular segmented tariff) is given to one or to all...then what you are trying to say is you will try to control each and every aspect of doing business,"" Justice A.K. Bhargava said.
“The issue in this particular case is retention of the customer not the tariff. That customer is already under the tariff. I may want to retain one particular customer I may not want to retain...as a part of doing business I would take a call and offer him if required...which principle is violated by this action...where is the non-discrimination...he is still under the same tariff, he has got some concession on the account of retention and retention is (an operator’s) right to do business,"" Justice Bhargava said.
Reliance Jio has been impleaded as a party in the case and has been given 10 days to file a reply. The company had on 29 January written to the regulator alleging that operators, including Airtel, were offering discriminatory tariffs to customers to retain them."

Mumbai: Telecom tower infrastructure provider Bharti Infratel, which has witnessed tenancy losses due to consolidation in the telecom sector, expects better business in the future as telcos continue to roll out 4G telecom networks and prepare for 5G services, top company officials said.
“With improving industry structure, rising consumer demand, and the need to expand 4G network in the short-term and potentially 5G in the longer term, we expect the (tower) industry to come out of the current phase (of slow growth) much more stronger,"" Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta told analysts in a post-earning call. 
“With data demand growing at a very rapid pace, it is clear that all private operators have to invest heavily on network throughout the country to remain competitive,"" Gupta said.
“In addition, in the longer term, the advent of 5G would significantly increase the demand for sites because of the spectrum being in higher frequency,"" Gupta added.
The tower arm of Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel on Monday reported a 2% rise in consolidated net profit at Rs606 crore for the March quarter against Rs597 crore a year ago.
The company ended FY2018 with 91,451 towers, up from 90,646 towers a year ago. 
However, it also lost 22,134 co-locations during the year due to consolidation. Co-locations are points where a tower operator deploys antennae of multiple carriers.
The revenue decline of Bharti Infratel will be driven by the exit of select players (RCom, TTSL and Aircel), said IDFC Securities Telecom Research dated 3 April. “This is likely to drive increase in churn and overall gross adds for the quarter are unlikely to offset this drag,"" it said.
However, Bharti Infratel managing director and chief executive Devender Singh Rawat told analysts that he doesn’t agree that there is excess of supply in the tower industry.
“With Reliance Jio’s announcement of 210,000 towers, it is clearly showing that new normal for an operator, who is trying to compete in the (market) post consolidation, is north of 200,000 towers,"" Rawat said, adding, “This clearly means that there is further requirement of rolling out new towers as we go forward.""
Rawat added that the tower industry is still to see much growth coming from areas with weak coverage.
Bharti Infratel expects average revenue per tenant, which has been stagnant for a few quarters, to increase after the Vodafone-Idea Cellular merger goes through.
“They (Vodafone/Idea) haven’t discussed with us on their exit,"" Devender Singh Rawat told analysts. “We will look to engage with them after they get DoT approval for the merger.""
Uninor, which is waiting for integration with Airtel, is also yet to cancel its tenancy with Bharti Infratel, Rawat addd.
Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers Ltd—two of India’s largest telecom tower firms—could also merge in the near future.
“Indus-Infratel merger remains a potential and is always a possibility,"" said Bharti Infratel chairman Gupta said adding, “But it’s a shareholders’ matter and we are not in a position to comment much on this.""
Mint had on 23 February reported that Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are planning to merge their businesses, citing three people aware of the matter.
Meanwhile, growth triggers for Bharti Infratel include the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea Cellular increasing tenancy, and Reliance Jio rolling out services.
“Jio has completed their earlier phase of growth at the end of the second quarter and are planning for the next phase of growth and rollout, and we are hoping to get a fair share of business,"" Rawat said."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked Bharti Airtel to tweak its ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement so that a disclaimer on certain hidden costs are written in bold, and comply with a 13 April order passed by it. 
On 13 April, justice Yogesh Khanna had directed Bharti Airtel to modify, as in an interim measure, the ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement to the extent of making the information on data consumption cost more prominent. 
The court was hearing a contempt plea moved by Reliance Jio Infocomm against Bharti Airtel for alleged non-compliance of the 13 April order. 
P. Chidambaram appearing for Bharti Airtel stated that the there had been no instance of non-compliance on behalf of Airtel and submitted a “compliance affidavit"" to the court. 
Reliance Jio had moved the high court on 13 April against Bharti Airtel’s ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement, alleging that the advertisement was misleading and deceptive as it failed to inform consumers about the hidden costs. 
Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Reliance Jio had claimed that the Airtel’s claim of providing access to all Indian Premier League (IPL) matches “live and free"" was not true as a user had to pay for the data consumed for streaming the matches by subscribing to one of the data plans starting from Rs399 for 20 GB data per month. 
Singhvi had further argued that the disclaimer that follows the advertisement, stating that “date consumption will be charged as per the existing plan"", went beyond clarifying or expanding the “main message"" and contradictied the message perceived by a viewer. 
Bharti Airtel had clarified that ‘free and live’ in the advertisement referred to a free subscription to online streaming platform Hotstar, and not data consumed. It was argued that the fact that users had to pay for data consumption was already stated in the advertisement. 
The case will be next heard on 27 April."

509,2018-04-24,Airtel,"Airtel's net profit fell to Rs83 crore in the three months ended 31 March from Rs373 crore in the year earlier

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s net profit fell 78% in the March quarter as the telecom regulator slashed international call termination charge and a brutal tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continued unabated. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s net profit fell 78% in the March quarter as the telecom regulator slashed international call termination charge and a brutal tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continued unabated.
Net profit fell to Rs83 crore in the three months ended 31 March from Rs373 crore in the year earlier, India’s largest telecom operator said in a statement on Tuesday.
This is the company’s lowest quarterly profit in nearly 15 years, a Reuters report said.
Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard in the December quarter after the telecom regulator’s decision to slash interconnection usage charges (IUC) levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Later, in another blow to operators, the regulator also cut the international call termination charge from 53 paise a minute to 30 paise a minute, effective 1 February. The termination charge is payable by an international long distance operator to the Indian telecom operator on whose network an overseas call terminates.
“The India mobile business has posted a loss on EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) level at Rs482 crore. They have been able to show an overall profit as cost rationalisation is saving the company. Also, the company recorded a net tax credit of Rs300 crore in Q4, which has inflated the net profit. If you look at the ARPU (average revenue per user), it is Rs116; the market was expecting Rs118,"" a Mumbai-based telecom analyst said on condition of anonymity. “Overall, the outlook for the sector looks negative and the pricing pressure is here to stay for few more quarters.""
Consolidated revenue dropped to Rs19,634.3 crore in the March quarter from Rs21,934.6 crore in the year earlier. Pricing pressure is evident from the fact that Airtel’s data customer base rose 50% from a year earlier to 86 million users in India in the quarter.
“The telecom industry continues to witness below cost, artificially suppressed pricing. Industry revenues were further adversely impacted this quarter due to the reduction in international termination rates,"" Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive of (India and South Asia) at Bharti Airtel, said in a statement.
Things started souring after Reliance Jio launched services in September 2016 with six months of free data and voice, followed by ultra-cheap tariffs. Airtel has since recorded a fall in net profit for six straight quarters as it reduced prices to compete with Jio.
Consolidated Ebitda fell 12% year-on-year to Rs7,034.1 crore in the quarter ended March, Airtel said. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Airtel’s March quarter revenues from India fell 7.5% year on year to Rs14,796 crore on an underlying basis, primarily due to a drop in mobile business, the company said.
Airtel’s monthly ARPU (in India) fell sharply to Rs116 in the March quarter from Rs158 a year ago. The number of minutes spent on calls on its network, however, grew 55% in India during the quarter while the total data consumed on its network rose more than 584% from a year earlier.
The company’s consolidated net debt has increased to Rs95,228 crore from Rs91,714 crore in the December quarter.
For the year ended 31 March, consolidated revenue fell 9.8% to Rs83,688 crore, the company said, while profit fell 71% year on year to Rs1,099 crore.
Performance of the company’s Africa unit has saved the company some blushes. In constant currency terms, Africa revenues for the March quarter grew 10.7% year-on-year, as data traffic grew 88%, voice minutes increased by 37% and Airtel Money throughput grew 45% on a yearly basis, the company said."
511,2018-04-24,Airtel,"Airtel will post its March quarter results today amid an ongoing tariff war in the telecom sector after the entry of Reliance Jio

New Delhi: India’s largest operator by subscriber base and revenue, Bharti Airtel Ltd, will post its financial results for the March quarter on Tuesday evening. Investors will keenly watch out for the company’s comments on the impact of the current tariff war and the recent cut in the international termination charge. 
New Delhi: India’s largest operator by subscriber base and revenue, Bharti Airtel Ltd, will post its financial results for the March quarter on Tuesday evening. Investors will keenly watch out for the company’s comments on the impact of the current tariff war and the recent cut in the international termination charge.
Some brokerages expect the company to post a net loss, its first in 15 years, an Economic Times report dated 4 April said, adding that the Bank of America-Merrill Lynch has estimated the loss at Rs58.5 crore, while Kotak Securities at Rs377 crore.
A UBS research report on the Indian telecom sector dated 13 April expects the January-March period to be weak for incumbent telecom operators on the back of price cuts implemented by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, ARPU (average revenue per user) down trading and reduction in international termination charges.
Companies in the telecom sector have been facing a brutal tariff war after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 with six months of free services, followed by rock-bottom tariffs. 
Airtel has since recorded a fall in net profit for five straight quarters as it cut tariffs to take on Jio.
In the quarter ended December, Airtel’s quarterly profit plunged 39%, missing analysts’ estimates, as India’s telecom regulator more than halved interconnection fees and a pricing war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio continued unabated.
“Regulatory fiat in the form of a cut in domestic IUC (interconnection usage charges) rates has exacerbated the industry ARPU (average revenue per user) decline in Q3’18. The recent announcement of reduction in international termination rates will further accentuate this decline and benefit foreign operators with no commensurate benefit to customers,"" Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive officer (India and South Asia) at Bharti Airtel, had said in a statement after the company posted results for the December quarter.
The termination charge is payable by an international long-distance operator to the Indian telecom operator on whose network an overseas call terminates. The move is expected to result in an annualized Ebitda hit of Rs500 crore to Bharti Airtel, a report by Kotak Institutional Equities dated 15 January said.
Airtel’s monthly ARPU in India, which fell sharply to Rs123 in the December quarter from Rs172 a year ago, will be another key metric to analysts to assess the company’s revenue generating capabilities in the future.
However, the performance of the Africa unit has saved the company some blushes in the last two quarters."
506,2018-04-25,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel, thanks to cost-cutting measures, reported a wafer thin net profit of Rs83 crore, or 0.4% of revenues in its Q4 earnings

Bharti Airtel Ltd kept its eye on the ball to avoid a net loss under trying circumstances in the March quarter. A number of analysts had predicted a loss, a first in 15 years. But thanks to cost-cutting measures, it reported a wafer-thin net profit of Rs83 crore, or 0.4% of revenues. 
Bharti Airtel Ltd kept its eye on the ball to avoid a net loss under trying circumstances in the March quarter. A number of analysts had predicted a loss, a first in 15 years. But thanks to cost-cutting measures, it reported a wafer-thin net profit of Rs83 crore, or 0.4% of revenues.
Of course, the struggles in the India wireless business were visible in the company’s financials. The division’s revenues fell 3.7% sequentially and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) fell 16.1% to Rs2,943 crore. Before Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s launch, less than two years ago, the India wireless business generated Ebitda of around Rs6,300 crore. The sharp decline in profitability is now resulting in steep losses and negative cash flow.
The silver lining, from an investors’ perspective, is that all of the above was on expected lines. In fact, a look at some of the other metrics, such as voice and data volumes, average revenue per user and mobile broadband network expansion, suggests the company has held its own. “The test of execution for the incumbents at this point is their ability to hold on to their customer base and usage in the backdrop of Jio’s incessant aggression. We believe Bharti Airtel has done reasonably well in the past 4-6 quarters,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 24 April note to clients. 
Needless to say, investors are desperately hoping that Jio is done with its price cuts. Just when it had seemed that it was done disrupting the market, it went ahead with a fresh round of tariff cuts in January. As such, trying to read its mind is an exercise in futility. Incumbents such as Airtel and Idea Cellular Ltd tend to think that further price cuts by Jio will hurt its own interests more, since it impacts its entire subscriber base. For the incumbents, they point out, the impact will largely be limited to subscribers who have broadband connections. But as past trends show, this is false comfort. If Jio isn’t content with its market share gains, it may well consider further tariff cuts necessary.
Thankfully for Airtel’s investors, while they wait for the India wireless market to recover, the company’s Africa business is doing wonders. Revenues in the region have been more or less flat, but profit margins have improved on the back of the restructuring the company has undertaken. Earnings before interest and tax of the company’s Africa operations stood at Rs1,121 crore last quarter, higher than all of the company’s other operations, a first in Airtel’s history. Companies such as Idea and Vodafone India Ltd don’t have this luxury, and their results are likely to look far worse."

Mumbai: Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose 5% intraday on Wednesday after it posted better-than-expected March quarter results. The telecom major’s fourth quarter net profit fell 78% to Rs83 crore while most analysts had estimated it to report losses in the three months ending March. 
Mumbai: Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose 5% intraday on Wednesday after it posted better-than-expected March quarter results. The telecom major’s fourth quarter net profit fell 78% to Rs83 crore while most analysts had estimated it to report losses in the three months ending March.
At 10:32am, Bharti Airtel was at 425.05, up Rs18.95 or 4.67% on the BSE. According to a Mint report, the company’s low quarterly net profit is due to the regulator slashing international call termination charge and a brutal tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd which bite into it margins.
In a note on 25 April, Nomura said that the overall Q4FY18 operating performance was more resilient relative to their expectations, even though the India business turned unprofitable. The brokerage firm has a buy rating on the company.
Though Bharti Airtel has lost 21% in the year so far and one of the worst performing stock in the Sensex, analysts are still bullish on the stock. Out of 33 analysts who track the stock on Bloomberg, 23 have ‘buy’ rating, four have ‘sell’ rating while six have ‘hold’. In contrast, rival Idea Cellular Ltd which lost 32% in the year so far and have more sell ratings. Out of 26 analysts, 13 have ‘sell’ ratings while six and seven have ‘buy’ and ‘hold’ ratings respectively. Benchmark index Sensex has gained 1.5% in the same period.
Meanwhile, BSE Telecom index has also gained over 2% on Wednesday as Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal’s (TDSAT) interim order is seen as a relief for top players Airtel and Idea Cellular. The telecom tribunal said in the order that until further orders, no penalty can be imposed on operators for not complying with the tariff reporting requirement to the telecom regulator.

503,2018-04-26,Airtel,"Airtel reported a Q4 loss this week in its Indian operations  its first in 15 years. Yet to write off Sunil  Mittal as a loser in the Indian data war of 2016-2020 may be a mistake

His business model has been upended, profitability lies in tatters and the regulatory environment has turned against him. But billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, who controls India’s largest mobile company, has just signalled a $14.6 billion intention to fight to the finish. 
His business model has been upended, profitability lies in tatters and the regulatory environment has turned against him. But billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, who controls India’s largest mobile company, has just signalled a $14.6 billion intention to fight to the finish.
Bharti Airtel Ltd. reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss this week in its Indian operations – its first in 15 years. Yet to write off Mittal as a loser in the great Indian data war of 2016-2020 may be a mistake.
For evidence, look no further than the timing of the merger announcement between Bharti Infratel Ltd. and Indus Towers Ltd. The deal, which will create India’s largest operator of cellular towers, was unveiled a day after Airtel’s financial results. (Infratel didn’t fare much better, reporting a steeper-than-expected drop in tenancies amid a scramble by incumbent operators to sell out, close down or file for bankruptcy.)
Mittal is agreeing to share control equally with Vodafone Plc in the merged tower business despite having a higher equity stake. The telecom tycoon is making his intention clear: He wants to monetize his real estate to invest in the battle against Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
If the expanded tower company is able to negotiate better rates with tenants, finding a buyer for, say, half of Airtel’s stake could easily add $3 billion to Mittal’s telecom war chest.
Nothing else matters. Bharti Airtel’s wireless market share of 26% has it comfortably ahead of Jio at 15%. However, the problem is that Jio, backed by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, added almost 9 million subscribers in February, compared with little more than a 4 million gain for Bharti.
Every second person in the country who took a mobile broadband connection last quarter opted for Jio’s plans that offer unlimited voice calls and as much as 2 gigabytes of data per day. Before Jio’s September 2016 entry with an expensive $31 billion 4G network, data was a sideshow in India.
The business model used to be about charging customers for voice conversations – and collecting money from smaller operators for terminating calls on their networks. Ambani killed the first avenue by offering lifetime free calls, and the regulator choked off the second.
Jio’s stated goals of making Rs350 ($5.20) a month from an average user —and charging at least Rs50 per gigabyte of data —are red herrings to confuse competitors into thinking the price war will end relatively soon, as Elara Securities’ analyst Ravi Menon puts it. Mittal, struggling with average revenue per user of Rs116, isn’t falling for the ruse.
What Ambani really wants is market dominance, which Menon translates as a revenue market share of 40 to 45% by the end of 2019. To get there, Jio could relentlessly undercut on price.
Currently, only 20% of India’s mobile subscribers have broadband internet. But that could change if the early success of JioPhone — a 4G-enabled feature phone that Ambani is effectively giving away — is anything to go by. While the smartphone market in India is showing signs of saturation, JioPhone is being lapped up by bottom-of-the-pyramid customers excited to go online for the first time.
To withstand Ambani’s triple play of carriage, content and commerce, Mittal will need to offer customers more than free Netflix. Given a net debt to Ebitda of more than 3 times, capital infusion into the network would need to come from equity. That’s why the tower merger, which will allow Bharti to cash in by selling a stake, is a good first step. Listing the promising Africa mobile business is another opportunity.
It’s hard to say what the 2020 landscape may look like. Assuming Jio and Bharti are close rivals that each have a substantial revenue market share, the prognosis must be bleak for Vodafone and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla.
Currently ranked second and third by subscriber numbers, Vodafone’s India operations and Idea Cellular Ltd. are merging. Their strategy beyond marriage, however, is unclear. No wonder Idea’s shares have 12 sell ratings from analysts, versus six buy recommendations, while 22 analysts say Bharti is a buy, and only four advise offloading.
Mittal is at least telling Ambani not to expect a walkover. Maybe the other two will be more obliging. Bloomberg Gadfly"
502,2018-04-27,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel may face a rating downgrade in next 6-12 months if intense competition remains in the market and decreases its margins, Moody's said

New Delhi: Telecom major Bharti Airtel Ltd may face a rating downgrade in next 6-12 months if intense competition remains in the market and decreases its margins, Moody’s Investors Service said while affirming Baa3 ratings with negative outlook to the company. 
New Delhi: Telecom major Bharti Airtel Ltd may face a rating downgrade in next 6-12 months if intense competition remains in the market and decreases its margins, Moody’s Investors Service said while affirming Baa3 ratings with negative outlook to the company.
“The ratings are likely to be downgraded within the next 6-12 months if heightened competition persists in its Indian wireless business, such that consolidated EBITDA or margins deteriorate further from current levels,"" Moody’s said in a statement. 
Moody’s Investors Service has affirmed Bharti Airtel (Bharti) Baa3 issuer rating and senior unsecured debt ratings, as well as the Baa3 ratings on the senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V., which are irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed by Bharti. 
“The outlook on the ratings is negative,"" the report said. Credit ratings reflect an organisation’s ability to repay debt. The Baa3 rating means the entity is medium-grade and subject to moderate credit risk and has an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations. “The affirmation of Bharti’s Baa3 rating and negative outlook recognises that the company’s leverage metrics remain elevated as profitability continues to be under pressure,"" Moody’s vice president and senior credit officer, Annalisa Di Chiara said. 
The negative outlook reflects the company’s high leverage levels with adjusted debt to Ebitda ratio of around 3.8 times on a consolidated basis at year-end March 2018. The consolidated net debt of Airtel increased to Rs95,228 crore at the end of March 2018 from Rs91,714 crore at the end of December 2017. The country’s largest mobile operator Bharti Airtel reported its lowest quarterly consolidated net profit in at least 14 years, as competition with free voice calls and dirt-cheap data tariffs from new entrant Reliance Jio ate into its margins. 
Airtel posted a consolidated net profit of Rs82.9 crore (or 21 paisa per share) in January-March quarter of 2017-18 fiscal as compared to Rs373.4 crore (or 93 paisa a share) in the same period of the previous fiscal. Airtel’s total revenue fell by 10.5% to Rs19,634 crore in the fourth quarter of 2017-18.
For the full fiscal year that ended in March 2018, Airtel’s net profit came in at Rs1,099 crore, over 71% lower than Rs3,800 crore logged in FY 2016-17. “To that end, we believe the recently announced merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers provides a path for significant debt reduction with the possibility of an eventual sale of its stake in a larger business over the next 12-15 months,"" Di Chiara said. 
Bharti is expected to have a 33.8-37.2% stake in Indus Towers following the merger, Moody’s said. “Based on the company’s announcement, the equity value of the combined entity is estimated at USD 14.6 billion, making Bharti’s stake worth around USD 4.9-5.4 billion, and thus providing significant potential for debt reduction within the next 12-15 months,"" the report said. 
Moody’s expect that with improvement in financial position of the African operations, Bharti will consider options to monetise a part of its stake in that operation as it focuses on measures to reduce consolidated leverage."

“They have sought approval. The government is evaluating the proposal currently. May be we will be able to take a call (for the acquisition) in 10-15 days,"" the person cited above said, requesting anonymity. The government owns a 26.12% stake in Tata Communications, earlier known as Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL).
Tata Sons chairman N. Chandrasekaran on Tuesday met telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan to discuss the closure of Tata Teleservices’ consumer mobile business by sale to Bharti Airtel, as well as Tata Communications’ plan to acquire the enterprise business of Tata Teleservices, said the person cited above.
In October 2017, the Tata group said it would sell the consumer mobile businesses of Tata Teleservices and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd on a debt-free cash-free basis to Bharti Airtel Ltd. The proposed transaction includes transfer of customers and assets of Tata consumer mobile businesses to Airtel, including 178.5 MHz spectrum (of which 71.3 MHz is liberalized) in the 850 MHz, 1,800 MHz and 2,100 MHz bands. 
The acquisition is pending multiple regulatory approvals, including those from National Company Law Tribunal, Competition Commission of India and the DoT.
At that time, Tata Teleservices had also said it was “in initial stages of exploring combination of its enterprise business with Tata Communications"" and that any such transaction would be subject to respective boards and other requisite approvals.
When asked if a final decision had been taken on Tata Communications buying the enterprise business of Tata Teleservices, Chandrasekaran told reporters the Tata Communications board had to approve it first. On when the board planned to take it up, he said: “For us, the first thing is, we have to close the mobile business.""
Tata Communications plans to announce March quarter results on 10 May. Apart from the government’s 26.12% stake, Tata Communications’ other promoters are Panatone Finvest Ltd with 30.12% stake, Tata Sons Ltd with 14.07% stake and Tata Power Co. Ltd with 4.71% stake. The public holds the remaining 25.01% stake.
An email query sent to Tata Communications was not answered till press time.
VSNL was disinvested on 13 February 2002 and management control of the firm was passed on to Panatone Finvest, a special purpose vehicle under the Tata group.
At the time of disinvestment, surplus land measuring 773.13 acres located at five locations across Pune, Kolkata, New Delhi and Chennai was demarcated and it was decided that the surplus land will not be part of the disinvestment bid. Panatone had undertaken an obligation to demerge or hive off the surplus land into a realty company Hemisphere Properties India Ltd.
Meanwhile, in order to facilitate the demerger of surplus land from Tata Communications to HPIL, the Cabinet on 4 April, ending an almost 15-year wait, approved the transfer of administrative control of HPIL from the DoT to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs after infusion of equity of Rs700 crore and Rs51 crore secured government loan into the company, and implementation of the scheme of arrangement for de-merger of surplus land."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a government petition challenging a telecom tribunal order directing it to clear Bharti Airtel Ltd’s acquisition of Telenor India without insisting on a bank guarantee for almost Rs1,499 crore.  
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a government petition challenging a telecom tribunal order directing it to clear Bharti Airtel Ltd’s acquisition of Telenor India without insisting on a bank guarantee for almost Rs1,499 crore. 
P.S. Narasimha, representing the government, told the court it had issued guidelines that required the bank guarantee to inspite of a stay order secured by Airtel in any court in the country. 
“They must provide the bank guarantee to the extent of one-time spectrum charges payable by them, to the tune of Rs1499 crore"", Narasimha added. 
The department of telecommunications (DoT) had challenged an order passed by the Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), which ordered the government to clear the deal without demanding a bank guarantee. 
Airtel plans to buy Telenor India in a no-cash deal and take over its outstanding spectrum payments of Rs1,650 crore. The deal will help it narrow the revenue market share gap with the emerging Vodafone India-Idea Cellular combine, which will become the country’s largest phone company after their merger. 
The proposed acquisition has already been cleared by Competition Commission of India (CCI), the market regulator Sebi and stock exchanges BSE and NSE, and it is awaiting telecom department’s nod.
Airtel and Telenor had signed the agreement for merger on February 2017 under which Airtel will acquire Telenor India’s running operations in seven circles — Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP (East), UP (West) and Assam.
As part of the deal, Airtel will assume the Telenor unit’s liabilities related to licence fees and lease obligations for phone towers, a Telenor spokesman said on Thursday. The transaction, which won’t involve any cash payments to Telenor, will give Airtel access to 44 million customers (increasing its user base to 307 million), 43.4 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum in the 1,800MHz band and 20,000 base stations.

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd. is looking to pare $4.6 billion from its net borrowings over the next three years by listing its African unit and potentially selling some stake in its tower business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, in a bid to safeguard its investment grade ratings. 
Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd. is looking to pare $4.6 billion from its net borrowings over the next three years by listing its African unit and potentially selling some stake in its tower business, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, in a bid to safeguard its investment grade ratings.
India’s top wireless operator plans to raise as much as $1.5 billion by listing a quarter of equity in its Africa unit by early 2019 in either London or South Africa, the person said, asking not to be identified as the information isn’t public. The parent will also look to sell part of its stake in the $14.6 billion tower giant after Bharti Infratel Ltd. merges with Indus Towers Ltd.
The twin deals will help the billionaire Sunil Mittal-controlled carrier improve its balance sheet after net debt rose almost 45% to $14.6 billion over four years as the company borrowed to buy spectrum and defend its position against disruptive upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The build-up, which came with an eight-quarter-long stretch of earnings declines, has put Bharti Airtel at risk of a downgrade to junk at both Moody’s Investors Service and S&P Global Ratings.
“We see a high likelihood that Bharti can avoid becoming a fallen angel,"" Anthony Leung, a Hong Kong-based senior analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. wrote in a report dated 7 May. “We expect a majority, if not all, of Bharti’s tower business to be sold in a year’s time, which will meet the timeline target imposed by Moody’s to keep the credit at Baa3,"" which is the lowest investment grade rating.
Bankers for the listing of Bharti Airtel’s Africa unit will be appointed by September, according to the person. The unit will house about $2.3 billion of debt, pushing its enterprise value to $8.3 billion, the person said.
A Bharti Airtel spokesman declined to comment.
The pressure to provide 4G services across India and expand broadband before Jio roils this segment too, will imply capital spending of about Rs24,000 crore ($3.6 billion) in the year to March 2019, the person said. The company invested Rs25,000 crore last fiscal.
Ratings concern
S&P Global Ratings put a negative outlook on Bharti Airtel’s BBB- rating on 3 May after “cut-throat pricing"" led to weaker-than-expected earnings and given the need for high capital spending. There’s “a one-in-three possibility"" of a ratings downgrade in the next 18 months if the financials don’t improve as expected “or if deleveraging does not materialize,"" S&P said in a statement.
Moody’s affirmed the company’s Baa3 rating with a negative outlook on 26 April, saying “demonstrated progress"" toward debt reduction was necessary to maintain the investment grade.
Equity investors too are feeling the heat. Bharti Airtel’s shares have plunged 24% this year, the worst performer on the 30-stock S&P BSE Sensex, which has climbed 3.7%. It climbed as much as 2.1% in Mumbai on Wednesday before closing 0.3% higher.
The company’s continuing asset monetization push will allay some of these concerns. Bharti Airtel will engage with investors to evaluate a strategic stake sale once the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus is complete, according to an 25 April filing. It will own up to 37.2% in the new entity that will control more than 163,000 towers across India.
It sold about 8,300 towers in seven African countries for about $1.7 billion in 2015 and followed with the sale of its Tanzanian tower business for $179 million a year later. In 2016, Bharti Airtel also sold its Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone units.
India’s top carrier raised $2 billion through the sale of its African tower assets and $1 billion from the sale of its Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone businesses, the person said. Bharti Airtel in 2010 acquired the African assets of Kuwait’s Mobile Telecommunications Co., also known as Zain, for an enterprise valuation of $10.7 billion."

New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday restricted the scope of its previous order asking Bharti Airtel to tweak its ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement, to the extent of advertisements published in print media only, and not television advertisements/video clips.  
New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday restricted the scope of its previous order asking Bharti Airtel to tweak its ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement, to the extent of advertisements published in print media only, and not television advertisements/video clips. 
A division bench of the court headed by acting chief justice of the high court Gita Mittal was hearing an appeal moved by Bharti Airtel against an order of a single judge bench asking it to use a font size of 12 pixels in its disclaimer instead of 10 pixels in print media, along with other specific instructions.
The other directions with respect to video clips/television advertisements were stayed.
The single judge bench had asked Bharti Airtel to start its television disclaimer “from the word the girl in the advertisement says ‘seasonal pass....’, in sync with the voice over.""
Counsel appearing for Bharti Airtel, P. Chidambaram argued that its advertisement was in compliance with Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) guidelines and did not result in disparagement or violation of intellectual property right. 
Reliance Jio had moved the high court on 13 April against Bharti Airtel’s ‘T20 cricket Live and Free’ advertisement, alleging that the advertisement was misleading and deceptive as it failed to inform consumers about the hidden costs.
Bharti Airtel had clarified the ‘free and live’ in the advertisement referred to a free subscription to online streaming platform Hotstar, and not data consumed. It was argued that the fact that users had to pay for data consumption was already stated in the advertisement.
Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Reliance Jio had claimed that the Airtel’s claim of providing access to all Indian Premier League (IPL) matches “live and free"" was not true as a user had to pay for the data consumed for streaming the matches by subscribing to one of the data plans. 
Singhvi had further argued that the disclaimer that follows the advertisement, stating that “date consumption will be charged as per the existing plan"", went beyond clarifying or expanding the “main message"" and contradicted the message perceived by a viewer."

Mumbai: Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd fell sharply on Friday, a day after rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd unveiled a new postpaid plan that analysts said was likely to hurt incumbent telecom firms’ business. 
Mumbai: Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd fell sharply on Friday, a day after rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd unveiled a new postpaid plan that analysts said was likely to hurt incumbent telecom firms’ business.
Airtel shares fell as much as 7.53% on the BSE during the day before closing at Rs385.70 each, down 6.44%. Idea’s shares dropped as much as 12.94% during the day and ended down 11.83% at Rs51.45 each. The BSE Telecom index fell 4.75%, while the benchmark Sensex closed at 35,535.79 points, up 0.82%.
Reliance Jio on Thursday unveiled a new postpaid plan that offers unlimited domestic voice calls and 25 GB of data, as well as international calling at Rs0.50 per minute, for Rs199 a month. That’s about half the cost of comparable offers from other, older telcos, Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a 10 May note. The brokerage added that it expects the incumbents to cut prices in response, leading to a further decline in average revenue per user, or ARPU.
“We have been concerned on the postpaid revenues for incumbents given the cost to consumers is three times of prepaid. Postpaid, while making up only 7% of top three operators subscribers, contribute over 20% of their revenues,"" it said.
Reliance Jio, which launched in September 2016 and sparked off a tariff war, has not had as much of an impact in the postpaid segment as it has in prepaid, as a significant proportion of postpaid connections are corporate accounts, said Kotak Intuitional Equities. However, the Rs199 plan “changes the dynamic; dramatically, as always"", it added.
The brokerage firms said that ARPU will correct if the incumbents try to hold on to these customers, but the impact may not be immediate. “More important is the much lower ISD rates being offered by Jio now versus the Rs8-10/min currently being charged by the incumbents. While ISD outgoing is a very low proportion of industry’s overall voice volumes (less than 0.1% of outgoing volumes), we believe the contribution to industry revenues could be in the 1.5-2% vicinity. This revenue stream can easily get cut by half,"" it said in a report on 10 May.
According to Jefferies, postpaid users don’t change operators as often as prepaid users do, and a shift to Reliance Jio would be gradual as 40% of the postpaid customers are corporate, and these would be a key targets.
“Any 10% cut in postpaid prices will lead to 2% cut in overall ARPU. Any 10% cut in postpaid prices will lead to 12%/6% Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) hits for Idea and Bharti respectively,"" Jefferies said.
Jefferies expects industry ARPU to remain under pressure and cost pressures to also increase. It said that recovery will also be gradual from mid-FY20 as ARPU increases will require investment in both capacity and content."

New Delhi: In fresh salvo fired in the hyper competitive telecom sector, Reliance Jio has complained to the department of telecommunications (DoT) alleging that Airtel is violating the government’s licence norms and posing a threat to national security by not setting up within India certain network infrastructure that it uses to sell Apple Watch Series 3. 
New Delhi: In fresh salvo fired in the hyper competitive telecom sector, Reliance Jio has complained to the department of telecommunications (DoT) alleging that Airtel is violating the government’s licence norms and posing a threat to national security by not setting up within India certain network infrastructure that it uses to sell Apple Watch Series 3.
“Airtel has not set up eSIM provisioning node within India and the node being used to provide Apple Watch Series 3 service is currently located out of India in gross violation of the licence terms,"" Jio wrote in a letter to the DoT on 11 May.
The user’s iPhone and Apple Watch share the same number and the user can choose either device to make or receive calls via the electronic SIM. At the time of pairing of the two devices, over-the-air provisioning of eSIM is carried out by a dedicated network node that is used for eSIM profile allocation which contains network and user information.
Government norms mandate an operator to deploy equipment anywhere in India subject to the interconnection points located and operated in the respective service areas for inter-operator, inter-service area, national long-distance and international calls. The licence terms also require that operators shall not transfer any user information or their accounting information to any person or place outside India.
“Airtel has deliberately chosen to install a critical network element outside India for a service being offered under the Access Services Licence indicates its blatant disregard for the sanctity of the licence terms and conditions including important security conditions,"" Jio said. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
Bharti Airtel had on 24 April announced a partnership with Apple for the India launch of the Apple Watch Series 3. This comes enabled with built-in cellular through an electronic SIM which will be used with customer’s existing Airtel number. Interestingly, on 11 May Reliance Jio also announced a similar partnership with Apple.
Jio has urged DoT to impose a penalty on Airtel for this alleged violation of norms, apart from directing Airtel to immediately stop this service and commence it again only after complying with requirements of national security and addressing the alleged violations of licence norms.
“This is yet another frivolous complaint by a desperate operator, whose sole aim appears to have a monopoly over everything that they do,"" a Bharti Airtel spokesperson said when contacted.
“The DoT was duly notified prior to the launch of Apple watch including product features, network architecture and lawful interception and we have also requested them to carry out a demonstration of the same. All information relating to customers, network nodes etc. is hosted in a fully secure manner by Airtel India along with provision for lawful interception. We will be happy to share more details with the DoT as and when required,"" the Bharti Airtel spokesperson said.
Mint could not independently verify the veracity of claims made by Jio."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd's battle with rival Bharti Airtel Ltd over the latter's 'T20 Live and Free' advertisement campaign is now in the Supreme Court.
The Mukesh Ambani-owned company on Monday challenged in the apex court a 10 May order by a Delhi High Court division bench, that gave a partial breather to Airtel over its disputed campaign.
The matter was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who posted it for hearing on 18 May.
The dispute revolves around Airtel's ongoing 'T20 Live and Free' advertising campaign in television, print and outdoor media, promising live and free coverage of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches on its network. In reality, the offer is a free subscription to watch the cricket matches on the Hotstar app.
Reliance Jio moved the Delhi High Court on 13 April, complaining the advertisement was misleading and deceptive as it failed to inform consumers about the hidden cost of data usage. Airtel said its ads indeed mention that “data consumption will be charged as per the existing plan"".
On 2 May, a single-judge bench of the Delhi High Court asked Airtel to make the disclaimer in a bigger type size, across ads in print, TV and in outdoor hoardings. For television and video ads, the judge asked Airtel to start its disclaimer “from the word the girl in the advertisement says ‘seasonal pass....’, in sync with the voice over.""
Airtel contested this order before a larger division bench of the high court, which ordered that the bigger type sizes need to be carried only in print ads, and not in videos or hoardings. Now, Reliance Jio has contested that order in the Supreme Court."

They got mails from Bharti Airtel asking them to attend a meeting with the HR officials to discuss “way ahead and next step"", an employee working for the Norwegian telecom company’s Indian subsidiary in Andhra Pradesh circle said.
Confirming the move, Airtel said “not all people from Telenor India will find meaningful roles within Airtel"". 
The Department of Telecom on 14 May approved the merger — a move that will make the subscriber base of Sunil Mittal-led firm almost twice the size of new entrant Reliance Jio.
Both the companies had entered into an agreement for the deal in February 2017.
A Telenor employee said he attended a meeting with HR officials of Airtel after receipt of a mail yesterday. “They told me that post merger, they have no place for my position. They offered me five months salary and asked my resignation letter. I have not decided what to do, the employee told PTI on condition of anonymity.
An Airtel source said Telenor India has around 1,400 employees and 700 of them had been absorbed. 
Airtel offered “good financial"" package besides continuance of medical insurance and free calls to the dropouts, the source said.
A spokesperson of Airtel said the company has already “on-boarded over 700 people from Telenor India and provided them growth opportunities"" across its (Airtels) India and international operations.

New Delhi: Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Thursday urged the Delhi high court to dismiss the suit of Reliance Jio against its advertisements offering “live and free access"" to IPL 2018 coverage.
Justice Yogesh Khanna, before whom Airtel moved the plea, issued notice to Jio and sought its stand before the next date of hearing on 2 July. Senior advocate Dayan Krishnan, appearing for Jio, told the court that a division bench of the high court has modified Justice Khanna’s interim orders in the matter and against that it has moved the Supreme Court which is expected to hear it tomorrow. 
He said in the present facts and circumstances, there was no urgency in the matter. Taking note of the submission, the court declined to give an early date of hearing, as sought by Airtel’s lawyer. The division bench of the high court on 10 May had modified its single judge’s interim orders and questioned the maintainability of the suit filed by Jio alleging that Airtel’s advertisement was “deceptive and misleading"". 
The single judge in his 2 May order had asked Airtel to use the font of 12 pixels in print media and that too in a prominent and visible place and not at the bottom. The order had also said, “So far as the video clips/television advertisements are concerned the disclaimer should start running from the word the girl says ‘Seasonal Pass-------------’ and it should be displayed in sync with the voiceover."" The disclaimer in billboards and hoardings be also at a prominent place, it had said. 
Prior to that, on 13 April the single judge had asked Airtel to carry a disclaimer in bold stating that under its ‘live and free access offer’ the only subscription to video streaming platform Hotstar would be free and data charges according to the subscriber’s plan would apply. 
The 2 May direction came after Reliance Jio moved an application alleging that the 13 April order was not complied with by Airtel. The division bench in its 10 May decision had upheld the 2 May order to the extent it directed Airtel to use font size of 12 pixel in its print media advertisements and set aside the remaining directions. 
The bench also upheld the 13 April order. The Jio, in its suit, had claimed that the advertisements “falsely proclaim"" that Airtel was offering “live and free"" access to T20 cricket coverage and also “falsely represent that a subscriber need only obtain a 4G sim from the defendant company and download the Airtel TV app to obtain a virtual season pass, that is live and free access to T20 coverage""."

“We have stepped up investments on home broadband. We do 400,000-500,000 home passes a year. Last year we did almost 2 million home passes,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter said requesting anonymity.
The company aims to achieve another 2-4 million home passes in 2018-19 and expand in its key markets such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai.
In the wired internet segment, fibre is distributed to the homes via an optical distribution frame with a single fibre dedicated to each customer’s home, which is termed a home pass.
A formal commercial launch of Reliance Jio broadband will shake up this segment and average revenue per user (ARPU) is expected to drop. The company has already initiated beta trials for its wired broadband service across regions in New Delhi and Mumbai, with unlimited internet at 100 mbps for a security deposit of Rs4,500.
“Airtel has under-invested in home broadband so far...the investment behind this segment will be in the ballpark range of few hundred crores out of the overall capital expenditure of $4 billion by Airtel in 2018-19,"" said the person cited above.
At present, Airtel provides wired broadband up to 100 mbps to 2.1 million users across 89 cities in India. As of quarter ended 31 March, Airtel’s average revenue per user from its ‘Homes Services’ segment was Rs929, registering a decrease of 12.6% year-on-year. Broadband customers account for 94% of its ‘Homes Services’ segment.
Last month, Airtel upped its game and introduced a new home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of Rs2,990 with 1,200GB of data. This plan comes with free subscription to Airtel’s OTT apps—Wynk Music and Airtel TV."

When contacted, an Airtel spokesperson said that the company has already written to the DoT on 15 May and clarified that it is in compliance with the licence conditions and why “Reliance Jio’s complaint is fallacious and needs to be rejected"".
“It appears that this particular communication from the DoT (which is dated 17 May 2018) has not taken into account our communication. We would like to reiterate that this is yet another frivolous complaint by Reliance Jio and we will respond to it at the appropriate forums,"" the spokesperson said.
Airtel in its 15 May letter said that all information relating to customers, network nodes, etc., along with provision for lawful interception, are hosted in a fully secure manner by the company in India. It stated that no network node or information or data, as alleged by Reliance Jio, has been hosted outside of India.
Airtel’s letter said that network node referred by Reliance Jio appears to be an inventory server, called SMDP server of eSIM, which is not the network node of the company. The letter said that network related information on SIM or eSIM to enable mobile devices connect with network is loaded by SIM makers outside India.
Airtel said that Reliance Jio itself is using SMDP servers installed outside India, which it has not disclosed to the DoT. A company official on condition of anonymity said that charges levelled by the rival are baseless and the SMDP server used by Reliance Jio is located inside India."

New Delhi: Airtel Payments Bank on Thursday said that it has appointed former ICICI Bank senior executive Anubrata Biswas as its managing director and CEO. 
“We are delighted to have Anubrata on board. I am confident that his experience will add immense value to the bank’s agenda of financial inclusion and digital leadership. I wish him the very best for his new assignment,"" Airtel Payments Bank chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal said in a statement. 
In his new role, Biswas will be responsible for driving Airtel Payments Bank’s mission of taking convenient and innovative digital banking services to the doorstep of every Indian, the statement said. Prior to joining Airtel Payments Bank, Biswas was the joint general manager and retail business head - South India, for ICICI Bank and was responsible for managing the retail banking business across over 550 branches of the bank. 
The appointment of Biswas comes five months after the exit of Shashi Arora, the first MD and CEO of Airtel Payments Bank. The resignation of Arora coincided with suspension of Airtel Payments Bank e-KYC licence by Aadhaar-issuing body Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) in December. 
The UIDAI had barred Bharti Airtel and Airtel Payments Bank from conducting Aadhaar-based verification of customers using the e-KYC process. Later, it allowed Airtel to conduct Aadhaar-based verification of mobile subscriber but e-KYC licence for Airtel Payments Bank continues to be suspended. 
The action was taken following allegations that Bharti Airtel was using the Aadhaar-e-KYC-based SIM verification process to open payments bank accounts of its subscribers without their ‘informed consent’. Airtel Payments Bank was the first payments bank to start operations in India."

Mumbai: The family of billionaire Sunil Mittal, who controls India’s biggest mobile phone operator Bharti Airtel Ltd, is looking to invest more than $1 billion into a hotel chain founded by his son-in-law in London, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The money, which would come from a unit of Mittal’s Bharti Group that handles the founding family’s wealth, would fund acquisitions by Sharan Pasricha’s Ennismore, a developer that owns the Gleneagles resort and Hoxton hotel chain, which is expanding in the US and Europe, said the people, who asked not to be identified as the matter is private.
“Bharti Global, an arm of Bharti Enterprises, is investing in the development of hospitality business in Europe and the US in partnership with Ennismore Ltd, a company owned and managed by Sharan Pasricha. Ennismore is the development manager, operator and owner of the Hoxton brand. It develops, manages and operates the hospitality investments of Bharti Global as well others in addition to owning and Managing its own F&B business,"" a spokesperson for Bharti Global said.
The injection would help Pasricha acquire and convert properties in trendy urban areas in US and European cities into hotels aimed at appealing to younger travellers. Hoxton, known for its casual atmosphere and affordable rates, operates two hotels in the London neighbourhoods of Shoreditch and Holborn and one each in Amsterdam and Paris. The brand has 667 rooms across these three cities.
Ennismore said in an email it’s partners with Bharti Global, which makes investments for the Mittal family, and declined to comment further. A Bharti Global representative declined to comment.
Street Art
Pasricha, who’s married to Mittal’s daughter Eiesha, ran a media startup, then a leather-goods factory and private equity before getting into the hotel business. Pasricha acquired the first Hoxton in Shoreditch, an east London neighborhood known for street art. The second in Holborn in 2014 was followed by Amsterdam in 2015 and Paris in 2017.
Hoxton is developing hotels in New York City’s hip neighborhood of Williamsburg, Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, with plans to start opening some of them this year, according to its website. By 2020, the firm expects to add locations in Chicago, San Francisco and in London’s Southwark and Shepherd’s Bush.
Ennismore also acquired the 232-room Gleneagles resort in Scotland in 2015 and is planning a new chain called NoCo—a budget hotel format it is positioning as “less boring""—to open its first location in 2019.

New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base Bharti Airtel Ltd plans to soon offer its customers an integrated billing system for their fixed-line, broadband, postpaid mobile and DTH (direct to home) connections with a 5-10% discount on the combined bill, a person aware of the matter said. 
New Delhi: India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base Bharti Airtel Ltd plans to soon offer its customers an integrated billing system for their fixed-line, broadband, postpaid mobile and DTH (direct to home) connections with a 5-10% discount on the combined bill, a person aware of the matter said.
The move is aimed at retaining consumers in the hyper-competitive telecom sector.
“Airtel is testing a digital platform that would enable customers to bundle all their Airtel connections into one single bill and do away with hassle of multiple bill cycles...customers can also expect 5-10% discount on the combined total bill,"" the person said, requesting anonymity.
This, the company expects, would also lead to consumer stickiness in a market that rival Reliance Jio disrupted in September 2016 through cheap data tariffs and free voice calls. 
Interestingly, Jio also plans to launch a bundled product that would offer broadband access at 100 mbps speed, entertainment through JioTV and unlimited calling through a VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) phone for less than  ₹ 1,000 a month when it launches its fibre-to-home services later this year.
“Airtel is currently testing this service in Hyderabad and expects to launch this over the next 7-10 days starting with southern cities. Airtel home broadband customers will be the first to get this service,"" the person said. An email query sent to Airtel was unanswered till press time.
Meanwhile, Airtel also plans to push its home broadband offerings in new cities and expand its network coverage in key markets such as Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, Kolkata and Chennai ahead of a likely commercial launch by Reliance Jio later this year.
For this, Airtel will step up investments behind the home broadband segment by a few hundred crores out of the overall capital expenditure of $4 billion in 2018-19, Mint had reported on 16 May.
Last month, Airtel upped its game and introduced a new home broadband plan with speeds of up to 300 mbps at a monthly rental of  ₹ 2,199 with 1,200GB of data. This plan comes with free subscription to Airtel’s OTT apps—Wynk Music and Airtel TV.
At present, Airtel provides wired broadband up to 100 mbps to 2.1 million users across 89 cities in India. As of the quarter ending March, Airtel’s average revenue per user from its ‘Homes Services’ segment was Rs929, registering a decrease of 12.6% year-on-year. Broadband customers account for 94% of its ‘Homes Services’ segment.
As of March end, the company had 304 million mobile customers of which 94% were prepaid customers while Airtel DTH had 14.2 million customers with an average revenue per user of Rs228. Mint could, however, not ascertain the number of customers who use all four services—fixed-line, broadband, postpaid and DTH connections."

Kotak Institutional Equities has an interesting report that draws parallels between the famous dollar auction game and the Indian telecom sector. The dollar auction game was used by economist Martin Shubik, a pioneer of game theory, to illustrate a concept known as “escalation of commitment"". Since the highest bidder wins the dollar, and the second highest bidder loses all that he/she has bid, those playing the game tend to keep bidding higher amounts to avoid losing what they have already bet. 
Kotak Institutional Equities has an interesting report that draws parallels between the famous dollar auction game and the Indian telecom sector. The dollar auction game was used by economist Martin Shubik, a pioneer of game theory, to illustrate a concept known as “escalation of commitment"". Since the highest bidder wins the dollar, and the second highest bidder loses all that he/she has bid, those playing the game tend to keep bidding higher amounts to avoid losing what they have already bet.
Shubik says it is not uncommon for the person conducting the game to end up with $3-5 for every dollar that was auctioned. In such scenarios, the winning bidder would have ended up paying roughly between $1.5 and $2.5, with the losing bidder ending up losing a similar amount, give or take a few cents. Of course, the winning bidder’s losses will be lower when compared to the second highest bidder, since he gains the auctioned dollar, but both end up losing when bidding is competitive.
Could the fate of India’s largest telecom companies be the same? Every passing day, they increase their bids to gain a higher share of the market. They are doing this by increasing capital expenditure, and a willingness to fund large operating losses in the hope of a glorious future, where all of this will be recouped. 
In the three-headed slugfest between Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and the Vodafone-Idea combine, each entity has already spent somewhere between  ₹ 2 trillion and  ₹ 3 trillion in gross capital investments. 
But the sharp rise in investments, especially since the entry of Reliance Jio, has also led to a shrinking of the market size. As the chart above shows, industry revenues have fallen by about a third since Reliance Jio’s entry. And this is before the new entrant’s latest salvo that involved a sharp cut in post-paid tariffs and international calling rates. Who knows what lies next?
In this backdrop, even a sizeable 50% market share may not amount to much in terms of profit potential. “We have seen spectrum auction bids and commercial decisions add up to an ‘escalation of commitment’ and undesirable outcomes, as things stand today,"" Kotak’s analysts write in the report.
“The game (between telecom firms) has the potential to reach a stage where aggressive bids are placed just to force another player to exit; such aggression again reduces the size of the prize but a player can still look at the trade-off between reduced size of the prize and potentially higher share of it as a net positive. Commitments escalate easily,"" they add.
Such scenarios haven’t been restricted to dollar-auction games in the past; they have played out often in real-life scenarios as well. In a paper published in the Journal of Marketing, researchers Eyal Biyalogorsky, William Boulding and Richard Staelin say that the occurrence of “escalation of commitment"" phenomenon is a well documented one. They cite the examples of “the Vietnam War and Desert Storm, the Apollo moon missions, the Campeau–Federated merger, the coffee wars between Philip Morris and Procter & Gamble, the National Basketball Association draft etc."", adding that the tendency to escalate commitments can be disastrous for firms, especially in hyper-competitive markets.
Kotak’s analysts say, “It is possible for a net-positive win-win outcome to emerge when players realize that the size of the prize and the cost associated with getting to a particular share matter as much as the share itself."" But this will involve so-called de-escalation bids, such as increasing tariffs and similar sane decisions. Now, who wants to bet on that?"

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has approached the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), accusing Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd of making false and misleading claims in its latest advertisement. ASCI has upheld the complaint. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has approached the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), accusing Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd of making false and misleading claims in its latest advertisement. ASCI has upheld the complaint.
This is the latest round in the war of words between the two telecom operators. 
Since Reliance Jio’s entry, the two operators have locked horns over network testing norms, provision of points of interconnect, the cut in interconnect usage charges and advertisements. Last month, Bharti Airtel had moved the fast-track complaints panel of the council alleging that Reliance Jio, in its latest advertisement starring actor Deepika Padukone, had falsely claimed that it was the “best network and the world’s largest mobile data network"", besides offering “best entertainment"" and “best postpaid offers"".
The claims, Airtel argued, were unsubstantiated and there was no clarification or independent third-party data to back them. Moreover, since these claims were made without any supporting evidence or disclaimers, the advertisement violated ASCI guidelines, Airtel said in the complaint.
The panel, after concluding a personal hearing with Reliance Jio, observed that Reliance Jio may carry the largest quantum of data consumed by subscribers globally, but data consumption cannot be the only parameter for claims that it was the largest mobile data network. It said infrastructure as well as the number of subscribers are also important parameters and, therefore, Reliance Jio’s claim of “best network and world’s largest mobile data network"" is misleading by ambiguity.
Mint has reviewed a copy of the panel’s recommendation as well as Airtel’s complaint to the panel. “The panel is also not in agreement with a blanket claim of the advertiser’s (Reliance Jio’s) offers being the best postpaid offers since it is not clear what aspects of the advertiser’s product are being compared with that of the competitor’s product,"" ASCI said in the letter. The panel also said Reliance Jio’s self-proclaimed claim of “best entertainment"" was not substantiated and is misleading by ambiguity.
A Reliance Jio spokesperson said, “The allegations made by the incumbent dominant operator are thoroughly frivolous and have been made only to distract others. This specific matter is currently under discussion with the ASCI. We believe that the recommendations at this stage do not reflect the submissions made, and the favourable views expressed by the ASCI during the course of discussions. We have followed up with further submissions and clarifications so that the right decision is made.""
It is likely that ASCI and Reliance Jio will meet again on 18 June, a person aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
This is not the first such controversy on advertisements between the two telecom operators. In March 2017, Reliance Jio accused Bharti Airtel of airing misleading ads on network data speed and ASCI, after investigating the matter, asked Airtel to withdraw the advertisement. Reliance Jio moved the metropolitan magistrate’s court after Airtel advertisements started appearing again in June, but in August the court dismissed its plea."

Nairobi:The Kenyan unit of Bharti Airtel has abandoned plans to merge with Telkom Kenya to take on the market leading operator, Safaricom, people in the industry and government said on Monday.
People aware of the matter said in April that Airtel and Telkom Kenya were planning to merge to create a stronger challenger to Safaricom, which has 72% of subscribers, or around 30 million subscriptions.
“Airtel developed cold feet,"" said a person in the industry, who declined to be named. 
Airtel, owned by India’s Bharti Airtel, did not respond to a request for comment.
Joe Mucheru, the minister for information and communication, said he was aware of the walkout by Airtel. 
The proposed merger broke down over a number of issues, particularly Airtel resisting to make a commitment to significant future investments in the company, the person said.
The sector regulator, Communications Authority of Kenya, said neither Telkom nor Airtel had formally communicated with it about their deal.
Telkom Kenya, which is controlled by Africa-focused, London-based Helios Investment, declined to comment. 
Telkom and Airtel have a combined 23% of Kenya’s 41 million mobile subscribers.
Data from the regulator showed Airtel had increased its users by more than a million in the last quarter of last year, benefiting from a call by the opposition for its supporters to boycott Safaricom."
481,2018-06-13,Airtel,"Trai's March quarter financial report puts Reliance Jio's adjusted gross revenue at ₹6,218 crore22% higher than Vodafone India and only 12% lower than Airtel

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) financial report for the March quarter puts Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) at  ₹ 6,218 crore. This is about 22% higher than Vodafone India Ltd’s revenue and only 12% lower than market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd’s AGR of  ₹ 7,087 crore.  
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) financial report for the March quarter puts Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s adjusted gross revenue (AGR) at  ₹ 6,218 crore. This is about 22% higher than Vodafone India Ltd’s revenue and only 12% lower than market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd’s AGR of  ₹ 7,087 crore. 
Based on these numbers, Reliance Jio has a market share of as much as 25.6%, less than two years since its launch. Vodafone and Idea Cellular Ltd, both of whom had a head start of about two decades over Reliance Jio, had an AGR market share of 21% and 16.6%, respectively.
But apparently, the AGR figure needs to be adjusted some more to reflect true market share. The AGR reported by telcos for their various circles does not fully capture revenues subscribers pay for roaming and national long distance (NLD) calls. As such, it makes sense to add NLD revenues reported by telcos, to the extent these are used by their captive subscribers, and arrive at, if you will, adjusted AGR (AAGR).
Based on estimates of Kotak Institutional Equities, after making these adjustments, Reliance Jio’s market share stands at 20.7%. We made another adjustment to reflect revenues of Aircel Ltd, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year and didn’t bother reporting revenues to Trai.
Based on this so-called AAGR data, Reliance Jio has a market share of 20.4%, which is not much lower than Vodafone’s 21.5%. So while the new entrant may not be No.2 yet, it isn’t far away from the mark.
The company may well reach that milestone in the June quarter, although it may get relegated back to the third position after Vodafone and Idea announce their merger.
While Reliance Jio has quickly grabbed a fifth of the market, its cut-throat pricing has also led to a fall of over a third in the revenue of large incumbents. Small firms’ revenues have fallen by 85%, and it’s only a matter of time before they completely disappear.
Since Reliance Jio’s launch, the overall industry size has fallen by about 30% based on the above-mentioned AAGR data. A moot question is how much lower it can go with Reliance Jio aggressively continuing to vie for a larger piece of the pie. 
As pointed out earlier in this column, Reliance Jio’s actions suggest it is happy to live with a high share of a market that has shrunk considerably, rather than a lower share in an unshrunk market. As the drop in revenues in the past six quarters show, that is extremely bad news for incumbents."

New Delhi: In what could be seen as a transformation rare in businesses, especially one triggered by a rival, Bharti Airtel Ltd is steadily morphing into a technology-led company from being India’s largest telecom operator, a top company executive said.
“Our ambition is to build a digital Airtel...,"" Gopal Vittal, chief executive officer of Airtel, said in an interview.
“In addition to being a telecom company, we are asking ourselves what more can we do riding on the infrastructure that we have built. I think there are some logical things you can do on top of the telecom game: financial services, data centres, enterprise, home broadband. And then finally, things that are a little bit out there where the business model is less proven—content—where we are making bets but these are not big bets that are busting the company,"" Vittal said.
Airtel’s current move to transform itself comes after it has become imperative to build multiple non-wireless revenue streams—something that rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd already has in its blueprint with the upcoming launch of fibre-to-the-home and aggressive plans to set up data centres and build teams for artificial intelligence and IoT—especially at a time when revenues from the wireless and broadband business are shrinking across the industry. 
Reliance Jio, for example, has made a string of acquisitions targeted at the content space. It also sees opportunities in sectors such as healthcare and education sector where offerings can ride on its telecom pipe. Reliance Jio parent Reliance Industries Ltd also plans to use the tech prowess of Reliance Jio to foray into e-commerce, Mint reported on 14 June.
Airtel, too, sees data centres as a big revenue opportunity. It now plans to consolidate 108 MSCs (mobile switching centres, which connect calls by switching digital voice data packets from one network path to another) spread across the country to 12 large data centres, which it believes will make it the largest data centre operation in the country. “We are in the process of construction in Pune, Chennai and in Kolkata and we will have these 12 in the next 18-24 months,"" Vittal said.
Airtel attracted controversy when it was barred by the Unique Identification Authority of India from conducting Aadhaar-based verification of customers using the e-KYC process. It later allowed Airtel to conduct Aadhaar-based verification of mobile subscribers, but the e-KYC licence for Airtel Payments Bank remains suspended.
“We were chasing growth and we were perhaps complying with the letter but not the spirit so we inconvenienced customers when the DBT credits went in without their explicit consent to their bank accounts. We have significantly corrected our systems,"" Vittal said."

In Hyderabad, Airtel has removed its fair usage policy (FUP) limits for its broadband customers, which means that you get unlimited data.
By paying a rental of  ₹ 349, Airtel is offering unlimited data and phone calls to all its broadband customers with a maximum bandwidth of 8 Mbps. At  ₹ 699 rental, Airtel customers can increase their broadband speed up to 40 Mbps and also get free subscription to Amazon Prime. If you want more speed, then at  ₹ 1,299 you can get up to 100 Mbps bandwidth.
So far, most broadband plans had been providing unlimited data to users but with a certain cap, beyond which the speed was throttled to 512Kbps.
In other cities, Airtel is trying to woo broadband subscribers with bonus data. In Delhi, a monthly plan of  ₹ 799 GB, offering data speed of up to 40 Mbps, comes with bonus data of 500 GB till 31 October. If you opt for the  ₹ 999 plan, then the speed increases to 100 Mbps, broadband data limit to 250 GB and 1,000 GB bonus data. The plan also gives you free Amazon Prime subscription. 
In Mumbai, the  ₹ 699 Airtel plan offers broadband data of 40 GB at 40 Mbps speed, besides 500 GB of bonus data.
A six-month Airtel broadband plan comes to you at a discount of up to 15% and the 12-month plan with up to 20% discount.
MTNL customers can get free 3G connection and data up to 10 GB with broadband connection. Existing customer can also avail this offer. MTNL, which operates out of Mumbai and Delhi, has also increased usage quota for its broadband plans. The  ₹ 750 plan which earlier offered 65 GB data now offers 10 GB extra. Similarly, the  ₹ 1,299 plan, which offered 130 GB data, now offers 180 GB data.
Will Reliance JioGigaFiber disrupt broadband market?
Reliance Jio GigaFiber, the fixed line fiber-based broadband services from Reliance Jio, will be rolled out across 1,100 cities of India gradually this year with speeds up to 1 Gbps. Currently, Reliance Jio is running beta trials of Jio GigaFiber in tens of thousands of homes.
Starting this Independence Day, 15 August, you can start registering your interest for Jio GigaFiber through both MyJio app and Jio.com. 
At Reliance Industries AGM last week, chairman Mukesh Ambani had spelt out his ambition in the broadband market clearly when he said that Jio GigaFiber aims to be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout anywhere in the world.
So far, nothing is known about the pricing of Jio GigaFiber but it is being speculated in the market that the pricing plans will be disruptive just like what Reliance Jio did to mobile phone calling rates and mobile internet rates.
Reliance Jio is targeting 5 crore JioGigaFiber home customers and 3 crore small merchants and shop-keepers."

New Delhi: Airtel Payments Bank Ltd has received requisite approvals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to start onboarding customers using Aadhaar based e-KYC (know your customer), the bank said on Thursday. 
This comes as a big relief to the bank which has not been able to enrol customers since January. “We thank the authorities for the approvals. We remain committed to the government’s vision of financial inclusion and banking for all,"" said a spokesperson of the bank.
In December last year, the UIDAI had temporarily suspended Airtel and its payments bank from conducting Aadhaar-based verification of its mobile customers as well as those of the bank using the e-KYC process after receiving complaints that it was opening payments bank accounts without the explicit consent of users. It was also alleged that government subsidies were being credited in these accounts without the knowledge of users.
The telco had deposited  ₹ 2.5 crore as penalty with the UIDAI. It also credited back  ₹ 138 crore of funds under the direct benefit transfer scheme to the original accounts of 5.6 million beneficiaries. Following this, the UIDAI decided to conditionally allow Bharti Airtel Ltd to resume Aadhaar-based e-KYC verification of telecom subscribers. However, the suspension of the e-KYC licence of Airtel Payments Bank was not revoked.
In January, RBI directed the bank not to onboard new customers. In March, RBI also imposed a penalty of  ₹ 5 crore on the bank for violating operating guidelines and KYC norms. The fine was imposed after RBI scrutinized the bank’s documents relating to the opening of accounts without specific or clear consent from the customers. Airtel Payments Bank had denied any wrongdoing and streamlined its processes to comply with the regulations.
Airtel Payments Bank was the first payments bank to start operations on 12 January last year with an investment of  ₹ 3,000 crore. Other payments banks that have started operations are India Post Payments Bank Ltd, Paytm Payments Bank Ltd, Fino Payments Bank Ltd, Aditya Birla Idea Payments Bank and Jio Payments Bank.
Payments bank is a differentiated bank providing a limited range of products, such as acceptance of demand deposits and remittances of funds. It can accept a restricted deposit, which is currently limited to  ₹ 1 lakh per customer. However, these banks cannot issue loans and credit cards."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio has topped the chart of fastest 4G telecom operators with an average peak download speed of 22.3 mbps on its network while Idea Cellular registered highest upload speed in May, according to a Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) report.
 Jio’s national average of 4G download speed was more than double compared to its closest rival Bharti Airtel, which recorded download speed of 9.7 mbps, higher than 9.3 mbps it registered in April, on similar parameters, according to the data published by Trai on MySpeed Portal. 
Vodafone and Idea Cellular registered slight dip in download speeds in May at 6.7 and 6.1 megabit per second (mbps), respectively, compared to 6.8 mbps and 6.5 mbps respectively that was recorded in April. Idea, however, continued to top the chart in terms of 4G upload speed but with a slight dip compared to previous month. 
The download speed plays an important role when a user watches any video, browse Internet, access emails; and a good upload speed is required when a user wants to share data like images, videos and any other file through email or social media applications.
 Idea registered nationwide average peak upload speed of 5.9 mpbs in May compared to 6.3 mbps in April. It was followed by Vodafone which registered peak upload speed of 5.3 mbps, Jio 5.1 mbps and Airtel 3.8 mbps. 
Both Jio and Idea have continued to maintain their leadership in their respective segment since last several months. The average speed is computed by Trai based on data it collects with help of its MySpeed application on a real-time basis. Idea’s upload speed has shown declining trend since last March."

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd is looking to slash its debt by half over the next 18 months by raising a total of  ₹ 56,000 crore from the sale of a stake in its African unit and a phased sale of its holding in the entity created by the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel Ltd. Airtel had a long-term debt of about  ₹ 1.08 trillion as of 31 March, according to its quarterly report.

Airtel had a long-term debt of about  ₹ 1.08 trillion as of 31 March, according to its quarterly report.
Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal has been facing one of the toughest challenges since founding the company in 1995, as rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, backed by India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, disrupts business models of established telecom operators with cut-price tariffs. Reliance Jio’s entry has crimped profits of rival operators and forced them to spend more to keep pace with Jio’s investments. 
Airtel plans to raise $1.5 billion by selling 25% in its African unit, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. 
Airtel is also debating whether it should look to list its African unit on two exchanges—London or Amsterdam, and South Africa—the person said, adding that the unit will be listed by March-end.
The company will sell an additional 10-15% in the African holding company to Warburg Pincus to raise another $1.5 billion, the Economic Times newspaper reported on Thursday. 
“The company is also looking to offload its stake in the tower business, where it will hold 33% stake in the merged entity of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel Ltd,"" the person cited above said. The merged entity is valued at $15 billion. An Airtel spokesperson declined to comment. 
“All the funds will be used to cut debt... the company will fund its capex and opex needs through the cash it generates every year,"" the person said.
Maintaining a healthy balance sheet will be crucial since telecom operators will have to roll out fifth generation or 5G networks in a couple of years, triggering another round of capital expenditure, said a Mumbai-based analyst on condition of anonymity. 
“They need to bring down the debt to a manageable level in order raise money debt later for their capex requirements,"" the analyst said."

New Delhi: Chief technology officers of telecom operators Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have resigned from their respective companies. 
Reliance Jio Group chief technology officer Jagbir Singh had joined the company before the soft launch of 4G services. Prior to this assignment, Singh was working with Samsung, and had previously worked with Airtel for about a decade. 
According to a source, he is moving back to Delhi but did not disclose any further details. 
Email sent to Reliance Jio did not elicit any reply. 
Bharti Airtel’s chief technology officer for mobile networks, Shyam Prabhakar Mardikar has also put in his papers. 
When contacted, Bharti Airtel spokesperson confirmed the development. 
According to the source, Mardikar has resigned to move up the ladder in his career path. 
Mardikar has been with Airtel since August 2012. This was his second stint with the telecom major. 
Earlier, he has served Airtel for about a decade from 2001-2010 after quitting his job at the Department of Telecom. He was serving as CTO of Airtel’s mobile network since January 2017."
473,2018-07-24,Airtel,"Analysts estimate revenues of Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular will decline between 2.5% and 3% in the June quarter on an organic basis

The June quarter was fairly eventful for Indian telecom companies, at least as far as disruptive announcements by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd go. In May, the company announced post-paid tariffs that were less than half of prevailing offers from incumbents, coupled with far cheaper international calling rates. It also considerably increased the data allowance on its flagship plans. 
The June quarter was fairly eventful for Indian telecom companies, at least as far as disruptive announcements by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd go. In May, the company announced post-paid tariffs that were less than half of prevailing offers from incumbents, coupled with far cheaper international calling rates. It also considerably increased the data allowance on its flagship plans.
But the impact of these moves is expected to have been minimal in the June quarter, with the new post-paid services being available for only about half of the period. It was also the first full quarter of operations after the exit of Aircel Ltd, resulting in gains for incumbents. At the same time, downtrading by subscribers continues to cost-effective bundled plans, which means the decline in Arpu (average revenue per user) and revenues should continue for incumbents.
Not all smartphone users have migrated to bundled plans yet. According to analysts, Arpu of smartphone users remains higher than what Arpu of bundled plans imply, leaving room for downtrading still. Of course, the pace at which this migration occurs has reduced, which should result in a drop in the rate at which revenues are declining.
In the March quarter, revenues of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd’s India wireless operations had declined sequentially 3.7% and 5.7%, respectively. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities estimate their revenues will decline between 2.5% and 3% in the June quarter on an organic basis.
Of course, the lower rate of decline is hardly any comfort to investors. Both Airtel and Idea were running losses at the Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) level in the March quarter, and losses are expected to increase in the first quarter of this fiscal year.
Idea, for instance, is estimated to report losses of   ₹  1,331 crore, according to Kotak’s estimates, far higher than the loss of   ₹  193 crore a year ago. The company’s estimated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of   ₹  817 crore amounts to only two-thirds its estimated interest cost of  ₹ 1,200 crore. Vodafone India Ltd’s financial position isn’t expected to be far better, and the merged Vodafone-Idea entity will be heavily banking on a recovery in Arpu for avoiding breaches on their debt covenants.
But Jio’s move in the post-paid segment shows that it is no mood to relent. If anything, Arpus will be under downward pressure for some time to come. The company itself is expected to report a drop in Arpu in the first quarter, since it has waived the Prime subscription fee. Besides, subscribers who availed of cashback offers will also generate lower Arpus. Whether Jio also reports a drop in Ebitda will depend on how much of its expenses remain capitalized.
The company has also stepped up competition in the feature phone segment, after a somewhat muted response to its JioPhone offering. In July, it lowered the initial outgo for owning a JioPhone to a third of existing levels. The company also said it has set a target of 100 million users for the feature phone, compared to around 25 million in early July.
In the smartphone segment, Jio continues to report decent growth rates, with its overall base having risen to 215 million subscribers in early July, compared to 186.6 million in end March. As long as new subscribers are being added at a fast clip, Jio can be expected to maintain current tariff levels. After all, why unnecessarily rock the growth engine? Those hoping for a recovery in tariffs may need to wait much longer."

New Delhi: Mobile tower arm of telecom major Bharti Airtel, Infratel on Wednesday said it has received clearance from stock exchanges for its merger with Indus Towers.  
New Delhi: Mobile tower arm of telecom major Bharti Airtel, Infratel on Wednesday said it has received clearance from stock exchanges for its merger with Indus Towers. 
It will now approach National Company Law Tribunal for its approval, the company said. 
“We are pleased to inform you that “no adverse observation"" letter has been received from the stock exchange for the proposed merger of Bharti Infratel Limited and Indus Towers Limited. The Company will file the first motion petition before the National Company Law Tribunal in due course,"" Bharti Infratel said in filing at both BSE and NSE. 
In April this year, Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group had announced an agreement for the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China. 
It will have over 163,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas in India. The combined company will own 100% of Indus Towers—jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42% holding), Vodafone (42%), Idea Group (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%). 
Post the deal, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company, and the transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018-19, subject to statutory approvals. 
The deal gives Idea Group an option to sell its 11.5% stake in Indus Towers for cash or in lieu of receiving new shares. 
Providence too has the option to receive cash or shares for 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding in Indus Towers with balance exchanged for shares. 
As per the deal structure, Vodafone will be issued 783.1 million new shares in the merged entity in exchange for its 42% stake in Indus Towers, and this could take its holding to 29.4% in new company depending on the options finally taken by Idea and Providence. 
Similarly, Airtel’s stake in new combined tower behemoth may be diluted to 37.2% in the combined entity from 53.5% it currently holds in Bharti Infratel. 
The transaction values Indus Towers at an enterprise value of Rs71,500 crore. Bharti Infratel stock was trading 0.44% up at Rs287.6 on BSE in the afternoon."

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd reported a consolidated net profit during the June quarter (Q1) on the back of a deferred tax gain of  ₹  515.6 crore, which helped it avoid a loss, as the brutal tariff war triggered by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd continued unabated during the quarter. Net profit fell to  ₹  97.3 crore in the three months ended 30 June from  ₹  367.3 crore in the year earlier, the telecom operator said in a statement on Thursday. Consolidated revenues for the June quarter stood at  ₹  20,080 crore, down from  ₹  21, 958 crore a year ago.

Net profit fell to  ₹  97.3 crore in the three months ended 30 June from  ₹  367.3 crore in the year earlier, the telecom operator said in a statement on Thursday. Consolidated revenues for the June quarter stood at  ₹  20,080 crore, down from  ₹  21, 958 crore a year ago.
Pricing pressure is evident from the fact that Airtel’s data customer base rose 51.5% during the June quarter from a year earlier to 94.78 million users in India during the quarter.
“Bharti Airtel would have reported loss had it not been for the deferred tax gain in Africa,"" said an analyst tracking the telecom sector with a domestic brokerage who didn’t want to be named.
“For Airtel, the mobile wireless business has been a sour point during the quarter, and segments that have held out apart from the African business are the DTH, digital, power and enterprise businesses,"" the analyst added.
A Bloomberg poll of 14 analysts had pegged Bharti Airtel’s net sales at  ₹  19,873.4 crore for the quarter. Another Bloomberg poll of seven analysts had estimated the company would report a loss of  ₹  427.1 crore for the quarter.
Telecom operators, reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard in the December quarter, and subsequently the June quarter, after the telecom regulator’s decision to slash interconnection usage charges (IUC) levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Later, in another blow, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) also cut the international call termination charge from 53 paise a minute to 30 paise a minute, effective 1 February. The termination charge is payable by an international long-distance operator to the Indian telecom operator on whose network an overseas call terminates.
“Our investments have led to some operational expense headwinds in this quarter, but we remain focused on structural cost containment. With consolidation largely done, the secular opportunity of the Indian telecom market continues to excite us and we remain committed to offer best-in-class services to all consumers,"" Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive of (India and South Asia) at Bharti Airtel, said in a statement.
“Aggressively expanding our 4G capacities and continuing to offer highest data speeds to customers remains a key priority for us, and towards this end, the quarter has seen our highest quarterly capital expenditure of  ₹  7,887 crore,"" Vittal added.
Consolidated Ebitda fell to  ₹  6,837 crore in the quarter ended June, down from  ₹  7,823 crore a year ago, Airtel said. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Airtel’s June quarter revenues from India fell 13%, year on year, to  ₹  14,930 crore on an underlying basis, primarily due to a drop in the mobile business, the company said.
Airtel’s monthly average revenue per user, or ARPU, in India fell sharply to  ₹  105 in the June quarter from  ₹  154 a year ago. The number of minutes spent on calls on its network, however, grew 62.2% in India during the quarter while the total data usage per customer on its network rose 201.2% from a year earlier.
The company’s consolidated net debt has increased to  ₹  1,02,902.8 crore in the June quarter from  ₹  87,840.4 crore during the year-ago period.
The performance of Airtel’s Africa unit has saved the company some blushes. In constant currency terms, the Africa revenues for the June quarter grew 14%, year on year, as the data customer base grew 45.2% and voice minutes on network increased by 43.8% on a yearly basis, the company said.
In addition to Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel will now also face intensifying competition from Vodafone-Idea Cellular, whose merger was announced by the department of telecommunications today.
According to Bloomberg data, Bharti Airtel had 344.55 million users as of end-May compared with 273.63 million a year earlier.
On Thursday, shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose 1.63%, or  ₹  5.75, to  ₹  357.60 on the BSE while the benchmark Sensex gained 0.34%, or 126.41 points, to end the day at 36,984.64 points."

Bharti Airtel Ltd reported a consolidated pre-tax loss for the first time in years, thanks to continued erosion in the profitability of its mainstay India wireless business. The mobile business reported a loss before interest and tax of  ₹ 878 crore, or 8.4% of revenue. A year ago, the segment had an Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 9.8%. 
Bharti Airtel Ltd reported a consolidated pre-tax loss for the first time in years, thanks to continued erosion in the profitability of its mainstay India wireless business. The mobile business reported a loss before interest and tax of  ₹ 878 crore, or 8.4% of revenue. A year ago, the segment had an Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) margin of 9.8%.
What’s more, cash burn from wireless operations in the June quarter stood at  ₹ 4,175 crore, almost as much as the deficit in the whole of fiscal year 2017-18. And as if all this isn’t bad enough, there’s more pain to come.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has only recently launched post-paid and international calling services, with its impact yet to be seen. Almost in tandem, it has become more aggressive in pursuing feature phone users by lowering the entry cost of its JioPhone. Both these segments account for a sizeable share of Airtel’s revenues, and defending its share can be a costly affair.
The silver lining in Airtel’s results is that it has been far more successful than Vodafone India Ltd in defending its subscriber and revenue shares. The latter reported a 1.3% and a 1.6% sequential decline in subscribers and revenues, respectively, in the June quarter. Airtel did far better, with its subscriber base growing by 4% sequentially on an organic basis. Its revenues were flat, after excluding a contribution of around  ₹ 125 crore owing to the consolidation of Telenor India’s operations from the middle of the quarter. 
Of course, Airtel was far more aggressive in the marketplace, offering competitive tariffs to a set of its customers. As a result, its Arpu (average revenue per user) fell 6% to  ₹ 109, excluding the newly acquired Telenor subscribers. Vodafone’s Arpu fell at a much lower pace, but it also ended up losing some subscribers to competition. 
From an investor’s perspective, another consolation is that Airtel’s Africa business continues to grow profits steadily. The African business now accounts for over 70% of consolidated Ebit, providing a meaningful buffer for the company.
The worrying bit, of course, is that losses in the Indian wireless operations continue to mount. Pre-tax losses nearly doubled sequentially to around  ₹ 1,000 crore after excluding the contribution from Telenor. And, as pointed earlier, they are likely to increase further in the coming quarters."

Payments through UPI will enhance customer experience by removing the hassle of typing card details or netbanking/wallet passwords and will eventually drive adoption of digital payments, Razorpay said in a statement. 
Razorpay’s payment gateway will process more than five million transactions a month on the Airtel website and mobile app, it added.

Mumbai: The sharp drop in telecom tariffs in the past two years has wreaked havoc on the financial health of Indian telecom firms. The surviving telcos are in dire straits. Idea Cellular Ltd reported pre-tax losses of  ₹ 2,817 crore in the June quarter, compared to a profit of  ₹  600 crore in the June 2016 quarter, ahead of Reliance Jio’s launch. Its debt has reached unsustainable levels of 19 times annualised Q1 Ebitda. And although things will get better after the merger with Vodafone India, and the resulting cost synergies, unless substantial equity is brought in, leverage of the merged entity will be at damaging levels.

Its debt has reached unsustainable levels of 19 times annualised Q1 Ebitda. And although things will get better after the merger with Vodafone India, and the resulting cost synergies, unless substantial equity is brought in, leverage of the merged entity will be at damaging levels.
Both companies have lagged far behind Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel Ltd with respect to investments in their network. Reliance Jio has stepped up investments lately with capital expenditure of  ₹  17,000 crore and  ₹  14,000 crore in the preceding two quarters.
Idea, with its balance sheet constraints, spent  ₹  7,000 crore on capex in all of financial year 2017-18. The gap is already beginning to show in subscriber numbers.
Until recently, when networks of Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd were shutting down, Idea and Vodafone had the advantage of increasing subscriber numbers by going after customers leaving those networks. But now, it turns out that they are the most vulnerable among surviving telcos.
According to an analyst with a domestic institutional brokerage, Reliance Jio’s incremental market share is largely expected to come at the expense of the Vodafone Idea combine.
While Airtel is far better placed in terms of its balance sheet, the deterioration in the profitability of its India wireless business has been equally dramatic. In the June quarter, it reported a loss before tax of around  ₹  2,000 crore, compared to a profit of  ₹  2,340 crore ahead of Reliance Jio’s launch. And things are getting progressively worse. It burnt cash worth  ₹ 4,200 crore last quarter, almost as much as it did in the whole of financial year 2017-18. As pointed above, this is driven by the need to increase data capacities, leading to higher capital expenditure.
Reliance Jio, interestingly, appears to be immune from all of the pain in the sector. It has reported profits for its wireless business in the past three quarters.
But its accounting has some quirks, including a different depreciation policy compared to peers, making comparisons difficult.
It’s best, then, to look at cash burn. On this measure, it leads the charts with cash burn of over  ₹ 40,000 crore in the previous financial year. This includes capex funded by creditors and capitalised interest costs. Put together, incumbents’ cash burn was a fraction of this.
Of course, Reliance Jio is yet to commercially launch its non-mobile businesses such as home broadband, and it remains to be seen how much this segment contributes to overall profits."
468,2018-08-02,Airtel,"Reliance Jio's disruption in broadband data services may be digital oxygen for consumers but is cutting the lifeline of Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is making life miserable for everyone—everyone, barring the consumer, that is. While four telecom firms have already folded up, Reliance Jio’s massive push to provide Indians with digital oxygen—which is how it refers to broadband data—is cutting the lifeline of even India’s largest telecom firms, including market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. Indebtedness at Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd has reached unwieldy levels. The only hope for investors and lenders is that tariffs increase from current levels.

While four telecom firms have already folded up, Reliance Jio’s massive push to provide Indians with digital oxygen—which is how it refers to broadband data—is cutting the lifeline of even India’s largest telecom firms, including market leader Bharti Airtel Ltd. Indebtedness at Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd has reached unwieldy levels. The only hope for investors and lenders is that tariffs increase from current levels.
But Reliance Jio itself seems content with current tariff levels. It has a lower cost structure compared to incumbents, and has been reporting profits in its wireless business. Besides, it hopes to recover a large part of its costs from the fixed broadband business, which is yet to be commercially launched. Then, there is the aspiration of being a platform business, which, according to some investors, will bring limitless opportunities.
What, then, could cause Reliance Jio to relent on pricing? If it does not and stays with its disruptive instincts, will other telcos survive?
“The current pricing in the telecom market is great from a consumer’s perspective… it is not great from a lender’s perspective. We have to be very, very cautious while taking exposure to the telecom sector,"" Rajnish Kumar, chairman, State Bank of India, said in an interview with Mint recently.
Much to the dismay of investors in telecom companies, there is no sign of an increase in tariffs. On the contrary, downward pressure on tariffs has continued unabated. Average revenue per user (Arpu) of Bharti Airtel Ltd fell sequentially by another 6% in the June quarter. Its Arpu has fallen 44.3% since Reliance Jio launched services in September 2016.
Things may only get worse. Reliance Jio has only recently targeted the postpaid segment, which accounts for over a fifth of incumbents’ revenues. Besides, in early July, Reliance Jio announced a huge cut in the cost of owning the Jio Phone, a feature phone targeting incumbents’ voice-only users. The impact of these moves is yet to be seen."

New Delhi: Telecommunications company Bharti Airtel has announced a strategic content partnership with media and entertainment firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) to “drive the over-the-top video streaming ecosystem in India"".
The deal will work in three parts. One, some of ZEEL’s curated content, including television shows, original web series and movies, will be available exclusively on Airtel’s digital property Airtel TV, in addition to ZEE5, the digital arm owned by ZEEL. Two, the ZEE5 app will be bundled into the Airtel TV app, allowing customers to get ZEE5 content for free. Three, the two companies will jointly create, market and distribute content, with specific focus on ZEE’s regional language-centric strategy.
“This is a win-win deal for both Airtel and us and a strategic partnership that we see extending into the long term, though the current alliance is only structured for three years,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer, ZEEL. He, however, declined to comment on the financial details of the partnership. “Apart from monetary benefit, we get access to their nearly 300 million subscribers, one-third of whom are on smart devices. We see much faster penetration of ZEE5 through this opportunity.""
Goenka added that Airtel does not have ready access to original content and partnership with ZEEL gives them an opportunity to expand and enrich their library.
“Our endeavour is to build a world-class content ecosystem by partnering with all players and enable a differentiated digital entertainment experience for our customers. We are extremely pleased to announce this exclusive partnership with ZEE and look forward to collaborating with them to unlock the potential of their vast content catalogue,"" said Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive officer (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, in a statement.
However, the Airtel-ZEE alliance is not entirely exclusive. Airtel offers a one-year subscription of Amazon Prime free of cost to its postpaid subscribers, which includes shopping and video benefits (with its OTT service Amazon Prime Video). Similarly, ZEE, too, will be free to partner with other telcos for content, except ones that are exclusively for Airtel TV.
Abneesh Roy, analyst with Edelweiss Securities, said the deal is extremely critical for both parties. On one hand, Airtel is competing with the likes of Reliance Jio that has brought in disruptive pricing with its super cheap data packs, besides acquiring stakes in production companies like Eros International, Balaji Telefilms and Roy Kapur Films. 
ZEE5, meanwhile, is vying for the same OTT space as players like Netflix that emphasize on original digital content, while services such as Amazon and VOOT (the digital service owned by Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd) are either curating a movie library or leveraging the content from their broadcast networks. 
“While Airtel has to differentiate itself through content tie-ups, ZEE5 will have to ensure visibility for the many shows it has in the pipeline. Plus, it needs the kind of payment from a telco partner that it gets from a DTH or cable partner,"" Roy added."
463,2018-08-21,Airtel,"Broadband rates have been cut by several telecom players, including Bharti Airtel and BSNL, ahead of Jio GigaFiber launch, but you may still be paying more. Here's a simple trick to get the best deal on your broadband plan.

As Reliance Jio has already begun taking registrations for its Jio GigaFiber broadband service, which is expected to be rolled out during the coming winter season all over India, several existing broadband operators led by Bharti Airtel and BSNL have cut their prices sharply to retain customers. However, not all new rates and offers can be seen on their websites and you may actually be paying more for your broadband connection than current market rate unless you have changed your plan. 
As Reliance Jio has already begun taking registrations for its Jio GigaFiber broadband service, which is expected to be rolled out during the coming winter season all over India, several existing broadband operators led by Bharti Airtel and BSNL have cut their prices sharply to retain customers. However, not all new rates and offers can be seen on their websites and you may actually be paying more for your broadband connection than current market rate unless you have changed your plan.
Not only Airtel has introduced new plans with cheaper broadband rates but it has also discarded its fair usage policy (FUP) limits for its broadband customers, which means that you get unlimited data, in several cities. If you are relying on the Airtel website to tell you about all the plans available in your city, then you may be mistaken.
In Delhi-NCR, for example, Airtel has a  ₹ 599 plan which offers 30GB data at the speed of 40Mbps. If you pay just  ₹ 40 more and upgrade to the  ₹ 639 plan (annual package), then you get 100GB data monthly.
At a little lower speed of 8Mbps, Airtel broadband customers can get 100GB data at a cheap price of just  ₹ 399 (annual package).
But if you look up the Airtel website, the cheapest plan starts from  ₹ 799, which offers 100GB of data at 40Mbps speed.
To get best deals on your broadband plans, you need to call up your service provider and bargain. Without which you may be still be paying more for your broadband service, which is available at much cheaper rates to your neighbours.

Prices of Airtel broadband vary not only according to data limit but also speed. If you are looking for an unlimited data plan which doesn’t slow down after you cross your data usage limit and are okay with 8Mbps speed, then the unlimited data plan may be the one best suited for you.
Unlimited data plans
Airtel had earlier removed the FUP limit from its plans in some cities and has now expanded it to several other big cities.
In Mumbai, for example, if you are ready to shell out  ₹ 699 then you get unlimited data at 8Mbps speed. In Hyderabad, the same plan will cost you only  ₹ 349.
With your Airtel broadband connection you also get a free landline service. In some select plans of Airtel broadband, you also get free subscription to Amazon Prime.
BSNL revises broadband plans
BSNL has also revised its broadband plan. At  ₹ 699, BSNL is offering 700GB data with 20Mbps speed. After the data limit is over, BSNL customers will get internet at 2Mbps speed, according to a report by Telecomtalk.

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel has received FDI clearance from the government for sale of 20% stake in its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia to Warburg Pincus for $350 million, a source said.
The source privy to the development said that the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) approval has been received for the deal, which was announced in December 2017.
When contacted, a Bharti Airtel spokesperson declined to comment on the matter.
According to the contours of the deal announced in late 2017, Bharti Airtel will sell its 15% stake in direct-to-home arm, and the balance will be sold by another Bharti entity, which holds 5% stake in the company.
The approval comes at a time when competition in the market is heating up -- Reliance Jio has already announced it will offer a Set Top Box for TV when it launches ultra-high speed fibre-based broadband services. Market watchers have said that Jio’s aggressive offerings will pose a “serious competition"" to TV distributors on both the DTH and cable side, putting further pressure on falling average revenue per user."
461,2018-08-28,Airtel,"Analysts expect Reliance Jio's market share gains to come at the expense of Vodafone Idea, simply because they are still far behind Reliance Jio and Airtel in terms of network investments

Ever since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched services in 2016, revenues of India’s wireless industry have been on a steady decline. The only exception was the June-September quarter of 2017, when Reliance Jio started reporting revenues, and more than made up for the drop in revenues of other telecom firms. 
Ever since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched services in 2016, revenues of India’s wireless industry have been on a steady decline. The only exception was the June-September quarter of 2017, when Reliance Jio started reporting revenues, and more than made up for the drop in revenues of other telecom firms.
The April-June quarter this year was another instance where Reliance Jio’s incremental revenues made up for the drop in others’ revenues. Wireless revenues rose by about 1% sequentially last quarter, a report by JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd points out, based on revenues reported by telcos to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
“Underlying wireless spending stabilised in Q1. Assuming no further tariff cuts, wireless spending is unlikely to decline materially from here,"" analysts at JM Financial said in the note to clients.
But while there may be signs of some stability, not all telcos are experiencing a state of calm.
Reliance Jio is clearly miles ahead of others in terms of revenue growth—its Q1 revenues grew 14%. Among the incumbents, Bharti Airtel Ltd was relatively better off with revenues growing by about 1% last quarter. Idea Cellular Ltd and Vodafone India Ltd reported a 4% and 2% drop in revenues, respectively.
According to JM Financial, the Idea-Vodafone combine’s revenue market share has dropped from 42.4% a year ago to 34.1% currently. This is using the sum of adjusted gross revenues (AGR) in the wireless business and AGR in national long distance, which also captures revenues related to the mobile business. Reliance Jio, meanwhile, has raced from zero to a 22% share in the same period.
If revenues related to non-mobile businesses, such as fixed line, are knocked off using rough estimates, Reliance Jio’s share rises to 23.5%, say analysts.
With most other telcos having exited the market, analysts now expect Reliance Jio’s market share gains to come at the expense of Vodafone Idea. This is simply because the two companies are still far behind Reliance Jio and Airtel in terms of network investments.
A pertinent question, therefore, is, will the stability in revenues seen in the June quarter continue going forward. After all, what stops Reliance Jio from getting more aggressive to gain market share at a time when the two companies are still busy completing their merger?
Of course, much depends on Reliance Jio’s attempts to make inroads into the post-paid segment and the feature phone segment.
If the response to the company’s new offers in these segments is lacklustre, the industry may well have to prepare for another round of downtrading."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel on Wednesday said its DTH arm Bharti Telemedia has received the government’s approval for transfer of its 15% stake to private equity firm Warburg Pincus. 
“Bharti Telemedia Ltd, a subsidiary of the company, has been granted the approval dated 28 August 2018 from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for transfer of its 15% stake to an affiliate of Warburg Pincus,"" Bharti Airtel said in a regulatory filing.

London: The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has approved the merger of Idea Cellular and the Indian unit of Vodafone Group, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
The new merged entity will overtake Bharti Airtel as India’s largest mobile phone operator. The Vodafone-Idea merger, announced in March 2017, will topple Bharti Airtel and create a behemoth with 438.8 million subscribers.
Idea, a part of the Aditya Birla conglomerate, and Vodafone signed a merger agreement last year, which could create the country’s biggest telecom operator. Approval from the Tribunal was the only outstanding regulatory requirement.
Both companies declined to comment. 
The Department of Telecommunications recently gave its approval to the merger. 
Vodafone India and Idea had in March outlined the key leadership team to head the merged entity. Aditya Birla Group’s chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla was named non-executive chairman of Vodafone Idea Ltd while Balesh Sharma, currently the chief operating officer of Vodafone India, was named chief executive officer."

New Delhi: The department of telecommunications (DoT) has in a letter dated 17 August asked Bharti Airtel Ltd to pay in cash and through a bank guarantee a total of  ₹  1,626.89 crore to clear its merger with Bharti Digital Networks (formerly known as Tikona Digital Networks). Airtel has, however, approached the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) seeking a stay on the DoT demand. 
New Delhi: The department of telecommunications (DoT) has in a letter dated 17 August asked Bharti Airtel Ltd to pay in cash and through a bank guarantee a total of  ₹  1,626.89 crore to clear its merger with Bharti Digital Networks (formerly known as Tikona Digital Networks). Airtel has, however, approached the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) seeking a stay on the DoT demand.
DoT asked Airtel to pay  ₹  185.62 crore in cash. This is the difference between the entry fee payable for unified access service licence in the four telecom circles of Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (east) and Uttar Pradesh (west) and the entry fee already paid by Tikona under unified licence in the 2300 MHz band.
This payment would enable Airtel to also provide voice services using the spectrum in the four circles. Tikona has 20 MHz spectrum in these circles and the Rajasthan circle.
“Bharti Airtel shall (also) submit bank guarantee towards one-time spectrum charges for  ₹  1,441.27 crore towards spectrum holding beyond 4.4 MHz (under the merger and acquisition guidelines),"" the letter said.
Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
One-time spectrum charges are payable by companies that want to convert their administered spectrum or spectrum not bought in an auction to liberalised or auctioned spectrum. Auctioned spectrum can be deployed flexibly for any purpose, unlike administered spectrum.
Under the department of telecommunications’s merger and acquisition guidelines, if a transferor (Tikona) holds a part of the spectrum, which (up to 4.4 MHz) has been assigned against the entry fee paid, the transferee (Airtel), at the time of merger, shall pay to the government, the differential between the entry fee and the market-determined price of spectrum from the date of approval of such arrangements by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on a pro-rata basis for the remaining period of validity of the licence.
In respect of spectrum holding beyond 4.4 MHz, a bank guarantee for an amount equal to the demand raised by the department of telecommunications for one-time spectrum charges shall be submitted by transferee (Airtel), pending final outcome of the court case, according to the guidelines.
Bharti Airtel had in March 2017 entered into a definitive agreement with Tikona to acquire its 4G business, including the Broadband Wireless Access spectrum and 350 sites, in five telecom circles.
The National Company Law Tribunal in July 2018 approved the merger between Bharti Airtel and Tikona.
Airtel plans to rollout high speed 4G services on the newly acquired spectrum in the five circles immediately after the closure of the transaction.
The acquisition will boost Airtel’s spectrum position in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, taking its overall broadband wireless access spectrum holding to 30 MHz each in these circles.
Post completion of the deal, Airtel will have 30 MHz in the 2300 MHz band in 13 circles enabling it to better handle the surging data demand.
Apart from the above two demands, the department of telecommunications has also sought that Airtel be responsible for clearing all demands which may be raised by any wing of the department including the penalties imposed on Tikona or Airtel, apart from submitting an undertaking to meet payments which are sub-judice, depending on the outcome of the case.
Airtel has already approached TDSAT seeking a stay.
 “The conditions are entirely contrary to the very guidelines, illegal, arbitrary, and contrary to the applicable order of this tribunal and other fora,"" Airtel said in its petition. Mint has seen a copy of the petition.
“The issuance of the impugned conditions smacks of non-application of mind on the part of the respondent (DoT),"" the petition read.
In a similar case, the tribunal had ordered DoT to clear the deal without demanding a  ₹ 1,499 crore bank guarantee from Bharti Airtel for its acquisition of Telenor India. DoT had then approached the apex court, which dismissed its petition in May.
An email query sent to Airtel was unanswered till press time."
456,2018-08-31,Airtel,"The merger has created India's largest telecom service provider and displaced Bharti Airtel Ltd from the top spot after about two decades

Mumbai: Idea Cellular and Vodafone India started to function as one entity on Friday, a day after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the merger of the two telecom companies into a new entity called Vodafone Idea Ltd. 
Mumbai: Idea Cellular and Vodafone India started to function as one entity on Friday, a day after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the merger of the two telecom companies into a new entity called Vodafone Idea Ltd.
The merger has created India’s largest telecom service provider and displaced Bharti Airtel Ltd from the top spot after about two decades.
The merged entity has more than 408 million subscribers, a broadband network of 340,000 sites and a distribution reach with 1.7 million retail outlets, according to a joint statement by the companies on Friday.
The new entity will have a market share of 32.2% and leadership position in nine out of 22 circles.
The merger is expected to generate  ₹ 14,000 crore in synergies annually.
“Today, we have created India’s leading telecom operator,"" Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Idea Ltd said. “This is much more than just about creating a large business. It is about our vision of empowering and enabling a New India and meeting the aspirations of the youth of our country,"" Birla said.
The merger also narrows the field in the telecom sector to three competitors now, from what was once a battle between rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd, Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Vodafone, Idea, government-owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. 
Ambani’s firm has disrupted tariffs, made its rivals bleed and controls more than 18.78% market share in less than two years of its launch. Jio can also take credit for triggering the long-heralded consolidation in the telecom sector and ushering in a data revolution in the country. 
As the dust from ever-changing regulations and a tariff battle appears to be settling down, the industry is again eyeing an upward curve in revenue.
A concern for the merged entity is the company’s virtual absence from the fixed line business, whose importance is growing even as Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio (RJio) race ahead in the segment, according to Mahesh Uppal, a director with ComsFirst consultancy. 
“If RJio was to crash prices further in the coming days, others including Vodafone Idea Ltd will have to follow suit to remain competitive. So, there isn’t going to be a major differentiation in terms of prices. However, the situation is of concern from the perspective of competition, as from a situation where we had too many players, we now have too few,"" Uppal said.
Vodafone Idea Ltd will be headed by its chief executive officer Balesh Sharma, who said that the company has the scale and resources to ensure sustainable customer choice and introduce new technologies.
The company claimed to have cash balance of over  ₹ 19,300 crore after payout of  ₹ 3,900 crore to the department of telecommunications towards spectrum charges.
The company also has the option of raising  ₹ 5,100 crore by monetising its stake in Indus Towers, a mobile tower company owned jointly by Bharti Infratel Ltd, Idea and Vodafone.
Vodafone Idea Ltd will invest  ₹ 60,000 crore in infrastructure to meet the expected sixfold rise in demand for data to more than 120 petabytes a day in the near term, a person with the direct knowledge of the matter told Mint in February, months before the completion of the merger.
“Overlapping of spectrum will be reversed, and with large spectrum chunks at disposal, rolling out faster data will be possible,"" the person said adding that the infrastructure ramp-up would see the merged company increase its capacity by up to six-seven times its existing capacity and also provide high-speed data at 200-300 Mbps as compared to current speed limits of 20-30 Mbps.
The investments being made by Vodafone-Idea will also help the merged company match data capacities of its rivals. The merged entity will have net debt to the tune of  ₹ 1.09 trillion."

Both the over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platforms start charging after the initial first month of use. Even a basic subscription of Netflix comes at a price of  ₹ 500 per month.

Amazon Prime is a little cheaper as you will have to shell out  ₹ 129 per month or  ₹ 999 for the annual subscription plan.
However, in a bid to increase the market for OTT content against traditional media platforms, two big telecom operators are offering you several options for free subscription plans. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone have come up with new bundled offers for Netflix and Amazon Prime. Such plans cost more than regular ones but if you do the math you will find that you are getting the OTT subscription at a price cheaper than the market.
To make the best of it, make sure you have used the one-month free trial before you buy the OTT bundled Airtel or Vodafone plan.
For free Netflix subscription:
Vodafone
Vodafone’s RED postpaid plans, which offer several other benefits as well, offer free Netflix subscriptions. The  ₹ 999 plan gets you free Netflix for 2 months, which would have otherwise cost you  ₹ 1,000 (basic plan).
Vodafone’s  ₹ 2,999 postpaid plan gets you a 1-year Netflix subscription worth  ₹ 6,000. Vodafone is, however, not offering this Netflix offer to people living in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, and Bihar.
Those using a Samsung Galaxy S9 or S9+ along with a Vodafone postpaid SIM card also get the free 1-year Netflix subscription.
Airtel
If you are an Airtel subscriber, then you can get Netflix through both mobile postpaid plans as well as broadband plans. Airtel’s select postpaid plans of  ₹ 649,  ₹ 799,  ₹ 999 and other premium plans are eligible for the bundled Netflix service free for a limited period of 3 months.
As an Airtel broadband user, you can buy  ₹ 999 plans and those above it for the 3-month Netflix offer.
For free Amazon Prime subscription:
Vodafone
Getting access to Amazon Prime is cheaper than Netflix. As a Vodafone postpaid customer, you just need an upgrade to any RED plan with monthly rentals beginning from  ₹ 399 and you get a  ₹ 999 subscription of Amazon Prime free for 12 months. You need to activate the offer using the Vodafone Play app.
Airtel
If you are on Airtel postpaid then the monthly plans begin from  ₹ 499 for a free Amazon Prime subscription for one year.
Tip: After the end of your offer period, Netflix and Amazon Prime service will be auto-renewed and you may be charged for it. To avoid such a situation it is better to unsubscribe after joining the platform. If you unsubscribe, your membership will end after one year and will not be auto-renewed. You can again choose to buy a subscription plan.

It may not actually be like bargaining with your vegetable vendor, but Airtel is offering you discounts and free data only if you are smart enough to just give them a call and negotiate. Just ahead of the Reliance JioGigaFiber launch, several Airtel broadband customers have secured discounts on monthly broadband bills by simply asking for them.

Just ahead of the Reliance JioGigaFiber launch, several Airtel broadband customers have secured discounts on monthly broadband bills by simply asking for them.
As part of its retention strategy for customers who may be lured away by lucrative offers from Reliance Jio, which is offering free 100GB data for the first 90 days under a preview offer, Bharti Airtel is offering customer retention discounts and bonus data.
Airtel has already announced new plans, with more data at lower cost. For several plans, the telecom service provider has removed its fair usage policy (FUP) limits, which allows unlimited data at the same speed. Most of these new plans have not been declared on Airtel’s website and can be uncovered by talking to the customer care helpline or by keeping an eye out on pamphlets or outdoor advertisements.
Also read: Reliance Jio GigaFiber broadband preview offer launched. It is free for 3 months
Such packages, however, vary from city to city. But since Reliance Jio has made it evident that it will disrupt the broadband market in India with 1Gbps data and cheap prices, Airtel has taken another step to protect its 9.53 crore customer base.
Airtel broadband users who are calling up the customer care helpline and trying to negotiate a deal with more discounts or bonus data are bagging benefits. These deals are being provided case by case without any official announcement from the service provider.
All such calls seeking discounts or subscribers asking to discontinue their Airtel broadband service are being transferred to a team specially assigned to retain customers. The executive online tries to understand what kind of deal the customer is looking at and based on the feedback prepares an irresistible offer. For example, if you are happy with 30 GB monthly data but find the monthly rental expensive, you can ask for cheaper plans with the same data limit. Or if you want more data at the same speed then also you can demand free bonus data.
Darshana Agarwal, a housewife living in Noida, wanted both. She called up the helpline and got her 30GB plan cost reduced to  ₹ 499 from  ₹ 599 and had the data doubled. An Airtel executive told her that this is a special customer retention discount and customer retention bonus data offer.
The Reliance Jio effect
Through its wireless broadband, Reliance Jio is already dominating the broadband market in India with a 48% market share, according to June 2018 data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). Existing operators, especially in the wired broadband segment, fear the situation may worsen after Jio GigaFiber broadband is launched. Once the service is made available in the next few months, Jio has promised not to charge installation fees or rent for the first three months. With plans to roll out broadband services in 1,000 cities, Reliance Jio will offer 100GB data at a speed of 100Mbps free for 90 days.
It will only charge a refundable security deposit of  ₹ 4,500 against the Jio broadband modem."

Earlier, Airtel had launched three combo recharge packs priced at  ₹ 35,  ₹ 65 and  ₹ 95. All of the aforementioned recharges offer data, voice calls and validity. The plans are available in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and UP (West) for now, but the telco said the plan will be made available in other circles as well.
The new plan competes with Airtel’s own plans worth  ₹ 95 and  ₹ 99.
The  ₹ 95 pack offers 500MB of 4G data but it doesn’t come with “free"" STD, local or roaming calling. Instead the plan charges 1p per 2 seconds over a validity period of 28 days.
The  ₹ 99 plan on the other hand provides unlimited local, STD and roaming voice call benefits, 2GB data and 100 text messages a day for the 28-days validity period.
It direct competitor, though, is the  ₹ 98 pack by Jio which offers 2GB of 4G data, unlimited local, STD and roaming voice calls, 300 text messages for a period of 28 days.
A similar plan, but only for Jio Phone users, offers 500MB 4G data per day, adding up to 14GB data through the validity period. Users also get unlimited local, STD, and roaming voice call benefits, 300 text messages over a period of 28 days."

Mumbai/New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Sterlite Technologies Ltd and two investment firms have bid to separately purchase assets of Aircel Ltd, but lenders to the bankrupt telecom operator may still have to take a large haircut. Lenders to Aircel are, however, keen on a lump sum sale to a single party as it believes such a move would lead to the best outcome, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Both declined to be named. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Sterlite Technologies Ltd and two investment firms have bid to separately purchase assets of Aircel Ltd, but lenders to the bankrupt telecom operator may still have to take a large haircut. Lenders to Aircel are, however, keen on a lump sum sale to a single party as it believes such a move would lead to the best outcome, two people with knowledge of the matter said. Both declined to be named.
“The bids have been received. But we are thinking of the possibility of a lump sum sale, that is, give all of the assets to a single party. This should get better value for the assets,"" said one of the two people cited before. “In a couple of days, these talks should happen. We are hoping to get over  ₹ 25,000 crore from asset sale proceeds."" 
Aircel Cellular Ltd and Dishnet Wireless Ltd, together known as Aircel, owe about  ₹ 50,000 crore to creditors. The companies owe  ₹ 15,545 crore to financial creditors, and about  ₹ 35,000 crore to operational creditors. Bids for the assets closed on Monday.
Hammered by intense competition in the domestic telecom market, Aircel’s woes multiplied with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016 with free calls and cheap data. 
Things turned sour last October when Reliance Communications called off plans to merge its wireless business with Aircel, citing legal and regulatory uncertainties, as well as “intervention of vested interests to derail the deal"".
In February, Aircel filed for insolvency, citing high unsustainable debt and increased losses.
Aircel holds 65 MHz spectrum in the 2,100 MHz band, 103 MHz spectrum in the 1,800 MHz band, and 21 MHz spectrum in the 900 MHz band. Details of other assets such as fibre and towers could not be ascertained immediately.
The assets, including spectrum licences and fibre, are valued at about  ₹ 32,362 crore, Aircel’s lawyer said on 9 March.
A potential raising of more than  ₹ 25,000 crore from the sale of Aircel’s assets would lead to a massive haircut to its lenders such as State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda.
India’s second-largest telecom operator, Bharti Airtel, is the sole bidder for Aircel’s spectrum assets, while Jio is the sole bidder for the telecom towers, said the second person.
The person added that Jio is also in the fray for Aircel’s fibre assets, along with Anil Agarwal-promoted Sterlite Industries, private equity firm I Squared Capital, and distressed asset fund Aion Capital.
Sterlite denied placing a bid for Aircel’s fibre assets. Jio, Airtel and I Squared Capital did not respond to queries till press time. Aion Capital declined to comment.
“Deloitte is very happy with the outcome, which exceeded everyone’s expectations. We will know final decisions on winners probably in four weeks’ time... the bids were being opened on Wednesday,"" the second person said.
Vijay Kumar Iyer of Deloitte, who has been nominated as the interim resolution professional, didn’t respond to calls.
Airtel, currently the sole bidder for spectrum, had in April 2016, announced buying spectrum worth  ₹ 3,500 crore from Aircel in eight telecom circles: Tamil Nadu (including Chennai), Bihar, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, Assam, the North-East, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.
In 2010, Aircel sold 17,500 towers and 21,000 tenancies to Chennai Network Infrastructure Ltd, a unit of GTL Infrastructure Ltd, for  ₹ 8,000 crore."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has identified two new areas—healthcare and education—around which it plans to build content apart from sharpening focus on regional music and videos on its platform as it braces for a long battle with rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Airtel expects the current round of battle will centre around content as cut-rate data tariffs have ceased to provide a meaningful competitive edge in the hyper-intensive telecom industry. 
New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has identified two new areas—healthcare and education—around which it plans to build content apart from sharpening focus on regional music and videos on its platform as it braces for a long battle with rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Airtel expects the current round of battle will centre around content as cut-rate data tariffs have ceased to provide a meaningful competitive edge in the hyper-intensive telecom industry.
While Reliance Jio aims to focus on producing in-house web series and shows for its subscribers, Airtel is forging partnerships with content producers Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar, Sony LIV and ZEE5, among others.
“We don’t believe in controlling the entire value chain end-to-end... There are a bunch of partnerships that we have got done which are exclusive to us...on the video side, we want to stay away from producing content,"" Sameer Batra, chief executive officer, content and apps, Bharti Airtel, said in an interview.
With regional content doing well on its platform, Bharti Airtel plans to increase these offerings to users to boost data usage. The company aims to bank on its machine learning and data science capabilities to spot trends and customise its offerings.
“Customers are very different across areas. For example, you would think that Hindi music is popular in Delhi. We are finding that Bhojpuri and Haryanvi music is very big in Delhi,"" he said.
The company has already inked a couple of partnerships to enhance regional content. It has partnered with Kolkata-based Shree Venkatesh Films to bring a large catalogue of Bengali content on Airtel TV, apart from signing up Marathi folk singer and Indian Idol season one contestant Prajakta Shukre to release six music tracks for Airtel’s music app Wynk Music.
“We are also talking to a team which has a huge catalogue of Nepali films, apart from planning a couple of partnerships for content to cater to the youth. We are also on the verge of closing a deal with global music label Orchard to add to our South Korean pop music category,"" Batra said.
Driving data usage through content is key for Bharti Airtel. In April-June, Reliance Jio reported 10.6 GB average data consumption per user per month while for Bharti Airtel this was 7.8 GB.
“Apart from music and video, we will get into one or two more key areas of interest and build the portfolio in a manner that we think is consistent with our ability to get scale and more importantly lock customers down. Healthcare and education are two areas which we are studying at the moment quite deeply,"" Batra said.
Reliance Jio also sees opportunities in sectors such as healthcare and education sector where offerings can ride on its telecom pipe. It has also made a string of acquisitions targeted at the content space. —in March, the company announced an integration with music app Saavn for its digital music service JioMusic and in February, Reliance Industries announced that it would buy a 5% stake in filmmaker Eros International Plc.
Monetising content is the big challenge not just for Airtel, but all telecom firms, especially at the current environment of suppressed tariffs. However, Airtel thinks it is too early to worry about monetisation.
“We have seen that if we are able to lock customers down to more digital products, their relative stickiness to Airtel goes up... Music, we have started to monetise at a decent scale. We are trying a few experiments on advertising etc. Right now, the objective is to get pretty much everybody with a smartphone have one of our digital properties,"" Batra said."

If the strong subscriber addition continues at Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, it may soon emerge as the leading wireless telecom company in India. Reliance Jio’s net revenue may have crossed Bharti Airtel Ltd’s wireless revenue in India last quarter, according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Research. If the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) unit maintains the momentum, then it may emerge as the largest telecom company as early as the end of 2018.

If the Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) unit maintains the momentum, then it may emerge as the largest telecom company as early as the end of 2018.
“We expect Bharti Airtel’s net India wireless revenues (reported gross wireless revenues less estimated gross interconnect revenues) to be around  ₹ 87-88 billion for 2QFY19. Reliance Jio’s reported revenues of  ₹ 92.4 billion are net of interconnect revenues as the company adjusts interconnect revenues in the interconnect costs line,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Research said in a note.
“If Bharti does not report a material beat on our estimated wireless revenues for the quarter, Reliance Jio has perhaps crossed Bharti on net India wireless revenues to become #2 after Vodafone Idea. If the current trends continue, Reliance Jio will likely become #1 on net revenues as early as 3QFY19E,"" the note said.
Reliance Jio’s focus remains on expanding its subscriber base but the ban on Aadhaar-based e-KYC can affect this. This, however, is seen as a temporary phenomenon. The trends indicate continued tough times for incumbent telecom companies which have to step-up capital expenditure (capex) while dealing with price erosion.
“We expect competitive intensity to remain elevated over the next 9-12 months as fight for subscriber share continues. Reliance Jio, over the weekend, introduced 100% cashback for all packages and various players have been tweaking with pricing and packs,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a 19 October note. Further, the incumbents, given their weakened financial position, are lagging in capex, which is crucial for product offerings and customer retention.

“Reliance Jio continues to be on an accelerated capex drive, spending around  ₹ 330 billion in H1FY19 (Q2 spend  ₹ 160 billion) which is ~70% its own FY18 capex and is largely equivalent to the combined capex spend of the remaining two incumbents (Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea) put together in FY18,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note. “The scale of investments and the current profitability differential suggest that Reliance Jio is unlikely to relent till it achieves a meaningful market leadership in terms of revenue market share.""

 New Delhi: Half a dozen marque investors, including Warburg Pincus LLC, Temasek Holdings, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp, will invest a combined $1.25 billion in Bharti Airtel Ltd’s unit in Africa ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO). India’s second-largest mobile operator by users will use the funds to trim Airtel Africa Ltd’s debt of $5 billion and expand operations in that continent, Bharti Airtel said in a statement on Wednesday. 
 New Delhi: Half a dozen marque investors, including Warburg Pincus LLC, Temasek Holdings, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp, will invest a combined $1.25 billion in Bharti Airtel Ltd’s unit in Africa ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO). India’s second-largest mobile operator by users will use the funds to trim Airtel Africa Ltd’s debt of $5 billion and expand operations in that continent, Bharti Airtel said in a statement on Wednesday.
The six companies will make the investment by subscribing to new shares, it said.
Bharti Airtel did not identify two of the remaining investors. It also did not give any timeline for the investment.
The move kickstarts the process to monetise Airtel Africa in line with the strategy of Bharti Airtel to cut debt by monetising its assets.
Bharti Airtel wants to also boost its cash pile as it faces a brutal tariff war in India intensified with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016.
As part of its steps to cut debt and monetise assets, Bharti Airtel in August sold a 20% stake in its satellite television arm, Bharti Telemedia Ltd, to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million.
The latest transaction will not involve any sale of existing shares, Bharti Airtel said.
It did not offer more details on the transaction.
ICICI Securities, in a research note on Wednesday, said Bharti Airtel has agreed to sell a 28.4% stake in the Africa unit to the six firms for $1.25 billion.
Bharti Airtel said its Africa unit is subsequently intending an IPO.
“The valuation is likely to set the floor for a potential IPO of the African operations,"" Deutsche Bank said in a note, adding the latest investment will narrow Bharti Airtel’s net debt to Ebitda ratio from 3.6 to 3.3.
Bharti Airtel had on 14 February announced its plan to list its African arm.
“We believe Bharti will also monetise it fibre network in the mid term,"" Deutsche Bank said in the note.
Bharti Airtel’s Africa venture started in 2010 when it bought Kuwait-based telecom operator Zain Telecom’s Africa operations for $10.7 billion.
Over the past few years, it has been trying to capture the African market through local deals.
It has so far made three small acquisitions in Uganda, Congo Brazzaville and Kenya.
In October 2017, Airtel inked a deal with Millicom, which owns the brand Tigo, to combine their operations in Ghana. In December, Airtel’s unit in Rwanda announced the acquisition of Tigo Rwanda Ltd, making Airtel, the second-largest telecom operator in the African nation.
Airtel’s Africa business has seen a turnaround of its business in recent years.
Data customers in Africa surged 45% to 26.4 million in April-June this year, from 18.2 million a year earlier. Revenue grew 14% to $794 million.
Back home in India, too, Bharti Airtel is taking steps to reduce debt. The company announced on 5 February that Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel) would indirectly raise its stake in Bharti Airtel by investing  ₹ 2,649 crore in Bharti Telecom Ltd, the promoter company of Airtel, through a preferential allotment of shares and the funds will be used to reduce debt."

In spite of that, operating profit of the consolidated entity dropped.
The mainstay India mobile services business continues to struggle. Losses before interest and tax expanded to  ₹ 1,591 crore. As a percentage of revenue, they increased to 15.5% from 8.4% in the June quarter. Cash burn almost doubled from a year ago but eased slightly on sequential basis. The average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped to  ₹ 101 from  ₹ 106 in the June quarter. But, compared to earlier quarters, the pace of the fall has reduced (see chart 2).
According to an analyst, Airtel restated the subscriber numbers. As a consequence, the fall in ARPU eased a bit. 
But otherwise, losses in the India mobile business are slightly higher than the Street estimates, reflecting elevated cost pressure.
The company’s Africa business, on the other hand, delivered steady performance. Margins and operating profits expanded on a sequential basis. 
Notably, the company received an equity infusion of $1.25 billion from global investors, the proceeds of which are expected to be used to partly retire debt. The fund infusion is seen as a precursor to the initial public offering (IPO) of the Africa unit which should further help ease leverage, helping the parent company.
The development should please investors. “This equity infusion is a significant positive and a benchmark ahead of the upcoming IPO for Africa operations.

Many fear competition in the mainstay India business to weigh on revenues in the near term, clouding earnings outlook. 
The principal competitor Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s focus on customer acquisition is expected to weigh on incumbents’ realizations. “We believe Jio’s new plan is likely to put to rest any hopes of a meaningful ARPU recovery for another 12 months, at least at a time when the Street and the incumbents were expecting a sharp recovery in the near term (4-6 months),"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note, adding: “We do not see any let-up in competitive intensity in the near term as Jio remains focused on market share gains, and incumbents continue to struggle with weak cash flow generation and stretched balance sheets."""

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd, India’s second-biggest wireless carrier, is delaying a planned initial public offering of its Africa unit due to the turmoil in emerging-market stocks, people with knowledge of the matter said. The company, which was originally aiming to list the unit in London by March, has pushed back the share sale by about half a year, according to the people. It plans to seek an enterprise value of about $8 billion for the Africa business, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. 
Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd, India’s second-biggest wireless carrier, is delaying a planned initial public offering of its Africa unit due to the turmoil in emerging-market stocks, people with knowledge of the matter said. The company, which was originally aiming to list the unit in London by March, has pushed back the share sale by about half a year, according to the people. It plans to seek an enterprise value of about $8 billion for the Africa business, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., which owns a stake in Bharti’s parent company, said in August that the listing was slated for the first quarter of next year. The equity rout has derailed IPOs around the world, with companies from Spanish oil refiner Cepsa to U.S. filmmaker STX Entertainment scrapping or postponing their offerings.
Bharti Airtel, backed by billionaire Sunil Mittal, is seeking the listing after spending heavily to acquire spectrum in India and defend its position in the country against disruptive upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. It has operations in 14 African markets including Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and Ghana, according to its latest annual report.
No final decisions have been made, and plans for the offering could change, the people said. A representative for Bharti said preparations for the Africa unit IPO are proceeding according to plan and there have been no changes. The company remains “very confident"" about the listing process, the representative said.
Bharti said last week its African unit raised $1.25 billion from investors including Warburg Pincus, Temasek Holdings Pte and SoftBank Group Corp."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has decided that ultra low-spending customers, those that buy recharge plans costing less than  ₹ 35 a month, are just not worth the trouble, as India’s second-largest telecom operator charts out a new strategy to take on rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which brought industry tariffs to rock bottom.

New Delhi: India’s second largest operator by subscribers Bharti Airtel Ltd on Friday announced the board of directors for Airtel Africa, the holding company for its operations in Africa.
The board of directors includes representatives from Airtel and the investors—Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal, his son Shravin Bharti Mittal, Bharti Airtel’s Africa chief executive officer Raghunath Mandava, Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta, Warburg Pincus managing director and head of India Vishal Mahadevia, SoftBank Group International president and chief financial officer Alok Sama, CEO International of Singapore Telecommunications Ltd Arthur Lang, and Richard Gubbins.
The announcement came after the company’s African arm completed raising a fresh equity issue worth $1.25 billion from six leading global investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International.
Airtel Africa is the holding company of Airtel’s operations in 14 countries in the continent which started in 2010 when it bought Kuwait-based telecom operator Zain’s Africa operations for $10.7 billion. 
On 14 February, Bharti Airtel announced that it will consider an IPO for the Africa business.
Over the past few years, it has been trying to capture the African market through local deals. It has so far made three small acquisitions in Uganda, Congo Brazzaville and Kenya.
The company has seen a turnaround of its business in recent years. 
In July-September, Airtel Africa’s Africa revenue at $824 million grew by 11% as compared to $743 million in the corresponding quarter last year. 
Data customers during the quarter increased by 6.6 million to 27.1 million from 20.5 million in the corresponding quarter last year."

OpenSignal claims to have done analysis using over 10 billion measurements covering 1.7 million unique devices.
“This latest report is yet another reaffirmation of Airtel’s obsession with network excellence. Our focus remains on building the fastest and the best network that enables a high quality digital experience for discerning customers who prefer network quality over deals and discounts,"" Bharti Airtel Chief Technology Officer Randeep Sekhon told PTI.
According to the report, average download speed on Bharti Airtel network during June 1-August 29 was 7.53 megabit per second. It was followed by Jio with speed of 5.47 mbps, Vodafone 5.2 mbps and Idea 4.92 mbps. “Over the last 90 days our pace of deployment and investment has continued to pick up. This is allowing us to decisively win with 4G customers in the top 500 cities,"" Sekhon said.

It was followed by Airtel with overall upload speed of 1.9 mbps and 2.56 mbps on 4G, Vodafone 2.31 and 3.03 mbps and Jio 1.58 mbps.
OpenSignal found Reliance Jio had the widest 4G coverage leaving behind its competitors with significant gap. “Our 4G Availability winner Jio continues to grow from 96.4 to 96.7 per cent in our analysis — hugely impressive since 4G Availability scores of over 95 per cent are very rare — particularly remarkable in a relatively new LTE market like India,"" the report said.
Airtel followed Jio with 73.99 per cent coverage score. Idea Cellular and Vodafone, were operating separately at that time, scored 73.17 and 72.59 per cent respectively on the coverage chart.

Mumbai/New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s plan to monetize its Africa business has hit a speed bump, with the Tanzanian government disapproving a proposed Airtel Africa IPO, while also staking claim to the company’s unit in Tanzania. The Tanzanian government, which owns 40% in the Dar es Salaam-based unit, through a letter, has informed potential investors that it does not recognize the IPO plans of Airtel Africa Ltd and the ownership of Airtel Tanzania will depend on negotiations between the Indian parent and the government. 
Mumbai/New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s plan to monetize its Africa business has hit a speed bump, with the Tanzanian government disapproving a proposed Airtel Africa IPO, while also staking claim to the company’s unit in Tanzania. The Tanzanian government, which owns 40% in the Dar es Salaam-based unit, through a letter, has informed potential investors that it does not recognize the IPO plans of Airtel Africa Ltd and the ownership of Airtel Tanzania will depend on negotiations between the Indian parent and the government.
The Tanzanian government also expects it to be treated as a joint venture partner in the process of welcoming new shareholders. Mint has reviewed the letter written in Swahili and translated into English.
“It’s not legitimate for Bharti Airtel to undertake any affiliate consultations of our Airtel Tanzania company by advertising it publicly without obtaining the consent of a partner who is the Government of the United Republic of Tanzania,"" Athumani S. Mbuttuka, treasury registrar, Tanzania, said in the letter.
“Thus, the public and investors (Airtel Africa Ltd) who are supposed to buy Bharti Airtel’s shares in 14 African countries, including Tanzania, (should) know that their ownership of Airtel Tanzania company will depend on the Tanzanian government’s commitment to the Treasury as well as the fate of negotiations between Airtel and the government,"" Mbuttuka said.
Reacting to the developments, an Airtel spokesperson said: “It is to be noted, the shareholding of Airtel Tanzania is and will continue to be held between Government of Tanzania (40%) and Bharti Airtel Tanzania BV (60%). There has been no change in the shareholding of either Airtel Tanzania or Bharti Airtel Tanzania BV and the control of Airtel Tanzania will continue to be exercised by Airtel as earlier. We are in dialogue with the government of Tanzania for additional clarifications.""
Airtel is Tanzania’s third-largest wireless carrier, with 10.6 million voice subscribers as of end-September 2017, according to Bloomberg.
The differences between the two parties over the Airtel Africa IPO come even as Bharti Airtel has told the Tanzanian government that investors such as Temasek, SoftBank, Singtel and Warburg Pincus, which have invested $1.25 billion in Airtel Africa in October, may raise their investments to as much as $4.5 billion.
An email sent to the Tanzania High Commission in New Delhi remained unanswered till press time. Repeated phone calls made to the Tanzanian treasury registrar’s office did not elicit a response.
The development is likely to affect the Airtel Africa IPO although the parent said earlier this week that its IPO plans remained on track.
Letting the crisis fester in Tanzania could further strain Bharti Airtel’s ability to raise funds in time, as it struggles to cut its $5 billion debt and boost its cash pile, amid a brutal tariff war in India triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.
“It is definitely a risk to the IPO process,"" an analyst said on condition of anonymity. “What is interesting is that Bharti Airtel has not yet given a date for Airtel Africa IPO. Maybe they were expecting this delay and hence raised $1.25 billion from the six firms before the IPO.""
Bharti Airtel had on 14 February 2018 announced its plan to list its African arm to raise about $8 billion. Bharti Airtel’s Africa venture, spanning 14 countries in the continent, started in 2010 when it bought Kuwait-based telecom operator Zain’s Africa operations for $10.7 billion.
In December 2017, according to Bloomberg, the Tanzanian government launched a probe into Airtel’s acquisition of Zain in Tanzania and found that the initial privatization of Tanzania Telecommunications Corp. “broke the law, regulations and procedure"". 
For its part, Airtel has maintained its acquisition was in full compliance and followed all approvals from the government. Tanzania’s complaint relates to the initial privatization of the firm five years prior to when Airtel took control, it said in a statement at the time.
“The government of the United Republic of Tanzania continues to negotiate with the Bharti Airtel company for the purpose of obtaining the proper operating and ownership of Airtel Tanzania,"" Mbuttuka of Tanzania said.
ALSO READ | Airtel Q2: Steady Africa business is no solace as losses in India rise
Airtel is the latest foreign investor to have faced regulatory hurdles in Tanzania currently ruled by its fifth president, John Magufuli. In July 2017, the government demanded $190 billion in back taxes from Acacia Mining Ltd, saying the gold miner had been under-declaring mineral exports for over a decade.
 Magufuli, also known as “The Bulldozer"", has gained popularity through a crackdown on corruption, tax evasion and a shake-up of the revenue service. In July 2017, he signed off on legislation that requires government ownership of at least 16% in mining companies, increases royalties on metals exports and imposes an additional clearing fee. The law also allows the government to cancel or renegotiate gas and mineral contracts, and forbids companies from seeking international arbitration.
As for telecom companies, the government said they should sell at least a quarter of their units on the local bourse to boost domestic ownership. The local operations of Johannesburg-based Vodacom Group Ltd, a unit of Vodafone Plc, became the largest company on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange when it raised 476 billion shillings ($213 million) in August 2017.
“Airtel, according to the information we have"", is an asset of Tanzania Telecommunications Co., Magufuli said on the East African country’s national broadcaster, TBC, in December. “A terrible game was played. I don’t want to say more than that."""

About a week ago, Bharti Airtel Ltd announced that its Africa unit had raised $1.25 billion from six global investors and that it intends to follow this up with an initial public offering (IPO). The investors, which included SoftBank Group International and Warburg Pincus, got a roughly 28% stake in Airtel Africa Ltd, which is the holding company that owns all of Airtel’s African assets.

The investors, which included SoftBank Group International and Warburg Pincus, got a roughly 28% stake in Airtel Africa Ltd, which is the holding company that owns all of Airtel’s African assets.
The announcement has caused a stir back in Tanzania. The government there has warned investors buying into Airtel Africa that it doesn’t approve of any change in ownership in Airtel Tanzania. Bharti Airtel, on its part, is labouring to point out that the stake sale in the holding company doesn’t at all affect the Tanzanian government’s 40% stake in Airtel Tanzania. Besides, Airtel Africa’s effective stake in the Tanzanian operations also remains the same—all that changes is the ownership structure of the holding company, Airtel Africa.
A report in Mint suggests that the Tanzanian government’s concerns go beyond this basic confusion about the holding company structure. It has been claiming for some time that all of Airtel Tanzania belongs to the government. Be that as it may, analysts aren’t too worried about the confusion. Even if this part of the company’s African operations were left out, it wouldn’t materially change the valuation of Airtel Africa. In Tanzania, Airtel is only the number three carrier.
Meanwhile, as investors wait for the African unit’s IPO, it’s heartening that the company has managed to raise considerable equity and pare down debt. The latest fund-raise will help Bharti Airtel bring down its net debt to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) ratio to 3.15 times estimated FY20 earnings, compared to a leverage of 3.4 times before the deal, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities pointed out in a note to clients."

New Delhi: Large telecom operators including Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel have begun rolling out an ‘alternate digital KYC process’ for new connections, which will replace Aadhaar-based electronic verification process. 
New Delhi: Large telecom operators including Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel have begun rolling out an ‘alternate digital KYC process’ for new connections, which will replace Aadhaar-based electronic verification process.
Reliance Jio sources indicated that the operator has a plan on alternate digital KYC and will roll it out soon.
However, it is not immediately clear if telecom service providers are, for now, continuing Aadhaar eKYC for verification of new subscribers.
In the wake of the recent Supreme Court verdict on Aadhaar, the Telecom Department had, last week, issued detailed instructions to telcos on stopping the use of Aadhaar-based electronic-know your customer (e-KYC) and had asked them to report compliance by November 5. But operators, subsequently, approached the government requesting that they be allowed to continue with Aadhaar-based eKYC process till November 20, while they implement the new digital process. Sources in the Bharti Airtel told PTI that the alternate digital KYC process has begun in select circles including Delhi, UP (East) and UP (West) and will be extended to other locations in the coming days.
The official who did not wish to be named said the new digital KYC process entails scanning of the proof of address and identity, embedding live customer photo and online customer acquisition form, and that the entire process will be digital.
The official further pointed out that the company will be phasing out the eKYC process, as the digital KYC system is rolled out to new locations, and stablises.
An email sent to Bharti Airtel in this regard remained unanswered.
Vodafone Idea, in a statement, confirmed its new digital KYC process is live and is being rolled out nationally, and added that the DoT instructions allow for provisional roll out of digital KYC.
Reliance Jio did not respond to an e-mail query but sources indicated that for alternate digital KYC process, the company has a plan in place and will start rolling it out soon.
Aadhaar issuing-body Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) could not be reached for comments. However, a person familiar with provisions of Aadhaar Act was of the view that it may be difficult for the UIDAI to immediately pull the plug on telecom-related authentications as Section 32(3) of the Act prohibits it from collecting or maintaining any information about the specific purpose of an authentication. The Supreme Court had in a landmark verdict in September restricted the use of Aadhaar by private entities in the absence of a legal provision. 
On October 26, the telecom department asked operators to stop using Aadhaar for electronic verification of existing mobile phone customers as well as for issuing new connections to comply with the SC order. The Department of Telecom (DoT) in its October 26 circular had also taken note of the fact that the industry mooted an alternate process for KYC (know your customer) which entailed customer acquisition forms to be embedded with live photo of the subscriber and scanned images of proof of identity and proof of address -- thereby digitising the end-to-end process for on-boarding of new mobile subscribers and making it paperless.
Accordingly, all telecom service providers were asked by the Department of Telecom (DoT) to ensure readiness of their systems and offer the proof of concept of the proposed digital process by November 5 for approval.

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd’s credit rating was placed under review for a possible downgrade by Moody’s Investors Service on high debt levels and weak cash flow generation. 
Moody’s has placed on review for downgrade the Baa3 issuer and senior unsecured rating of Bharti Airtel, and the ratings on the backed senior unsecured notes issued by Bharti’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV, Moody’s said in a statement on Thursday.
Baa3 rating means the entity is medium-grade, subject to moderate credit risk and has an acceptable ability to repay short-term obligations, according to Moody’s.
“The review for downgrade is primarily driven by our expectation that Bharti’s cash flow generation will remain weak and leverage elevated,"" Annalisa DiChiara, vice president and senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in a statement. 
The review by Moody’s also reflects Bharti Airtel’s low levels of profitability, particularly from its core Indian mobile operations, negative free cash flow and higher debt levels to fund capital spending.
“Because we believe a more rational competitive environment in India’s telecommunications market is unlikely over the next 12-18 months, the review also reflects uncertainty as to whether the company’s profitability, cash flow situation and debt levels can improve sustainably and materially over the same period,"" DiChiara added. 
Moody’s said that its review for the downgrade will focus on Bharti Airtel’s plans to reduce debt levels significantly over a short period of time and its plans to turnaround the underlying Indian mobile operations.
“The ratings could be downgraded if the company fails to use proceeds received from its recent pre-IPO (initial public offering) of its African business or its proposed capital-raising activities for debt reduction,"" Moody’s said. 
“Moreover, any further deterioration in its operating performance, particularly in the Indian mobile segment, such that earnings and cash flows or revenue market share contracts from current levels, would also lead to a downgrade,"" it added."

428,2018-11-15,Airtel,"A more aggressive stance from Vodafone Idea will make the market share battle against Reliance Jio and Airtel uglier. As such, things may get worse before they get better on the profitability front

Vodafone Idea Ltd is down but not out. Its financial results are a mess. The recently merged company reported a pro forma Ebitda of  ₹ 977 crore for the September quarter, at margins of just 8.1%. At the time Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd announced their merger, margins were far more healthy at 26.5% and profits were more than five times higher than current levels. Bharti Airtel Ltd had also reported Ebitda margins of about 21% for its India wireless business last quarter. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.

At the time Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd announced their merger, margins were far more healthy at 26.5% and profits were more than five times higher than current levels. Bharti Airtel Ltd had also reported Ebitda margins of about 21% for its India wireless business last quarter. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Vodafone Idea will be quick to point out that this great divide with Airtel’s margins will get bridged after accounting for synergy benefits. But note that even after these savings kick in, profit will be merely enough to meet interest costs.
“Current annualized Ebitda plus synergy gains could mean a baseline Ebitda of  ₹ 10,000-12,000 crore. This would not leave much to spend on capex after paying interest,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities wrote in a note to clients.
What’s more, Vodafone Idea’s net debt stands at about 10 times these estimated Ebitda figures. As such, there is a desperate need to deleverage and raise funds for capital expenditure. Though Airtel is smaller in revenue terms, its capex is more than 2.5 times that of Vodafone Idea.
Capex constraints are reflecting in revenue market shares. Vodafone Idea’s pro forma revenues fell 7.1% sequentially in Q2, much higher than the 2.2% decline reported by Airtel.
It’s against this backdrop that the company has announced fundraising plans of  ₹ 25,000 crore (about $3.5 billion), of which more than  ₹ 18,000 crore will come from the promoters. At the current share price, this could mean a dilution of around 69% in the company’s equity. However, the news could lead to a rally in the stock, leading to lower dilution.
Vodafone Group Plc has indicated that it will bring in about $1.5 billion, which is a positive surprise. When the merger was announced, the UK-based company seemed keen on reducing its exposure to India, rather than increasing or even maintaining its stake. For now, plans to bring down its 45% stake in the Indian business on a par with that of the Aditya Birla Group (which is currently at 26%) seem to have been put on the back burner. Note that the Vodafone Group can raise funds by selling its stake in the Infratel-Indus Towers firm, and needn’t necessarily tap the parent company for a fresh infusion of funds. Vodafone Idea also said that it is looking at some asset sales to raise more cash.

A moot question is if the ammunition provided by the fundraise will make things better or worse on the tariff front. It’s quite likely that a more aggressive stance from Vodafone Idea will make the market share battle uglier, especially as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is still a long distance away from its target of 50% revenue market share. As such, things may get worse before they get better on the profitability front.
Of course, it goes without saying that Vodafone Idea has little choice but to raise cash quickly and deleverage, and provide room for its capex plans to defend its market share. Whether this will be enough is anybody’s guess."

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd. is raising more than $2 billion in loans from banks, as India’s second-biggest wireless carrier faces increased competition at home and the threat of a ratings downgrade to junk. 
Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd. is raising more than $2 billion in loans from banks, as India’s second-biggest wireless carrier faces increased competition at home and the threat of a ratings downgrade to junk.
The company, controlled by billionaire Sunil Bharti Mittal, has agreed to two- and three-year bilateral loans with 10 to 12 lenders, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who are not authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified.
Moody’s Investors Service on November 8 put Bharti’s Baa3 rating, its lowest investment-grade evaluation, on review for downgrade citing low levels of profitability and higher debt levels to fund capital spending.
A price war for Indian customers has worsened since billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd debuted with free services in 2016. Bharti delayed plans for an initial public offering of its Africa unit due to the turmoil in emerging markets, people with knowledge of the matter said last month.

The all-in cost for Bharti’s dollar loan, which includes margin and upfront fees for the deals, is about 110-120 basis points over London interbank offered rate, according to people familiar with the deal. A Bharti spokesman declined to comment on the transaction.
Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) B.V., a company unit, signed for separate bilateral loans totaling over 1.75 billion euros ($2 billion) with more than 10 lenders, people familiar with the matter said.

The 8GB RAM variant will be available for  ₹ 39,999. It is available for pre-booking starting today via Amazon India, Flipkart, Airtel’s online store and Samsung’s e-store. 
The most talked about feature of the phone is its quadruple rear camera setup, which allows the user to take ultra wide angle and telephoto shots. 
Samsung Galaxy A9: Specifications
The Samsung Galaxy A9 sports a 6.3-inch Full HD+ sAMOLED display with a resolution of 2220x1080. This means it has an aspect ratio of 18.5:9 and a pixel density of about 392ppi.
Under the hood, it is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC paired with 6GB or 8GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage that is expandable up to 512GB via a MicroSD card. 
The back of Galaxy A9 has four vertically-stacked cameras. The arrangement of them is similar to the on found on the Galaxy A7, which has three cameras. The camera setup can be thought of as telephoto and wide-angle cameras stacked on top of a primary dual camera module. The primary module consists of 24MP+5MP sensors with Phase Detection Autofocus and f/1.7 aperture. The wide-angle camera has an 8MP sensor at its heart while the telephoto camera has a 10MP sensor and provides 2x optical zoom.
The main reason to implement this setup is to offer professional camera-like capabilities inside a smartphone and providing more flexibility and versatility to the user when it comes to different shooting scenarios. We explored this (sans the telephoto module) in the Samsung Galaxy A7 in Goa—you can check out its camera review here.
The phone runs Android Oreo 8.0 with Samsung’s own “Samsung Experience"" UI running atop. It has dual SIM capabilities along with Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, FM Radio and USB Type-C as other connectivity options. It is backed by a 3,800mAh Li-ion battery.
It has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, unlike the Samsung Galaxy A7 which has one built inside the lock button."

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd jumped 9.3% and 16.5%, respectively, last Friday, and have retained most of those gains so far this week. Some investors got excited about rumours that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is set to raise tariffs. While there is little doubt that an increase in tariffs will bring much relief to telecom companies, the big question is if such a move is on the cards to begin with. 
Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd jumped 9.3% and 16.5%, respectively, last Friday, and have retained most of those gains so far this week. Some investors got excited about rumours that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd is set to raise tariffs. While there is little doubt that an increase in tariffs will bring much relief to telecom companies, the big question is if such a move is on the cards to begin with.
Reliance Jio hasn’t shied away from high amounts of cash burn to grow its market share at a quick pace. In less than two years of operations, it has grown to 23% of the market. Its share has risen further in the September quarter, although industry numbers are yet to be released by the sector regulator. Even so, the company is still a long distance away from its aspirational target of a 50% market share.
In this backdrop, analysts are surprised that such a move is being considered in the first place. “It would be premature, in our view, to presume Reliance would lift tariffs soon given its clear intent for market leadership,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. 
The brokerage firm estimates that competitive pressures may not ebb for another 9-12 months, given Jio’s clear focus on subscriber addition.
“The timing of the rumoured move is suspect, especially given Vodafone Idea’s recent announcement of a $3.5 billion fundraising plan,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. 
If anything, Reliance Jio may need to step the ante, considering that incremental market share gains may be more difficult to come by from two fairly well-capitalized companies, as opposed to early gains that came partly from firms that were on their way out.
Of course, it must be noted here that Jio’s stance thus far has been to maintain tariffs at levels that are about 20% cheaper than competition. If it raises tariffs, incumbents may be expected to maintain the differential by raising their own tariffs. Not that they would complain, given the rising cash burn in their own operations. But given this dynamic, it will be interesting to see how tariffs are calibrated, if at all."

Bharti Airtel shares jumped as much as 3.14% intraday to  ₹ 338.25 per share following the announcement.
The proposed IPO of the African unit follows a $1.25 billion fund raise by Airtel Africa, led by Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel, SoftBank Group International and others.
Earlier this month, Airtel Africa also announced its newly-constituted board of directors that includes representatives from Bharti Airtel and the investors. “The new Board of Directors brings a wealth of industry and governance experience to further drive the Airtel Africa business,"" the telecom operator said in the filing.
Airtel Africa is a pan-African telecommunications company with operations in 14 countries across Africa.
The proposed offering hit a roadblock earlier this month when the Tanzanian government not only disapproved the IPO, but also claimed that the government owns the Tanzanian unit.

The regulator’s diktat comes after Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced a new strategy to boost margins by rolling out minimum monthly recharge plans starting at  ₹ 35. The telecom operators are hoping that the move will help boost their average revenue per user (arpu) which has suffered due to an intense tariff war following the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.

The telecom operators are hoping that the move will help boost their average revenue per user (arpu) which has suffered due to an intense tariff war following the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
In its letter, Trai has asked operators to duly inform subscribers within three days in a clear and transparent manner the date on which the current validity of an existing plan would expire and the manner in which the subscriber can opt for available plans including minimum recharge plan using subscriber’s available prepaid account balance. Mint has seen a copy of the letter. Trai also met the two operators on Monday to discuss the issue.
“Till such time operators should not discontinue services of such customers who have balance in prepaid accounts equal to minimum recharge amount,"" Trai said in the letter.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea did not respond to emails.
In a post-earnings investors call last month, Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said the minimum recharge plans would reduce the number of marginal customers, rein in selling, general and administrative expenses, and help focus attention on improving services to premium customers.
Introducing higher minimum recharge plan would also reduce Airtel’s low-end customer base, which the management claims would help improve arpu, as customers would do more recharges.
India’s largest telecom operator Vodafone Idea too has rolled out such plans and will now have only a total of five plans in a bid to simplify tariff portfolio. It would have three monthly recharge plans of  ₹ 35,  ₹ 65 and  ₹ 95 to encourage higher value recharge, make tariff plans easier to understand, cut customer complaints and reduce costs, apart from recharge packs for  ₹ 145 and  ₹ 245 for longer validity periods.
This would also lead to significant reduction in incoming-only and inactive base, Vodafone Idea said in an investor presentation dated 21 November.

“Airtel’s plan is clear...to stay focused on the top 100 cities... stay focused on the high income, stay focused on high-rise buildings rather than horizontal deployment, as this business model is more economical and logical,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter said on condition of anonymity.
The commercial launch of Reliance Jio GigaFiber is expected to disrupt the wired broadband market in a similar way it disrupted the wireless market.
Reliance Jio has launched the registration process for Jio GigaFiber with an aim to connect 50 million homes but has not announced the pricing plans yet.
Reliance Jio GigaFiber would also be the largest greenfield fixed-line broadband rollout globally, with simultaneous introduction in 1,100 cities across India, which would connect homes, merchants, small and medium enterprises and large enterprises, Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani said in July.
Airtel, on the other hand, plans to cater to better-paying customers and aggressively expand this market. It has 2.2 million wired broadband customers as of 30 September. According to data available with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), there are 18 million wired broadband subscribers in the country. Reliance Jio has not yet commercially rolled out its broadband service.
“As long as it is the mid- to high-end of the market, Airtel will compete there very hard and match any prices offered by rivals,"" the person cited earlier said. “Two years ago, the company used to do half-a-million home passes every year. Last year it did one-and-a-half-million home passes. In 2018-19, Airtel is deploying 2.5 million home passes. In the next few years, the plan is to end up doing 8-10 million home passes. It already has 10 million home passes. This will make that a total of 20 million.""
In the wired internet segment, fibre is distributed to homes via an optical distribution frame, with a single fibre dedicated to each customer’s home, which is termed a home pass. This pass may or may not result in conversion of a customer.
Airtel believes that catering to the upper segment would be prudent as home broadband is a costly exercise and also requires more committed spending from the customer compared with a wireless subscriber and hence the company should focus on ensuring that consumption goes up.
ALSO READ | Airtel steps on the gas before Reliance Jio broadband launch
“Given that deployment of fibre is time-consuming and expensive, Airtel’s strategy to focus on the high-end consumers makes sense as it will generate healthier cash flows. It seems wise for the company to not invest heavily in areas where returns are going to be too far away in the long run,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
To ensure customer stickiness, Airtel also plans to build a digital platform, Airtel Homes Platform, wherein it will offer bundled services.

“There is an overlap of mobile and home broadband customers, as well as those who use DTH services. So the company is now creating propositions, whereby the customer benefits if he takes all three services,"" the person cited earlier said. “The billing is also integrated and will offer discounts. Airtel is also currently piloting in Andhra Pradesh the Airtel Homes Platform, whereby a customer can buy all three (broadband, DTH, SIM card) together.""
The platform will also offer not just products from Airtel’s stable, but also ancillary services such as home security and surveillance available through a third-party vendor, but serviced by Airtel.

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Wednesday dismissed a plea by the Competition Commission of India (CCI) seeking a probe against Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, on complaints of cartelisation by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The anti trust body had approached the Supreme Court in January this year challenging an order of the Bombay High Court, which set aside a probe against the telecom companies.
“We are dismissing it,"" said a three-judge bench headed by Justice A.K. Sikri.
On September 21, 2017, the Bombay High Court had ruled that the CCI had no jurisdiction to interpret contract conditions or policies of the telecom sector, which was governed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) Act, 1997.
The order was passed on a plea by Idea Cellular, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking to quash the CCI order directing an investigation into allegations of cartelisation made by Reliance Jio.
Reliance Jio had questioned the jurisdiction of the Bombay High Court and said the case must be heard by the Delhi High Court since the CCI order was passed in Delhi. This was rejected by the court.

New Delhi: Telecom operators are unlikely to get any financial relief on spectrum-related payments due to the exchequer unless all three companies—Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd—come together and agree that the industry is undergoing financial stress, a senior government official said requesting anonymity.
This comes after Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla last month met officials from the finance ministry and department of telecommunications (DoT) to discuss the firm’s pending spectrum-related liabilities. He had also flagged concerns on liquidity crunch in the sector.
This was followed by a letter from the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) to the DoT seeking financial relief.
Under present norms, an operator has to pay some amount at the time of purchase of spectrum. From the date of purchase, there is a two-year moratorium, after which the operator has to make the remaining payment over 16 years.
Vodafone Idea had sought increasing this period from 16 years to 18 years. But Reliance Jio has opposed that proposal, and hence there is no agreement among operators.
“The problem is that they are not able to come together as an industry and say there is stress,"" the official said. “We could have initiated some action if they could come together. If one player is opposing everything, and two players are saying they want relief, then what will the government do""?
Vodafone Idea faces spectrum liabilities worth  ₹ 3,000 crore due in March 2019 and an additional   ₹  12,000 crore due in mid-2019-2020, Credit Suisse said in a note dated 22 November.
The telecom sector is undergoing a fierce battle after the entry of Reliance Jio, which brought tariffs to the rockbottom. As a result of year-long consolidation among multiple operators, only two other private players are left: Bharti Airtel and the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.
Vodafone Idea posted  ₹ 4,970 crore loss in the September quarter, while Airtel posted a  ₹ 118 crore profit.
Meanwhile, the government has initiated action on the industry’s demand for reviewing import duties on telecom equipment. In October, the government raised basic customs duty on telecom equipment, including base stations and optical transport equipment, from 10% to 20%. Products that enjoyed zero percent import tax were slapped with a 10% customs duty.
“COAI had asked for import duties to be reviewed on telecom equipment. There’s a committee comprising of members of Department of Revenue, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology and DoT which is looking into it,"" the official said."
413,2018-12-07,Airtel,"There is an aggressive new entrant (Reliance Jio), a mature player (Airtel) and a third player which is going through strenuous amalgamation (Vodafone Idea)

New Delhi: Six months ago, Bharti Airtel Ltd was the undisputed leader in India’s telecom market with the largest subscriber base, highest profit and maximum revenue market share. The entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd however resulted in a bruising tariff war, which forced even a large corporate house like the Tata Group to exit the industry. Following a year-long consolidation, only two other private players were left in the field—Bharti Airtel and entity resulting from the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.

Following a year-long consolidation, only two other private players were left in the field—Bharti Airtel and entity resulting from the merger of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.
Although the dust in the telecom battleground has settled largely with three players remaining, the sector is at the cusp of an anomaly with no clear market leader emerging on key growth metrics and no distinct industry hierarchy in sight.
Sample this. Vodafone Idea Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by users and revenue market share, is also the only loss-making company among the three—posting a  ₹ 4,970 crore loss in the September quarter. Reliance Jio, which had 252 million subscribers compared with Vodafone Idea’s 435 million as of end-September, made a profit of  ₹ 681 crore in the same period.
The third player, Bharti Airtel, saw revenue from its India business fall 11% on-year in July-September. It lost 2.3 million users in September alone when Reliance Jio added 13 million.
So, who is the real number one telecom company?
“Vodafone Idea may have the most subscribers and revenue market share but clearly can’t be called the number one player or the industry leader if you look at all the parameters,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said, requesting anonymity.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) believes this abnormality is because of industry dynamics, which changed after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016. “The fundamental issue is that the industry has transformed from a voice-only network to an all-data network. The whole network has got more complex. As a result, we are wondering what are the right metrics to look at,"" COAI director general Rajan Mathews said.
The lobby group believes that in the current situation, the amount of data flowing on the network and the operator’s 4G coverage would be better metrics. “4G capacity will determine tomorrow’s leader. Who has the most subscribers is not a relevant metric anymore,"" Mathews said.
On 4G coverage, Reliance Jio is targeting 99% population coverage by March. Airtel has over 90% 4G coverage with an aggressive plan to grab the user’s primary 4G SIM slot. Vodafone Idea is the laggard with 50% 4G coverage. It plans to cover 70% of the country in the next six months, and 80% in 2019-20.
“Airtel and Jio are best placed to grab the low-hanging fruits and quickly upgrade customers from 2G to 4G in areas where Vodafone Idea doesn’t offer 4G currently,"" an industry executive said requesting anonymity.
Jio’s 4G user base of 252 million is almost twice of Airtel and Vodafone Idea combined.
“At this time, it is not quite clear which is the industry leader among telecom operators. But this should change over a year or two as the competition is forcing telcos to focus on their product and marketing,"" said Amresh Nandan, vice president and analyst (tech industry), Gartner. “The fight for the lead position would eventually not be based on subscriber size but revenue, profitability and even quality of revenue.""
Vodafone Idea is deploying technologies to handle 2G spectrum refarming to 4G.
With plans to raise up to  ₹ 25,000 crore, Vodafone Idea also faces spectrum liabilities of  ₹ 3,000 crore due in March and an additional  ₹ 12,000 crore due in the middle of the next financial year, Credit Suisse said in a note on 22 November.

“There is an aggressive new entrant (Jio), a mature player (Airtel) and a third player which is going through strenuous amalgamation (Vodafone Idea). The industry will have to wait for at least a year before getting a clear hierarchy in place,"" Mathews said.
This isn’t a sprint any more. It is a marathon."

Bernstein & Co. analysts Chris Lane and Samuel Chen.

Industry-leading rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd lack the “stomach"" to battle Reliance Industries Ltd’s Reliance Jio, which is luring away users with free voice services and inexpensive phones, Lane and Chen wrote in a report published 10 December.
Reliance Jio launched a free-for-life call service last year that triggered a price war and consolidation in one of the world’s most crowded mobile markets. Its free introductory nationwide 4G wireless service started in 2016, instantly roiling the world’s largest telecommunications sector after China’s.
Two years later, Reliance Jio—which began charging for data in 2017—has 227 million users and has become profitable as it brings connectivity to remote Indian villages.
The ensuing disruption forced smaller operators to quit, merge or go bankrupt. Newly merged Vodafone Idea has toppled Bharti Airtel to become India’s top operator, while Reliance Jio has quickly added subscribers to gain the No.3 spot.
Bernstein wrote that it expects Reliance Jio to keep selling its subsidized Jio Phone, the 4G feature phones it sells for a refundable deposit of $23 (about  ₹ 1,500), until it reaches the No.1 position.

Bernstein said average revenue per unit (arpu) would probably rise for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea this year as they cancel user contracts that generate little revenue. The research firm does not expect 3G/4G pricing to start to creep up until 2020. Bernstein lowered its price targets for Airtel to  ₹ 450 a share and Vodafone Idea to  ₹ 40 a share.

New Delhi: The tax directorate of Niger has ordered closure of offices of Airtel Niger seeking tax dues that have been disputed by the operator, but the company is hopeful of early amicable resolution through a “collaborative dialogue"", according to a statement.
“The General Tax Directorate of Niger ordered the closure of the offices of Airtel Niger, seeking tax amounts that have been disputed by Airtel. This follows similar action taken against another global operator last week,"" Airtel said in a statement.
In response to an email sent to it over reports that Niger directed closure of offices of Airtel for unpaid taxes of $107 million, the company said an assessment was made relating to Airtel’s taxes in October 2018.
“Based on independent advice, Airtel believes that this was done without appreciation of the facts and law and with undue haste in dismissing the detailed responses submitted by Airtel. This resulted in an astounding demand amounting to approximately 70% of its annual revenues,"" it said.
Airtel is committed to a collaborative dialogue to resolve the issue, and has requested the authorities to review the issues in depth to reach a mutually acceptable solution, the statement added.
“Airtel Niger remains hopeful of an early amicable resolution to this unfortunate situation in the interest of its over 4.4 million customers, over 500 direct and indirect employees and over 50,000 retail shops and outlets,"" the statement added.
Airtel, the leading operator in Niger, has invested into the economy and contributed to the development of telecommunications in the West Africa nation. Airtel Niger -- a subsidiary of Airtel Africa -- has also recently upgraded the network to facilitate 3G availability and is the only operator to acquire a 4G license, which it did in April 2018 at a cost of $22 million, the statement added."
409,2018-12-14,Airtel,"Trai cannot impose penalty for predatory pricing and discounted tariffs, says TDSAT, asking Trai to reconsider the provisions within 6 months

New Delhi: India’s top telecom tribunal on Thursday quashed controversial rules on predatory pricing, in a relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which had complained that the rules would benefit rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
New Delhi: India’s top telecom tribunal on Thursday quashed controversial rules on predatory pricing, in a relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which had complained that the rules would benefit rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had issued the new rules arbitrarily and without deliberation or effective consultation, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) ruled. The tribunal rejected Trai’s new definition of “significant market player"" (SMP), besides sparing telecom firms from disclosing on their websites segmented offers or tariff discounts aimed at retaining customers.
During the TDSAT hearings, the telecom firms argued that information on segmented offers were a trade secret and its disclosure would help rivals and, hence, confidential information of such nature should not be asked to be disclosed.
According to the TDSAT order, instead of reporting all segmented offers/discounts, Trai may call for details of any segmented offer about which it receives complaints.
The tribunal directed Trai to reconsider within six months provisions related to predatory pricing and segmented offers, barring it from imposing any penalty on this count.
“Authority (Trai) is required to take fresh decision on relevant issues in case of segmented offers and whether prevailing facts and health of sector would require major changes in meaning of tariff plans,"" the order said.
Trai will challenge the verdict in the Supreme Court, an official at the regulator said on condition of anonymity.
In February, Trai directed telcos to transparently disclose segmented offers and set the penalty for violations at  ₹ 5,000 for every day of delay, subject to a maximum of  ₹ 2 lakh. Operators were required to report any new tariffs to Trai within seven working days from the date of their implementation, after conducting a self-check to ensure the tariffs are transparent, non-discriminatory and non-predatory.
Moreover, under the new rules, Trai could examine tariffs of an SMP—an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market—to check for predatory pricing. The new definition of “total activity"" was based on any of two parameters—subscriber base and gross revenue—while an earlier definition included subscriber base, revenue, switching capacity and volume of traffic. According to other operators, excluding traffic from the definition of SMP would help Jio, which enjoys huge traffic on its network.
Under the new rules, Trai had also said that it would look at whether the tariff is below the firm’s average variable cost over a certain period, in addition to whether there was evidence of a specific intent to engage in predatory pricing; and if the tariff was found predatory, an operator was liable to pay a penalty of up to  ₹ 50 lakh per tariff plan per telecom circle.
While Bharti and Idea moved TDSAT against the Trai rules, Vodafone challenged them in the Madras high court, alleging that the order would result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio, as it took away their flexibility to compete and retain customers in a circle in which they are significant market players.
The tribunal was critical of the Trai order: “By this definition, Trai has encouraged and permitted non-SMPs to indulge in predation by creating a presumption that only SMPs can be capable of predation,"" it said.
“The concept that only an SMP is capable of predation and therefore fit to be subjected to scrutiny for purposes of clause 7 and penalty is over-theoretical and divorced from all practical considerations well-known to competition laws,"" TDSAT said. It added that Trai had exceeded its role and powers by developing a complex concept of SMP and non-predation.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio did not comment on the verdict."

New Delhi: Telecom operator Bharti Airtel and Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson on Friday claimed to have achieved broadband download speed of 500 Megabits per second (Mbps) on smartphones during live trial of a new technology. 
“During the trial, data download speeds of over 500 Mbps were recorded on smartphones in an indoor environment. In outdoor environment, peak download speed of more than 400 Mbps was achieved with coverage of about 180 meters from the base station. The trial was conducted in Delhi-NCR,"" Airtel and Ericsson said in a joint statement. 
Both companies jointly conducted India’s first trial of Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) technology over a live 4G network. LAA is a key technology wherein operators evolve their networks to achieve gigabit LTE (4G) by opening up previously untapped resources of unlicensed spectrum delivering speeds once thought only possible over fiber.
LAA enables the use of unlicensed spectrum in the 5 GHz band in combination with the licensed spectrum.
“Airtel used one LTE 5 MHz carrier aggregated with three 20 MHz carriers of unlicensed spectrum. Together with 4CC carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM technologies, the trial was conducted using Ericsson Radio System,"" the statement said.

New Delhi: A week after a telecom tribunal quashed the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) rules on predatory pricing and discounted offers, the regulator has appealed the tribunal’s verdict in the Supreme Court, arguing that it dismantles the regulatory framework for tariff assessment and places consumers at the mercy of service providers.
The regulator, in an appeal filed on Friday, has also asserted that the tribunal’s judgement hinders it from performing its statutory functions.
The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) had on 13 December quashed Trai’s predatory pricing order, in a relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which had complained that the rules would benefit rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Trai had set the new rules arbitrarily and without deliberation or effective consultation, TDSAT had ruled. The tribunal rejected Trai’s new definition of “significant market player"" (SMP), besides sparing telecom firms from disclosing on their websites segmented offers or tariff discounts aimed at retaining customers.
“The tribunal has erred in taking the view that it would not be necessary for telecom service providers to disclose details of segmented offers and if there is any other sensitive information which they feel would affect their business interests, they would be at liberty to withhold such information by offering a written explanation to Trai,"" the regulator said.
In February, Trai directed telcos to transparently disclose segmented offers and set the penalty for violations at  ₹ 5,000 for each day of delay, subject to a maximum of  ₹ 2 lakh.
Moreover, under the new rules, Trai could examine tariffs of an SMP—an operator holding a share of at least 30% of total activity in a relevant market—to check for predatory pricing.

While Airtel and Idea approached TDSAT against the Trai rules, Vodafone challenged them in the Madras high court, alleging that the order would result in an unfair advantage to Reliance Jio, as it took away the three rivals’ flexibility to compete and retain customers in a circle in which they are significant market players.
In the appeal, Trai has also said that the tribunal’s judgement grants liberty to private operators to withhold information of segmented offers and discounts provided to existing customers, which is against the objectives of transparency and non-discrimination.
Moreover, the verdict quashes the operator’s requirement to disclose such discounts to the regulator which has created an anomalous situation where Trai’s power to regulate tariffs has been made redundant, Trai said in the appeal."

In October, Bharti Airtel had said that half a dozen marquee investors, including Warburg Pincus Llc, Temasek Holdings, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd and SoftBank Group Corp, will invest a combined $1.25 billion in Airtel Africa ahead of a potential initial public offering (IPO) and the funds would be used to trim Airtel Africa Ltd’s debt of $5 billion and expand operations in that continent.
As part of its steps to cut debt and monetise assets, Airtel in August sold a 20% stake in its satellite television arm, Bharti Telemedia Ltd, to private equity firm Warburg Pincus for $350 million.
In February this year, Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (Singtel) said it would will indirectly raise its stake in Airtel by investing  ₹ 2,649 crore in Bharti Telecom Ltd, the promoter company of Airtel, through a preferential allotment of shares.
The board on Thursday also approved transfer of up to 591.87 million equity shares or 32% of Bharti Infratel Ltd’s stake owned by Airtel to its wholly owned subsidiary Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd (Nettle) as it deems fit. This is part of the company’s overall strategy to monetize its stake in Bharti Infratel, which is also in the process of a merger with Indus Towers Ltd.
Airtel had in November last year offloaded 83 million shares of its subsidiary Bharti Infratel for  ₹ 3,325 crore through secondary share sale in the stock market to use the proceeds from this sale to pare its debt. The sale was carried out by Airtel via Nettle Infrastructure Investments.
Prior to that, Airtel had sold 3.65% of its stake in Bharti Infratel in August last year to raise more than  ₹ 2,570 crore and before that in March last year it sold 10.3% stake in the tower unit to a consortium of investors to raise  ₹ 6,193.9 crore.

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has wrested market share from Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, as the relatively new entrant in the telecom sector continued to add a large number of users even as its bigger rivals lost customers. Reliance Jio added 10.5 million users in October while Vodafone Idea and Airtel lost 7.3 million and 1.8 million users, respectively, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Wednesday. India’s overall wireless user base grew by just 724,725 subscribers during the month.

India’s overall wireless user base grew by just 724,725 subscribers during the month.
Till now, the growth of Reliance Jio was largely attributed to smaller companies exiting the market because of the brutal tariff war triggered by its entry in late 2016. The wave of telecom sector consolidation that followed has left just three operators in the market. That Reliance Jio has added close to 10 million users almost every month in 2018 implies that the pressure on Vodafone Idea and Airtel in unlikely to abate.
In September, Reliance Jio added 13.02 million subscribers, while Vodafone Idea lost 6.68 million subscribers and Airtel lost 2.35 million users. Before September, Vodafone and Idea competed as separate entities. Airtel did not lose subscribers in the first eight months of 2018.
“It would appear that while incumbents are shedding marginal subscribers, Reliance Jio is acquiring new ones. However, it would be useful to know the number of subscribers who use Jio as their primary SIM,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India. “The incumbents are undoubtedly under great pressure and are struggling to compete. The large debt sitting on their books further impacts their ability to raise funds and invest in their networks.""
Vodafone Idea reported a  ₹ 4,970 crore loss in the September quarter, while Airtel posted a meagre profit of  ₹ 118 crore.
In contrast, Reliance Jio made a profit of  ₹ 681 crore during the same period.
In a strategic shift to boost profitability, Airtel and Vodafone Idea in November also introduced minimum recharge plans starting at  ₹ 35 a month, with an aim to reduce the number of low-paying and inactive customers, rein in selling expenses and focus on improving services to better-paying customers. This, the two operators believe, would improve average revenue per user, or arpu, as customers would do more recharges.
However, it seems that the competitive pressure on incumbents is likely to linger for some more time, especially given that Reliance Jio is not only grabbing subscribers but also cornering a large portion of the revenue market share. In the July-September period, Reliance Jio more than doubled its revenue market share to 26.1%, compared with just 11.6% in the same quarter in 2017.

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd added 8.5 million active subscribers in October, much better than Bharti Airtel Ltd’s tally of 3.4 million, shows data compiled by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. Vodafone Idea Ltd’s active user base eroded by 2.9 million. Its shares unsurprisingly fell 2%.
Interestingly, Reliance Jio’s parent, Reliance Industries Ltd’s (RIL’s) shares also fell 1.5% despite the gains in subscriber base. It may be gaining ground, but its focus on subscriber additions and cost-effective feature phones are limiting earnings expectations. “We note that the chase for feature phone subscriber market share has led to the roll out of low-average revenue per user plans,"" Motilal Oswal said in a note, referring to the Jio Phone offering. In any case, investors are already pricing in a far higher market share for Reliance Jio in RIL’s current valuations. The monthly subscriber addition numbers can do little to increase bullishness on the stock.
Besides, the subdued trend in subscriber additions at incumbents does not necessarily mean commensurate revenue market share gains. After all, Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been looking to weed out low-value subscribers. They introduced minimum recharge plans, requiring subscribers to mandatorily recharge to stay active on the network. In fact, this may lead to further subscriber share losses, as the full impact of the tariff hike is yet to be seen.
According to Motilal Oswal, around one-third of (35%) of Airtel and Vodafone Idea subscribers are low-paying customers (sub-₹15). As the tariff hikes kick in, the broking firm sees significant churn in this part of the user base. 
“A drop in the number of subscribers, per se, isn’t something that will worry incumbents,"" says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm. Of course, it’s another matter if Reliance Jio starts weaning away high-value subscribers as well. Revenue market share numbers till the September quarter show that the new entrant has been more successful in markets outside the metros, indicating that incumbents have done reasonably well in holding on to high-value subscribers.
Much also depends on how dual-SIM users react to the tariff hikes. If a large section of customers prefers to retain Reliance Jio as their primary telecom connection, then it can make a notable dent to incumbents’ revenue base, say analysts."

Dares Salaam: Bharti Airtel has agreed to give part of its stake in Airtel Tanzania to the government, raising the East African nation’s holding in the mobile phone operator to 49% from 40%, the president’s office said on Friday. The announcement followed talks in Dar es Salaam between President John Magufuli and Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal to resolve a dispute over ownership of the Tanzanian mobile operator.
“We have in principle agreed to move forward with a new arrangement of shareholding of 51:49 — where Airtel will now drop from 60% to 51% and the people of Tanzania through the ownership of the government of Tanzania will own 49%,"" Mittal said.
The value of the share transfer deal was not provided.
Magufuli had said in 2017 that state-run Tanzania Telecommunications Company Ltd (TTCL) owned the local subsidiary of Bharti Airtel outright but had been cheated out of shares.
Bharti Airtel had disputed this, saying it received all the required approvals from the state when it bought a 60 percent stake and had complied with all government rules.
Mittal said on Friday that Tanzania wanted to increase its shareholding. “Such negotiations do take some time. We are glad that we have come to a point where we will be making some final decisions,"" Mittal said.
Magufuli said in Friday’s statement that, in addition to giving the government more shares, Bharti Airtel had agreed to pay dividends to the state. “It’s great that they have agreed to give dividends to the government, which for eight to 10 years we had not received. The percentage of dividends is still under discussion,"" the president said.

392,2019-01-21,Airtel,"Vodafone Idea is wearing the mantle of market leader uncomfortably On an apples-to-apples comparison, Reliance Jio may have already overtaken incumbents' revenues in Q3

The Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd juggernaut continues to gather steam. The three months ended 31 December marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential growth for the telecom firm. With a quarterly revenue of  ₹10,383 crore, Jio has in all likelihood overtaken Bharti Airtel Ltd’s India wireless revenue. Most analysts expect Airtel’s third-quarter revenue to decline slightly from the  ₹10,250 crore level in the September quarter.
But that is fairly well known. A moot question is whether Jio has also overtaken Vodafone Idea Ltd. The market leader reported wireless revenue of around  ₹11,300 crore in the September quarter, and it’s unlikely the revenue would have fallen over 8% sequentially in the December quarter. So perhaps, Vodafone Idea can wear the mantle of market leader for another three months.
But note here that we aren’t comparing apples to apples. Jio’s revenue does not include interconnect fees received from other telcos, while those of its competitors do. Interconnect charges are payable by a telecom operator whose subscriber makes a call to the telco whose subscriber receives the call. While incumbents may claim that these are legitimate charges and must form part of revenue, the fact remains that they will be abolished in less than a year from now. As such, a comparison that excludes interconnect usage charge (IUC) receipts makes sense.
Jio had a revenue market share of around 31.4% in the September quarter using this measure, marginally short of Vodafone Idea’s 31.8% share, according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. With Jio’s revenue having grown in double digits in the third quarter, it would have easily overtaken Vodafone Idea, even if the latter reports flat revenue. Kotak’s calculations involve myriad assumptions and calculations, which are best left alone. But whatever the assumptions, it’s fair to say Jio will be crowned market leader on revenue adjusted for IUC receipts, after incumbents report their third-quarter earnings.
Note that Jio has raced from upstart to market leadership in a little over two years since its commercial launch. As if that wasn’t bad enough from the incumbents’ point of view, they need to prepare for far worse. After all, while announcing third-quarter earnings, Jio told analysts it sees no need to tinker with tariffs. Current tariffs are in a sweet spot, the firm seems to think, as these are supporting double-digit sequential growth and inducing subscriber churn at incumbents.
For incumbents, there is nothing sweet about the current tariff levels. Airtel and Vodafone Idea are running large pre-tax losses already, and the only way out is higher tariffs. Jio’s statement that it is happy with the current tariff levels sent shares of Airtel and Vodafone Idea down 6.5% and 5%, respectively on Friday.
The hope that Jio might raise tariffs to reduce its own cash burn seems to be fading. In the third quarter, it reported a cash profit of about  ₹2,500 crore and a capital expenditure of  ₹14,000 crore, which shows that cash burn remains high. As a result, indebtedness at its parent, Reliance Industries Ltd, has climbed to around  ₹3 trillion, or about four times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
But Reliance’s answer to this is to look for opportunities to monetize its tower and fibre assets, rather than raising tariffs and cash flows. Investors should note that such sales involve some give and take. The higher the tower assets are valued, the higher will be the rentals the buyer of the assets demands, as is typical of any sale and leaseback transaction. As such, while debt may reduce a bit, so will profitability.
For now, investors don’t seem to be too bothered by all of this: Reliance shares rose 4.5% on Friday, with investors presumably enthused about the telco arm’s increasing dominance."
391,2019-01-22,Airtel,"A bench headed by justice R.F. Nariman issued notices to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, and Reliance Jio InfocommTDSAT had highlighted the need for “objective” yardsticks to introduce vital changes relating to SMP and non-predation

The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear a plea by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) against the 13 December ruling of the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) quashing the regulator’s tariff order on predatory pricing.
A bench headed by justice R.F. Nariman issued notice to telecom companies Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone, and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Companies such as Airtel and Vodafone contended that these rules on predatory pricing would give undue advantage to new players such as Reliance Jio Infocomm.
The telecom regulator had, through its order, sought to introduce the concepts of “significant market power"" and “non predation"" and also permit non-reporting of “segmented offers/discounts"" by telecom service providers.
TDSAT had, while setting aside Trai’s Telecommunication Tariff (Sixty Third Amendment) Order, 2018 (1 of 2018) of 16 February, 2018, highlighted the need for “objective"" yardsticks to introduce vital changes relating to SMP and non-predation including “variable cost"" concept.
“The yardsticks must be objective and known to all telecom service providers or else the task must be left to be dealt with under the competition laws so that a competent authority can decide a complaint alleging predation,"" the appellate tribunal said. 
It also found the consultation process adopted by the telecom regulator to develop a new concept of SMP and non-predation ineffective.
Trai, however, contended that the appellate tribunal had, by setting aside its tariff order, exceeded its jurisdiction and thus virtually dismantled the statutory framework in force since 1999.
“The impugned judgment seriously acts against the interest of the consumers and deserves to be interfered with and ought to be set aside,"" it said."

389,2019-01-23,Airtel,"It must ratchet up the scale of its ambition, and rediscover the audacity that lay behind its original success

eliance Jio fired the most dramatic opening salvo of the new year with its announcement that it was venturing into the e-commerce space. It also served notice to its powerful competitors by suggesting that data of Indians should be controlled by Indian companies. Whatever be the trajectory of Reliance’s e-commerce ambitions, much can be learnt from its declaration. First, there must be a clear realization that the internet is a melting pot where connectivity providers, search engines, social media companies, device manufacturers and e-commerce platforms are engaged in stiff competition with each other, even as they cooperate in various ways to provide services to customers. For instance, Google’s search engine competes with Amazon in e-commerce by providing comparison shopping services. Second, the competitive advantage in this game will be seized by the company that is able to gather the most amount of data from customers and use it in the most effective manner. Third, bending the still nascent rules of the game to one’s advantage will constitute a key pillar of market leadership. Fourth, a stratospheric level of ambition is a necessary condition for mere survival in this market. And finally, the ability to “mess with the minds of competitors"" using jaw-dropping announcements followed by razor sharp execution is key.
It seems almost superfluous to mention that as of January 2019, Jio seems to have established a clear advantage over Airtel and Vodafone Idea. It is not even clear whether Jio regards them as its primary competition in the long run. So far, Jio’s growth was largely attributed to smaller telecom companies exiting the market. However, in October 2018, with all small firms having already exited the market, Jio added 10.5 million users while Vodafone Idea and Airtel lost 7.3 million and 1.8 million users, respectively.
In terms of its recent loss of subscriber numbers, the most plausible hypothesis is that the incumbents are losing 2G, 3G, and the 4G mass market customers. The 4G premium customers may have no reason to move and may even be averse to the Jio brand. Airtel’s problems with the mass market segment can be tackled by the introduction of a 4G feature phone, the simplification of its pricing plans to match the clarity of Jio’s plans, and bringing more flexibility in its data plans by setting monthly data limits rather than daily limits.
But to address the problems of Airtel and Vodafone Idea in terms of subscriber numbers would be to miss the point. The game today is not about allowing subscribers to connect to the internet but, rather, helping them to solve problems and becoming a part of the way they live, work and play. In the case of Airtel, it is also about stopping being seen as the follower and recovering its leadership position. In terms of subscribers, the company is still the leader with 343.5 million. It caters to a large percentage of technology startups in India. But in the battle for the mind of the customer, it seems to be a step slower than the new kid on the block.
To reclaim its lost leadership brand, Airtel should draw a leaf out of the politician’s playbook. The Congress party has recently come back from the dead by targeting farmers, SMEs, and unemployed youth. K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) has held off the challenge of the mahagathbandhan by a slew of welfare measures, including a successful scheme for giving doles to farmers. The challenges of the mass market can be best addressed by a similar targeting strategy. Here are three possible ideas that could help.
First, an agri-tech platform to provide farm-related services via the farmer’s mobile phone. Farmers residing in rural areas have started using popular communication apps. With its partner IFFCO Kisan Sanchar Ltd, Airtel can bring in efficiencies on a massive scale by filling knowledge gaps related to weather predictions, mandi rates, trader contact details, updates on government policies and subsidy details. Once they grow data-rich, Airtel’s platform can provide insights and data-driven recommendations moderated by expert opinion on crop selection. It can evolve into a complete e-commerce platform exclusively for farmers.
Second, an all-India weather portal that can be used by farmers, insurance companies, logistics providers, aviation companies and energy utilities. The weather solution can work off connectivity provided by sensors placed all over the country.
Third, a “Come to India"" initiative that aims to turbocharge India’s highly underutilized tourism potential, both for international and domestic tourists, by the creation of millions of competent travel guides, waste warriors, tour operators and travel agents in partnership with government agencies. This could be synergized with a skills development and jobs portal for the youth of the country, especially those looking for jobs in the range of  ₹15,000-25,000 a month.
In short, Airtel has to transform itself from a connectivity provider to a cause-driven company that aims to radically improve the lives of ordinary Indians. It must ratchet up the scale of its ambition, and rediscover the audacity that lay behind its original success. The journey will probably require a rewiring of its culture.
As Louis Gerstner, the CEO responsible for making IBM an internet-compatible company, said: “Until I came to IBM, I probably would have told you that culture was just one among several important elements in any organization’s makeup and success… I came to see, in my time at IBM, that culture isn’t just one aspect of the game; it is the game.""
We look forward to a jaw-dropping announcement or two from India’s pioneering communications company.

TRAI has given time till January 31 for consumers to select channels of their choice under the new framework for broadcasting and cable services and said all existing packs of subscribers will continue uninterrupted till then.
The TRAI, in March, 2017, had notified the new regulatory framework for broadcasting and cable services and re-notified it on July 3, 2018, prescribing the implementation schedule.
“All existing packs/plans/bouquets to the subscribers will continue uninterrupted till January 31, 2019. No service provider to disconnect any signal or feed to any MSO/LCO (local cable operator)/subscriber till January 2019,"" TRAI had said in a statement."
395,2019-01-28,Airtel,"After the TRAI order, all broadcasters like Sony, Zee, Star, Discovery, Sun, Turner and Viacom have declared prices of their individual pay channels as well as those of bouquets. Here are 10 things to know about selecting new 2019 plans on Airtel DTH, Dish TV, Hathway and other cable operators.

New Delhi: Following implementation of new regulations imposed on DTH service providers and cable operators by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), you can now reduce your monthly TV bill by limiting your subscription to only those TV channels you watch. Consumers have been given time till the end of this month to make a choice for uninterrupted service after January. In the new regulations, any DTH provider like Airtel DTH TV, Tata Sky or Dish TV can charge a maximum of only   ₹ 130, excluding GST, for a set of 100 non-HD channels.

In the new regulations, any DTH provider like Airtel DTH TV, Tata Sky or Dish TV can charge a maximum of only   ₹ 130, excluding GST, for a set of 100 non-HD channels.
If you opt for any pay channel in that list of 100, you have to pay extra, according to the MRP of that individual channel. After a TRAI order, all broadcasters like Sony, Zee, Star, Discovery, Sun, Turner and, Viacom have declared which of their TV channels are free-to-air (FTA) and which ones are pay channels.
10 things to know about selecting new plans on Airtel DTH, Dish TV, Hathway, other cable operators and multi-system operators:
1. Besides a la carte rates, all major broadcasters have also declared various bouquets based on genre and language. The prices declared by individual broadcasters are the maximum retail price and your TV service provider can offer you a deal below the MRP. Even the price of the base packs can be lower than   ₹ 130.
2. On its website, Airtel DTH TV shows a base pack of   ₹ 99 with a host of SD (standard definition) channels. Tata Sky’s lowest base pack, too, begins from   ₹ 99. However, both the operators have a list of select SD TV channels as part of the pack. As the new TRAI rules come into force, these base packs will also undergo a change as you will have the liberty to put any SD channel of your choice in the base pack. Any pay channel you include in the list gets added to your bill.
3. In the new regulations, any subscriber wanting to watch more than 100 channels can choose additional channels in each slab of 25 channels with at a maximum price of   ₹ 20 per slab. According to TRAI, consumers opting for more than 100 channels are rare and form only 10-15% of the market. About 80% subscribers, according to the viewing pattern from BARC, do not even flip more than 40 channels.
4. “If a consumer carefully chooses channels of choice for the complete requirement of a family, the amount payable may be even less than the present payments being made per month,"" TRAI says on its website.
5. As reported to TRAI, there are as many as 330 pay TV channels, including HD and SD, from 40 broadcasters. The list of private FTA channels goes up to 535.
6. Among the 40 broadcasters, at least 17 have announced bouquets of several channels with discounted pricing. For example, a bouquet of 9 channels will cost   ₹ 63 if taken a la carte basis but if bought together, the price reduces by almost half to   ₹ 31.
7. FTA channels can’t be clubbed with pay channels in a bouquet. Further, HD channels can’t be clubbed with the SD version of the same channel, so that the consumer has complete clarity with respect to what is on offer.
8. You also have the freedom to buy a set-top box from the market and not from the service provider. However, that set-top box will have to be technically compliant with the system of the operator.
9. TRAI has instructed that there shall be no blackout of services till January 31 but after that, you may be pushed to the basic pack, which has no pay channels. To avoid disruption in services, you have to migrate to the new plan by the end of the month.
10. Every cable operator or DTH player has been asked to run a consumer information channel preferably on channel No. 999 wherein consumer-related information including the prices of channels shall be displayed."

New Delhi: Whether you are a DTH or cable TV subscriber, your TV bill will not appear the same from February when the new regulatory regime, as mandated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), kicks off. The regulatory body has come up with a set of rules which changes plans, packages and pricing of TV channels by all operators like Airtel DTH, Tata Sky, Dish TV, Hathway Cable, Siti Cable, Sun DTH, etc.

The regulatory body has come up with a set of rules which changes plans, packages and pricing of TV channels by all operators like Airtel DTH, Tata Sky, Dish TV, Hathway Cable, Siti Cable, Sun DTH, etc.
The new tariff order by TRAI, in most likelihood, will reduce the price you pay for watching television if you make a judicious choice of channels. After the TRAI order, not only have all broadcasters like Sony, Star, Zee, Discovery, Disney, National Geographic and Sun TV have announced individual pricing of all their TV channels but they have also come up with bouquets of several channels at discounted packages.
Base package:
The new framework mandates all operators, including DTH, cable service provider or multi-system operator, to have a base package of 100 channels. You have the freedom to choose free to air (FTA) or pay channels or any bouquet of several channels in that list.
Your service provider cannot charge more than  ₹130 for the base package, excluding GST. If you want to watch a pay channel you will have to pay more for every such choice you make. The latest list by TRAI shows that there are 330 pay TV channels and 535 FTA channels.
Currently, Airtel DTH and Tata Sky are offering a base pack which begins from  ₹99.
Individual and bouquet channel package price:
TRAI has come up with a portal www.channeltariff.trai.gov.in which lists the price of all pay channels as well as bouquet packages of all broadcasters. The price mentioned in the list is MRP and no distributor can charge more than the maximum retail price declared by a broadcaster. The distributor can, however, choose to offer you discounted tariff plans.
Out of the list of 100 TV channels in the base package, you will have to deselect any number of FTA channels of your choice and add pay channels of equal number. The overall limit cannot cross 100.
Extra channels:
In case you want to watch more than 100 channels in the base package, you can top it up with more channels. For every 25 channels, you add to the list of 100, you pay  ₹20 extra. For example, if you pay  ₹150, excluding GST, you get access to 125 channels. Besides that, you will have to pay extra for any pay channel you include on the list.
Cost of migration to new plans:
In case you have already paid for an annual plan, then the distributor shall continue to provide services for the remaining period without change in tariff plan, according to new TRAI rules. If you switch over to a new package after 1 February, then the proportional balance amount of existing package can be adjusted against the new package."
388,2019-04-24,Airtel,"Far from leaving a hole that can’t be filled, the exit of a market leader often triggers a burst of fresh growth. IndiGo and SpiceJet will soon fill the gaping hole left in the wake of the Jet Airways crisis

More than 2,000 years before Jet Airways (India) Ltd looked set to join the ash heap of airline history, Aristotle postulated horror vacui, the concept we understand as “nature abhors a vacuum"". While Hindu philosophers as well as those like Epicurus and Lucretius subsequently debunked the thought, it is a convenient way of looking at where the Jet Airways crisis is headed.
While Naresh Goyal may well choose to believe (and declare), that après moi le déluge—reality may be a bit more banal—even if it hurts his delicate sensibilities. Markets, especially free ones, tend to handle the loss of a single competitor with far greater equanimity than what floundering protagonists themselves display when faced with their unfortunate demise.
Examples abound of industries where the loss of one or even more participants has been swiftly followed either by existing players stepping up to the plate or newcomers seizing the opportunity.
In the aviation industry, of course, we have the oft-chronicled instance of how when the first set of private airlines like Damania Airways, ModiLuft and East-West Airlines collapsed in the mid-1990s, they were replaced quickly by newer players like Jet Airways, Air Sahara, Air Deccan and of course, Kingfisher Airlines. In turn, even as the last three were disappearing from the map, their place in the sky was being taken up by IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir.
The airline business is at its core fairly straightforward, with the mobility of underlying assets a given. Planes, gates, pilots and other key resources can smoothly be transferred from one company to another. After all, in which other business can you slap a new name over an existing one overnight and operate as if nothing has changed?
But, even in a more complex sector like the telecom industry in India, the elimination of six of the nine companies that were present in the business even three years ago hasn’t led to a shrinking of the market or even a paucity of choice for the customer. Indeed, if anything, with the business reduced to just three major competitors, there has been a bonanza for customers in terms of lower prices and greater data offerings.
Far from leaving a hole that can’t be filled, the exit of a market leader often triggers a burst of fresh growth. That happens largely because incumbents, especially those who are leaders, tend to get caught napping just when the market is ready for take-off.
In 2007, Nokia had a 50% share of the smartphone market. Today, its share is down to barely 1%, but the market for smartphones has grown exponentially. Nokia didn’t read the tea leaves and paid the price for it.
Around the same time, an entirely new business was emerging around the social media space. At this time, Myspace was acquired by Rupert Murdoch for $580 million in 2005 in an effort to leverage its hugely popular online community for his news business. Just four years later, Murdoch sold Myspace at a massive 90% discount, effectively killing it as a competitor. But instead of signalling the end of social media as a business, it marked the rise and rise of Facebook.
Market leaders slip and fall due to complacency, mismanagement, circumstances beyond their control or simply because they have nothing new left to offer, and this cycle of boom and doom has become increasingly shorter.
Indeed, the consolidation that has taken place in both telecom and aviation in India is the new norm for businesses across the world.
In a recent piece in the Harvard Business Review titled The High Price Of Efficiency, author Roger L. Martin points out, “In more and more industries, profits are concentrated in a handful of companies. For instance, 75% of US industries have become more concentrated in the past 20 years. In 1978, the 100 most profitable firms earned 48% of the profits of all publicly traded companies combined, but by 2015 the figure was an incredible 84%."" 
So, let’s ignore all the hosannas for Jet Airways on social media. The truth is the airline has been underperforming for several years now. Its fate also reflects the repudiation of its business model. Simply put, the yield on a two- or three-hour flight—which forms the bulk of air services within India—can never justify the full-services model that Jet Airways adopted.
Only low-cost airlines, with their maniacal drive to constantly cut costs, grow revenues and maximize efficiencies, can survive in such markets. It is a trend that is being replicated in country after country, with even the long-distance flying market now being driven by low-cost carriers (LCCs).
According to the International Civil Aviation Organization, LCCs are consistently growing at a faster pace than the world average growth, and their market share is continuing to rise both in advanced and emerging economies. In 2018, these LCCs carried an estimated 1.3 billion passengers, accounting for approximately 31% of the world’s total passengers on scheduled flights.
The Jet Airways crisis is part of what Joseph Schumpeter called “the essential fact about capitalism"", creative destruction, and will ensure that the cycle of business continues.
The next entrant to the market will do well to take lessons from Jet Airways’s fate to heart. Each quarter is important and profits are the only holy grail of every business.

386,2019-04-25,Airtel,"According to reports, Jio now has a subscriber count of 306 million (paying and non-paying both), pushing Airtel with its 284 million figure at the end of 2018, could find itself in third spot on overall numbers

Most people who spend even a little time in front of the idiot box would already know through Reliance Jio’s advertisements that its subscriber base has crossed the 300 million mark. This, it has been tom-tomming for a while. Now, it appears in sniffing distance of unseating Bharti Airtel to become the second-largest player by subscriber count in India’s telecom market. Reportly, Jio now has a subscriber count of 306 million (paying and non-paying both) at the end of 2019’s first quarter. Airtel, with its 284 million figure (all paying) at the end of 2018, could find itself in third spot on overall numbers. Jio would then lag only Vodafone-Idea, which has 387 million subscribers. Analysts suggest it may be a matter of a few quarters before market leadership is taken by Jio.
The sheer pace of Jio’s growth has been spectacular, to say the least, considering it began operations barely two-and-a-half years ago. Its entry caused an upheaval, wiping out some smaller players (Aircel and Reliance Communications, for example), and triggered mergers among others to bulk up and defend themselves from Jio’s onslaught of dirt cheap data plans. While some of these competitors have complained about Reliance using the group’s deep pockets to wage a predatory price war, customers have a lot to cheer.
Reliance’s strategy of offering a bouquet of digital services such as internet access, news, music and entertainment content, has helped multiply Indian data usage several fold while also making conventional voice services almost free. Its high-speed network has forced rivals to upgrade infrastructure. Customers, as a result, are getting better services. The rest of the sector is expected to stabilize once the havoc caused by Jio’s entry settles down. And even though they can’t seem to match Jio’s throwaway deals, the initial threat appears to have ebbed. Competitors are slowly but surely upping their game and raising funds to stay competitive. It would be a pity if they’re unable to hold their own. Every market needs several contenders for it to thrive."

The rights issue of Vodafone Idea Ltd., India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base, was oversubscribed, with its promoters committing  ₹18,250 crore, said two people aware of the development on Thursday.
According to a one of the person cited above, the issue received bids worth  ₹26,950 crore compared with  ₹25,000 crore on offer. The non-promoter portion of the issue received bids worth  ₹8,700 crore.
The promoter contribution comprises  ₹11,000 crore from the Vodafone Group, and  ₹7,250 crore from the Aditya Birla Group.
The rights issue which opened on 10 April, offered 2,000 crore new shares at  ₹12.50 apiece. The issue had received bids for 1,109 crore shares, according to data available on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on Wednesday. Data on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) showed that bids worth 492 crore were received as of 8 pm on Wednesday.
Malaysia’s Axiata Group Berhad had decided not to participate in the rights issue, renouncing its shares entitlement in favour of investors through transactions on the BSE, cutting its stake in the company from 8.1% to roughly 2.6%.
Promoter shareholders - Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group - had reiterated that they intend to contribute up to  ₹11,000 crore and up to  ₹7,250 crore, respectively, amounting to a total of  ₹18,250 crore, as part of the  ₹25,000-crore rights issue.
The Vodafone Idea rights issue is one of the largest in recent times by any company. 
Vodafone Idea Ltd. announced the rights issue on March 20 at a steep discount to its prevailing share price as it sought to attract enough subscribers. At that time, the shares were priced at a 61% discount to the then prevailing market price, Mint reported on March 20.
It is critical for Vodafone Idea to raise resources as it faces stiff competition from Reliance Jio - the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd - which has hit revenue streams of other operators, since it entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap tariffs.
Earlier this month, the board of Bharti Airtel Ltd approved a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore, as well as the raising of  ₹7,000 crore through foreign currency perpetual bond issues, taking the total fund raising raise to  ₹32,000 crore.
Vodafone Idea also plans to raise up to  ₹5,000 crore by monetizing its stake in Indus Towers and has separately announced plans to sell its fibre network comprising more than 156,000 km of intra- and inter-city fibre routes."

NEW DELHI :
Private equity investments worth $6,198 million were announced last month, taking the total deal value during the January-March quarter to $8,451 million, largely driven by big ticket investments, says a report.
According to Grant Thornton's PE Dealtracker, 69 PE investments worth $6,198 million were announced in March, registering a significant jump from $1,382 million in the year-ago period.
In January-March period, there were 182 PE deals worth $8,451 million, recording a twofold jump in the investment values on account of increased big-ticket deals that saw 11 investments attracting funds in the range of $100-500 million.
""PE firms looking for places to park their capital in leverage buyouts will help keep up the deal-making pace,"" Grant Thornton India LLP Director Pankaj Chopda said, adding much of the action is dependent on the policies of the next government.
A sector-wise analysis shows that a total of five PE transactions in the energy and natural resources sector led the value chart. On the other hand, 118 transactions in the startup and e-commerce sector and 15 transactions in the banking and financial sector, led the PE volume chart.
Canadian investor Brookfield-led India Infrastructure Trust's (InVIT) acquisition of East-West gas pipeline for  ₹13,000 crore was the top PE deal of the January-March quarter.
Other major PE investments during the quarter include Singapore government's investment arm GIC Pte's investment in Bharti Airtel and Brookfield Asset Management-Hotel Leelaventure transaction.
Going ahead, the need for funding for small and medium businesses to fuel growth and availability of transaction structures to monetise capital intensive businesses indicate the opportunity for higher tractions in the PE or VC landscape, Chopda said."

NEW DELHI :
People in Bengaluru may face call drops and disruption in internet services as the local municipal body and telecom players are at loggerheads over payment issues.
The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) has ordered to cut telecom cables laid over the ground, citing them to be non-compliant with existing norms, and has demanded fees from companies to lay them underground.
However, telecom service providers said the cables were laid overhead temporarily due to road construction work and they have already paid the fees for laying them under the ground.
A BBMP official told PTI that it was disconnecting only those optical fibre cables which were unauthorised.
""We have incurred huge financial losses because of the unauthorised cables. Several times we had warned the telecom companies to get the cables regularised and should be laid in as per regulations but they ignored our warnings. We were left with no option but to disconnect them,"" the officer said.
He added that telecom companies still have the chance to disclose the cables they have laid and get them regularised by paying the prescribed fees.
The officer said most of the cables were laid overhead and were dangling from trees, which had caused many accidents in the past.
Meanwhile, telecom industry body COAI said they were authorised temporarily to lay cables aerially as road construction work was going on that frequently damaged cables and they have already paid fees for laying them underground.
""BBMP is demanding right of way charges again to lay telecom cables underground. We have already paid fees and the cables were laid overground temporarily after permission from BBMP.
""We asked them to put the order on hold and give us time to put them underground as cable cut will lead to disruption in services which is already on red alert after terror attack in Sri Lanka,"" COAI Director General Rajan S Mathews said.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has approached Telecom Secretary Aruna Sundararajan over the issue.
""After telecom secretary's intervention, we met Karnataka State Chief Secretary along with representatives from Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
""The chief secretary has asked BBMP to resolve the matter. We will be meeting BBMP commissioner on Tuesday and hope the matter will be resolved amicably,"" Mathews said."

New Delhi: After conceding market share to rival Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel is now taking the fight to Jio’s turf – rural India – with the launch of a new audio-video streaming app targeted at the non-English speaking population possessing entry-level smartphones.
On Tuesday, Airtel announced the launch of Wynk Tube, an extension of its music streaming service Wynk Music targeted at small-town India that will allow users to stream both audio and video within the same interface, and switch between the two modes for a particular song. Currently available for Android smartphones, the service offers content in vernacular languages like Hindi, Punjabi and Bhojpuri as of now and is looking at Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Marathi soon.
This, the company believes, will help retain consumers and drive traffic in rural India where data consumption is lower than that in urban areas. Interestingly, Reliance Jio has made significant strides in the rural market through its cheap data tariff and entry-level JioPhone launched in 2017. In July last year, the telecom company said that it had already sold 25 million handsets.
As of February end, Airtel had 340.3 million users out of which 157.5 million are in rural areas. Out of Reliance Jio’s total 297.2 million users, 111.8 million users are in rural areas.
At 5 MB, the Wynk Tube app will be free for Airtel customers while non-Airtel users will be charged  ₹99 a month.
“There is a massive opportunity in tier 2 and tier 3 towns in India or the people who live beyond the top 100 cities of the country as they are consuming content like never before,"" said Sameer Batra, chief executive officer — content and apps at Bharti Airtel, attributing the evolution to increasing number of smartphones, better data connectivity and cheaper data packs.
Batra said that while the content play on Wynk Tube is currently limited to music offerings, it may be expanded to other entertainment options such as live TV in the future. Original content, however, remains out of the question. “We are sure we don’t want to control the value chain but instead work with partners whom we can provide targeting and reach,"" he said. “Our model has always been to add value to the core telco consumer. The market is cluttered at the top end of the spectrum but it’s very interesting and open towards Bharat or India 2.""
Airtel already has Wynk Music which it claims has 100 million users while Reliance Jio has JioSaavn app, which Reliance claims is South Asia’s largest streaming, entertainment and artiste platform. Vodafone Idea currently does not have any music streaming app but plans to launch one soon along with a global partner.
Stepping up music and content play has become imperative for telecom operators as they fight to retain high-paying subscribers in a low-tariff market. Bharti Airtel’s and Vodafone Idea’s revenues from wireless business dropped after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 as they were forced to match Jio’s rock-bottom data prices.
Bharti Airtel’s profit plunged 72% to Rs. 86 crore in the fiscal third quarter from Rs. 306 crore a year earlier, while Vodafone Idea incurred a net loss of Rs. 5,004.6 crore last quarter, compared with Rs. 4,973.8 crore in the preceding quarter.
The Indian music industry is valued at Rs. 1,280 crore where digital channels account for 65% of overall music sales. While Swedish audio streaming platform Spotify entered the country this February, other players include local entities like Gaana and Hungama Music besides a few international services such as Apple Music and Google Play Music."

Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm swung to a quarterly net profit from a year-earlier loss because of an increase in transaction value on its Airtel Money platform and higher data consumption on its network.
The Africa operations posted a net profit of $83 million in the March quarter, compared to a loss of $49 million a year earlier.
The improved earnings is significant for Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm, which is gearing up for an initial public offering in June-July, while it also battles a bruising tariff war with rival Reliance Jio at home.
Bharti Airtel will declare its March quarter earnings for India operations on 6 May. In the December quarter, Airtel’s profit had plunged 72% to  ₹86 crore from  ₹306 crore a year earlier.
Africa has proved to be a beacon of hope for the company, which is at present faced with a struggling India business.
Airtel Africa’s total revenue grew 6% year-on-year from $736 million to $781 million in the March quarter, while its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation improved 12% year-on-year from $307 million to $344 million in the March quarter.
The total megabytes (MBs) on the network surged 73.1% to 120.7 billion MBs from 69.7 billion MBs in the corresponding quarter last year while data customers grew by 5.1 million to 30 million in the quarter.
The company’s revenue from data services grew 30% year-on-year to $192 million. Earnings also received a boost from a 22% yearly rise in transaction value on the Airtel Money platform to $6.8 billion.
The average revenue per user, however, fell 3.1% year-on-year to $2.7 in the fourth quarter from $2.8 a year earlier.
Airtel Africa, the holding firm for Bharti Airtel’s operations in 14 countries in the continent, has 99 million customers across three regions—Nigeria; East Africa, comprising Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia; and the rest of Africa, which comprises Niger, Gabon, Chad, Congo Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Seychelles. Nigeria alone accounts for half of its Ebitda and 40% of its total revenue.
Airtel established its presence in Africa in 2010 when it bought Kuwait-based Zain’s Africa operations for $10.7 billion. Over the past few years, it has been trying to expand in Africa through local deals and has made three small acquisitions in Uganda and Congo Brazzaville besides Kenya.
In October 2017, Airtel also signed a deal with Millicom, which operates the Tigo brand, to combine their operations in Ghana. In December that year, Airtel’s Rwanda unit announced the acquisition of Tigo Rwanda Ltd, making Airtel the second-largest telecom operator in the east African nation.
Airtel said in February 2018 that it would consider an IPO for the Africa business. In October, the company said six investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, would invest $1.25 billion through a primary equity issuance in Airtel Africa. Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of the state of Qatar, said in January it would invest $200 million in the Africa arm.
These fundraises, which were used to bring down debt, led to the company’s net debt falling to $4 billion in the March quarter from $7.7 billion a year earlier.
This has also led to its net debt to Ebitda ratio (annualized) come down to 2.91 in the March quarter from 6.32 a year earlier."

Bharti Airtel has created a loyalty programme for its prepaid users, similar to what airlines offer to flyers. Now, subscribers will be able to reap benefits based on their tariff plans and consumption of digital services on the Airtel network.
Amid a bruising price war with Reliance Jio, this is Airtel’s first such exercise to retain its prepaid user base. Postpaid users already enjoy access to services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime bundled with their tariff plans.
Under the loyalty programme, prepaid customers subscribing to higher tariff plans will get access to better services and added benefits. Airtel expects to achieve twin objectives of increasing its average revenue per user, which has been under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016, while getting them to avail more services as the telecom major embarks on its journey to morph into a digital platform.
“We are also segmenting our customer base and ensuring that our high-value customers get VIP services,"" Adarsh Nair, chief product officer, Bharti Airtel, said.
The three-tier loyalty programme includes Silver, Gold and Platinum membership, with each tier offering a new set of benefits. Silver tier, with a monthly tariff of  ₹119, will offer basic content, including AirtelTV and Wynk. Gold customers, with tariffs ranging from  ₹119 to  ₹499, will get access to add-on telecom benefits and premium content. Platinum customers paying a monthly tariff of  ₹499 or more will get priority services such as a dedicated customer service desk apart from e-books and device protection plans, among others.
“We are also exploring verticals like travel, financial services, healthcare to expand offerings for Airtel Thanks users,"" Shashwat Sharma, chief marketing officer, Bharti Airtel, said. At present, users can opt for these plans only through the Airtel Thanks mobile app, which has replaced the My Airtel app. However, the company plans to extend this facility to customers who walk in at retail stores as well.
Stepping up digital services, especially music and content, has become imperative for telecom operators, as they fight to retain high-paying subscribers in a low-tariff market. Bharti Airtel’s and Vodafone Idea’s revenues from their respective wireless businesses dropped after Jio entered the Indian market with rock-bottom data prices.
Bharti Airtel’s profit plunged 72% from  ₹306 crore in the third quarter of 2017-18 to  ₹86 crore in Q3 FY19, while Vodafone Idea incurred net losses of  ₹5,004.6 crore in the December quarter, compared with  ₹4,973.8 crore in the preceding quarter.

LONDON :
Bharti Airtel Ltd., India’s second-biggest wireless carrier, is preparing to kick off the initial public offering (IPO) of its Africa unit in a deal that could raise about $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said.
Airtel Africa is planning to make a formal announcement about the London listing this month and aims to start trading in June, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. It’s considering seeking an equity valuation of about $5 billion, they said.
The IPO could be one of the biggest in London this year. The exchange’s lackluster domestic volumes are being boosted by emerging-market companies seeking a wider investor pool. Finablr, the currency-exchange firm controlled by an Abu Dhabi-based billionaire, starting taking orders this week for a share sale that could raise as much as $677 million. Middle Eastern payments processor Network International Holdings Plc raised 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) last month in the largest London IPO this year.
Valuation and the listing date are still under discussion, and final details could change depending on investor demand and market sentiment, the people said. A representative for Bharti Airtel declined to comment.
Bharti Airtel, backed by billionaire Sunil Mittal, has spent heavily to defend its position in India against disruptive upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. The firm’s Africa unit raised $1.25 billion last year from investors including Temasek Holdings Pte and SoftBank Group Corp., giving it an equity value of about $4.4 billion.
The business has operations in 14 African markets including Kenya, Tanzania, Nigeria and Ghana, according to Bharti Airtel’s latest annual report.

378,2019-05-03,Airtel,"The cost per gigabyte data use for a telco will be much lower with 5GEricsson signed up the largest operator Vodafone Idea as a client to deploy cloud packet core to enhance its network performance

MUMBAI :
Even as domestic telcos struggle to come out of their deep financial troubles, Swedish telecom equipment-maker Ericsson said it is a ""matter of survival"" for them to embrace 5G.
The domestic telecom industry is still reeling under financial woes inflicted on them by the entry of the deep- pocketed newcomer Reliance Jio's aggressive play and analysts are divided over when can a revival happen.
A senior official from Ericsson acknowledged that the lowest average revenue per user generated by the domestic telcos is the ""real challenge"".
""It is more a matter of survival for our customers to move into 5G,"" said Ludvig Landgren, head of network applications and cloud infrastructure for Southeast Asia, Oceania and India.
Speaking on the sidelines of a company event, he said the need to switch over to 5G is because of the financial benefits the newest generation of communication offers.
The cost per gigabyte data use for a telco will be much lower with 5G, he said, pointing out that Indians are one of biggest consumers of data in the world at present.
He claimed the costs will be 10 times cheaper per GB of data usage and that his company is coming out with offerings such that only software upgrades to existing infrastructure will be required for companies to transition.
It can be noted that India is yet to sell its 5G spectrum and there is a point of view which calls for deferring the same due to the financial difficulties the operators are facing, wherein they recover the cost on previous generations well before transitioning to the new.
It can be noted that Jio's entry as a 4G network from the beginning fastened the adoption of the new-age telephony in the country and led to considerable troubles for incumbent operators who had secured 3G spectrum by aggressive bidding.
At the event, Ericsson executives cited a survey to claim that a third of consumers will leave their operator ""immediately"" if competition starts providing 5G, while another third will wait for six months before migrating.
Even as multiple use cases, including driverless cars and drone deliveries get spoken about, the company officials said mobile broadband will be the primary driver for 5G adoption in the country.
Meanwhile, the company signed up the largest operator Vodafone Idea as a client to deploy cloud packet core to enhance its network performance.
Landgren said this is significant because it used to work with the erstwhile Idea Cellular but not with Vodafone.
On when Ericsson, which already counts as Bharti Airtel as a customer, will start working with Jio, he said it has already demonstrated its abilities to the Mukesh Ambani- company.

Vodafone Idea Ltd.'s  ₹25,000 crore rights issue-- the largest so far by the company, received a good response from both foreign and public shareholders as the issue was oversubscribed nearly 1.08 times.
Besides a public participation of 1.2 times the offering, the promoters, too, applied for  ₹90 crore higher than their aggregate rights entitlement. The promoters, Aditya Birla Group and UK's Vodafone Group, were allotted  ₹17,920 crore increasing their shareholding to 71.57% over 71.33% earlier.

""We are progressing well on integration and are well on track to deliver our synergy targets. Our ongoing investments are improving broadband coverage and capacity, enabling us to offer a superior network experience to our customers as well as enhancing our ability to win new broadband customers,"" he said.
India's largest telecom firm by subscribers, Vodafone Idea's board of directors, in a May 4 meeting, had approved the rights issue for about 2,000 crore equity shares of  ₹10 each at a price of  ₹12.50 per share. The paid-up equity capital of the company post the rights offer would stand at  ₹28,735 crore shares of face value of  ₹10 each. The company looks to list the new shares on the bourses on May 10.
Under rights issue, existing shareholders are offered to purchase additional stock shares, known as subscription warrants, in proportion to their existing holdings. Rights are often transferable, allowing the holder to sell them in the open market.

374,2019-05-06,Airtel,"Airtel will announce its earnings for the March quarter todayIn the December quarter, Airtel’s profit had plunged 72% to  ₹86 crore from  ₹306 crore a year earlier

Bharti Airtel is expected to report an improvement in its average revenue per user (ARPU) for the second consecutive quarter after the company rolled out minimum recharge plans for users to stay on its network at a time when it battles cheap tariffs from rival Reliance Jio.
Airtel will announce its earnings for the March quarter today. Reliance Jio posted a profit of  ₹840 crore for the March quarter. In the December quarter, Airtel’s profit had plunged 72% to  ₹86 crore from  ₹306 crore a year earlier.
The operator’s topline has continued to remain under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016 brought down tariffs to rock-bottom.
However, analysts believe that a large part of tariff downtrading is now complete, therefore stability in revenue is likely, unless Jio initiates a new round of tariff war to accelerate its subscriber growth. As of February end, Airtel had 340.3 million users while Jio had 297.2 million users.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects a modest 1% sequential uptick in Airtel’s revenue to  ₹10,300 crore.
“Reported ARPU will likely see a sharp 14% quarter-on-quarter uptick to  ₹120, largely optical on account of the sharp subscriber base clean-up done in December 2018,"" Kotak said in a report dated 8 April. Rival Jio’s ARPU for March quarter was  ₹126.2.
Average revenue per user for Bharti Airtel was  ₹104 in the December quarter, an improvement from  ₹100 from the preceding September quarter, the first such increase after nine straight quarters of decline. However, the rise was merely due to the fact that the company had modified the prepaid customer base definition in order to represent only the customers who transact and generate revenue.
Motilal Oswal, which expects Bharti to post a loss of  ₹720 crore, expects that its India wireless revenue, coupled with an uptick in its Africa business, should drive consolidated revenue growth of 1% quarter-on-quarter.
Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm swung to a quarterly net profit from a year-earlier loss because of an increase in transaction value on its Airtel Money platform and higher data consumption on its network.
The Africa operations posted a net profit of $83 million in the March quarter, compared to a loss of $49 million a year earlier, the company said in an earnings announcement on 30 April.

In a war for the control of India’s billion-plus mobile-services market, tycoon Sunil Mittal seems to be floundering in the face of a juggernaut unleashed by Mukesh Ambani.
For at least a fourth quarter in a row, Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. shored up its profits with one-time gains, masking headwinds posed by upstart Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Jio’s roll-out, after its 2016 debut, has knocked Airtel from its perch in a consolidation that shrank the industry to three players from about a dozen four years ago.
Airtel is struggling to add subscribers in a saturated market after Jio managed to lure more than 300 million users over the past three years -- a quarter of the world’s second-largest market. The aggressive expansion of Jio with free calls and cheaper data, backed by the deep pockets of Asia’s richest man, was bad news for highly indebted incumbents engaged in a tariff war that had pushed call rates to less than a cent.
Shriveling earnings portend further trouble for Airtel. Already saddled with more than $17 billion of debt -- the highest among Asian peers -- it is also preparing to spend billions more on 5G airwaves at a government auction in coming months. Adding to its woes, Moody’s Investors Service cut its rating to junk earlier this year.
The New Delhi-based company is counting on some asset sales, a rights issue and an initial public offering in London of its Africa unit to bolster its finances.
“Airtel’s profit will suffer until Jio is ready to raise prices. It is hard to say when, but Jio may remain aggressive until it achieves the No. 1 spot in mobile revenue. In the meantime, Airtel is trying to weather through by preserving margin at the sacrifice of subscriber loss, divesting assets to ease debt burden, and raising equity to avoid a credit downgrade,"" said Anthea Lai, telecom industry analyst.
Airtel said in an exchange filing Monday that a one-time net gain of  ₹2,020 crore ($291 million) on account of a credit related to “re-assessment of levies"" boosted its net income to 1.1 billion rupees for the quarter through March. Analysts had predicted a loss of  ₹966 crore.
Although revenue rose 6% to  ₹20,600 crore in the period, data provided by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show Airtel added a net 53,493 subscribers in the first two months of the year, compared with Jio’s 17.1 million. While Airtel didn’t provide user addition data for the quarter, Jio reported an increase of 26.6 million.
Shares of Airtel have advanced 19% this year to  ₹333.45, compared with a 7.6% gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex index.
In an interview with BloombergQuint earlier this year at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Mittal described conditions in India’s hyper-competitive telecommunications market as “dreadful,"" predicting a possible turning point this year. “This will be the year of perhaps hemorrhaging stopping,"" he said.
Airtel slipped to No. 2 in the industry last year after Idea Cellular Ltd. and the local unit of Vodafone Group Plc closed their merger to become India’s largest operator by subscribers.
In February, Airtel unveiled plans to raise as much as  ₹32,000 crore for a war chest to take on Jio as well as to prepare for the 5G auction. Of that,  ₹25,000 crore will be from a rights issue due to close May 17 at  ₹220 per share, and the rest from the sale of perpetual bonds with equity credit. Vodafone Idea proposes to raise  ₹25,000 crore rupees from a rights issue.

However, profit fell 63% to  ₹409.5 crore for the year ended 31 March from  ₹1,099 crore in the previous year.
The results underscore the sustained struggle of Bharti Airtel and other telecom operators in India to grow profits despite recording higher data and voice consumption.
Bharti Airtel’s consolidated revenue from operations for the fourth quarter grew to  ₹20,602.2 crore from  ₹19,394 crore in the year ago period. Its India wireless business posted a revenue of  ₹10,632.3 crore the March quarter, up from  ₹10,353.2 crore in the year-ago period.
In comparison, Reliance Jio generated  ₹11,106 crore in operating revenue in the March quarter, beating Bharti Airtel on this metric.
The company’s India wireless business posted a loss of  ₹1,377.8 crore in the March quarter, almost triple the  ₹482.2 crore loss it posted in the year-ago period. However, the March quarter numbers are better than the  ₹1,903.2 crore loss the company reported in the preceding December quarter.
“If you look at earnings, the losses seem to be coming down quarter on quarter and the company shows an improving trend. However, the pressure on India wireless business continues to remain,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said, requesting anonymity.
The launch of low-cost tariff plans by Reliance Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, in September 2016, forced rivals to drop their rates, hurting profit margins.
Smaller companies were forced to either shut shop or get acquired, leaving just Airtel, Jio and the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea to compete in the Indian market.
Jio had 306.7 million users as of 31 March.
The company did not disclose other details such as average revenue per user, data traffic and 4G customer base, and shared only the audited financial results as it is proposing to make a rights issue for which statutory and regulatory approvals are awaited.
The performance of the company’s Africa unit has proved to be a beacon of hope as it battles Jio in its home market. Last week, Airtel announced the earnings for the Africa unit which swung to a quarterly profit from a year-earlier loss because of an increase in transaction value on its Airtel Money platform and higher data consumption on its network.
The Africa operations posted a net profit of $83 million in the March quarter, compared to a loss of $49 million a year earlier.
The improved earnings is significant for Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm, which is gearing up for an initial share sale in June-July."
372,2019-05-07,Airtel,"With both the main divisions performing well, consolidated results beat the Street’s estimates by a mileAnalysts say the revenue and earnings prints for the India wireless business are substantially higher than their estimates

When a company’s results filing extends into the late evening hours, it is normally assumed it is trying to postpone bad news. In Bharti Airtel Ltd’s case, its late Monday results filing was full of positive surprises, in contrast.
Its flagship India wireless business reported a 4.4% sequential jump in revenue, far higher than the 1% increase analysts at brokerages such as Kotak Institutional Equities and IIFL Institutional Research were expecting. What’s more, given the fairly high operating leverage associated with the telecom business, losses before interest and tax fell to  ₹1,378 crore, from  ₹1,903 crore in the December quarter.
Mint’s rough calculations show that this is the first quarter since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd started operations in September 2016 that Airtel has reported an increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation).
Analysts say the revenue and earnings prints for the India wireless business are substantially higher than their estimates. The improvement comes on the back of a requirement for subscribers to make minimum recharges, which weeded out low-quality subscribers. While the company has been saying that this has a better-than-expected impact on its revenue profile, hardly anyone had factored in the impact to be as meaningful.
Note that Airtel’s growth of 4.4% isn’t much lower than Jio’s 7% growth in the March quarter. “The growth differential between the two companies has narrowed considerably,"" says an analyst at a multinational brokerage firm.
Results of the last two quarters indicate some signs of stability in the sector, after several quarters of declining revenues and profits. Of course the fact that Airtel is still running losses means that the road to recovery will be a long one.
Airtel Africa, which had already reported results, was ahead of expectations as well. With both main divisions performing well, consolidated results naturally beat the Street’s estimates by a mile. For instance, while analysts at Kotak had estimated a drop in consolidated Ebitda, Airtel reported a sequential increase of about 6%.
As pointed out earlier, the better-than-expected results should be seen in the backdrop of the several quarters of disruption in the industry. Firms are still running losses and burning loads of cash, with debt continuing to rise. Airtel, like Vodafone Idea Ltd, is raising  ₹25,000 crore through a rights issue to help strengthen its balance sheet, and also raise funds for future expansion.
Hopefully for the company and its investors, if the improvement in financial performance is here to stay, there won’t be a need for another such fundraise for a long time to come."

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel's results for fiscal 2018-19 indicates a ""rebound"" in the Indian mobile sector amid easing competition, and industry revenue may rise by 5-10 per cent this year, Fitch Ratings said on Wednesday.
""We believe the Indian mobile sector's recovery is underway as the top-three telcos are likely to turn their focus towards profitability, while their revenue market shares are relatively equal at around 30-33 per cent each,"" Fitch Ratings said in a note.
Bharti's ratings headroom is likely to improve with an equity infusion, planned asset sales and growing Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (EBITDA) from Africa, it noted.
""We expect industry revenue to rise by 5-10% in 2019 - the first growth in three years - underpinned by easing competition and growing data traffic with the proliferation of affordable 4G handsets. We expect blended average revenue per user (ARPU) to rise by 10-20% to around $1.6-1.7 per month in 2019, underpinned by the incumbents' introduction of a minimum mobile tariff of  ₹35 ($0.50) per month and growing data use,"" the note said.
The top three telcos are likely to drive tariffs higher by bundling value-added services, such as music, movies and sports, amid growing data consumption.
On Bharti Airtel, it said that an equity injection of USD 3.5 billion, a public equity offer by its African operations, and a stake sale in the merged entity of Indus Tower and Bharti Infratel will significantly ease pressure on the balance sheet.
""We forecast Bharti's FY20 revenue and EBITDA to increase by the low single digits, driven by better ARPU for mobile and steady growth in the African and business-to-business (Enterprise) segments,"" Fitch said.
Earlier this week, telecom operator Bharti Airtel posted a surprise 29 per cent surge in March quarter net profit, aided by exceptional income gains.
The company, whose profitability has been battered by intense price competition posed by the richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio, earned a net profit of  ₹107.2 crore in January-March quarter as compared to  ₹82.9 crore in the same period previous fiscal, its first rise in profit after several quarters.
Its revenue increased 6.2% to  ₹20,602.2 crore for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
Airtel, which is in the midst of  ₹25,000 crore rights offer, neither issued the customary press statement detailing earnings statement and management commentary nor provided average revenue per user - a key metrics tracked by analysts.
A recent report by SBICap Securities said that Bharti had ""done well"" on ARPU as it seems to have improved about 20% sequentially, while Jio’s ARPU declined about 3%.
""Subscriber traction is something that Bharti needs to pick up, as ARPU gains incrementally may be much lesser but may still continue, driven by upselling for low-end subscribers and 2G-to-4G upgrade,"" it said."

Shares of Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Ltd on Wednesday closed at a two month low, with falling for third sessions, tracking a fall in the local equity markets.
RIL closed at Rs1299.45 a share, down 3.35% from its previous close, while India’s benchmark Sensex Index fell 1.27% to 37,789.13 points. Since 3 May, RIL has fallen 7.65%. Local equity markets fell for 6th sessions with dropping nearly 3% due to renewed trade war concerns.
Investors are worries due to RIL's rising debt, weak gross refining margin and a recent positive earnings from Bharti Airtel.
RIL's refining margin narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 a barrel in March quarter. Since launch of RJio debt of the RIL increasing continuously due to higher capex. It’s debt outstanding as on 31 March rose to  ₹2.87 trillion from  ₹2.18 trillion at the end of the previous year.

365,2019-05-13,Airtel,"Vodafone Idea will announce its earnings for the March quarter todayVodafone Idea’s average revenue per user is also expected to improve in this quarter

Vodafone Idea is expected to narrow its loss in the March quarter as it reaps synergies from the merger of brands Idea and Vodafone completed in August last year in order to survive in an intense telecom battleground where it fights rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.
Vodafone Idea’s average revenue per user (ARPU) is also expected to improve for the second consecutive quarter on the back of minimum recharge plans rolled out for users to stay on its network.
The company will announce its earnings for the March quarter today. Rival Jio posted a profit of  ₹840 crore for the March quarter and Airtel’s profit rose 29% year on year to  ₹107.2 crore because of a one-time gain of  ₹2,022.1 crore and a tight control on sales and marketing expenses.
The operator’s topline has continued to remain under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016 brought down tariffs to rock-bottom.
However, analysts believe that a large part of tariff downtrading is now complete, therefore stability in revenue is likely, unless Jio initiates a new round of tariff war to accelerate its subscriber growth.
ICICI Direct Research expects Vodafone Idea’s ARPU to grow 6.7% quarter on quarter to  ₹95, boosted by minimum recharge and shedding of low paying customers. The company’s ARPU was  ₹89 in the December quarter and  ₹88 in the September quarter. Despite the growth, the company’s ARPU is behind both Airtel and Jio.
“The company is expected to post a net loss of  ₹4,540 crore. The key monitorables would be the progress on fructification of synergy gains and fundraising status,"" ICICI Direct Research said in a research note dated 9 April.
Vodafone Idea had incurred a net loss of  ₹5,004.6 crore in the December quarter, compared with  ₹4,973.8 crore in the September quarter. Before that, Idea and Vodafone competed as separate brands.
Motilal Oswal too expects Vodafone Idea to narrow its loss to  ₹4,120 crore. “We expect revenue to remain flat quarter on quarter at  ₹11,770 crore, as the uptick in APRU will be largely be offset by the decline in subscriber base and revenue dilution from interconnect usage charge,"" Motilal Oswal said in a report.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, who had announced their merger in March 2017, completed the exercise in August 2018 and are currently undergoing an integration exercise to create synergies which would bring down costs of operating networks.
The company has also completed a capital raising exercise through a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore to existing eligible equity shareholders. It is also simultaneously working on monetising its fibre assets apart from its stake in the joint entity of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers which is close to completing their merger."

MUMBAI :
In light of the ruthless land grab that followed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry into India’s telecom industry, the last thing one would have expected is for telcos to say no to some subscribers. But this is exactly what incumbents Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have done in recent months.
They introduced so-called “service validity vouchers"", which required customers to make minimum recharges to continue using their networks.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, this resulted in a decline of 53.2 million subscribers or about 14% in the March quarter.
As it turns out, this was a smart move. With low-value subscribers getting weeded out, total revenues increased. Vodafone Idea’s average daily revenues for the quarter increased 2.3% sequentially.

As it turns out, this was a smart move. With low-value subscribers getting weeded out, total revenues increased. Vodafone Idea’s average daily revenues for the quarter increased 2.3% sequentially.
Bharti Airtel had earlier reported a 6.7% sequential jump in average daily revenues. While the company, too, got rid of low-value subscribers, its subscriber base did not fall at the same pace as Vodafone Idea’s.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, synergy benefits from last year’s merger are beginning to accrue at a faster pace, leading to higher-than-expected profits as well.
The company reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) of  ₹1,590 crore in the March quarter, after adjusting for one-offs. This was as much as 39.4% higher than the December quarter profit of  ₹1,140 crore.
While the increase in profitability is heartening, it clearly is far from being enough. The company’s net interest cost stood at  ₹2,789 crore last quarter, about 75% higher than current Ebitda levels.
Also note that Vodafone Idea has already achieved 60% of its synergy target. All else remaining the same, its quarterly Ebitda will rise to about  ₹2,420 crore when 100% of the synergies kick in. That is still short of its quarterly finance costs.
Note also that Vodafone Idea’s total number of broadband sites fell sequentially by about 4,900 sites, which is unusual given the backdrop of increasing coverage by competitors Jio and Airtel.
While Vodafone Idea has successfully raised  ₹25,000 crore through a rights issue, it still doesn’t have the financial flexibility to raise capex to the levels of its rivals.
“The company’s survival hinges on market repair and pricing uptick which is yet to be seen, analysts at ICICIdirect.com said in a post-results note to clients.
But there are no signs of price hikes, especially since Jio is still a distance away from its targeted revenue market share. While strategies such as “less is more"" may have resulted in some short-term dividend, the need of the hour clearly is more pricing power and higher growth in quality subscribers.
Unfortunately for Vodafone Idea, it remains at the mercy of its more powerful competitors for things to improve on the pricing front."

Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel together shed 29.6 million users by March-end compared to February.
Market analysts noted that in certain cases, the subscriber tally difference between regulator's data and those cited by the companies is on account of the different measurement used for computing wireless subscribers base.
While TRAI data takes into consideration live connections in a 90-day period, operators' calculations are based on active customers as on March 31, 2019, and factors in the impact of minimum recharge plan, market watchers pointed out.
The customers base of Reliance Jio, owned by richest Indian Mukesh Ambani was 306.7 million as on March 2019, against 297.2 million as on February.
Overall , India's broadband subscriber base rose to 563.1 million in March, swelling 2.37 per cent over the previous month. Jio notched the highest broadband subscriber base of 306.7 million, followed by Airtel (114.6 million), Vodafone Idea (110.2 million) and state owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (22.14 million).
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel - whose financials have been battered by intense price competition posed by Reliance Jio - have resorted to minimum recharge plans, consciously cleaning off plain vanilla, low-value subscribers.
During its recent quarterly earnings announcement, Vodafone Idea said that it benefitted from the introduction of 'service validity vouchers' that require customers to make a minimum recharge of  ₹35.
""As expected, this resulted in a decline of 53.2 million subscribers as 'Incoming-only' or 'Low ARPU' customers migrated their spending from multiple SIMs to single SIM, taking the overall subscriber base to 334.1 million,"" Vodafone Idea statement had then said.

NEW DELHI :
Industry body COAI said Wednesday that not too much should be read into the drop in mobile subscriber numbers for March, as the reduced numbers are a result of consolidation of multiple, unused SIMs and weeding out of low-usage connections by operators.
The comments come a day after data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) showed that the country's total wireless subscribers fell to 1,161.8 million as on March 31, 2019, shedding 21.87 million users over the previous month. The overall teledensity in India declined to 90.11 at the end of March, from 91.86 in February.
Mobile subscriber base of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel shrunk by nearly 14.5 million and 15.1 million, respectively, as of March over the previous month, while Reliance Jio added 9.4 million users during the period.
Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) Director General, Rajan Mathews attributed the fall to a combination of factors such as subscribers with multiple SIMs making a decision to move onto one mobile number.
Mathews further said that with the roll out of 'minimum recharge plans' by operators, many of the low-usage customers may have decided not to continue with multiple connections. Also, the requirement of recharging within a set period to keep the number active may have led to discontinuation of connections, he added.
""It is not worrisome, because of those factors. The improvement in revenue and increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) in future will confirm this,"" Mathews told PTI.
According to Trai, the wireless subscriber base of Vodafone Idea at the end of March 2019 was 394.8 million. Bharti Airtel's mobile subscriber base was 325.1 million, and that of rival Reliance Jio was 306.7 million as on March 2019.

NEW DELHI :
1) Is the subscriber base falling?
The country’s mobile user base has shown a declining trend from 1.18 billion at the end of March 2018 to 1.16 billion at the end of March this year. However, the decline has not been consistent on a month-on-month (m-o-m) basis. Users in March 2019 fell by 21.86 million m-o-m, but there had been a rise of 1.7 million in the total number of users in February, mainly due to subscriber additions by Reliance Jio and BSNL, which made up for the decline in Airtel and Vodafone Idea’s customer base in that month. Vodafone Idea and Airtel count only paying customers. Trai counts each SIM as a user and includes inactive subscribers.
2) Are subscribers falling across companies?
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been losing customers in the last seven months, while Reliance Jio has seen an increase in the number of subscribers. Airtel did not lose subscribers in the first eight months of 2018. But its user base has declined every month since September 2018, except in November and January when it added users. Vodafone and Idea merged in August. The very next month, the merged entity lost 6.68 million users. The decline went on, with the entity losing users every month since. Jio has bucked the trend, with its user base rising from 186.56 million in March 2018 to 306.72 million in March 2019.
3) What are the reasons for the decline in user base?
Airtel and Vodafone Idea might have lost users to Jio as it offers lower tariffs. Airtel and Vodafone Idea also launched minimum recharge plans to reduce the number of low-paying, inactive users.
4) Should operators be worried about the falling subscriber base?
This should not worry operators. Airtel and Vodafone Idea have both realized that in a low-tariff market and with debt on their books, they need to shift focus from growing their user base to raising revenue and protecting their bottom lines. They are trying to drive more data usage per SIM. Upgrading feature phone users to data subscribers is seen as a good move, as the number of wireless internet users rose from 409 million in Q1FY18 to nearly 491 million in Q1FY19.
5) Will the trend of falling user base continue?
Vodafone Idea’s customer base fell by 35.1 million in the third quarter to 387.2 million and further by 53.2 million to 334 million in the fourth quarter. The shrinking subscriber base led to an improvement in average revenue per user (Arpu) from  ₹88 in Q2 and  ₹89 in Q3 to  ₹104 in Q4. Airtel showed a similar trend. Jio’s Arpu for the fourth quarter is still higher at  ₹126.20. Vodafone Idea chief executive officer Balesh Sharma said he expected the firm to complete the exercise of weeding out low-paying users by the end of May."

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel Ltd has sought approval of the UK financial regulator for an initial public offering of its African unit in London as it seeks to cut debt and expand its network.
Airtel Africa Ltd, the continent’s second-largest mobile operator, is aiming to raise around $1 billion in a June equity offering, a person familiar with the development told Reuters.
In a filing made to the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Airtel Africa said it is also considering a listing on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. In London, Airtel Africa is looking to trade on the main market of LSE, using its premium listing segment.
The African unit has already raised $1.25 billion in October from six investors, including Temasek Holdings Pte and SoftBank Group Corp., Warburg Pincus and Singtel. In January, Qatar Investment Authority invested $200 million in the Africa arm.
As a result of these fundraises, the company’s net debt fell to $4 billion in the March quarter from $7.7 billion a year ago.
Airtel Africa is the holding firm for Bharti Airtel’s operations in 14 countries, including Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, Niger, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Seychelles. It has 100 million customers across the continent but Nigeria alone accounts for 36% of its total revenue.
Bharti Airtel established its presence in Africa in 2010 when it bought Kuwait-based Zain’s Africa operations for $10.7 billion. Over the past few years, it has been trying to expand in the continent through local acquisitions.
Africa has proved to be a beacon of hope for the company, which is faced with a struggling India business as it battles Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd on its home turf. Bharti Airtel’s Africa operations posted a net profit of $83 million in the March quarter from a loss of $49 million a year earlier.
Airtel Africa’s total revenue grew 6% to $781 million in the March quarter from $736 million in the year earlier, while its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization improved 12% to $344 million.
The company offers prepaid and postpaid wireless services in the continent, with an increasing focus on data and non-voice services through the expansion of its 3G and 4G networks, fixed-line telephone services, as well as mobile money services under its Airtel Money brand both nationally and internationally.
Mobile voice business is the largest component of Airtel Africa’s revenue, bringing 62.2% in the year ended 31 March. The mobile data business segment accounted for 22.2% and Airtel Money accounted for 7.6% of the consolidated revenue.
Airtel Africa’s network includes 30,000km of fibre, over 16,400 3G sites and over 9,200 4G sites.
“The 14 countries where we operate offer strong GDP growth potential and have young and fast-growing populations, low customer and data penetration and inadequate banking infrastructure. These fast-growing markets provide us a great opportunity to grow both our telecom and payments businesses,"" Raghunath Mandava, chief executive of Airtel Africa, said in the LSE filing.
Airtel Africa has hired JPMorgan Securities as sole sponsor; BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan Cazenove as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners; and Absa Group Ltd, Barclays Bank Plc, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank Plc and Standard Bank of South Africa Ltd as joint bookrunners.

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Thursday said its average revenue per user rose by 6.5% to  ₹123 in the January-March quarter which is still not at ""sustainable"" level for the sector.
The company had ARPU of  ₹116 in the same period a year ago.
""The year has ended on a positive note with 4th quarter ARPU increasing to  ₹123 though still not at sustainable levels for the industry,"" Gopal Vittal, MD and CEO, India & South Asia, Bharti Airtel said in a statement.
The company's loss from India mobile services business more than doubled to  ₹1,377.8 crore in January-March 2019 compared with  ₹482.2 crore loss in the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Bharti Airtel on May 6 had reported a surprise 29 per cent surge in March quarter net profit as exceptional income gains and Africa business helped offset losses in India mobile services operations.
The company -- whose profitability has been battered by intense price competition posed by richest Indian Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio -- earned a net profit of  ₹107.2 crore in January-March against  ₹82.9 crore it earned in the same period of the previous fiscal.
This is the first rise in profit after several quarters for the company. Revenue soared 6.2 per cent to  ₹20,602.2 crore for the three months ended March 31, 2019.
The firm had an exceptional income gain of  ₹2,022.1 crore in the quarter, it said in a regulatory filing to stock exchanges.
According to the quarterly performance report released Thursday, the mobile customer base of Bharti Airtel in India declined by 7.1 per cent on year-on-year basis to 28.26 crore at the end of March 2019 from 30.41 crore in March 2018.
The same was reflected in consolidated customer base which declined by 2.5 per cent on y-o-y basis to 40.36 crore in March 2019 from 41.38 crore in the previous year.
The company’s consolidated net debt has increased to  ₹108,235 crore from  ₹106,367 crore in the previous quarter.
The consolidated mobile data traffic recorded y-o-y growth of 137% at 3,836 billion megabytes in the reported quarter.
In India, mobile data traffic of Bharti Airtel grew to 3,705 billion megabytes during the reported quarter as compared to 1,540 billion MBs in the corresponding quarter last year.
""We continue to see robust growth in usage parameters with a YOY growth of 140.2 per cent and 23.4 per cent for data and voice traffic respectively. Our investments towards building capacities will continue to remain ahead of demand,"" Vittal said.
He said that network expansion and content partnerships have led to some opex headwinds on a full year basis."
353,2019-05-31,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel had not earlier shared segmental details due to rights issue related compliance restrictionsAverage revenue per user at India wireless business saw a noticeable improvement

When Bharti Airtel Ltd released its statutory financial results earlier this month, the Street didn’t get a complete picture of the operating performance. The company did not share segmental details due to rights issue related compliance restrictions. The company released these details on Thursday and operating metrics show notable improvement, which should impress investors.
Consolidated revenues continue to inch up. Operating profit in March quarter increased about 6% from December quarter. The sequential expansion in earnings underscores a notable improvement in the mainstay India business.
Operating profit at India mobile services business jumped 31.6% sequentially. Margins expanded from 19% to 24%. The improvement reflects cost control and revenue optimization measures.
Average revenue per user at India wireless business saw a noticeable improvement from  ₹104 in December quarter to  ₹123. The expansion comes on the back of introduction of minimum recharge plans, aimed at weeding out non-paying users. But analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities point out the subscriber churn at Bharti Airtel is much lower than Vodafone Idea Ltd.
Growth in data usage is also impressive at 15%. The operating metrics show Bharti Airtel is withstanding the competition better. “We like the directional moves in several metrics and believe Bharti is making the most of the window of opportunity provided by Vodafone Idea (VIL) being busy with integrating two large networks,"" Kotak said in a note.
Importantly, Bharti Airtel is catching up on the network expansion on 4G coverage. Mobile broadband towers grew 4.7% sequentially. More than 95% of the company’s tower network now is equipped with broadband. “Bharti is still behind Reliance Jio on LTE coverage and capacity but is catching up quick and smart,"" analysts at Kotak added."
349,2019-06-02,Airtel,"Launch of Wynk tube and minimum recharge plans have helped the telecom firmBharti has also introduced an e-book app as a subscription service for niche users

NEW DELHI :
After weathering the choppy seas left in the wake of Jio’s disruptive entry, rival Bharti Airtel Ltd, which till a year ago wore the crown as India’s number one telco, has finally managed to steer into stable waters, with its customer retention and engagement strategy driving up data usage and monthly revenue.
This, in turn, raises hopes of a turnaround in a sector which has seen margins squeezed and revenues eroded by Jio’s launch of dirt cheap data tariffs in September 2016. That disruption forced operators to either shut down or get acquired or merge businesses, leaving just two other private players in the battlefield: Airtel and the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular.
In just the last six months, Airtel has introduced a slew of measures to take on Jio.
It started with rolling out monthly minimum recharge plans starting at  ₹35 to weed out inactive users, which improved its average revenue per user (ARPU).
For consumer engagement on the network, it launched Wynk Tube, which is an extension of its music streaming service Wynk Music, targeted at small-town vernacular users that will allow streaming both audio and video within the same interface. It has also introduced an e-book mobile application, Airtel Books, as a subscription service for niche users. To retain its prepaid customers, who make up over 90% of its total user base, it has introduced a loyalty programme where you get benefits based on the size of your tariff plan.
“Bharti is showing courage. Look at how the minimum recharge plans worked and improved its average revenue per user. It seems like it does not fear that Jio will cut prices. The better news is wherever Airtel is taking the lead in raising tariffs, Vodafone Idea is also following,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said requesting anonymity.
Airtel’s ARPU for the March quarter was  ₹123, an 18.6% increase from  ₹104 in the December quarter. Jio’s ARPU for the March quarter is just  ₹3 higher than Airtel’s at  ₹126.2. Vodafone Idea lags behind these two at  ₹104.
Take another metric. Airtel’s data consumption per user was 11 GB per month in the March quarter, for the first time beating Jio, which saw usage of 10.9 GB per month in the same period.
Its strategy to get users to consume more data on its network is expected to result in a further uptick in average revenue per user and customer engagement, two metrics which are already showing signs of improvement.
In fact, during the January-March quarter, Vodafone Idea lost 53.2 million users while Jio added 26.6 million. Airtel lost just 1.5 million users and managed to improve revenue.
Airtel’s India wireless business posted a revenue of  ₹10,632.3 crore in the March quarter, up from  ₹10,353.2 crore in the year-ago period.
Interestingly, its gross revenue per employee per month rose 9.8% year-on-year to  ₹31 lakh while personnel cost per employee per month came down 5.9% year-on-year to  ₹109,196.
However, these green shoots have emerged after over two years of a brutal tariff war and the industry believes tariffs must rise for the sector to go back to its glory days.
“If you look over a long period of time, prices are not coming down anymore. So competitive intensity is stable because we’re not seeing any further fall in pricing,"" Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said in a post-earnings call with analysts on Friday. “But it is still a brutal marketplace in terms of pricing structure… and industry repair has to happen""."
352,2019-06-02,Airtel,"Revenue soared 6.2% to  ₹20,602.2 crore for the three months ended March 31, 2019The company on Thursday said that its average revenue per user rose by 6.5% to  ₹123 in the January-March quarter

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Friday said base price of spectrum recommended by the regulator are ""exorbitant"" and unaffordable, as it urged the government to review the price of radiowaves to set the stage for an aggressive 5G play.
""These prices are exorbitant given that the state of 5G ecosystem, is still nascent. So, we would hope that the Government brings down prices of spectrum and reserve prices of spectrum, and that is the stage we would look seriously at 5G,"" the company's MD and CEO, India and South Asia, Gopal Vittal said during an earnings call.
Vittal said the base prices recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) places the radiowaves in the ballpark range of  ₹50,000-55,000 crore for 100 MHz of spectrum.
""5G requires large quantities of spectrum. If you have 40 MHz, you don't get 5G type requirement, so in terms of speed and latency you require large chunks of spectrum. Clearly, these are prices we can't afford,"" he said.
The management of Bharti Airtel, present at the earnings call, said the competitive intensity has stabilised to the extent that the company has not seen a reduction in tariffs.
But it conceded that the marketplace continues to be brutal, given that the Average Revenue Per User, which used to be about  ₹200, has slipped to  ₹125. The capital expenditure of the company had already peaked in FY19 and the current financial year would see a moderation in capex, the company said but did not provide a guidance for the same.
Airtel had, earlier this month, announced its earnings for the fourth quarter and FY19 but it had not issued the customary press statement, detailing the management commentary nor provided average revenue per user and other key metrics tracked by analysts, owing to the mega rights offer that was open at that time.
The company on Thursday said that its average revenue per user rose by 6.5% to  ₹123 in the January-March quarter which is still not at ""sustainable"" level for the sector. The company had ARPU of  ₹116 in the same period a year ago.
""The year has ended on a positive note with 4th quarter ARPU increasing to  ₹123 though still not at sustainable levels for the industry,"" Vittal had said in a statement on Thursday.

New Delhi: The recent drop seen in the mobile subscriber base is not a cause of worry nor does it call for the regulator's intervention as the fluctuation is on account of multiple factors like minimum recharge plans and will correct in due course, TRAI Chairman R S Sharma said.
India's total wireless subscriber base fell to 1,161.8 million on March 31, 2019, shedding 21.87 million users over the previous month, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) recently. The overall tele-density in India declined to 90.11 at the end of March from 91.86 in February.
Sharma, however, sought to allay any concern on the headline subscriber numbers.
""These are fluctuations which happen due to multiple factors, like telecom operators have started monthly minimal recharge to keep the connections live...that could have led to inactive connections getting removed. These are minor variations which I don't think are major fluctuations, and I don't think it is a cause for worry,"" Sharma told PTI.
Asked if the regulator intends to intervene to contain the situation, he said, ""There is no question of intervening"".
""The way data services are being used by the people, I am sure this market is not going to stop. The fluctuation in numbers are due to multiple factors so these corrections, they take place due to certain factors. They are not a matter of concern,"" he emphasised.
Mobile subscriber base of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel shrunk by nearly 14.5 million and 15.1 million, respectively, as of March (over the previous month) while Reliance Jio added 9.4 million users in the month, according to the TRAI data.
""Total wireless subscribers declined from 1,183.68 million at the end of Feb-19 to 1,161.81 million at the end of Mar-19, thereby registering a monthly decline rate of 1.85 per cent,"" it said.
The wireless subscription in urban areas declined to 650.49 million in March-end from 656.57 million in February-end, and rural user base also plunged to 511.32 million from 527.11 million during the period.
Industry body Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) also has been of the opinion that not too much should be read into the drop in mobile subscriber numbers for March, as the reduced numbers are a result of consolidation of multiple, unused SIMs and weeding out of low-usage connections by operators.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI :
India's top telecom lobby said on Tuesday that the government's proposed base price for the auction of spectrum for next-generation 5G networks is too high, as India outlined plans to launch the sale process later this year.
The proposed auction price will be a ""serious impediment"" to the uptake of 5G in India, said Rajan Mathews, director general of lobby group Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).
""The majority of our members believe the present proposed pricing of 5G spectrum is unaffordable and above even global discovered prices"", Mathews said in a brief statement.
India's largest telecommunications companies, including Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd's Jio - all members of COAI - are expected to participate in the auction.
Next-generation 5G networks, which can provide data speeds at least 20 times faster than 4G, are seen as vital for emerging technologies like self-driving cars and artificial intelligence.
India's Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told media on Monday the newly-elected government plans to commence 5G trials within 100 days and conduct the auction of 5G airwaves in 2019.
The global rollout of 5G technology has been complicated by US sanctions against Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. US officials have also lobbied allies not to use Huawei network equipment in their 5G networks.
Huawei, the world's largest telecoms network gear maker, has repeatedly denied being controlled by the Chinese government, military or intelligence services.
When asked whether India would permit Huawei to participate in the upcoming 5G trials, Prasad said deciding on participation was ""a complex question, including security issues"", the Economic Times reported.
Telecom operators have not yet received any direction from India's telecom department regarding exclusion of any company from participating in 5G trials, Mathews said."

DAR ES SALAAM :
India's Bharti Airtel has agreed to pay 60 billion shillings ($26 million) over five years and cancel debt to resolve a dispute over ownership of its Airtel Tanzania unit, the Tanzanian government said on Monday.
Tanzania's minister for foreign affairs and east Africa cooperation, Palamagamba Kabudi, announced the deal at a ceremony to receive a three-month batch of monthly payments worth 1 billion shillings each due from April this year.
Bharti Airtel also cancelled $407 million of debt owed to it by Airtel Tanzania as part of the settlement, Kabudi said.
In 2017, the Indian company was drawn into a dispute with Dar es Salaam over ownership of the mobile operator after President John Magufuli said it was fully owned by state-run Tanzania Telecommunications Company Ltd (TTCL)
He said TTCL had been cheated out of its shares through an irregular privatisation process. Bharti Airtel rejected the claim, saying it had complied with regulatory approvals when it acquired a 60% stake in the firm.

343,2019-06-13,Airtel,"The order, against which Airtel and Vodafone Idea secured a favourable verdict, would have aided them nowTRAI rules said telco holding at least 30% of subscriber base or gross revenue share was an SMP

A lot can change in a year, especially in the hyper-competitive telecom industry, which has witnessed severe disruption and has seen operators publicly spar against each other and with the sector regulator, since Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016.
In yet another cruel twist of fate, incumbent telcos Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which had managed to secure a favourable verdict from the telecom tribunal against the regulator’s predatory pricing order last year, will now find themselves in a sticky situation as the same law, which they fought against, would have now come to their aid.
A little over a year ago, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) announced rules under which it would examine tariffs of a significant market player (SMP)—which is an operator holding a share of at least 30% of either subscriber base or gross revenue in a telecom circle—to determine the existence of predatory pricing. It would also look at whether the tariff is below the firm’s average variable cost over a certain period. If the tariff was found predatory, the operator would face a penalty.
At that time, Airtel and Vodafone-Idea were much bigger in subscriber base and revenue compared to Jio.
In the March quarter of 2017-18, Vodafone Idea had 37.5% share, Airtel 31.8% and Jio 19.8% share of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) market across 22 telecom circles in India. In terms of user base, Jio at that time had 186.5 million users, Airtel had 304.19 million users and Vodafone and Idea together had 433.89 million users, as per Trai data.
Given that the two incumbent telcos were much bigger, they alleged that Trai’s new rules on predatory pricing were unfair and would only benefit Jio.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), without naming Jio, had even said in February 2018 that the rules seemed to strengthen the ambitions of a particular operator with deep pockets and monopolistic designs at the expense of other operators.
In December, the telecom tribunal quashed the regulation and Trai immediately appealed the verdict in the Supreme Court.
However, a year after those controversial rules were laid out, the entire industry hierarchy has changed. As of the quarter ended March 2019, Jio has more than 30% gross revenue market share in 17 out of the total 22 circles in the country. Airtel and Vodafone-Idea each have more than 30% gross revenue market share in 13 circles.
“Now, Jio has become a significant market player in many circles. Incumbent telcos were never offering tariffs below cost. But they still challenged the predatory pricing order. They moved TDSAT and that verdict favoured them. Trai then appealed at the Supreme Court. There is a stay on that order now. We can’t take any action against Jio (if it indulges in predatory pricing) because there is no law,"" a senior Trai official said, requesting anonymity.
COAI did not respond to an email query.
In fact, as on 31 March 2019, out of the 22 telecom circles, in terms of adjusted gross revenue, Jio has the largest market share in 16 circles, Vodafone-Idea leads in just five and Airtel in just one circle in Karnataka.
“All three private players have similar revenue market shares now. At this stage, pricing power will be a key factor to watch out for. All operators want to increase revenue, but there is no room to raise prices. Also, Reliance Jio can cross subsidize across sectors and will constantly put pressure on prices. It is also strong enough to take a short-term hit and would not let incumbents even come up for air. Incumbents are witnessing tough times and need to look at different revenue streams,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India."

The department of telecommunications (DoT) made the request to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to ensure competition, sale of all spectrum and bringing the benefits of 5G to social sectors, a DoT official said.
“The government’s goals such as broadband for all and proliferation of 5G are its highest priority. Hence, we have asked Trai to review the entire architecture of auctions... the reserve price... they will look at the participation, and the possibility of greater competition...,"" the official cited above said on condition of anonymity, adding that it has requested Trai to respond with revised recommendations within a month.
The Digital Communications Commission or DCC (formerly Telecom Commission), the highest decision-making authority in DoT, met on Thursday to review, among other proposals, Trai’s auction recommendations. The government is keen to conduct the auction, India’s first for 5G airwaves, in the current year.
In August, Trai had said the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, should be auctioned as a single band and in blocks of 20MHz each at  ₹492 crore per megahertz. While Bharti Airtel Ltd has said these prices are exorbitant and it would not participate in an auction held at these prices, Vodafone Idea Ltd has suggested the 5G auction take place in 2020. In South Korea, the same band was priced at roughly  ₹131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June last year.
Trai has also been asked to offer suggestions on the pattern of deployment, eligibility criteria and method of payment for spectrum.
The government is in the process of finalizing a road map to roll out 5G services, the next-generation technology for wireless communications expected to improve data speed and propel Internet of Things. It is expected to yield industry-altering changes, especially in sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and education.
The Commission also approved a one-year trial period and a one-time fee of  ₹5,000 for entities seeking experimental spectrum to conduct 5G trials.
“This time, we want that all spectrum on offer (over 8,000MHz) should be auctioned and it should be optimized to contribute the maximum to the exchequer,"" said the official cited earlier. Historically, an average of just 40% of the total spectrum put up for sale has been sold.
“It would have helped if DCC had explicitly asked Trai to suggest lower prices. However, the government’s focus on 5G coverage would suggest that this is what it wants,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India. “It’s a welcome development that the government wants more spectrum to be put up for auction, which would hopefully lead to a cut in prices and wider participation in the auction.""
An email sent to the Cellular Operators Association of India, an industry body for telcos, remained unanswered till press time.
Given that the 700MHz band remained unsold in the last auction in 2016, Trai had then also proposed fixing the base price for the 700MHz band at  ₹6,568 crore per megahertz—43% below  ₹11,485 crore set in the 2016-17 auction. The high-value 700MHz spectrum is considered efficient for deploying 4G LTE networks and has greater structural penetration.
For airwaves in the 800MHz and 900MHz band, Trai suggested lowering prices by 21% and 51%, respectively.
The government did not auction any spectrum in fiscals 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, the government had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965MHz."
341,2019-06-17,Airtel,"Trai in October 2016 recommended imposing total penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone IdeaPenalty on Airtel and Vodafone works out to be about  ₹1,050 crore each

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on Monday approved levying a penalty on Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd for allegedly denying interconnectivity to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in 2016.
It, however, asked the telecom regulator to review the recommended  ₹3,050-crore penalty, given the stress in the telecom sector.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in October 2016 recommended a penalty of  ₹1,050 crore each on Airtel and Vodafone, and a  ₹950 crore fine on Idea. Since Vodafone and Idea have been merged, the new entity will have to bear the combined burden. The recommendation came on a Jio complaint that more than 75% of calls on its network were failing as its rivals were not releasing sufficient number of points of interconnect (PoI).
“DCC has agreed to impose penalty on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio. However, the Commission has decided to take Trai’s view on revising quantum of penalty in the backdrop of stress in the sector,"" PTI reported, quoting a person it did not identify. The DCC, formerly called the Telecom Commission, is the top decision-making body in the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
A DCC member’s proposal to impose a penalty on Reliance Jio as well for “failing to deliver quality service to customers"" did not find favour with the majority of its members, the PTI report said.
“A secretary from a nodal ministry said the penalty should be apportioned and applied on RJio as well. His point was whether responsibility of providing quality of service by a primary licence holder be shifted on others. However, DCC members did not agree to the view of imposing penalty on Jio,"" PTI quoted the person as saying.
The telecom secretary is the ex-officio chairperson of DCC and the panel’s full-time members include DoT’s additional secretary, member (finance), member (services) and member (technology). NITI Aayog’s chief executive officer, Department of Economic Affairs secretary and Ministry of Electronics and IT secretary are part-time members of the body.
Calls made to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea for comment went unanswered.
Interconnection is at the heart of a landline/mobile service since a call can start only when the service provider of the “called party"" allows the service provider of the “calling party"" to interconnect or terminate the call on its network. Unless there is an agreement between the two service providers on this, a person will not be able to call another user. A PoI can handle 10,000-12,000 calls at a given time.
Jio had commercially launched its voice and data services in September 2016, but kept them free till 31 December. Its services were nearly free for even longer. The entry of Jio and its cheap data plans attracted millions of users, resulting in an unprecedented amount of traffic from its network to other service providers.
As rivals struggled to release adequate PoIs to absorb the massive traffic flowing from the Jio network, the company alleged that the incumbents were doing this to deliberately thwart emerging competition, something the long-established operators have all along contested."
340,2019-06-17,Airtel,"Airtel expects to raise $750 million through IPOThe offer is expected to comprise approximately 595.2 million-744.0 million new shares

LONDON :
Bharti Airtel Monday announced the price range of its Africa business IPO on the London Stock Exchange at 80-100 pence per ordinary share, through which the company expects to raise $750 million (approximately  ₹5,236 crore).
""The price range for the offer has been set at 80 pence to 100 pence per ordinary share, implying a market capitalisation on admission of between 3,007 million and 3,623 million pounds (approximately $3,788 million-4,565 million),"" Airtel Africa said in a London Stock Exchange filing.
The offer is expected to comprise approximately 595.2 million-744.0 million new shares, to be issued by Airtel Africa, to raise gross proceeds of approximately 595 million pounds (approximately $750 million), including the over-allotment option (green-shoe option), the filing said.
""10% of the offer (100%: primary) is expected to be made available pursuant to the over-allotment option... Excluding the over-allotment option, the offer is expected to comprise approximately 541.1 million-676.4 million new shares to be issued by the company to raise gross proceeds of approximately 541 million pounds (approximately $682 million),"" the filing said.
The final pricing is expected to be announced on or around June 28, 2019, on the London Stock Exchange, according to the filing."
339,2019-06-17,Airtel,"Airtel Africa IPO price is at a 15-32% discount compared to that of its pre-IPO placementsThe lower pricing has more to do with market conditions than company-specific concerns

The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry,"" said poet Robert Burns.
Airtel Africa Ltd, a step-down subsidiary of Bharti Airtel Ltd, had set itself up nicely for an initial public offering (IPO) on the London Stock Exchange. The unit’s profit margins have improved sequentially each quarter for the past 19 quarters, and absolute profits have risen by about 50% during this period.
What’s more, when the company went around looking for pre-IPO investors last year, it managed to sell shares at a significant premium compared to analysts’ estimates. In all, it sold shares worth $1.45 billion at $1.485 apiece.
In that backdrop, it wasn’t surprising that news reports suggested Airtel Africa is looking at raising $1 billion in the planned June IPO. But closer to the IPO date, things have been underwhelming. The company first said it will raise up to $750 million, and has now added that it has set a price range of 80 to 100 pence per share for its IPO.
That represents a 15-32% discount compared to the price the company sold its shares in the pre-IPO placements, using current exchange rates.
Airtel Africa’s latest financials show that its profits haven’t deteriorated since the time it sold shares to pre-IPO investors.
As such, the lower pricing has more to do with market conditions rather than company-specific concerns, says an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, requesting anonymity.
The number of IPOs in London for the first six months of the year is at its lowest in 10 years, with the primary market also coming under the shadow of Brexit.
“The relatively lower pricing of Airtel Africa’s IPO reflects difficult market conditions for an IPO currently, besides an Africa discount,"" said another analyst at an institutional brokerage firm on condition of anonymity.
The Africa discount refers to the costs associated with relatively higher regulatory and policy risks associated with operating in some African markets.
To be sure, Bharti Airtel has done well in the past few years to exit some unprofitable markets and turn around its overall Africa portfolio.
Having said that, the lower IPO pricing reduces the overall valuation of the Africa business, and impacts the market value of the Indian parent to that extent. “At the mid-point of the IPO price range, this would imply a negative impact of about  ₹10 per share on Airtel’s valuations,"" says an analyst. This is less than 3% of Bharti Airtel’s current share price.
That isn’t much to worry about. Talking of regulatory and policy risks, Indian telcos have been hit with costs that are far higher in the domestic markets.
On the flip side, Bharti Airtel’s plan to go ahead with the IPO despite the lower valuation is a positive as far as its intent on deleveraging plans go."
338,2019-06-18,Airtel,"The sector’s regulator should adopt DoT’s suggestions on keeping business costs low, lest the market for mobile services is left with too few survivors for the country’s own good

Sanity appears to be returning to India’s telecom sector. After years of hyper competition and court litigation, companies as well as the authorities are looking to get their act together. As service providers get down to deleveraging their balance sheets—Bharti Airtel intends to take its Africa subsidiary public and Reliance Jio Infocomm plans to sell new shares of its tower company to an investor—the department of telecommunications (DoT), too, has begun to take an accommodative approach. The DoT first asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to lower the base prices of various spectrum bands coming up for auction. Then it advised the latter to reconsider the penalties it had recommended against Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea for denying interconnectivity to new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm in 2016. The fines amounted to  ₹3,050 crore. While wrongdoing cannot go unpunished, the DoT’s twin suggestions to Trai reflect the tough times this sector is going through.
During the boom years, the sector must have looked eminently milkable. Taxation has been high, be it the steep import duties on equipment in the past or the 18% goods and services tax now. The Supreme Court-ordered shift to auctions of airwave spectrum has had service providers suffer the “winner’s curse"" in recent years, with small fortunes stumped up for this vital resource, leaving the older players far too burdened by debt to invest in much else. User charges, meanwhile, have been driven low by the intensity of market rivalry. Rarely have consumer services been so cheap and resource costs so high anywhere in the world. Another round of auctions—for 5G upgradation—at high reserve prices could cripple them. The outcome would be full of irony: perhaps only one private player would survive. The monopolistic effects of such a market shake-out apart, Indian lenders, already staring at huge write-offs in the infrastructure and aviation sectors, can hardly afford another disaster.
There is no denying that the 2G scam during the second term of the United Progressive Alliance government induced some fear among the authorities. Our institutions of governance grew reluctant to do anything that could remotely be construed as favouring a particular private party. Arguably, telecom has been a victim of this dread. However, it is time now to think clearly about the future of a sector that matters hugely to the country. The promise of the Indian market is such that it should never stop attracting new players. As of now, there are only three big private players, with uncertainty hovering over the future of the fourth one, a state-owned entity. Luring fresh investment should be part of the agenda for telecom. Auction participation needs to widen. The regulator would also do well to adopt measures that lower costs and assure the viability of various operators. Tax relief also deserves some thought. The truth is that the government’s pursuit of revenue maximization through spectrum sales and other levies is now at risk of turning counterproductive. The Centre’s routine revenues from the sector have been on a decline, as its budget records show. This is a bad sign. The expanding use of telecom services ought to be filling government coffers, not the sums that are squeezed out of thin air at auctions. The broad goal, remember, is to arm Indians with choice and help everyone stay in touch as cheaply as possible."
337,2019-06-20,Airtel,"India seeks to raise $84 billion this year from a sale of airwavesOperators may soon decide how much more pain they can endure for a high-speed wireless network that can offer better user experience in streaming, gaming and entertainment

Mumbai: After racking up $59 billion of net debt to survive a brutal war in the world’s second-biggest phone-services market, some of India’s billionaires are bracing for more as their next battle looms: 5G.
India seeks to raise $84 billion this year from a sale of airwaves -- most of it for the latest technology tipped to revolutionize connectivity -- posing a conundrum for the carriers controlled by tycoons including Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s wealthiest man. Investment would mean more borrowings, but the reward could be revenue streams never seen before.
Operators may soon decide how much more pain they can endure for a high-speed wireless network that can offer better user experience in streaming, gaming and entertainment in a market where Netflix Inc. to Amazon.com Inc. are making inroads. With applications ranging from manufacturing to education and health care, 5G could be the catalyst for India’s digital economy that has the potential to reach $1 trillion by 2025, according to a report by Deloitte.
‘Competitive Parity’
“Any player missing on the 5G service offering is likely to see erosion of market share,"" said Alok Shende, a Mumbai-based principal analyst for telecom at Ascentius Insights. “There’s all the more case for maintaining competitive parity to remain in the game. Offering a forward path to customers is important.""
Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd., the two biggest carriers, didn’t respond to request for comments on their 5G plans, while Ambani’s Reliance Industries Ltd. said it won’t comment on the spectrum auction.
While 5G offers potential in augmented reality, virtual reality, connected cars, autonomous drones, smart homes and cities, the real promise for a country like India lies in rural areas, said Prashant Singhal, global head of telecommunications at Ernst & Young.
The technology could address some of the basic challenges due to lack of infrastructure in health care and education. For instance, an experienced surgeon in a major urban hospital can advise an in-theater doctor in a small town to perform a surgery over a real-time 5G connection or a holographic image of a teacher could be beamed to a classroom in a village, he said.
Most of Asia’s largest wireless carriers are in the process testing 5G networks, with plans to introduce them commercially in 2020.
World’s First
South Korea’s SK Telecom Co. unveiled its 5G network for public use in April, calling it the world’s first such full commercial roll out. China issued 5G licenses to its three main operators earlier this month, raising the prospect of services starting as early as this year. India plans to deploy its own next year.
The immediate challenge in India would be the investment needed for the network, which the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India estimates could be as much as $70 billion. That amount will further dent the finances of operators that are in the midst of efforts to pare debt piled over the past decade.
“Spectrum pricing is too expensive in India and the telecom companies will have further stress in their balance sheets if they wish to participate in the upcoming auction,"" Rajan Mathews, chief of Cellular Operators Association of India, the industry group representing the carriers, said in an interview Tuesday. “But they have an option of buying at a later date.""
Deferred Purchase
In India, successive governments running chronic budget deficits have relied on airwave auctions to replenish their coffers. If authorities don’t garner enough demand for the airwaves, they usually cut the price by as much as 40% in the subsequent round, according to Deepti Chaturvedi, an analyst at CLSA India Pvt. The preferred option may be to defer the purchase, she wrote in a note earlier this month.
Despite a market with more than 1.1 billion subscribers, competition has driven data tariffs to less than a dollar for 1 GB -- the cheapest in the world. The monthly average revenue per mobile user is also among the lowest, at about $2, compared with about $8 in China and at least $40 in the U.S.
The environment got tougher after Ambani, 62, as part of his empire expansion, unleashed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. in 2016 with free calls and even cheaper data. As a result, many incumbents retreated or merged. Reliance Communications Ltd., run by Ambani’s younger brother, is now facing bankruptcy. The consolidation has left three non-state carriers still standing, from about 10 four years ago: Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
Bruised by Jio, which rolled out its network aggressively to acquire more than 300 million customers within three years, billionaire Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Airtel has run up a net debt of about $16 billion, while shoring up profits with one-time gains for at least four quarters in a row.
Vodafone Idea, India’s largest carrier by users after Vodafone Group Plc’s local unit merged with tycoon Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd., has reported losses in every quarter since the deal was announced in 2017. Both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea top the list of Asian peers with highest borrowings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
However, unlisted Jio thrived, supported by the deep pockets of Ambani’s energy-to-retail conglomerate that has spent more than $36 billion to build the telecom unit. But the group’s net debt of almost $28 billion is also backed by cash and equivalents of $11.3 billion. In January, Ambani, said in a speech that his network is “fully 5G ready,"" signaling spending will be relatively less.
Globally, 5G spectrum auctions have witnessed “robust"" participation, said Ernst & Young’s Singhal. Germany raised 6.55 billion euros ($7.3 billion) this month, more than the government’s highest estimate of 5 billion euros, while Italy got $7.6 billion last year, more than twice what authorities expected. If that trend is any indication, India’s auction may well turn out to be a success, given the growing demand for data.
“The prognosis for 5G in India is positive given the growing appetite for data, increasing digital transformation and the need to quickly adopt new technologies,"" said Singhal. “It has the potential to transform lives and play a key role in socio-economic development.""

Country's mobile phone customer base grew by 490,000 subscribers to 1.16 billion in April, data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India showed on Monday.
Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Jio Infocomm added eight million users in the month to take its total number of users to 314.8 million.
Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel lost 3.3 million users taking its total subscriber base to 321.9 million and Vodafone Idea lost 1.6 million users, thus taking its total subscriber base to 393.3 million.
State-run BSNL was the only other gainer with over 0.2 million new subscribers taking its total tally to around 115.9 million.
Active mobile subscribers in April were 999.7 million. Mobile connections per 100 people, or the tele-density of wireless subscribers, were 88.42 as of April 30. Mobile tele-density in urban India was 155.71, compared with 56.94 in rural regions.
""The wireless subscription in urban areas increased from 650.49 million (65.04 crore) at the end of March 2019 to 652.35 million (65.23 crore) at the end of April 2019.

NEW DELHI :
Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd said it is willing to sign a “no back door"" pact with the Indian government to assuage potential security concerns.
The statement from Huawei comes against the backdrop of the Chinese telecom major battling intense pressure from the US, which is pushing allies to ban the company from 5G networks on suspicions of espionage.
The company hopes the measure would help assure the Indian government about any cybersecurity breach that could arise at the vendor’s end. A “back door"" is a point of access in a network/equipment that guarantees entry into the network/equipment under exceptional circumstances. In its absence, the equipment supplier would not be able to access the customer’s network without consent.
“I am ready to sign a ‘no back door’ agreement with my customers (telcos) and the Indian government today,"" Jay Chen, chief executive officer of Huawei India, said in an interview.
“I would like to propose this to all original equipment manufacturers that let’s sign this agreement with customers (telcos) and the government for network security compliance... to give trust and confidence to the government on security concerns,"" said Chen.
Huawei’s proposal comes a day before US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s visit to New Delhi. Various issues, including Huawei’s participation in 5G roll-outs, are expected to figure in discussions between Pompeo and Indian government officials during his visit from 25-27 June.
Since last year, the US has incessantly pressed its allies to ban Huawei from 5G roll-outs on the suspicion that the Chinese government used the company as a vehicle for spying, an allegation the company has always denied.
Australia and Japan have barred Huawei, while Canada and New Zealand are likely to follow suit.
“We should appreciate Donald Trump and the US government for making Huawei too popular,"" Chen said, tongue-in-cheek.
However, many countries in Europe are still to take a decision, while Russia, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have welcomed Huawei. India is yet to take a decision on whether to permit Huawei in 5G roll-outs.
Earlier this month, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said the government would take “a firm view"" on Huawei’s participation. On Thursday, telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan said her ministry was expecting a recommendation from a committee examining Huawei’s 5G participation.
Earlier this month, India’s department of telecommunications (DoT) began the process for 5G roll-outs by seeking a comprehensive review of the sector regulator’s recommendations on the upcoming spectrum auctions of 5G, the next-generation technology for wireless communications that is expected to improve data speed and propel Internet of Things.
India has also approved a one-year 5G trial period and a one-time fee of  ₹5,000 for entities seeking experimental spectrum to conduct trials. It has, however, not stated explicitly whether it will allow Huawei to participate in the trials as DoT awaits a recommendation from the committee examining security risks arising out of Huawei’s presence in 5G networks.
An emailed query seeking DoT’s response on Huawei’s proposal for a “no back-door agreement"" was unanswered till press time.
Even as India takes time to make up its mind about Huawei’s presence in 5G roll-outs in the country, the company has called for a collaborative mindset.
“India is staring at the next 10 years, which is going to be a golden decade for the country,"" Chen said. “It’s very hard to imagine that a country like India, with a 1.3 billion population, can only partner with a few countries in the world to achieve massive growth... it’s not possible. The fundamental factor for India to achieve growth is openness and cooperation.""
Under its national digital communications policy approved by the cabinet in September, India aims to attract $100 billion in investments by 2022 and create four million jobs in the sector.
“Currently, the world is becoming a mess. But one country can still select its right path,"" said Chen."

Airtel Africa said it had priced the offering at 80 pence a share, at the low end of its range, giving the company a market capitalization of about 3.1 billion pounds ($3.93 billion). It traded at 69.88 pence as of 11:17 a.m.
The weak market showing for the African carrier, the continent’s second-largest by subscribers, comes as parent Bharti Airtel struggles back home with a years-long price war and mounting debt. Proceeds from the IPO will help the India-based wireless operator pare debt while it prepares to upgrade its mobile network to fifth-generation technology.
Airtel Africa may be suffering from broader investor unease about telecom carriers in emerging markets, said Ally McKinnon, a fund manager at Scottish Investment Trust Plc who didn’t participate in the IPO.
Phone companies were popular during the investment boom in so-called BRIC stocks -- from Brazil, Russia, India and China -- but they can be at risk of state intervention, he said, citing Johannesburg-based MTN Group Ltd.’s battle against multibillion-dollar claims by Nigerian authorities over taxes and fines.
“Once you’ve got the network built, you’re vulnerable because you’ve got assets in the country, you’re a big company that makes money, or makes cash flow at least,"" McKinnon said.
Alastair Jones, an analyst at New Street Research, had flagged concerns about Airtel Africa in the run-up to the IPO tied to the company’s network investment and its exposure to Nigeria -- given MTN’s troubles there -- as well as Airtel’s slightly weaker market position relative to rivals.
“Clearly it’s a more difficult market at the moment for African telcos,"" said Jones, who doesn’t have a rating on Airtel, in an interview on Friday. “The regulatory risk around the region is elevated given what has happened with MTN over the last few years.""
In a statement before the start of trading, Airtel Africa Chief Executive Officer Raghunath Mandava said the IPO was a proud moment for the company. “We are delighted by the strong response we have received from the many high-quality investors from around the world,"" Mandava said.
Bharti joins Volkswagen AG in pricing IPOs at the low end of a target range for listings on Friday. Volkswagen raised $1.8 billion through the IPO of its truck unit, Traton, which dropped as much as 2.4% in Frankfurt. Still, low interest rates are helping demand, and some sales that proceeded have done well.
The Airtel Africa sale is among the largest IPOs announced in 2019 in London, where emerging markets companies are boosting volumes amid a lackluster year for British issuers.
Airtel Africa already raised $1.25 billion last year from investors including Temasek Holdings Pte and SoftBank Group Corp., and the company is also planning to pursue a local secondary listing in Nigeria. Bharti is relying more on Africa for growth as prospects for a quick revival of profit in India dim."

327,2019-07-03,Airtel,"The National Company Law Tribunal in July 2018 approved the merger between Bharti Airtel and TikonaA bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose took note of the plea by the Department of Telecom

NEW DELHI :
The central government on Wednesday moved the Supreme Court against the TDSAT order that stayed the Department of Telecommunications’ (DoT’s) demand of  ₹1,627 crore for allowing the merger of Bharti Airtel with Tikona Wireless.
A bench comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose took note of the plea by the DoT for an urgent hearing and posted the matter for July 8.
“...Accordingly, we direct the authorities concerned of the Union of India to take the merger of two companies and licence on record, subject to the under mentioned conditions and the final result of this petition… This interim order shall govern the parties till it is vacated or modified after considering any further or new material, which may be brought on record on behalf of the respondent,"" reads the TDSAT order.
The DoT had in a letter dated 17 August, 2018, asked Bharti Airtel Ltd to pay in cash and through a bank guarantee a total of  ₹1,626.89 crore to clear the merger with Bharti Digital Networks (formerly known as Tikona Digital Networks). Airtel had, however, approached the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), seeking a stay on the DoT demand.
The DoT had asked Airtel to pay  ₹185.62 crore in cash. This is the difference between the entry fee payable for a unified access service licence in the four telecom circles of Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh (east) and Uttar Pradesh (west) and the entry fee already paid by Tikona under the unified licence in the 2300 MHz band.
This payment would enable Airtel to also provide voice services using spectrum in the four circles. Tikona has 20 MHz spectrum in these circles and the Rajasthan circle.
One-time spectrum charges are payable by companies that want to convert their administered spectrum, or spectrum not bought in an auction, to liberalised or auctioned spectrum. Auctioned spectrum can be deployed flexibly for any purpose, unlike administered spectrum.
The DoT’s merger and acquisition guidelines state that if a transferor (Tikona) holds a part of the spectrum, which (up to 4.4 MHz) has been assigned against the entry fee paid, the transferee (Airtel), at the time of merger, shall pay to the government the differential between the entry fee and the market-determined price of spectrum from the date of approval of such arrangements by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on a pro rata basis for the remaining period of validity of the licence.
In respect of spectrum holding beyond 4.4 MHz, a bank guarantee for an amount equal to the demand raised by the DoT for one-time spectrum charges shall be submitted by the transferee (Airtel), pending final outcome of the court case, according to the guidelines. Bharti Airtel had in March 2017 entered into a definitive agreement with Tikona to acquire its 4G business, including Broadband Wireless Access spectrum and 350 sites, in five telecom circles.
The National Company Law Tribunal in July 2018 approved the merger between Bharti Airtel and Tikona. Airtel plans to roll out high-speed 4G services on the newly acquired spectrum in the five circles immediately after the closure of the transaction. The acquisition will boost Airtel’s spectrum position in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, taking its overall broadband wireless access spectrum holding to 30 MHz each in these circles.
After completion of the deal, Airtel will have 30 MHz in the 2300 MHz band in 13 circles, enabling it to better handle surging data demand.
Apart from the above two demands, the DoT had also sought Airtel be made responsible for clearing all demands that may be raised by any wing of the department, including penalties imposed on Tikona or Airtel, apart from submitting an undertaking to meet payments that are sub judice, depending on the outcome of the case."
326,2019-07-04,Airtel,"The telecom companies’ lobby group has also sought access to long-term, low-cost debt for infrastructure projectsThe Indian telecom sector has seen intense disruption following the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016

New Delhi: The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has sought incentives such as an option to issue tax free bonds as well as creation of a separate financing body which would provide cheaper loans to telecom operators as they battle shrinking revenue streams in the midst of a heated tariff war in the sector.
The telco lobby group has also sought for access to long term, low cost debt for infrastructure projects to be provided by Infrastructure Debt Funds, according to a presentation made by COAI to the department of telecommunications ahead of the budget. Mint has seen a copy of the presentation.
Infrastructure Debt Funds are investment vehicles which can be sponsored by commercial banks and NBFCs in India in which domestic/offshore institutional investors such as insurance and pension funds can invest through units and bonds issued by the IDFs. These funds essentially act as vehicles for refinancing existing debt of infrastructure companies.
The Indian telecom sector has seen intense disruption following the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 which brought down data tariffs to rock-bottom and made voice calls free. Operators which were forced to match these tariffs either shut shop or were acquired by bigger players. Only two private players Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, who are both under heavy debt and are incurring losses, are competing with Jio now, which has been profitable for five quarters.
Airtel’s India wireless business posted a loss of  ₹1,377.8 crore in the March quarter, almost triple the  ₹482.2 crore loss it posted in the year-ago period. Vodafone Idea, which is India’s largest telecom operator by subscribers, posted a net loss of  ₹4,881.9 crore in the March quarter and its net debt stands at  ₹1.18 trillion.
“Telecom/ telecom infrastructure sectors should be allowed to issue tax free bonds to reduce the overall cost of capital and mobilize cheaper funds & thereby help achieve the national vision of a connected India,"" the presentation said.
Telcos also pay spectrum usage charges between 3% and 6% of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and licence fees at 8% of AGR, apart from a GST of 18%. COAI has also sought for reduction in these levies.
“The industry has accumulated unutilized input tax of about  ₹35,000 crore. This should be refunded immediately to enhance cash flows of the industry,"" COAI said in the presentation.
The industry body has also batted for abolishing customs duty on the 4G/5G related network products such as soft switches and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) equipment, etc, till such time as quality products at a competitive price are available in the country."

MUMBAI :
Tata Group paid lenders and the government about  ₹50,000 crore ($7.3 billion) to help complete the sale of its mobile-phone services business to Bharti Airtel Ltd., a deal that was announced almost two years ago.
Tata Sons Pvt., the group holding company, paid the Department of Telecommunications  ₹10,000 crore late last month, days after settling all pending loans worth  ₹40,000 crore owed by unit Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd., the Mumbai-based group said.
“All debt obligations of the consumer mobile business of Tata Teleservices have been repaid as per schedule,"" a Tata Group spokeswoman said in an emailed statement.
The disposal of Tata’s phone business was part of an industry consolidation triggered by the entry of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. in 2016. The new operator with deep pockets stormed the market with free calls and cheap data, forcing many of the incumbents, already struggling under a pile of debt, to exit or merge with rivals.
Tata, the salt-to-software conglomerate, agreed in October, 2017 to dispose of the unprofitable businesses under Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) and merge them with billionaire Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Airtel, which is now the nation’s second-biggest carrier. The deal was termed as a “debt-free, cash-free"" transaction.
Besides Bharti and Jio, the other non-state carrier still standing is Vodafone Idea Ltd., which was the result of a merger between Vodafone Group Plc’s local unit with tycoon Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd.

The Supreme Court on Monday ordered status quo for 15 days on the telecom department’s demand of  ₹1,627 crore for allowing the merger of Bharti Airtel with Tikona Wireless. The apex court asked both parties to approach TDSAT for hearing of review petition.

322,2019-07-08,Airtel,"The regulator believes that auction is an open process and players other than existing licensees could also participate in itThe govt asked Trai to reconsider its pricing stance as the market had consolidated

The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has stuck to its stand on pricing for the next spectrum auctions, the first for 5G airwaves in the current year, as it believes that an auction is an open process and players other than existing licensees could also participate.
This is expected to be a setback for debt-laden telcos, which have been clamouring for lower spectrum prices.
The regulator made public its response to the government late on Monday evening after the Digital Communications Commission, the highest decision making body at the department of telecommunications, last month sought a comprehensive review of the regulator’s recommendations on upcoming spectrum auctions, including reserve prices.
The government’s call for Trai to review its suggestions came as it was worried that the demand for spectrum is likely to be subdued because of consolidation in the market as a result of which there are effectively three private telecom service providers.
The sector saw intense disruption after Jio’s entry in September 2016 which brought down data prices to rock bottom and made voice calls free. This forced other operators to match tariffs and many shut shop or were acquired by bigger players. Now, only Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are left to compete with Jio.
The government had also urged the telecom regulator to review its suggestions so that entire spectrum put for auction is sold rather than having a large quantum of spectrum unsold.
Trai said that for the sale of spectrum in an auction, the bidders take into consideration various factors such as the company’s vision, network need, price, number of competing participants in the auction, foreign direct investment policy, and development of device ecosystem.
“The government’s own marketing efforts will also have an impact on participation in the auction. Therefore, no guarantee can be given about sale of all the spectrum put to auction,"" it said.
The government is also keen that social sectors get the benefit of 5G.
The regulator, however, said that it may not be correct to assume that only existing licensees will participate in the auction.
“The auction is an open process and there is always a possibility of additional players participating in the process,"" Trai told the government. Its suggestions include putting all the available spectrum on auction, the regulator said.
Given that the 700MHz band remained unsold in the last auction in 2016, Trai had in its recommendations in August last year already proposed fixing the base price for the 700MHz band at  ₹6,568 crore per megahertz—43% below the  ₹11,485 crore set in the 2016-17 auction. The high-value 700MHz spectrum is considered efficient for deploying 4G LTE networks and has greater structural penetration.
For airwaves in the 800MHz and 900MHz band, Trai suggested lowering prices by 21% and 51%, respectively.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has said that it is disappointed that Trai has chosen not to reduce its recommended reserve prices.
“This puts in serious jeopardy the 5G aspirations of the government and the potential benefits to citizens. We hope the Digital Commission and Cabinet will review this Trai recommendation and make the right decision in the interest of the country,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI, said.
The government did not auction any spectrum in fiscals 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, it had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965MHz.
In August, Trai had said the 3,300-3,600MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, should be auctioned as a single band and in blocks of 20MHz each at  ₹492 crore per megahertz. Bharti Airtel Ltd has said these prices are exorbitant and it would not participate in an auction held at these prices, while Vodafone Idea Ltd has suggested that the 5G auction take place in 2020. In South Korea, the same band was priced at roughly  ₹131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June last year.
The government is finalizing a road map to roll out 5G services, the next-generation technology for wireless communications expected to improve data speed and propel Internet of Things. It is expected to yield industry-altering changes."
321,2019-07-09,Airtel,"India should not end up lagging other countries on 5G adoption. It’s not a good sign that the government has still not finalized guidelines for 5G trials

India’s ride towards 5G just got bumpier with India’s telecom regulator refusing to budge from its earlier recommended prices of spectrum. This has operators worried. Already suffering a huge debt burden, their revenue streams have been constricted by ultra-low telecom charges in a hyper-competitive market. Last month, the government did make the right noises about “inclusive"" 5G services that everyone could afford. But with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) sticking to its stand, the department of telecommunications (DoT) is now in a sticky spot. If the DoT reduces prices at its end, the exchequer’s intake would likely fall short of TRAI’s projections; if not, the auction would risk failure.
This upgradation of telecom technology is expected to raise efficiency in agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, education and other sectors. Mobile telephony, after all, is part of the country’s enabling infrastructure, especially vital to the objectives of Digital India. For these plans to work out, auction reserve prices need to be low. Moreover, India should not end up lagging other countries on 5G adoption. It’s not a good sign that the government has still not finalized guidelines for 5G trials.
Just one operator, Reliance’s Jio, has a 4G-only network that can effortlessly be upgraded to 5G. Its loss-making rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have legacy 2G and 3G networks as well, will need to work harder at it. Without affordable spectrum available for 5G services, the ideal of a market shaped by healthy competition may begin to look distant. That would eventually impact the economy negatively."
320,2019-07-09,Airtel,"COAI says all telcos, including Reliance Jio, are unanimous that Trai’s suggested spectrum prices are too highLast August, Trai set a base price of  ₹492 crore per megahertz for the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services

New Delhi: India’s wait for 5G may get longer with the telecom regulator declining to review spectrum prices that the country’s debt-laden telcos have termed too costly to buy.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) last August set a base price of  ₹492 crore (around $70 million) per megahertz for the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services. The regulator this week declined a government request to review the prices, potentially leading to an auction failure.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the industry body that represents telecom operators, said that all telcos, including new entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, are unanimous that these prices are too high. Bharti Airtel Ltd has said it would not participate in an auction held at these prices, while Vodafone Idea Ltd has suggested the 5G auction take place in 2020. Jio has not yet made its plans public.
Keen to conduct India’s first 5G auction this year itself, the government last month asked the regulator to review the auction architecture, including reserve prices, to make sure the benefits of 5G reach social sectors. However, the regulator was not convinced.
“There’s a divergence clearly. The government says the pricing does not make sense. But Trai does not think so. When two arms have divergence in terms of opinion, as a regulator, it (Trai) carries weight. So, the question is, who is the umpire?"" said COAI director general Rajan Mathews.
Historically, India has priced spectrum much higher than the rest of the world. In fact, in the last auction in 2016, the 700MHz band remained unsold. The government did not auction any spectrum in 2017-18 and 2018-19.
In Australia and South Korea, 5G spectrum was auctioned at $5 million and $18 million per MHz, respectively, against India’s base price of $70 million. While Trai justifies the higher price to India’s higher population, telcos say the addressable population and profit margins are much lower.
“On per-population basis, the spectrum is the cheapest, Trai says. But telcos can’t take the whole population as denominator,"" Mathews said. “The whole country is not even on 4G. When will 1.1 billion people come on 5G and what is the addressable market? Also, this has to be correlated with the Indian users’ ability to pay.""
Mobile tariffs in India are currently among the lowest in the world. In India, the average cost of 1 gigabyte of mobile data is  ₹10. Telcos in the US offer the same for $12, while in South Korea it is $15.
“Since the government is now in a spot after the regulator refused to cut prices, it is likely that the government will allow this auction to fail,"" a senior official at a telecom equipment maker said on condition of anonymity.
The government’s decision to ask for a review of the recommendations was done with an aim to ensure that the benefits of 5G reach social sectors.
“Globally, 5G is being used for B2B sectors. India is looking at agriculture, health, education, smart cities, etc. These are not big-ticket in terms of margins. Telcos here are expected to devote efforts on these social aspects, but then they are paying commercial rates for spectrum,"" said Mathews.
Trai has suggested the 3,300-3,600 MHz band be auctioned as a single band at  ₹492 crore per megahertz.
India Ratings and Research said that any incremental spending for the acquisition of additional spectrum, along with investments in 5G technology, may further stretch the balance sheets of telecom operators and derail the recovery process.
“However, the auction may not garner adequate interest as telcos are still optimizing their existing spectrum; moreover, spectrum pricing continues to be a matter of concern, and 5G technology has still not been finalized,"" the credit rating agency said in a report on Tuesday."

Lagos: Airtel Africa shares fell sharply on Wednesday, a day after its debut $4.4 billion flotation in Lagos, mirroring a similar decline on the London stock market where the telecoms firm has its primary listing.
Airtel dropped 10% in early trade on Wednesday, hitting a low of 359.40 naira against an initial public offering price of 363 naira.
The telecoms company, owned by India's Bharti Airtel, listed in Lagos on Tuesday in an offering that made it the third-largest company on the exchange by market value behind main rival MTN Nigeria and Dangote Cement.
A total of 373,238 orders had been placed for the stock by 10:46 GMT against thin demand. The shares, which listed at 363 naira, closed 10% higher at 399.30 naira on Tuesday after 100,000 shares traded.
Analysts at Meristem Securities said Airtel stock could be mirroring its performance on the London stock market where it dropped as much as 15% the day after it listed in London on June 28.
India's Bharti Airtel offered shares in its African unit via an IPO two weeks ago with a flotation in London and a secondary listing in Nigeria, its biggest market in Africa.
The listing comes after its rival, South Africa's MTN, floated its Nigerian unit in Lagos in May in a $6.5 billion listing that made it the second-largest stock on the bourse by market value.
Meristem analysts said MTN Nigeria had been trading over-the-counter before its listing in May unlike Airtel but added that a tax dispute with the Nigerian government may have dented MTN's valuation.
MTN has said it would sell more shares once the tax issue is resolved and that Airtel's listing valuation provides a comparable for MTN Nigeria which has a return on equity of 93% as against Airtel Africa's 50%.
Nigerian equities dropped to a seven-week low on Tuesday just before the Airtel listing which helped the stock market recoup losses. The main index, however, continued its downward trend on Wednesday to fall 0.86% by 10:46 GMT.
Stocks have been held back by low growth in Africa's biggest economy as well as the president's failure to appoint a cabinet months after winning a second term. Local stocks have fallen 6.7% this year and 17.8% last year.

NEW DELHI :
Despite the onslaught of digital streaming platforms, India doesn’t seem to be giving up on good old television. According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) Performance Indicator Report 2019, the direct-to-home (DTH) service sector has displayed significant growth in financial year 2019 with the addition of 4.91 million active subscribers between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019.
In contrast, the DTH sector had added 3.92 million subscribers in financial year 2018.
Further, DTH has attained net active subscriber base of around 72.44 million with five pay DTH service providers as on 31 March,2019 as compared to 70.49 million at the end of last quarter. This is in addition to the subscribers of the free DTH services of Doordarshan. The DTH market is dominated by Dish TV (40%) followed by Tata Sky (25%) and Airtel TV (22%).
The report further says that there are 328 pay channels in India which include 229 SD (standard definition) pay TV channels and 99 HD (high definition) pay TV channels. The number of satellite pay TV channels has gone up by 20 (from 308 to 328) over FY 2019 compared to 13 in FY 2018. The total number of satellite channels has risen from 875 to 902 over the same period.
The growth in satellite, especially pay channels comes despite Trai’s roll-out of the new tariff order (NTO) according to which consumers can choose the TV channels they want to watch and pay only for them at maximum retail prices (MRPs) set by broadcasters as opposed to the bouquets offered earlier.
“The Trai order has in fact, given DTH operators more benefit and consumers better value for money,"" said Sukhpreet Singh, corporate head, marketing, Dish TV India Ltd. He added that the growth in the DTH segment may seen as an overall rise in video consumption in India, of which streaming services are part of and not at the expense of DTH providers. Further, big-ticket events like the Lok Sabha elections and the Cricket World Cup have kept audience interest alive in television this year. Post the implementation of the new tariff regime, several broadcasters like Star India and Zee took their FTA (free-to-air) channels off DD Free Dish and converted them into pay channels. DTH services have further upped the game, Dish TV, for example, has an OTT (over-the-top) streaming app called Watcho.
“Despite both cable and DTH being digital platforms, it is DTH that offers total flexibility of instantly selecting a pack, separately for every room and change it as often as it is required. It is this customer convenience that is aiding the higher growth of DTH,"" said Harit Nagpal, CEO and managing director of Tata Sky."

316,2019-07-17,Airtel,"Revenues of telecom companies have stabilized after several quarters of declinesVolume growth has come off from the 35-40% levels seen in the preceding quarters

Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) latest performance indicator report has mixed news for telecom investors. Consumer spends on telecom services, which had been falling for several quarters, have stabilised recently. But while telecom companies hold on to tariffs and maintain revenues, volume growth came off significantly in the March quarter.
First, the good news on revenue. Aggregate consumer spends on mobile services, including goods and services tax, stood at around  ₹35,000 crore in the quarter ended March, according to an analysis by Kotak Institutional Equities. This translates to annual spend of  ₹1.4 trillion, 5% higher than the lows of  ₹1.34 trillion in the September 2018 quarter.
The stabilization in revenue comes on the back of stable pricing and implementation of minimum recharge plans for pre-paid users. None of the major players have announced any cuts in their tariffs from February 2019, points out India Ratings and Research Pvt. Ltd
Revenue trends are unlikely to see major change in the recently concluded June quarter either. Both Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd are expected to report stable revenue in comparison to the March quarter. “Overall, our prognosis is that of a steady quarter with Bharti reporting a modest 1.6% sequential growth in wireless revenues and Vodafone Idea reporting a flattish revenue print, largely on the back of higher number of days in the June quarter versus March,"" analysts at Kotak said in a results preview note.
The stable revenue scenario, however, does not mean the industry’s challenges are behind it.
The March quarter industry internals also show easing of volume growth. Industry voice volumes grew just 18% (YoY), the slowest since the commercial launch of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio, points out Kotak. 4G data usage per subscriber grew a modest 1.6% sequentially in the March 2019 quarter, implying usage is plateauing for many smartphone users. In the preceding three quarters, growth had stood at 2.8%, 5.9% and 12.2%, respectively.
Also, the postpaid segment continues to see a sharp fall in average revenue per user (Arpu). Consumers have been downtrading their usage plans, reflective in the 33% year-on-year (YoY) fall in postpaid revenue. The churn is expected to continue in June quarter as well. “Even as like-for-like pricing has been stable for the past few quarters, incumbents continue to see net negative impact of consumers trading up and trading down on the average revenue per user axis,"" analysts at Kotak add.
While volume trends are not worrying yet, telecom companies still face the herculean task of profitability improvement and balance-sheet repair. “Despite the likely stabilisation of revenues and possibly profitability, telcos would continue to rely on external funding arrangements to support their debt servicing and elevated capex requirements,"" India Ratings and Research said in a note."
315,2019-07-17,Airtel,"The move will let Indus secure a unique revenue stream outside the traditional model of renting towers to phone firmsThe move will allow the company to secure a unique revenue stream outside the traditional model of renting out its towers to mobile phone operators

NEW DELHI :
Indus Towers Ltd, India’s largest mobile tower company, plans to utilize its vast base of telecom towers to charge electric vehicles as part of a strategy to tap this fledgling industry and morph into an overall infrastructure provider.
The move will allow the company to secure a unique revenue stream outside the traditional model of renting out its towers to mobile phone operators. It would also help Indus Towers reduce dependence on the troubled domestic telecom sector.
The telecom industry has witnessed severe disruptions after the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 with cheap tariffs, which eventually forced smaller operators to either close operations or consolidate—leaving just two operational entities, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel Ltd.
With fewer telecom tenants, the tower industry has flipped from being a seller’s market over three years ago to a buyer’s market currently.
Indus Towers, thus, believes that hosting EV charging units is a natural extension for the company because of its large footprint.
“We are very keen about this (EV) space. Since the car tank will be replaced by a battery, you will need to charge that battery at either commercial places or your building. The kind of turnaround we talk about in these electric vehicles, you will need many locations. And we have locations which are powered 24 hours of the day making it suitable for EV charging,"" a top company official said, requesting anonymity.
Indus Towers’ plans come at a time when the Union government is aggressively looking to increase the sale of electric vehicles and also make the country a global manufacturing base for EVs. The government in this year’s budget announced income tax rebates of up to  ₹1.5 lakh to customers on interest paid on loans to buy electric vehicles, with a total exemption benefit of  ₹2.5 lakh over the entire loan period.
The government also announced customs duty exemption on lithium-ion cells, which will help lower the cost of the batteries in India, as they are not produced locally. Makers of components, such as solar electric charging infrastructure and lithium storage batteries, will be offered investment-linked income tax exemptions under Section 35 AD of the Income Tax Act, besides other indirect tax benefits.
To handle the charging of EVs, Indus Towers would have to extend the outlets of its current mobile tower infrastructure to EV charging as well, the official added. This is part of its endeavour to become an infrastructure provider independent of any sector.
“We have a location to sell. Any and every technology which hangs on our location and pays us money, we are happy about it,"" he said. “There is a huge amount of traction that Indus is seeing from municipalities in providing the EV charging stations and trials have already started in Gurgaon.""
Indus Towers, is still to firm up its EV charging plans, including the likely investments given the early stages of the EV ecosystem in India.
“What kind of nozzle will go into the car...what will be the battery charging model and the charging cycle, or will the battery be swappable...all that is still on the table,"" the official said.
The company, which was incorporated in November 2007 as a joint venture between certain entities of Bharti Group, Vodafone Group and Idea Cellular, is in the final stages of completing a merger with Bharti Infratel Ltd.
Last April, the two tower companies had agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company outside China.
The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower.
It will be listed on the stock exchanges, as Bharti Infratel is a publicly-traded company.
Its nearest rival in India will be ATC, which has 78,000 towers."

Mumbai: Joseph Landy is stepping aside from his role of co-chief executive of American private equity major Warburg Pincus, after two decades of managing one of the most renowned private equity firms.
Established more than 50 years ago, Warburg Pincus has invested more than $77 billion in more than 870 companies in over 40 countries around the world. The firm established its first institutional fund in 1971
Landy will transition out of the co-CEO role over the next year, reported Bloomberg, citing an unnamed source.
Charles Kaye, co-chief executive and Landy's partner, will take over as the sole CEO of the PE firm, while former US Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner will continue to remain the firm's President, Bloomberg reported.
This is only the second management transition at the top of the PE firm. Landy and Kaye took over the reins of the growth investment and leveraged buy-out firm in 2000, after its founders Lionel Pincus and John Vogelstein stepped down.
Warburg Pincus raised $14.8 billion in 2018 for its flagship fund Warburg Pincus Global Growth. Easier this year it raised $4.25 billion for its China Southeast Asia II fund.
Closer home, Warburg witnessed a similar management transition in early 2018, when Warburg's India co-head Niten Malhan stepped down to set up his own investment firm. Since then, Vishal Mahadevia has been heading the firm's investment activity in India as the sole head.
India has been a major investment destination for Warburg, being one of the earliest global PE firms to invest in India. Warburg's investment in telecom company Bharti Airtel in 1999 was one of the earliest successful PE transactions in the country.
In recent times, the firm has made several large investments across sectors ranging from insurance, microfinance, logistics, education financing and real estate.
In March, Warburg Pincus announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an 80% stake in education financing company Avanse Financial Services Ltd from Wadhavan Global Capital group.
Warburg's other recent investments in India include leading a $65 million round in logistics startup Rivigo, a $200 million commitment to set up a shopping mall platform with realtor Runwal Group and a plan to jointly invest Rs3,000 crore with Lemon Tree Hotels to develop student housing and co-living spaces."
311,2019-07-19,Airtel,"Reliance Jio has vaulted past Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second-largest mobile telephone company by user base

Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio has vaulted past Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second-largest mobile telephone company by user base. Considering Jio’s growth strategy, this was inevitable. Jio launched its commercial services—entirely on 4G technology—in September 2016, signing up millions of subscribers in a matter of moths with its initially-free data and voice service. The latest data put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India shows Jio has about 323 million subscribers, as of 31 May, ahead of Airtel’s 320.4 million and behind Vodafone Idea’s 387.6 million users.
At this rate, Jio’s use base could go on to overtake Vodafone Idea’s in the not-too-distant future. Jio’s exponential growth has been driven by aggressive pricing, but that’s only part of the story. The new entrant offered such fabulous data speeds and voice services that it made the offer basket of pricier incumbents look slow and patchy. Customer complaints of call-drops and internet snap-offs have bedevilled many of the older players in recent years. The price war unleashed by Jio has led to record losses in the telecom industry, forcing some players to the brink. The once-crowded telecom space now has only three large private players, and the state-run MTNL and BSNL are hardly seen in market contention anyway.
The ongoing surge in Jio’s subscriber base has a lot to do with Vodafone Idea and Airtel introducing service validity vouchers, which require users to pay a minimum recharge sum to continue using their networks. What users want, though, are reliable networks as a minimal guarantee; and with 5G around the corner, network quality differences could yet become stark."
312,2019-07-20,Airtel,"As of May end, Reliance Jio had 322.98 million users, against Bharti Airtel’s 320.38 million usersVodafone Idea continues in the top position with 387.55 million users

NEW DELHI :
India’s youngest and only profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has overtaken rival Bharti Airtel to become the second largest operator in terms of subscribers to its mobile phone services, according to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India made public on Friday.
Jio, which entered the sector in September 2016, had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May.
To be sure, the subscriber numbers include active as well as inactive SIMs. The telecom regulator counts each SIM as a user although there are overlaps.
Vodafone Idea, the company born out of a merger between Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, continues to retain the top position with 387.55 million users and a 33.36% subscriber market share.
There is, however, a silver lining for Airtel. It held the maximum proportion (99.86%) of active wireless subscribers as against its total wireless subscribers in May.
Interestingly, as Jio continues to widen its subscriber base by adding low-paying users on its network, rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea started weeding out inactive customers through minimum monthly recharge plans of  ₹35, launched in November. The telcos expect the focus on paying users will improve average revenue per user (ARPU).
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the number of users or connections on its network.
Airtel’s ARPU for the March quarter thus improved to  ₹123, rising 18.6% from  ₹104 in the December quarter. Vodafone Idea’s ARPU was at  ₹104 in the March quarter, up from  ₹89 in the December quarter, and  ₹88 in the three months ended September 2018. These two companies now consider only active users to calculate ARPU.
However, both Airtel and Vodafone Idea have lost subscribers over the past 11 months. In May alone, Airtel lost 1.5 million users, while Vodafone Idea was poorer by 5.7 million subscribers. In contrast, Jio added 8.1 million users during the month.
As a result of the massive bottom-of-the-pyramid user additions on its network, Jio has seen a continuous drop in its ARPU in the past six quarters. Jio’s ARPU for the June quarter was at  ₹122, down from  ₹126.2 in the March quarter.
Jio had 331.3 million subscribers as of 30 June, and posted a net profit of  ₹891 crore in the June quarter, according to the company’s financial results.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea are yet to announce their June quarter earnings."

MUMBAI :
India's Reliance Industries plans to remain focused on subscriber additions rather than chase higher tariffs for its Jio telecoms business, a top company executive said.
Its strategy is aimed at prolonging the pressure on rivals such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, whose revenue and profits have plunged since the launch of Jio by Reliance boss Mukesh Ambani.
""We have been telling you from the beginning, the priority for us today is customers,"" Jio's head of strategy, Anshuman Thakur, said in a news briefing late on Friday after quarterly results.
Since its launch in September 2016 Jio has added 331.3 million subscribers by offering cut-price data plans and free voice calls, along with free music, movies and more. Its arrival has caused upheaval in India's mobile telephony market, forcing some small players out of business while bigger Vodafone and Idea have responded by merging in India.
Competition from Jio has sent the average revenue per user (ARPU) tumbling. Jio's results for the three months to June 30 showed its ARPU - a key metric for telecoms companies - was at 122 rupees ($1.77), down 9.3% from a year ago.
""We are not in this ARPU game,"" Thakur said, adding that the management's priority is to ensure that more subscribers latch on to its network and use its services, thereby creating greater ""long-term value.""
Jio recently topped Bharti Airtel to become India's second-biggest telecoms operator behind Vodafone Idea.
Analysts had predicted that Jio would start raising its tariffs as soon as it reached a critical mass of subscribers.
Thakur, however, suggested that Jio is in no mood to relent, noting that it added 24.5 million subscribers in the quarter and that its subscribers consume an average of 11.4 gigabytes of data each month.
""We're quite happy with these key performance indicators,"" he said.
Reliance also announced on Friday that Jio has sold its tower assets via an investment trust to Canada's Brookfield Asset Management for 250 billion rupees."

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel will seek shareholders' approval for a waiver of recovery of excess remuneration paid to company chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal and CEO Gopal Vittal in 2018-19, the telecom company said Sunday.
According to the regulatory filing, Mittal's remuneration in 2018-19 was Rs21.19 crore more than the ceiling of 11% of the company's net profit. Vittal was paid Rs8.87 crore in excess of that limit in the last fiscal.
Bharti Airtel will seek the approval at its annual general meeting to be held on August 14 in New Delhi, the filing said.
""...the approval of the members of the Company be and is hereby accorded to ratify and confirm the waiver of recovery of the excess remuneration amounting to Rs211.90 million paid to Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman for the financial year 2018-19,"" Bharti Airtel said.
According to the rule, total managerial remuneration payable by a public company to its directors, including managing director and whole-time director, and its manager in respect of any financial year shall not exceed 11% of the net profits of that company.
Total remuneration paid to Mittal was over Rs31 crore and Vittal was paid Rs20.9 crore against the ceiling of around Rs9.8 crore and Rs12 crore, respectively, for 2018-19.
Bharti Airtel's revenue and profit have been eroding due to a fierce tariff war after the launch of services by Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio.
The standalone revenue of Airtel dropped to Rs49,608 crore while the net loss for the financial year ended on March 31, 2019, was at Rs1,829 crore against a net profit of Rs79.2 crore for the previous year.
""...the financial performance of the Company in the financial year ended March 31, 2019, did not meet expectations and it is possible that the Company may also have inadequate profits in coming years,"" the company said in a notice.
Bharti Airtel will also seek shareholders nod to fix and regularise minimum pay for Mittal and Vittal in case the company has no profit or inadequate profit for period between April 1, 2019, to September 30, 2021, and April 1 to March 31, 2022, respectively.
""The management of the Company believes that the remuneration as previously approved by the members of the Company and paid to Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal and Mr Gopal Vittal is justified in terms of their key role within the Company,"" Airtel said.
The HR and Nomination Committee and the Board have at their respective meetings, subject to the approval of the members of Bharti Airtel, accorded their approvals for waiver of the recovery of excess managerial remuneration paid by the company to Mittal and Vittal
""Since the said remuneration of Mr Sunil Bharti Mittal and Mr Gopal Vittal was earlier approved as Ordinary Resolutions, the approval of members is now being sought to regularise such minimum remuneration by passing Special Resolutions,"" the notice said.
Mittal was paid around Rs30.1 crore in 2017-18 and 2016-17.
Vittal's remuneration, on the other hand, has seen an increase of around 68% between 2016-17 to 2018-19. He was paid Rs16.97 crore in 2017-18 and Rs12.4 crore in 2016-17 in the form of fixed pay, performance-linked incentives, perquisites and other benefits."

307,2019-07-24,Airtel,"The decision today will set the ball rolling for operators' plans for launching such services in IndiaThe industry will watch out for whether the government will agree to lower spectrum prices

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the highest decision making authority at the Department of Telecommunications, is set to meet Wednesday to deliberate on the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) suggestions on conducting upcoming auctions – the first for 5G airwaves.
This puts the spotlight on the country’s roadmap for rollout of next generation wireless technology which is set to boost data speeds and Internet of Things (IoT), resulting in industry altering changes for agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, and education.
The decision today will set the ball rolling for operators' plans for launching such services in India. The industry will keenly watch out for the government’s decision on lowering spectrum prices.
This will be the first time the commission will meet after the telecom regulator on 8 July said it would stick to its earlier stand on pricing for next spectrum auctions, as it believes that the auction is an open process and players other than existing licencees could also participate.
This caused a setback to debt laden telecom companies which have been clamouring for lower spectrum prices.
The regulator’s response came after the commission last month sought a comprehensive review of the Trai’s recommendations on upcoming spectrum auctions, including reserve prices.
The government’s call to review came with an aim to ensure greater competition, sale of all spectrum and bringing the benefits of 5G to social sector. The government is keen to conduct the auction this year. It is also worried that the demand for spectrum is likely to be subdued due to consolidation in the market as currently there are effectively three private telecom service providers.
The sector saw intense disruption after Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016 pulled down data prices to rock bottom and made voice calls free. This forced other operators to match tariffs, which saw many shutting shop or being acquired by bigger players. Now, the market is essentially left to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Jio.
The government had last month also urged the telecom regulator to review its suggestions so that the entire spectrum which is put for auction is sold rather than having a situation where large quantum of spectrum remains unsold.
In August, Trai said the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, should be auctioned as a single band and in blocks of 20MHz each at Rs492 crore per megahertz. While Bharti Airtel Ltd has said these prices are exorbitant and it would not participate in an auction held at these prices, Vodafone Idea Ltd has suggested the 5G auction take place in 2020.
In South Korea, the same band was priced at roughly Rs131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June last year.
The government did not auction any spectrum in fiscals 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, the government had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the Rs5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965MHz."

NEW DELHI :
Content spends in India across TV, film and online video rose 24% in 2018 to touch $3.6 billion. The country shows the highest rate of investment growth in southeast Asia which saw an overall rise of 12% year-on-year to touch an investment of $10 billion, according to the latest edition of Asia Video Content Dynamics, an annual report published by Media Partners Asia (MPA), an independent provider of research, advisory and consulting services across the media, entertainment, sports, telecommunications and technology industries in Asia Pacific.
Asia Video Content Dynamics tracks investment, production and consumption for TV, film and online video across India, Korea and south east Asia’s five biggest growth markets (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam).
MPA attributes the 24% surge in content investment in India to a major outlay on premium sports rights in 2018, including big price increase for IPL cricket, supported by continued growth and competition in TV, especially among regional languages outside the Hindi heartland.
Growth in TV entertainment is likely to soften in 2019, due to new regulations on channel pricing and bundling introduced earlier this year, though underlying trends remain strong, it said. The new tariff order introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) earlier this year allows customers and pick and pay for individual channels as opposed to bouquets offered by broadcasters earlier.
The overall 12% increase, up from 8% in 2017, highlights rising competition for audiences and production talent, especially in India and Korea, two of Asia’s most dynamic production and content hubs. Together, India and Korea accounted for more than 75% of video content spend across the report’s seven surveyed markets last year, the report said.
“The outlook remains healthy across much of Asia for the video content industry, with aggregate budgets scaling up in TV, film and online video across our surveyed markets. Much of this growth came from India and Korea, two large production dynamos with deep pools of talent,"" said Stephen Laslocky, vice-president, MPA, in a statement.
“Investment in online video content continues to scale, up 60% in aggregate to reach $858 million across the seven surveyed markets, powered by rapid growth in India, boosted by Amazon, Hotstar and Netflix in particular. Online video accounted for 14% of all video content spend in India last year, the highest proportion of all our surveyed markets. Growth in online video budgets is also accelerating from a low base across much of south east Asia, although investment remains underweight in Thailand and Vietnam. Online video budgets are also constrained in Korea, due to the popularity of VOD (video-on-demand) services from incumbent IPTV (Internet protocol television) platforms,"" Laslocky added."

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) on Wednesday upheld the telecom regulator’s decision to levy a penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd for denying interconnection ports to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd when it started operations three years ago.
DCC is a government panel comprising top officials from the telecom department, ministry of electronics and information technology, NITI Aayog and the department of economic affairs.
The decision comes as a setback to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are already buried under a pile of debt and are facing mounting losses, amid a lingering tariff war triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio in late 2016.
“Today, after detailed discussion it was decided that the DCC will accept Trai’s recommendations to levy penalty and recommend accordingly to the government (department of telecommunications or DoT),"" telecom secretary Aruna Sundararajan told reporters on Wednesday. In the previous DCC meeting, the matter was referred back to the Telecom Regulatory of India (Trai) for a review, Sundararajan said, adding that the regulator wrote back saying it would not change its recommendations.
DCC’s recommendations will be sent to DoT now, which has also been studying the issue for almost three years since Trai first sent its recommendations in October 2016.
“DoT is the final authority to issue the penalty. It has the powers to take any decision,"" said Sundararajan.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the industry body representing telecom operators, said it was disappointed with the imposition of a penalty of this magnitude at a time when the industry is reeling under financial stress. “We had earlier also said that this would simply extract more from the industry,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of COAI.
Bharti Airtel said that given the recent forced consolidation due to financial stress in the sector, this decision would be an additional burden on the already stretched balance sheets of the operators, and would adversely impact the government’s vision of a digitally inclusive and empowered India.
“... the requested POIs (points of interconnection) were provided within the prescribed time limits and were more than the numbers requested for. All these facts were presented to the authorities. It is, therefore, disheartening that those facts have not been considered while taking this arbitrary decision of imposing the penalty,"" a spokesperson for Airtel said, adding that “upon receipt of the formal communication intimating the levy of penalty, we will approach the appropriate forum. We have complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land"".
A Vodafone Idea spokesperson said, “We will explore all options, including seeking legal recourse to protect our interests.""
In October 2016, Trai had recommended to the government that a penalty of  ₹1,050 crore each be imposed on Bharti Airtel and Vodafone India, and  ₹950 crore on Idea, for allegedly denying PoIs to Reliance Jio.
This came after Jio in September 2016 complained to Trai that a large number of calls on its network were failing as incumbent operators were not providing sufficient interconnection ports. Points of interconnection are used to connect two telcos’ networks to complete a phone call.
Trai had then said that Reliance Jio had placed its demand with the three operators well in advance, based on its subscriber and traffic projections, to ensure communication between subscribers of networks. Denying sufficient PoIs was anti-consumer, against public interest and aimed at stifling competition in the sector, Trai had then said."

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Wednesday expressed disappointment on the DCC's decision on penalty imposition, saying the ""arbitrary"" move would put more burden on stretched financials of telcos while adversely impacting the government's vision of a digitally empowered India.
The telecom department's apex decision-making body, the Digital Communications Commission (DCC), on Wednesday approved imposing a cumulative penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea (now merged as Vodafone Idea Ltd) for not providing points of interconnection to Reliance Jio.
The penalty on Airtel and Vodafone works out to be about  ₹1,050 crore each. In case of Idea, it comes to around  ₹950 crore.
Hinting at possible legal recourse, Airtel asserted that it will approach the ""appropriate forum"" after receiving a formal intimation about penalty, and went on to say that it has ""complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land"".
""We are extremely disappointed with the decision to impose penalty on the telecom operators on the matter pertaining to providing the Point of Interconnect (POI). This is despite the fact that the total number of POIs provided were more than sufficient for the projections provided on the number of customers,"" an Airtel spokesperson said.
The spokesperson argued that the requested points of interconnect were provided within the prescribed time limits and were more than the numbers requested for.
""All these facts were presented to the authorities. It is, therefore, disheartening that those facts have not been considered while taking this arbitrary decision of imposing the penalty,"" the spokesperson said.
Given the recent forced consolidation due to the financial stress in the sector, the decision will put an additional burden on the already stretched balance sheets of the operators, and adversely impact the government's vision of a digitally inclusive and empowered India, the spokesperson said.
""Upon receipt of the formal communication intimating the levy of penalty, we will approach the appropriate forum. We have complete faith in the judicial process and the law of the land,"" the spokesperson added.
In October 2016, the telecom regulator had recommended imposing a total penalty of  ₹3,050 crore on Airtel, Vodafone and Idea for allegedly denying inter-connectivity to Reliance Jio.
The regulator had, at that time, stopped short of recommending cancellation of their telecom licences saying it may lead to significant consumer inconvenience.
The DCC had last month approved imposing penalty on Airtel and Vodafone Idea. However, before imposing the penalty, the commission decided to seek the regulator's views on revising the  ₹3,050 crore suggested penalty, citing the ""present financial health of the sector"".
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, however, maintained its stand, saying it is not in a position to modify its previously recommended penalty on the operators as it is bound by the provisions of the Trai Act."
303,2019-07-25,Airtel,"Consolidated revenue grew 1% from a year ago, making it the first time in a year that revenues have grownRevenue per tower, per tower per month, and per customer saw notable rise in Q1, against the March quarter

Bharti Infratel Ltd’s June quarter results has impressed investors. The stock was the biggest gainer among Nifty stocks in early deals on Thursday.
Consolidated revenue grew for the first time in a year, rising 1%. Lower fuel, other expenses and changes in accounting norms means operating profit jumped 28% from a year ago boosting return ratios. “Rental EBITDA grew strongly by 6% on account of better rental revenues and a 60 basis points margin improvement,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note. “Average rental yield increased by a strong 3% QoQ (quarter-on-quarter), attributed to loading and higher rate reset at sites that have seen terminations.""
More importantly, key parameters show signs of stabilising. Revenue per tower per month and revenue per customer per month saw notable rise from March quarter. Even the closing sharing factor which indicates tenancy, and has been on a steady decline, stabilised in the June quarter. “We are pleased to note that after negative trend in net co-locations for the last six consecutive quarters due to consolidation in the telecom industry, we had net additions in co-locations this quarter,"" Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel said in a statement.
However, it is not clear yet how much revenue Bharti Infratel derived as exit penalties from customers who discontinued services. Companies such as Vodafone Idea Ltd have been getting rid of duplicate tower infrastructure focusing on high paying cell sites.
A significant portion of the improvement in operating metrics is driven by Indus Towers, in which Bharti Infratel holds 42% stake. Total co-locations at the company increased 0.8% sequentially, improving the closing factor. Comparatively, co-locations at Bharti Infratel standalone level continued to decline – it was 0.3% from the March quarter.
Even so revenue per tower per month and revenue per customer per month increased at both the entities. “Bharti Infratel’s core operating performance was better on account of better-than-expected rental income, while margins were better than our expectations on lower repairs and maintenance expenses,"" ICICI Direct Research said in a note to its clients.
If the current trends hold ground, one may see a steady recovery in financial performance, partly aided by a favourable base. Last financial year, Bharti Infratel’s operating profit dropped 5.5% as it lost customers. As the company recalibrates its costs aligning its network to new technology (4G), earnings are projected to recover. “EBITDA may have bottomed out in Q1, even as we expect some pick-up in tenancy exits by Vodafone-Idea over the coming 1-2 quarters. We see room for EBITDA upgrades,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities Ltd said in a note to their clients. Ebitda is earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm posted net profit of $132.2 million in the June quarter, a fall of 12.2% from the corresponding quarter of the previous year, as higher finance costs and lower gains on exceptional items offset its growth in operating profit.
These were the company’s first financial results since raising $750 million through its initial public offering (IPO) last month. The shares were then priced at 80 pence apiece, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.9 billion.
It posted revenue of $795.9 million, up 6.9% year-on-year from $744.5 million, largely driven by double-digit growth in Nigeria and East Africa, but partially offset by a decline in revenue in the rest of Africa, the company said.
The revenue increase is significant for the African arm of Bharti Airtel, which battles a bruising tariff war with rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd at home.
Airtel Africa’s customer base stands at 99.7 million. Its average revenue per user (Arpu) was $2.7 in the June quarter.
“Voice revenue, our largest business product, was up 3% largely driven by 9% growth in our customer base, now reaching nearly 100 million customers across our footprint. Data revenue, our largest contributor to growth, was up 36%, as an increasing number of customers relied on our high-quality and high-speed LTE network, resulting in 79% growth in data usage. Mobile money revenue, our fastest growing business, increased by 42%, as we expanded our distribution reach,"" Raghunath Mandava, chief executive officer, Airtel Africa, said in a statement.
Bharti Airtel will declare its June quarter earnings for India operations on 1 August. Africa has proved to be a beacon of hope for the company, which is faced with a struggling India business.
Airtel Africa is the holding firm for Bharti Airtel’s operations in 14 countries, with Nigeria alone accounting for almost half of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).
Airtel Africa’s Ebitda rose 9.7% year-on-year from $316.9 million in the year-ago period to $347.6 million in the June quarter.
Revenue from data services grew from $156.6 million a year ago to $207.1 million in the quarter, while voice revenue was flat at $469.9 million."

Vodafone Idea is expected to narrow its loss in the June quarter as it reaps synergies from the merger of brands Idea and Vodafone completed in August last year in order to survive in an intense telecom battleground where it fights rivals Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel.
Vodafone Idea’s average revenue per user (ARPU) is also expected to improve for the third consecutive quarter on the back of minimum monthly recharge plans it rolled out for users in November.
ARPU is the total revenue of the operator divided by the subscriber base. Vodafone Idea counts only paying users to calculate ARPU.
The company will announce its earnings for the June quarter later today. Rival Jio posted a net profit of  ₹891 crore, up 45.6% year on year. Airtel will announce its financial results on 1 August.
Vodafone Idea’s topline has continued to remain under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016 brought down tariffs to rock-bottom. However, it is still the largest operator in India, by revenue and by subscriber base.
Motilal Oswal expects Vodafone Idea to see 6% quarter-on-quarter jump in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) led by synergy gains.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, who had announced their merger in March 2017, completed the exercise in August 2018 and are currently undergoing an integration exercise to create synergies which would bring down costs of operating networks.
Kotak Institutional Equities expects the company’s average revenue per user to rise to of  ₹114. It was  ₹104 in the March quarter,  ₹89 in the December quarter and  ₹88 in the September quarter. Despite the growth, the company’s ARPU is behind both Airtel and Jio.
“The company is expected to post a net loss of  ₹4,540 crore,"" ICICI Securities said in a note dated 8 July.
Vodafone Idea had incurred a net loss of  ₹4,881.9 crore in the March quarter, down from  ₹5,004.6 crore in the December quarter."
300,2019-07-27,Airtel,"Three years ago, Reliance Jio entered the telecom sector which rock-bottom tariffsRecently, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers

Not very long ago, India had a booming telecom industry, with a dozen operators battling for market share in this billion user market.
But three years ago, Reliance Jio entered the sector which rock-bottom tariffs. A brutal tariff war started, which kicked several operators out of the race to provide wireless services and left many with battle scars. Today, just two other private operators, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are left to compete with Jio.
Earlier this week, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers.
Vodafone Idea retains top spot in terms of subscriber base.
But if you compare India’s number one and number two players on metrics like profitability, revenue, 4G data users and the growth trend of the operators’ average revenue per user, the results that emerge boggle the mind.
For starters, Vodafone Idea, with the largest user base, made a net loss of  ₹4,874 crore in the June quarter, while Jio made a profit of  ₹891 crore. Both companies have priced mobile services at almost similar levels. To be sure, Vodafone Idea is in the midst of a merger integration exercise. The company believes that it is delivering on its stated strategy although the benefits are not yet visible in its topline. It also expects better financial performance going forward. But that depends on when tariffs improve in the market, and that call is clearly in Jio’s hands.
Take a second metric – revenue. Despite more subscribers, Vodafone Idea, which posted revenue of 11,269.9 crore, lags behind Jio which posted revenues of  ₹11,679 crore in the June quarter. Its other rival, Bharti Airtel, will announce its results on 1 August.
Third, Vodafone Idea had 84.8 million 4G subscribers as of 30 June. However, in comparison, Jio has 331.3 million 4G subscribers. Then again, Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base is a mix of 2G, 3G and 4G while Jio is a 4G-only operator.
The fourth metric is the most interesting. While Vodafone Idea’s average revenue per user is steadily climbing, Jio’s is dropping.
After Vodafone Idea rolled rout monthly minimum recharge plans for subscribers to stay on its network, its shrinking subscriber base has led to an improvement in average revenue per user (Arpu) to  ₹108 in the June quarter, from  ₹104 in the March quarter,  ₹89 in December and  ₹88 in September.
Average revenue per user is an operator’s total revenue divided by total subscriber base.
Jio, on the other hand, has shown the opposite trend for the last 6 quarters. Jio’s ARPU for the June 2019 quarter was at  ₹122, down from  ₹126.2 in the March 2019 quarter and  ₹130 in the December 2018 quarter. It was at its peak of Rs154 in the December 2017 quarter.
A declining ARPU means subscriber additions on the network outpace its growth in revenue. In other words, every incremental Jio user contributes less to the total revenue and for Vodafone Idea the quality of the user base is improving.
A clear picture of who wins this telecom war will emerge only when the dust settles in the battleground. Till then, customers can sit back and enjoy cheap data tariffs."
298,2019-07-29,Airtel,"Global rating agency Fitch said India's reserve price of $70 million per MHz is ""expensive""It said Indian telcos, which are already stretched, will have to shell out $7 billion for a pan-India license with 100 MHz of spectrum

Mumbai: India's reserve price of $70 million per MHz is ""expensive"", and will force Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to participate in 5G spectrum auctions in a ""limited"" way, global rating agency Fitch said on Monday.
The comments come weeks after nearly all the telcos had expressed their concerns on the spectrum pricing.
""The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (TRAI) 5G spectrum price for spectrum band of 3,300-3,600MHz of $70 million per MHz is expensive compared with 3G and 4G spectrum auctions in the past,"" the agency said in a note.
It said Indian telcos, which are already stretched, will have to shell out $7 billion for a pan-India license with 100 MHz of spectrum.
The agency said it is unlikely for the auction to be undertaken in 2019. In June, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said that the Government is likely to hold the auction this year and also start trials in the next 100 days.
Fitch said the auction will only likely to happen in the second half of 2020 as the government and TRAI will require time to prepare.
""We expect limited participation in the 5G spectrum auctions by Bharti and Vodafone-Idea given the expensive spectrum and limited business case of 5G in the short to medium term,"" it said.
The agency said 5G may have only limited commercial viability in the short term, as 4G penetration is still low in India and there is little appealing content or applications which cannot be addressed by 4G speeds.
Also, Indian telcos lack extensive intra-city fibre infrastructure, which is responsible for poor internet experience relative to other markets and is also critical in order to provide a seamless 5G experience, it said.
In the report focused on Bharti Airtel, the agency said the third biggest telco by subscribers will earmark $1 billion towards upfront 5G spectrum payments in FY20.
The agency said it has a stable rating on Bharti's 'BBB-' rating as it feels the average revenue per user are on the way up and also due to de-leveraging work through the sale of non-core assets by the company.
Despite the experience of the last two years, where the entry of the deep-pocketed Reliance Jio wrecked the telecom market, the agency said it expects competition to ease as three broadly equally sized telcos have emerged, each with a 31-33% revenue market share.
""We expect the blended average tariff to rise by 5-10% during FY20, underpinned by the incumbents' introduction of a minimum mobile tariff of  ₹35,"" it said.
This estimate was attributed to expectation of Jio starting to raise tariffs gradually as it starts to focus on monetisation of its large investment.

NEW DELHI :
Vodafone Idea Ltd, India’s largest operator by users, plans to boost 4G penetration and roll out a new minimum monthly recharge plan to improve revenue and arrest the trend of customers leaving its network.
The company, which is in the midst of a massive integration exercise of its two telecom brands Vodafone and Idea, has completed the network integration process in 11 out of 22 circles and hopes to achieve the rest by June 2020.
Triggered by the price war unleashed by Jio’s entry in September 2016, the two brands had announced their merger in March 2017 and completed the regulatory process by August 2018.
Since then, the company has continued to lose subscribers every month.
In fact, its subscriber base declined from 334.1 million in the March quarter to 320 million in the June quarter.
Because of the customer churn that was triggered by the introduction of minimum monthly recharge plans and decline in tariffs, Vodafone Idea’s revenue fell 4.3% to  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter from  ₹11,775 crore in the preceding three months.
However, the company has announced a new monthly minimum recharge plan for  ₹45 which it hopes will boost revenue.
“We have already tested the  ₹45 plan across four markets and have seen encouraging response which gives us the confidence of getting the customer churn down as this pack gives much more value (70 minutes talk-time) compared to the  ₹35 pack (which had only incoming calls facility). We will soon roll out the  ₹45 plan across India,"" Vodafone Idea chief executive officer Balesh Sharma said in the company’s post earnings call with analysts.
In November, the company rolled out recharge packs starting  ₹35 to weed out inactive subscribers and reduce administrative and selling expenses. This shrinking subscriber base led to an improvement in average revenue per user (Arpu) to  ₹108 in the June quarter from  ₹104 in the March quarter,  ₹89 in December and  ₹88 in September. Average revenue per user is an operator’s total revenue divided by total subscriber base.
To be sure, Vodafone Idea only counts active users for Arpu calculation.
“We are trying to arrest customer churn. We are understanding why users are leaving us. After a couple of recharges of  ₹35, the customer started seeking value. In many markets, in reality or perception, we are not on top. The odds are against us. That’s why we are rolling out  ₹45 pack which gives much more talk time to the user. We see a clear upside,"" Sharma said.
The telecom operator posted a loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter. The net loss came despite the company witnessing higher data consumption on its network, and signing up more 4G subscribers.
The company’s shares plunged 26.8% on Monday to  ₹6.77 on BSE.
It added 4.1 million 4G customers, taking the overall base to 84.8 million as of 30 June. However, in comparison, Jio has 331.3 million 4G subscribers.
Vodafone Idea believes increasing 4G penetration will reduce customer churn. It currently has 68% 4G coverage across the country. It has a long way to go as its rivals Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio have over 90% 4G coverage at present.
Vodafone Idea’s gross debt stands at  ₹1.2 trillion."

Despite being dismissed as a glossy marriage video masquerading as cinema, India’s favourite family film, Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!, which celebrates 25 years of its release this week, continues to make money. When it was released in August 1994, the Sooraj Barjatya-directed musical, romantic comedy starring Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan had grossed  ₹72.46 crore at the box office, running for nearly two-and-a-half years in some theatres, while celebrating either a golden or silver jubilee in most others.
Adjusted for inflation, today, the family drama would have grossed around  ₹973 crore, to emerge as the highest grossing film in the history of Indian cinema, considering that the Hindi version of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion had raked in  ₹708.99 crore.
Even now, the film is much loved on television, and has most recently found acceptance on video streaming platforms. Industry experts said Rajshri Productions should be making anywhere between  ₹3-5 crore per year from the sale of these various ancillary rights that are not purchased for perpetuity, but renegotiated every few years.
“Hum Aapke Hain Koun...! has been the most successful Hindi movie on Indian television ever with its viewership surpassing the likes of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Sholay and even recent hits like 3 Idiots and PK,"" said Ruchir Tiwari, business head, Hindi movies cluster, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. The Zee network owns satellite rights to the film.
“Airing consistently for 25 years, it has managed to grasp the attention and interest of the viewers every time due to its strong storyline, simple plot and relatable characters that resonate highly with audiences across age groups. It is a movie about family, sacrifice, duty and, most of all, love—all the elements that make for perfect family viewing,"" Tiwari added.
The other big platform where it has been a clear winner is the mobile ringtone and caller tune segment, especially in the Hindi heartland, where the melodies of the 1990s still reign. “Broadly about 40% of our consumption is in Hindi, around 7-8% of which comes from 90s’ music,"" said Sameer Batra, chief executive officer, content and apps, Bharti Airtel Ltd, which owns music streaming app Wynk. While the north and west are obvious markets for this genre, the east and south, including Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, are surprisingly big on the 1990s’ music too, he added.
As far as hello tunes go, a double-digit user percentage goes for the music of the 1990s across big and small towns. Top 1990s albums include hits such as Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, Saajan, 1942: A Love Story, Dil Se.., Dil Toh Pagal Hai and Mohra, while Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu are the top artistes.
“As an album, Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! continues to have about 25,000-30,000 daily users and the top four songs are Pehla Pehla Pyaar, Mujhse Juda Hokar, the title track and Didi Tera Dewar Deewana,"" Batra added. “For the 35-40 age group that was young in the 1990s, these hold a lot of nostalgic appeal.""
Released on 5 August 1994, the film, which was indeed a remake of Rajshri’s own 1982 production Nadiya Ke Paar, ranks No.1 in the list of all-time Hindi blockbusters. It was essentially a love story centered on strong family ethics. The Barjatyas had taken it slow, releasing in only 26 cinemas across the country to begin with. By the 21st week, however, it was being screened across 522 cinemas, only to peak with 730 screens by the 25th week.
“We were very confident of the project and had gone for very limited release,"" said Ramanathan P.S., head of sales, Rajshri Productions, adding that it was recorded in the optical stereo sound system, which not too many theatres had the infrastructure to play in those days.
Rajshri sold the film only to cinema halls that had the sound system and even went to the extent of installing the system at their own cost in a few theatres, one in Jaipur and the other in Hyderabad.
Initially playing for 3 hours 35 minutes, the makers chopped a couple of the 14 songs to bring the running time to 3 hours 13 minutes.
“The film was going very steady. In the beginning, every show was houseful. But we didn’t want to increase the number of theatres. By the eighth or ninth week, we started giving it to other good theatres. Our condition was that theatre should be well-maintained. And No.2, we wanted the film to have a long run. In Mumbai’s Liberty Cinemas, for example, it ran for two-and-a-half years."" Ramanathan recalled.
There were other big challenges, too. In the 1980s, people from respectable families had stopped visiting cinema halls because most were dilapidated and shoddily maintained. The boom in the use of video cassette recorders (VCRs) also let families watch movies from within the comforts of their homes. There was huge entertainment tax levied and theatres were shutting down left, right and centre. “But films like Hum Aapke Hain Koun ...! and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge helped the exhibition business to bounce back. The trend (of going to theatres) started again,"" Ramanathan said."
294,2019-07-31,Airtel,"June quarter revenue of Bharti, which will announce its earnings today, is unlikely to exceed that of JioIn the March quarter, Bharti Airtel’s India mobile business generated  ₹10,632 crore

Bharti Airtel Ltd, which was India’s largest operator till a year ago, will announce its June quarter earnings on Thursday, but the day will be more significant for its arch rival Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which is expected to be crowned the number one telco.
With Bharti’s revenue unlikely to exceed that of Reliance Jio, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani will have achieved a rare feat with his telecom company grabbing the top spot in the market in less than three years of starting operations.
Last week, Jio, for the first time, surpassed Vodafone Idea Ltd in terms of operating revenue. Despite more subscribers, Vodafone Idea, which posted revenue of  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter, lagged behind Reliance Jio’s  ₹11,679 crore.
In the March quarter, Bharti Airtel’s India mobile business generated  ₹10,632 crore. Top brokerages expect Airtel India mobile revenue to grow just 1-2% sequentially in the June quarter.
“Indian wireless revenues (for Bharti Airtel) are expected to grow 1.7% quarter-on-quarter to  ₹10,810 crore,"" ICICI Securities said in a report dated 8 July.
The brokerage expects Airtel’s Indian wireless business to witness muted net subscriber addition of 1.1 million given the weakness in wireless broadband subscriber addition.
Motilal Oswal, too, expects Airtel’s India wireless revenue to grow by a meagre 1.1% sequentially to  ₹10,750 crore.
With Airtel’s June quarter results to be announced on Thursday, the dust will settle in the telecom battleground with Reliance Jio likely to emerge as the market leader from its challenger position three years ago.
Jio entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap data plans and affordable handsets, which led to an unprecedented rise in mobile data consumption in the country, with an average user consuming 11 GB data per month.
While the telecom industry also witnessed intense disruption, shrinking revenue streams, bankruptcy and, finally, consolidation, the last three years have been monumental as 4G coverage soared and became a catalyst for the growth of mobile data and new applications and services, especially in the content ecosystem.
Earlier this month, Reliance Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers. Jio had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May, according to data from Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.
The leadership position is also significant for Jio as it would allay concerns about the company not raising tariffs even as it reinvents itself as a technology platform.
At last year’s annual general meeting, Ambani had said that digital platforms were becoming the new-age factories and that Reliance was embarking on a golden decade.
“As the golden decade rolls on, our consumer businesses will contribute nearly as much to the overall earnings of the company as our energy and petrochemical businesses,"" he said on 5 July last year.
Reliance has invested over  ₹2.5 trillion in building mobile and broadband infrastructure across the country.
Ambani’s next big bet is on fibre-to-the-home offerings. Termed JioGigaFiber, it is touted to be the largest green field rollout of wired broadband services, covering 1,600 cities in India.

293,2019-08-01,Airtel,"Airtel will announce its earnings for the June quarter todayAirtel had posted a surprise profit of  ₹107.2 crore in the three months ended 31 March

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel is expected to report a slight improvement in its average revenue per user (ARPU) for the third consecutive quarter after the company rolled out minimum recharge plans for users to stay on its network at a time when it battles cheap tariffs from rival Reliance Jio.
Airtel will announce its earnings for the June quarter today. Reliance Jio posted a profit of  ₹891 crore while Vodafone Idea posted net loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter.
“Indian wireless revenues (for Bharti Airtel) are expected to grow 1.7% quarter-on-quarter to  ₹10,810 crore,"" ICICI Securities said in a report dated 8 July.
The brokerage expects Airtel’s Indian wireless business to witness muted net subscriber addition of 1.1 million given the weakness in wireless broadband subscriber addition. ICICI Securities expects Airtel to post a net loss of  ₹1,009 crore.
The operator’s topline has continued to remain under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016 brought down tariffs to rock-bottom.
Motilal Oswal expects Airtel’s consolidated revenue to rise 3% year-on-year at  ₹20,600 crore and out of that India wireless business to record revenue of  ₹10,750 crore.
Average revenue per user for Bharti Airtel has been improving as it sheds low paying users from its network. Arpu is the total revenue of the company divided by the number of subscribers on the network.
Arpu was  ₹104 in the December quarter, an improvement from  ₹100 from the preceding September quarter, the first such increase after nine straight quarters of decline. However, the rise in Arpu is on account of the company modifying the customer base definition in order to represent only the customers who transact and generate revenue.
Airtel had posted a surprise profit of  ₹107.2 crore in the three months ended 31 March because of a one-time gain of  ₹2,022.1 crore and a tight control on sales and marketing expenses.
While the company posted a profit at the consolidated level, Bharti Airtel’s India wireless business had posted a loss of  ₹1,377.8 crore, almost triple the  ₹482.2 crore loss it posted in the year-ago period. However, the March quarter numbers were better than the  ₹1,903.2 crore loss the company reported in the preceding December quarter.
Investors will also watch out for management’s commentary on competitive intensity in the sector."

Indian stock markets are expected to remain subdued on Thursday tracking weakness in global peers as the US Federal Reserve has indicated that there may no rate cuts going ahead due to a global slowdown.
Asian equities fell to six-week lows on Thursday and the dollar rose after the US Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point rate cut as expected but doused hope of a lengthy easing cycle.
MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.4%, extending losses for a fifth day to the lowest since mid-June. Japan’s Nikkei also fell 0.4%. South Korea’s KOSPI slipped 0.5%, while Australian shares declined 0.3%.
Speaking at a news conference after the release of the US central bank’s statement, Fed chief Jerome Powell termed the rate cut as “a mid-cycle adjustment to policy"", citing signs of a global slowdown, simmering trade tensions and a desire to boost too-low inflation. Markets took that as a sign that further sharp cuts were unlikely anytime soon.
Overnight, the Dow and the Nasdaq lost 1.2% each, while the S&P 500 declined 1.1%. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe slipped to a five-week low.
Back home, shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd are likely to be in focus. Ahead of a September deadline, Subhash Chandra’s Essel group has agreed to sell an 11% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) for  ₹4,224 crore to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, as controlling shareholders of the broadcaster attempt to pay off debts.
In macro-economy news, eight infrastructure sectors, accounting for 40.27% of the index of industrial production (IIP), was almost flat (0.2%) in June, paving the way for another round of policy rate cut by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Reserve Bank of India during its meeting on 7 August. Data released by the Controller General of Accounts showed that the central government exhausted 61.4% of its full-year fiscal deficit target during the first quarter (April-June) of the fiscal. This compares with 68.7% during the same period a year ago.
Companies that will announce June quarter earnings are Bharti Airtel, Tata Power Company, Marico, Godrej Consumer Products, Ceat, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare and ICRA among others.
Auto stocks will also be in focus as monthly sales number will be released by the manufacturing companies.
Meanwhile, US Treasuries reacted to Powell’s remarks by flattening the yield curve as the front-end of the market scaled back prior expectation of at least a 100 basis points of easing in the near-term.
Further hurting sentiment, the US and China ended a round of meetings without much progress on their ongoing tariff war.
In currency market, the dollar rose against the euro and Antipodean currencies on expectation that monetary policies in Europe, Australia and New Zealand will remain accommodative. The dollar index finished July 2.5% higher. The common currency hit a more than two-year trough of $1.1058 overnight and was last at $1.1061.
Against the Japanese yen, the dollar broke above 109 to jump to its highest since end-May.
In commodities, crude oil futures settled higher on Wednesday for the fifth straight day, buoyed by a bigger-than-expected drop in US inventories, but a stronger dollar helped bring prices down from the session’s high in post settlement trading. US crude futures fell more than $1 to $57.56 per barrel. Brent was down $1.10 at $63.95.
Spot gold made a new two-week trough on Thursday after falling to 1,399.75.

291,2019-08-01,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel posts  ₹2,866 crore loss in Q1FY20, against  ₹97 crore profit in the year earlierRevenue from India wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel Ltd posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that has ravaged its rivals and reshaped India’s telecom market.
New Delhi-based Bharti Airtel swung to a  ₹2,866 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 June from a net profit of  ₹97 crore in the year earlier as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore.
Bharti Airtel, which was till last year India’s biggest telecom operator, has been struggling to raise prices and add subscribers because of the tariff war, although a wave of consolidation in India’s telecom market has wiped out smaller telcos and forced Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd to merge.
“The pressure on Airtel will continue as it has to incur the cost of managing multiple networks given its users are also on 2G and 3G. This hurts Airtel’s economics in the short run,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
Bharti Airtel’s consolidated revenue from operations grew 4.7% to  ₹20,738 crore in the June quarter from  ₹19,799 crore a year ago. Revenue from the India wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore.
Reliance Jio generated  ₹11,679 crore in operating revenue in the June quarter, beating Bharti Airtel on this metric. Last week, Jio surpassed Vodafone Idea Ltd, which posted revenue of  ₹11,269.9 crore despite having more users.
With this, Reliance Jio is now the number one telco in terms of revenue, achieving the rare feat of market leadership in the telecom industry in less than three years of starting its operations in September 2016.
The results also underscore the sustained struggle of Bharti Airtel and other Indian telecom operators to stay profitable despite recording higher data and voice consumption. An average Airtel user consumed 12GB of data a month in the June quarter, compared to 7.8GB in the year-ago period.
Consolidated operating profit rose 24.2% to  ₹8,493 crore from a year earlier. The company’s India wireless business posted a loss of  ₹1,242 crore in the June quarter. Airtel’s consolidated net debt was  ₹1.16 trillion as of June-end.
The silver lining for the firm is that its average monthly revenue per user (Arpu) from India mobile services rose to  ₹129 in the June quarter from  ₹123 in the preceding three months. This is also due to the fact that its subscriber base has shrunk.
Airtel’s Arpu is the highest across telcos in the June quarter, with Jio at  ₹122 and Vodafone Idea at  ₹108.
“The India business revenue is stable, Arpu is up and 4G base has also increased. These are positive factors,"" said a Mumbai-based fundamental analyst, requesting anonymity.
The launch of low-cost tariff plans by Reliance Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, forced rivals to drop their rates, hurting profit margins. Smaller companies were forced to either shut shop or get acquired, leaving just Airtel, Jio and the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea to compete in the Indian market.
The performance of the firm’s Africa unit has proved to be a beacon of hope. Airtel Africa posted revenue of $795.9 million, a 6.9% rise from $744.5 million a year earlier, largely driven by growth in Nigeria and East Africa.
The Africa operations posted a profit of $132.2 million in the June quarter."
290,2019-08-02,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel’s total data customer base grew 4.3% last quarter, while Vodafone Idea’s data users fell 2%Airtel’s operating profit or Ebitda dropped only by 1.8%

Bharti Airtel Ltd’s June quarter results will bring relief to investors, especially after the shocking results of Vodafone Idea Ltd. Revenue at Airtel’s mainstay India wireless business grew for the second consecutive quarter. They are up 2.2% from March quarter, on the back of a 4.3% sequential expansion in the March quarter.
In comparison, revenues at Vodafone Idea had fallen 4.3%, and resulted in a 22% drop in operating profit on a like-to-like basis. In Airtel’s case, operating profit or Ebitda dropped only by 1.8%. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
""Bharti’s ahead-of-Vodafone Idea network investments, slightly better quality of subscriber base, and some success of its loyalty/partnership program (Airtel Thanks) are all playing a role on Bharti’s superior relative performance to Vodafone Idea,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients.
Drill down further and it becomes clear why Airtel has handled the onslaught of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd much better. To start with, the fall in its subscriber base is far lower than Vodafone Idea’s.
Importantly, the expansion in mobile broadband towers is better at Airtel, where they rose 2.6% to 177,141 towers. Vodafone Idea saw a mere rise of 1.1% to 157,278 towers.
Note that Vodafone Idea’s revenue is ahead of Airtel’s, even while its broadband coverage is lower. It isn’t surprising then that Airtel’s total data customer base grew 4.3% last quarter, while Vodafone Idea’s data users fell 2%.
Data usage per customer has seen notable improvement— up 8% vis-à-vis 4.9% in March quarter. As a consequence, the improvement in realization, also known as average revenue per user, is also better at Airtel.
Now that Airtel has reported a steady performance for its India wireless business, it is evident that Vodafone Idea’s underperformance can be explained by company-specific issues. The mega-merger and the time taken to integrate teams and networks have weighed on the latter’s performance.
It is not yet clear how Airtel customers are reacting to minimum recharge plans. Vodafone Idea’s experience with the minimum recharge plans has not been encouraging, forcing the company to alter the plans. It is also not yet clear if the pace of down-trading in post-paid segment has slowed at Airtel. Prima facie, Airtel appears to have handled these pressures better.
Meanwhile Airtel Africa, the other key business segment, reported a steady quarter with revenue and operating profit growing slightly from the March quarter.
While key operating metrics of the India business show incremental improvement, much depends on market repair. Capital expenditure remains elevated and earnings expansion remains a challenge. “Although we think Bharti is better positioned than incumbents, we believe recovery is still some way off. The key for Bharti, in our view, will be an improvement in pricing, which remains elusive. Jio has said it does not feel the need to change ARPU (average revenue per user) currently. We expect competitive intensity in the India business to stay high over the next 12 months,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in 28 July note."
289,2019-08-02,Airtel,"So far this year Nifty has lost 0.1% while Sensex was up 1%Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose 3.2% after its Arpu from India mobile services rose to  ₹129 in Q1

Mumbai: India's Nifty 50 equity index wiped out gains made in 2019 so far, while the benchmark Sensex hit a fresh five-month low on Friday, tracking global peers that declined after US President Trump’s announcement of fresh tariffs escalated trade tensions with China.
Market value of BSE-listed companies eroded over  ₹15 lakh crore since 5 July as disappointment over the Union Budget, tepid corporate earnings, weak auto sales, and the ongoing credit crunch have weighed on investor sentiment. Sensex and Nifty have fallen over 10% during this period.
So far this year, Nifty has lost 0.1%, while Sensex has risen 1%. Foreign investors have bought $9.60 billion while domestic institutional investors bought nearly  ₹1.33 lakh crore in equities during this period.
At 10.30 am, the Sensex index was down 1% at 36,708.32 points, while the Nifty dropped 1.02% to 10,892.15 points. In the US, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 closed 1% lower each in overnight trade. Among Asian equities, Nikkei and Hang Seng were down 2.3% each.
""The major concern for the market is serious slowdown seen in various sectors that seemed cyclical at the start but are turning out to be structural in nature. To reverse the current slowdown we would need tough economic reforms,"" said Rusmik Oza, head of fundamental research, Kotak Securities.
In a surprise move, Trump on Thursday said he would impose 10% tariff on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, effective 1 September, and could raise tariffs further if President Xi Jinping fails to move fast enough on striking a trade deal.
""This backdrop of a slowing economy and the low probability of any ‘big-bang’ stimulus events do not bode well for overall growth and earnings outlook. Nifty consensus EPS has been seeing cuts, with the downgrade momentum spreading across stocks. The Nifty companies results so far (two-thirds of the index weight) indicate Q1FY20 EPS growth of only 5% yoy. This contrasts with the steep 20-30% growth rates built into consensus expectations for FY20/FY21,"" said Emkay Research in a note to its investors.
""Despite the recent correction, we see Nifty valuations (17.5x one-year forward) not factoring in further earnings risks. Our cautious stance on the Nifty is reflected in ~4% cash position in our Nifty EAP. We like sectors that could benefit from continued govt spending and corporate re-leverage cycle (Corp banks and Cap goods), and defensives (IT services). On the other hand, we are underweight on discretionary (Auto) and Telecom (competition worries linger),"" Emkay report added.
Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd rose 3.2% to  ₹334.30 after its average monthly revenue per user (Arpu) from India mobile services rose to  ₹129 in the June quarter from  ₹123 in the preceding three months.

288,2019-08-02,Airtel,"The company started the process last month, when it wound down the 3G network in the Kolkata circleAirtel will shut down 6-7 circles by September and the entire pan-India network by March

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel will shut down its 3G network across India’s 22 telecom circles by March 2020, and increase its focus on providing 4G services, a top company official said.
The company started the process last month, when it wound down the 3G network in the Kolkata circle. It, however, continues to provide 2G services for feature phone users.
“This has worked very well in Kolkata. Now we will do this process across India. By September, we will shut down six to seven circles and by March, the entire 3G network pan-India will shut down,"" Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said in the post-earnings call with analysts on Friday.
This marks the first phase-out of the 3G technology in India, which is now increasingly moving to 4G, triggered by the entry of 4G-only Reliance Jio in September 2016. Rival Vodafone Idea continues to provide 2G, 3G and 4G services.
In Kolkata, Airtel has reformed the 900MHz spectrum band, used for 3G, to strengthen its 4G network. The telecom operator is deploying L900 technology in the 900MHz band to complement its 4G services in the 2300MHz and 1800MHz bands.
The move, Airtel expects, will improve 4G availability inside buildings and coverage across homes in Kolkata.
However, the company does not expect much cost savings by shutting down 3G as it would continue to use the same equipment to offer 4G services. “Our capex will continue for deployment of new sites and some loading on 2300MHz band,"" Vittal said.
On Thursday, Airtel Ltd posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio. Airtel swung to a  ₹2,866 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 June from net profits of  ₹97 crore in the year earlier, as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore.
However, its consolidated revenue from operations grew 4.7% to  ₹20,738 crore in the June quarter from  ₹19,799 crore a year ago. Revenue from its Indian wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore. Airtel’s consolidated net debt was  ₹1.16 trillion as of June-end.

287,2019-08-03,Airtel,"Airtel’s big focus now is to engage customers more on its network and drive data usageBharti Airtel is growing its India revenue and improving its quality of subscriber base

New Delhi: Earlier this month, Reliance Jio dethroned Bharti Airtel as the number two operator in terms of subscriber base. Jio has also became the number one operator by revenue in less than three years of operations, surpassing Vodafone Idea in the June quarter.
The turmoil in the telecom sector caused by Jio’s rock-bottom data tariffs and free voice calls, introduced in September 2016, has reshaped the Indian telecom market, leaving just two other private operators – the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, and Bharti Airtel – to compete with it.
Analysts fear Vodafone Idea could be reduced to a regional operator given its mounting losses and shrinking revenue stream.
But Bharti Airtel, at the same time, is growing its India revenue and improving its quality of subscriber base.
Airtel reported a net loss of  ₹2,866 crore in the April-June quarter, its first in 14 years, but that was largely the result of a one-time exceptional expenditure. Airtel’s revenue from India wireless business grew 4.1% year-on-year to  ₹10,724 crore and customer churn was low.
In comparison, Vodafone Idea posted a net loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore, while its revenue fell 4.3% from the preceding quarter to  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter.
Airtel has now sharpened its focus and is aiming for quality and not quantity of subscribers.
To upgrade users to 4G, and drive data usage it also plans to shut down its 3G network across India by March.
In fact, Airtel’s data consumption per user surpassed Jio for the second consecutive quarter. In the three months ended June, Airtel’s average data usage per month was 11.9 GB compared with Jio’s 11.4 GB.
By ensuring stickiness for better paying users on the network, Airtel has managed to post the highest average revenue per user across the three telcos at  ₹129, beating Jio at  ₹122 and Vodafone Idea at  ₹108. Average revenue per user is the total revenue of the operator divided by its subscriber base.
“We are happy to lose subscribers who don’t pay us money,"" Bharti Airtel CEO Gopal Vittal said in the post-earnings call with analysts on Friday.
To wean away inactive users from its network, the company had in November rolled out minimum monthly recharge plans starting  ₹35. As a result, there was some customer churn but its average revenue per user also rose.
Airtel’s big focus now is to engage customers more on its network and drive data usage.
In May this year, created a loyalty programme for its prepaid users called Airtel Thanks, similar to what airlines offer to flyers, under which subscribers can reap benefits based on their tariff plans and consumption of digital services on the Airtel network.
Airtel expects to achieve twin objectives of increasing its average revenue per user, which has been under pressure after Jio’s entry in September 2016, while getting them to avail more services as the telecom major embarks on its journey to morph into a digital platform.
This loyalty scheme will be refreshed in the next three months. Airtel has, however, not divulged the details on this.
Despite all these positives, the company continues to maintain that industry tariffs are unsustainably low and prices need to move up to ensure sector viability.
But for that to happen, it has to pray that rival Jio does not get too greedy."

Reliance Jio's aggressive posturing has begun to show the divergent impact on entrenched telcos, with Vodafone Idea getting impacted sharply and Bharti Airtel holding on, a report said on Monday.
The deep-pocketed Jio's entry has so far impacted all the telcos, forcing mergers and also bankruptcy filings.
For Vodafone Idea, it was the market share loss to Jio which proved to be the undoing and led to a weak numbers for the June quarter, Airtel could hold on, global rating agency Fitch said in a note.
The agency also estimated that Airtel, which has now begun the third biggest telco after Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, to show operating profit growth in India this year on improvements in average revenue per user (ARPU), easing competition and cost savings.
It said Airtel's operating profit grew 7% during the June quarter as compared to the three months ending March on an ARPU growth and shift of more consumers to the 4G network.
Vodafone Idea's revenue slipped 4 per cent and operating profit was down 22 per cent during the same period, as it lost 14 million subscribers, it said.
In comparison, Jio posted revenue growth of 44 per cent and 37 per cent growth in operating profit, it said.
Internet experience is the key aspect which is influencing customers and not tariff where no differentials exist, it said, adding that Bharti and Vodafone-Idea are improving their 4G coverage.
Going forward, Telcos are likely to monetise their tower and fibre assets to deleverage and create financial flexibility, it said in the note that comes days after Jio announced a  ₹25,000 crore deal to sell tower assets to Brookfield.

285,2019-08-07,Airtel,"DoT will subsidize operating costs for five years, after which, the infrastructure will be handed over to the operatorSo far, the government was dependent on state-run operator BSNL to reach these unconnected villages

NEW DELHI :
Every Indian village without mobile connectivity is likely to get connections in a year from now, if a new incentive model devised by the department of telecommunications (DoT) works out.
Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have teamed up with DoT to reach the last 43,000 villages without cellular services, Cellular Operators Association of India director general Rajan Mathews said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants these villages connected within a year, Mathews said, along the lines of the last-mile connectivity achieved for cooking gas and electricity supply.
“Telcos didn’t go there earlier because the commercials don’t work. DoT is now coming up with a model where they will give 100% subsidy (for capital expenditure). Basically, the government will pay for it and telcos will set up the network and operate it,"" Mathews added.
“The (DoT’s) intention is to also subsidize (network) operating costs for five years,"" he said. After this period, the infrastructure will be handed over to the operator.
Under the model, the government will divide these 43,000 villages into three categories—easy-to-cover, medium difficulty, and hard-to-cover. After this, it will form pools comprising villages from each of these three categories. Telcos will then bid for these pools and will not be allowed to disaggregate the villages from the pools.
Whichever telco bids the lowest amount to provide connectivity to these pools will win the bid. The government is working on other modalities, including the total size of the project.
An email query to DoT did not elicit any response till press time.
So far, the government was dependent on state-run operator BSNL to reach these unconnected villages.
According to data from DoT, Odisha had 9,940 villages without mobile services, Maharashtra 6,117 and Madhya Pradesh 5,558. Other villages lacking mobile services are located in border areas, islands and the north-eastern states.
The fresh focus on connecting the villages comes after telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad met top officials of telcos last month and assured them of the government’s full support on outstanding issues, such as cut in levies and refunds, apart from asking the industry to reach all villages within a year.
According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, as of May end, rural tele-density was 56.42. Teledensity is the number of telephone connections for every hundred individuals living in an area.
There were 505.59 million rural wireless subscribers in the country as of May end. The share of rural wireless subscribers in the overall wireless user base is 43.52%.
Interestingly, the national digital communications policy, approved by the Cabinet in September 2018, had set a goal to provide universal broadband coverage, deploy five million public Wi-Fi hot spots by 2020, and 10 million by 2022 through a National Broadband Mission, apart from implementing a “Fibre First Initiative"" to take fibre to the home.
In February, DoT announced plans to monetize fibre assets built by the government under its flagship mission BharatNet by leasing the assets for a 20-year period after a bidding process. This comes against the backdrop of concerns over poor utilization of digital infrastructure that has been created across more than 100,000 gram panchayats in the country."

Dish TV, Airtel Digital TV merger announcement likely by month end
Bharti Airtel’s direct-to-home (DTH) arm Airtel Digital TV, private equity firm Warburg Pincus and Essel Group-owned Dish TV have reached an agreement on merging the two businesses and a formal announcement is expected in four-six weeks, The Economic Times reported citing two people with direct knowledge of the development. With the partial stake sale in Essel Group-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) having been decided, the promoters are focused on completing Dish TV’s merger with Airtel Digital TV. The Essel Group’s promoters are selling assets to repay debt. They own a 57.52% stake in Dish TV— almost 95% of this is pledged with lenders. The three options being discussed are—an overall merger, a revenue merger and a deal that involves part cash, part merger. Together, Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV will create the world’s largest TV distribution company with close to 40 million subscribers and over 62% share of India’s DTH market."

New Delhi: The pricing scale and style of Reliance Jio's fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) services, Jio Fiber, will expand the market and increase the scope for all operators to grow, including Airtel, since the home broadband penetration in India is well below 10 per cent, according to analysts.
""We believe that Jio's FTTH  ₹700 price point is comparable to Bharti's broadband average revenue per user (ARPU) of  ₹825. Jio's launch is going to expand the home broadband market which will be beneficial for Bharti as well. Home broadband penetration is well below 10 per cent in India where addressable homes are around 240-250 million"", Fitch Ratings Director Nitin Soni told IANS.
Soni did not specifically say Jio would prevail over other players and stand-alone operators in the FTTH segment.
In its 42nd annual general meeting on Monday, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) announced the launch of its much-awaited Jio Fiber services. The Jio Fiber base plans will start at 100 Mbps, and can go up to 1 Gbps, with prices ranging from  ₹700 to  ₹10,000 depending on usage.
Customers opting for the Jio Forever plan in Jio Fiber will also get an HD 4K LED TV and a 4K set-top box free.
Additionally, Jio Fiber subscribers will be able to make voice calls from home to any Indian telecom network for free. The international calling tariffs will also be lower.
Jio Fiber will also include subscriptions to several top premium OTT applications. JioFiber's commercial rollout will begin on September 5, 2019.
On a comparative basis, the biggest competitor of Jio Fiber in the Indian market is Bharti Airtel with its Airtel V-Fiber broadband service that too offers lightning-fast speeds of up to 100 Mbps. In Delhi,
Airtel's monthly plans start from  ₹799 with internet speeds of up to 40 Mbps and 100GB broadband data. The 100 Mbps plan is priced at  ₹1,099 per month with 300GB broadband data. The company also has  ₹1,599 and  ₹1,999 plan with speeds up to 300 Mbps and 100 Mbps respectively. The  ₹1,999 plan does not come with a data limit.
State-owned BSNL also offers a wide range of plan on its Broadband Internet Service on Bharat Fiber (FTTH). BSNL's Bharat Fiber plans start from  ₹777 to  ₹16,999 per month. The cheapest  ₹777 plan brings up to 50 Mbps speeds till 500 GB and the speed is throttled to 2 Mbps beyond the data limit.
The 100 Mbps plan starts from  ₹1,277 and comes with a data limit of 750GB.

Over 88% of shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM) held on August 14 voted in favour of the special resolution for waiver of recovery of excess managerial remuneration paid to Mittal during FY19, while 11.7% voted against it.
""Therefore the resolution...has been approved with requisite majority,"" it added.
However, when seen category-wise, all of promoter group votes were cast in favour of the proposal, although within the public institutions category only 52 per cent of voters supported the proposal.
In the public non-institutions category 99.9 per cent were in favour of the proposal.
A similar proposal for Vittal received overall 88.6 per cent total votes in favour, and 11.3 per cent votes against it.
Public institutions category, in this case, had 58 per cent votes in favour and 41.9 per cent votes against the motion.
In July, the company in a filing, outlining the agenda for the AGM, had informed that Mittal's remuneration in 2018-19 was  ₹21.19 crore more than prescribed limits under the Companies Act.
However, the remuneration was within the limits as approved by shareholders on August 19, 2016.
Accordingly, Bharti Airtel had sought the approval for the proposal, and other items, at its AGM scheduled on August 14.
Total remuneration paid to Mittal was about  ₹31 crore, while Vittal was paid  ₹20.9 crore against the ceiling of around  ₹9.8 crore and  ₹12 crore, respectively, for 2018-19.
Bharti Airtel's revenue and profit have been eroding due to a fierce tariff war after the launch of services by Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio.
Shareholders at the company's 24th AGM have also approved a proposal - with 87.7 per cent votes in favour - for payment of remuneration to Mittal for the period April 2019 to September 2021.
It had proposed that such remuneration, would be ""minimum remuneration in case the company has no profits or the profits of the company are inadequate during period commencing from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2021 or for such shorter period as may be prescribed under applicable laws...""

New Delhi: Reliance Jio has added over over 82.6 lakh subscribers in the month of June, Vodafone Idea shed 41.45 lakh subscribers, and Bharti Airtel 29,883 customers, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). The number of telephone subscribers in India increased from 1,183.15 million at the end of May'19 to 1,186.63 million at the end of June'19, thereby showing a monthly growth rate of 0.29%, Trai data showed.
The urban subscription increased from 674.66 million at the end of May'19 to 675.58 million at the end of June'19 and the rural subscription also increased from 508.49 million to 511.05 million during the same period. The monthly growth rates of urban and rural subscription were 0.14% and 0.50% respectively during the month of June'19, the data showed.
Trai data showed that Jio gained 82.68 lakh customers in June, higher than 81.80 lakh additions it had notched in May. State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) continued to gain subscribers in June as well. BSNL, which was the only mobile operator apart from Jio to add customers, gained 2.66 lakh users during June.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have seen their subscriber base erode in the past months. These two operators have been locked in a bruising tariff war following the entry of Reliance Jio, backed by India's richest man Mukesh Ambani.
Jio shook the mobile telephony market with free voice calls and dirt cheap data in 2016, and within three years became the largest telecom player in the market by revenue.
It is now hoping to repeat the feat in fixed line broadband space and has recently announced 'Jio Fiber'. The subscription to Jio Fiber will start at  ₹700 a month. This is the base plan that offers 100Mbps data speed. The top-end plan for 'power users' is priced at  ₹10,000 that offers unlimited data at speeds of 1Gbps.

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel, is staying strong and growing and has a robust balance sheet, said broking house Goldman Sachs.
Airtel has a robust balance sheet, and a ""best-in-class"" spectrum footprint position which favours Bharti Airtel for future network roll-outs and market share gains. With declining capex intensity and rising margins on stable revenue growth, we expect Bharti to be FCF (Free Cash Flow) positive in financial year 2020-21, Goldman Sachs said in a report.
The report said the telecom operator has a strong wireless business growth potential.
""We forecast a 30% EBITDA growth CAGR for India wireless (46% of FY19E revenue) in FY19-22E driven by market share gains, customer upgrades/better customer monetization in data, and tariff hikes. With a recovery in India wireless, steady growth in Africa, and stable non-wireless businesses, we forecast Bharti to deliver an 8 to 18% revenue/EBITDA CAGR in FY19-22E"", it said.
The broking house also said the telco has solid growth outlook for Africa. ""We forecast a 9 to 11% revenue/EBITDA CAGR in FY19-22E for Bharti's Africa business (24% of FY19E revenue) driven by data and mobile money.""
""Its valuation is at t 8.5x CY20E EV/EBITDA, Bharti trades higher than its own historical average (of 7.3x) and its Asian telco peer median (of 7.1x). However, we expect Bharti's EBITDA growth over the next two-to-three years to be more than 3x its Asian telco peers and view a higher multiple as justified; Bharti trades in line with Asian peers on CY21 EV/EBITDA.
""Our 12-month Discounted Cash Flow-based Trading Price of  ₹415 implies 15% upside; our bull/bear scenarios suggest 40% upside vs. 13% downside."""

New Delhi: Broadband speed measurement firm Ookla on Thursday said it has found Bharti Airtel to be the fastest mobile broadband network, while speed on Reliance Jio network was the slowest in July.
The report, compiled based on Speedtest Intelligence data collected by Ookla between August 2018 and July 2019, shows mobile broadband speed on the Vodafone Idea network has gradually improved.
""Speedtest results show that mobile download speeds in India improved on average for all the top mobile operators over the period of August 2018 - July 2019, with Airtel holding the title of fastest operator throughout these 12 months,"" the report said.
The report is in contrast to data published by telecom regulator Trai.
The data compiled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India shows Reliance Jio has consistently maintained lead throughout the year in mobile broadband speed with more than double the speed of its nearest rival.
Ookla has measured broadband performance of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea Cellular and Reliance Jio in the study.
According to the Speedtest Intelligence data, mobile download speeds for both Airtel and Jio started a decline after May 2019 and continued through July 2019.
Meanwhile, Vodafone saw a decline in mean mobile speed from November 2018 through January 2019, after which they recovered and showed a year-on-year improvement of 23.6 per cent, according to the report.
""Mobile download speeds on Idea improved in every month except December 2018, for a year-over-year improvement of 51.2 per cent. In comparison, Airtel's download speed increased 7.7 per cent during the same period and Jio's download speed went up 10.8 per cent,"" the report said.

276,2019-08-24,Airtel,"The battle is between the country’s mobile operators and the department of telecommunicationsThe battle started when telcos migrated to new system offered by the government in 1999

The final verdict of a 14-year-old legal battle between the country’s mobile operators and the department of telecommunications over the definition of ‘adjusted gross revenue’ is near and may deal blow to debt-laden operators such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea which are already battling shrinking revenue streams.
AGR is the basis on which department of telecommunications (DoT) calculates levies payable by operators and then it has been a bone of contention in the sector. Telecom operators are liable to pay around 3-5% and 8% of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT.
The matter has been under litigation for 14 years with operators arguing that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisting that AGR should include all revenue earned by an operator, including that from non-core telecom operations.
The battle started when telcos migrated to new system offered by the government in 1999 under which operators agreed to share certain percentage of revenue with the government.
The case has seen multiple judgments by telecom tribunals and the final hearing by the Supreme Court was held on 1 August, 2019. The final order is expected soon.
“We expect final verdict to come for AGR case while there has been some judgment on one-time spectrum charges, which may create certain payment liabilities for these telcos. We understand companies have not created any provisions against these liabilities, and any payments, if arise (though should be much lower compared to government claims), will put an additional strain on their already stretched balance sheets,"" ICICI Securities said in a note dated 22 August.
If the government wins the case, then Bharti Airtel will have to cough up  ₹21,682 crore and Vodafone idea will have to pay  ₹28,308 crore. For Jio the amount will be just  ₹13 crore as it entered the sector only three years ago. This amount includes interest, penalty and interest on penalty ballooning liabilities.
If telcos, who had secured a favourable verdict in the telecom tribunal, lose the case in the Supreme Court, it would mean a body blow for them as they are already engaged in a tariff war with Reliance Jio which has squeezed their margins.
Bharti Airtel Ltd posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years in the June quarter at  ₹2,866 crore compared to a net profit of  ₹97 crore in the year earlier as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore. Vodafone Idea posted net loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter. In comparison, Jio posted a profit of  ₹891 crore.
“While TDSAT order reduces significant risk of payment by the operators, they will still need to make some payments. And if the Supreme Court order is extended to other telcos as well, they will be required to provide bank guarantees towards one-time spectrum charges,"" ICICI Securities said.
Back in 2005, telecom industry body Cellular Operators Association of India had challenged the definition of the AGR and certain components included in the AGR as being contrary to Telegraph Act and the recommendations made by the TRAI.
COAI has alleged that DoT unilaterally changed the earlier understanding of the definition of revenue share to include the revenue received by the licensees from their non-licensed activity.
The industry body also contends that under the telecom licence issued to the licensees, there is no prohibition on the licensees from doing other business or from making investments on non-telecom business and the income, interest or dividend received from such investments cannot be added to the gross revenue of the licensed activities so as to claim a revenue share from those revenues of the licensee by DoT."

NEW DELHI :
India’s youngest and only profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio is now also the number one operator by revenue market share with 31.7% share of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) that the industry recorded in the April-June period.
Airtel came a close second with 30% market share and Vodafone Idea Ltd was third with 28.1% share, data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India released on Tuesday and analysed by brokerage ICICI Securities showed.
“RJio AGR (including National Long Distance calls) rose 9% year on year to  ₹109 billion, and finally became the No. 1 operator,"" the brokerage said in a note dated 27 August.
Mint had on 31 July reported that Jio would be crowned as number one operator in terms of revenue in the June quarter.
With this, India’s richest man Mukesh Ambani has achieved a rare feat with his telecom company grabbing the top spot in the market in less than three years of starting operations.
Jio entered the telecom sector in September 2016 with cheap data plans and affordable handsets, which led to an unprecedented rise in mobile data consumption in the country, with an average user consuming 11 GB data per month.
Bharti’s AGR (including National Long Distance calls) was at  ₹103 billion, up 5.9% from December quarter. Vodafone Idea’s AGR (including National Long Distance calls) stood at  ₹96 billion.
Last month, Jio overtook rival Bharti Airtel to become the country’s second largest operator in terms of mobile phone subscribers. According to data from TRAI released last month, Jio had 322.98 million users and 27.8% subscriber market share, against Airtel’s 320.38 million users and 27.6% market share as of end-May.
While the telecom industry also witnessed intense disruption, shrinking revenue streams, bankruptcy and, finally, consolidation, the last three years have been monumental as 4G coverage soared and became a catalyst for the growth of mobile data and new applications and services, especially in the content ecosystem.
Jio’s present subscriber base is 331.3 million subscribers, according to its April-June financial results announced last month when it reported a profit of  ₹8.91 billion, up 45.6% year on year and an operating revenue of  ₹116.79 billion rupees, up 44% on year.
Despite more subscribers, Vodafone Idea, which posted revenue of  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter, lagged behind Reliance Jio’s  ₹11,679 crore.
“In eight leadership circles, Vodafone Idea’s AGR dipped 4.6% QoQ to  ₹45 billion and five established circles were down 7.3% QoQ to  ₹13.9 billion,"" the brokerage said."
273,2019-08-28,Airtel,"In June quarter, Voda Idea was the only firm to post a sequential decline in revenues; Airtel and Jio reported notable gainsThe drop in Vodafone Idea’s market share and operating performance comes at a time when its balance sheet is fast deteriorating

Vodafone Idea Ltd may be India’s largest telecom company by subscriber base, but it also happens to be the smallest in terms of revenue market share among private sector operators.
In the June quarter, Vodafone Idea was the only company to post a sequential decline in revenues, while competitors Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd reported notable expansion. This is based on quarterly revenue data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) compiled by SBICAP Securities Ltd.
Based on adjusted gross revenues, including receipts from long- distance services, Vodafone Idea’s market share dropped from 32.1% in the quarter ended March 2019 to 27.8% last quarter. Two years ago, the combined market share of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular stood at 42.5%.
SBICAP Securities estimates Vodafone Idea’s revenue market share to stabilize at around 20% in the medium term, with Reliance Jio seeing further gains by the end of FY20. At the end of the June quarter, Reliance Jio’s revenue market share stood at 31.5%.
While Bharti Airtel’s market share was similar, according to Trai numbers, analysts said Jio achieved clear market leadership in the June quarter. Airtel’s numbers reported to Trai may need some adjustments, they added.
What’s more, the hit from the reduction in interconnection usage charges to zero in a few months will make things worse for the incumbents.
The drop in Vodafone Idea’s market share and operating performance comes at a time when its balance sheet is fast deteriorating. An analysis of its debt and repayment schedules, based on the latest annual report by Kotak Institutional Equities, shows that the company may fall short of funds in about a year from now.
“Our analysis of Vodafone Idea’s debt and deferred spectrum repayment schedules, basis the company’s FY2019 annual report, suggests a need for another round of equity infusion as early as 2Q/3QFY21E unless—(a) there is a quick and steep recovery in ARPU or (b) fiber sale closes and fetches upwards of  ₹10,000 crore or (c) some of the debt due for repayment is refinanced or (d) capex credit increases by a sum materially higher than the  ₹6,000 crore we assume in our math,"" analysts at Kotak said in a note to clients. ARPU is average revenue per user.
Of course, asset sales can take Vodafone Idea only so far. What is required is revenue and market share stabilization, but the trajectories have been disappointing till now. With Reliance Jio armed with more resources after its recent deleveraging moves, analysts are worried that it is unlikely to relent on tariffs."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm has crossed the 100-million customer mark across its operations in the continent, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.
This is significant for the company, which entered the continent in 2010. Airtel Africa is currently the second-largest mobile operator in Africa by the number of active subscribers; South Africa’s MTN is the largest.
“The positive momentum we have seen in customer acquisition further underpins our medium-term aspirations for revenue and profit growth,"" Raghunath Mandava, Airtel Africa’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.
Airtel Africa is the holding firm for Bharti Airtel’s operations in 14 countries in the continent across three regions — Nigeria; East Africa, comprising Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia; and the rest of Africa, including Niger, Gabon, Chad, Congo Brazzaville, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar and Seychelles. Nigeria alone accounts for almost half of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda).

Airtel established its presence in Africa in 2010 when it bought Kuwait-based Zain’s Africa operations for $10.7 billion. Over the past few years, it has been trying to expand in Africa through local acquisitions.
Africa has also proved to be a beacon of hope for the company, currently faced with a struggling India business, which is battling a tariff war waged by Reliance Jio’s entry in September 2016.
Bharti Airtel’s Africa arm posted a revenue of $795.9 million in the June quarter, up 6.9% year-on-year, from $744.5 million, largely driven by double-digit growth in Nigeria and East Africa, and partially offset by a decline in revenue in the rest of Africa.
Airtel Africa posted a net profit of $132.2 million in the June quarter, a decrease of 12.2% against the previous year, as higher finance costs and lower gains on exceptional items offset its growth in operating profit. The June-quarter results were the company’s first financial results after it raised $750 million in June through its initial public offering (IPO). The shares were then priced at 80 pence per share, giving it a market capitalization of around $3.9 billion.
Its average revenue per user was $2.7 in the June quarter. Airtel Africa’s Ebitda rose 9.7% year-on-year to $347.6 million in the June quarter, from $316.9 million in the previous year.
The company’s revenue from data services grew to $207.1 million in the quarter, from $156.6 million a year ago, while voice revenue was flat at $469.9 million."

New Delhi: Indian telecom major Airtel announced the launch of Airtel Xstream which offers live TV, video, music, news and sports using an over-the-top (OTT) smart stick as well as an Internet-enabled set top box. The move comes just ahead of Jio Fiber’s commercial rollout.
The set top box (STB) comes with an in-built Chromecast. It is being seen as a direct competitor to Reliance Jio's hybrid set top box which is expected to offer over the counter (OTT) content like Netflix, Hotstar and more along with Internet services.
The Airtel Xstream Box is priced at  ₹3,999 and it will offer a complimentary year’s subscription to all Airtel Xstream app content. The year package starts at  ₹999. It also comes with a month’s subscription to an HD DTH pack. Existing Airtel Digital TV customers can upgrade to Airtel Xstream Box by paying  ₹2,249. The Xstream stick is available at a price of  ₹3,999.
With all the content on one platform, Airtel Xstream will bring entertainment catalogues - hundreds of satellite TV channels, thousands of movies and shows in English, Hindi and multiple Indian languages, millions of songs, plus access to all the popular OTT entertainment apps on one platform, Airtel said at the event. Thanks to this, Airtel customers will receive access to content across the device of their choice—be it TV, PC or smartphone—along with a unified user interface.

NEW DELHI :
In an effort to address India’s television and video streaming audience growing parallel to each other, telecommunications company Bharti Airtel has launched a converged digital entertainment platform, Xstream.
The new service will play out in three formats. First, there is the Airtel Xstream app which is a revamped version of the Airtel TV app offering a new user interface and a content catalogue with around 400 live TV channels, 10,000 movies and shows from streaming services like Netflix, Amazon, ZEE5, HOOQ, Eros Now, HungamaPlay and others.
Second is the Airtel Xstream stick, priced at  ₹3,999, an Android-based OTT (over-the-top) stick that also provides access to Airtel’s movie roster and OTT library, in addition Airtel’s Wynk Music’s catalogue. Airtel Thanks Platinum and Gold customers get complimentary access to the content subscription plan on the Airtel Xstream stick. All other customers get free access to the content for the first 30 days and will need to subscribe to a  ₹999 annual plan for the catalogue to be available to them.
Then comes the Airtel Xstream box that is equipped with around 500 TV channels as well as the telco’s OTT library. Also priced at  ₹3,999, it comes with a voice control enabled remote and hot keys for Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and YouTube. The box offers a complimentary one-year subscription (worth  ₹999) to all Airtel Xstream app content in addition to a one-month subscription to an HD DTH pack. Existing Airtel Digital TV customers can upgrade to the Airtel Xstream box for  ₹2,249.
The firestick and box will be available on e-commerce sites like Flipkart and Amazon, besides all Airtel stores, the company’s website and retail chains like Chroma and Vijay Sales.
To be sure, the Airtel strategy to capture the country’s growing television and digital audience in one go isn’t entirely new. Amazon already has the Amazon Fire TV Stick which is a media player that plugs into an HDTV and lets customers access Prime Video, Netflix, Hotstar and other content that it comes pre-loaded with. Direct-to-home service Tata Sky is also making its content available online through its own subscription based service called Binge.
“While the US is already familiar with the phenomenon of cord-cutting, India is a unique and diverse market in the sense that people are still watching content across platforms, on the move and at home,"" said Adarsh Nair, chief product officer, Bharti Airtel. According to the KPMG media and entertainment industry report 2019, while digital media grew at a rate of 43.4% in FY19 to reach  ₹173 billion, the TV segment also rose by 9.5% to touch  ₹714 billion. Airtel says the immediate target for Xstream is urban India but it should eventually penetrate all of the country.
“This is a new beginning for our entertainment product strategy. As we enter the era of 5G, this not just seems like a sensible decision for the market but good preparation for the future as well,"" said Sunil Taldar, CEO and director, Airtel DTH."

New Delhi: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio on Thursday announced the launch of its fibre-based broadband service, offering minimum internet speed of 100 Mbps for  ₹699 a month, a rate 35-45% lower than rivals, as it looked to repeat the disruption caused in the telecom sector three years back.
JioFiber will offer free voice calling anywhere in the country, unlimited data and video conferencing, the company said in a statement.
Annual subscribers will get 4K set top box, for streaming TV channels, free while a 4K television set would be complimentary with plans with higher payouts such as 'Gold' and above.
The company announced complimentary high definition set-top box and an advance modem Jio Home Gateway, zero-latency gaming and device security of up to five devices in all the plans priced between between  ₹699 to  ₹8,499 per month.
""For Gaming, Device Security, Home Networking, VR Experience, Video Content services, provided by RCITPL (a platform service company) and TV Video Calling & Conferencing, subscribers need to purchase compatible devices,"" Jio said.
Jio is offering complementary television sets to annual subscribers of broadband plans in the range of  ₹2,499 to  ₹8,499. The company is also offering television set on two-year subscription of gold plan priced at  ₹1,299 per month.
""The launch of JioFiber, with its revolutionary services is just the beginning of a new and exciting journey. As always, we will continue working hard to bring more such amazing services to your home and take Jio Fiber to the next level. I want to specially thank our 5 lakh JioFiber Preview users, who have contributed significantly in perfecting our product and service experience,"" Akash Ambani, Director, Reliance Jio Infocomm, said.
The company has announced launch of the service across 1,600 cities.
Reliance Jio, Mukesh Ambani's vehicle for re-entry into the telecom space, had three years back begun mobile services, offering free voice calling and data. That got millions hooked on to his network which started charging for internet data usages from April 1, 2017, while voice calls continue to remain free.
Jio's  ₹3.5 lakh crore investment in 4G telecom services coupled with aggressive pricing had unleashed intense competition in the market that forced rivals to either fold up or merge to better compete with it.
""Currently, the average fixed-line broadband speed in India is 25 Mbps. Even in America, which is the most developed economy, it is around 90 Mbps. JioFiber, India's first 100% all-fiber broadband service, will start from 100 Mbps and go all the way up to 1 Gbps. This will propel India to top 5 broadband nations globally,"" the statement said.
JioFiber customers subscribing to  ₹699 plan will get three-month complimentary access Jio Cinema and Jio Saavn app and  ₹849 plan subscriber will get three-month access to video entertainment apps. Subscriber of higher plan will get access to annual subscription of leading video entertainment apps bundled in their plans, according to the statement.
Customers opting for JioFiber will need to pay  ₹1,000 installation charges and  ₹1,500 refundable fee.

NEW DELHI :
Home broadband operators, who had so far relied on selling internet connections by pulling the duct till your home, are now eyeing a bigger slice of the pie by morphing into integrated content and services platforms with consumers demanding more value for their money.
These operators believe that this can help them increase customer stickiness through offerings such as gaming and smart home experiences. The home broadband operators could provide these through partnerships and by ultimately becoming an integrated platform to meet the digital needs of consumers.
Bala Malladi, chief executive officer of Atria Convergence Technologies Ltd (ACT), says: “We are not the masters of the universe when it comes to content. We can, however, become a one-stop shop for you and deliver content through partnerships. If you subscribe to Netflix through us, you will get a discounted price. We also have a lot of events planned around the gaming community, which is a loyal customer base for us.""
ACT, India’s second-largest private wired broadband firm after Bharti Airtel, offers high-speed internet in 19 cities, most of which are in south India. The company is slowly expanding into cities such as Jaipur and Lucknow.
ACT Fibernet launched the ‘ACT Stream TV 4K’ across top metros in August to offer consumers movies, TV shows, sports, music videos, and live TV from existing on-demand streaming providers and TV channels. Customers can pay for their subscription directly as part of the ACT Fibernet monthly bill.
This strategy mirrors the events in the mobile services space when Jio entered three years ago. At that time, mobile operators were selling vanilla offerings of data and voice calls. However, they now offer mobile data tariff and content as a bundle.
To Jio’s credit, the wired broadband space is also seeing this change. Reliance Jio formally launched its wired broadband offering, JioFiber, last week. Starting with a basic monthly plan of  ₹699 for 100GB, and an additional 50GB of promotional data, at 100mbps speed, customers can enjoy free voice calls and video conferencing through a compatible TV, besides high-speed gaming and content sharing across the home network. Premium JioFiber customers can enjoy immersive shopping through wearable headsets and even view first-day-first shows of certain movies in their homes. All plans will enable gaming, with your smartphone doubling up as a game controller.
A few days before JioFiber’s launch, rival Bharti Airtel also announced a converged digital entertainment platform, Xstream. Airtel Xstream, priced at  ₹3,999, is an Android-based over-the-top (OTT) stick that also provides access to Airtel’s movie roster, OTT library, and Airtel’s Wynk Music’s catalogue.
“The US is already familiar with the phenomenon of cord-cutting, while India is a unique and diverse market in the sense that people are still watching content across platforms, on the move and at home,"" Adarsh Nair, chief product officer, Bharti Airtel, had said last week.
Airtel says the immediate target for Xstream is urban India but it should eventually penetrate all of the country. ACT also believes that there is a lot of room to grow.
“The current level of penetration of wired broadband in the country is just 7%. There is significant room to expand and grow the market,"" Malladi said.

NEW DELHI :
The bitter rivalry in mobile services between Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel, now in its third year, has spilled over to the home broadband segment, as the two companies battle for leadership in revenue and market share.
Airtel on Wednesday launched its ultra-high speed Airtel Xstream Fibre broadband service, matching the price of JioFiber’s top-end plan launched a week ago.
For  ₹3,999 a month, top JioFiber users will get 2,500GB of data at a speed of 1Gbps, while Xstream Fibre users will get 3,333GB at the same speed.
Airtel said this plan will come bundled with unlimited landline calls and some content freebies, such as three months’ Netflix subscription, one year Amazon Prime membership, and access to content from ZEE5 and the Airtel Xstream app.
Airtel Xstream Fibre will initially be available in Delhi, Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida, Ghaziabad, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Chandigarh, Kolkata, Indore, Jaipur, and Ahmedabad. It will be rolled out in more markets in the next few months. The company plans to focus on the top 100 cities for home broadband.
Jio, on the other hand, plans to reach 1,600 cities in the country through JioFiber. Its basic monthly plan of  ₹699 will offer consumers 100GB of data, with an additional 50GB of promotional data, at 100Mbps speed, free voice calls and video conferencing through a compatible TV, and high-speed gaming and content sharing across the home network.
“Home broadband is a very different space compared to wireless broadband as the entry barriers are high and it is expensive and time consuming to deploy fibre. While Airtel and Jio are the big players, a chunk of the penetration in this market is driven by local cable operators who double up as broadband providers. It will take a fairly long time to reach the same penetration level as wireless broadband,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India said.
Airtel’s basic plan for  ₹799 offers 100GB internet at up to 40Mbps speed.

261,2019-09-18,Airtel,"Interconnect usage cost is levied by networks handling incoming calls from rival networksScrapping IUC or reducing it would help operators with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls

NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is having a rethink two years after it decided to phase out interconnect usage charges (IUC) from January 2020.
The regulator on Wednesday floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic. The paper also seeks to discuss with stakeholders what parameters should be looked at to decide on an alternate date, if any.
IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. Scrapping the IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. The latest decision may come as a relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
“At present, there is a net outgo of calls from Jio to incumbents. If this IUC of six paise is retained a bit longer, it will offer incumbents some relief. This relief is due to them (Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea) as these companies acquired customers at a very high cost earlier. To equate them with a new player is unreasonable and to scrap IUC is over-zealous,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to six paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020. Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
Bharti Airtel’s quarterly profit plunged 39% to  ₹306 crore in the three months ended 31 December 2017, while Idea Cellular’s quarterly loss more than tripled to  ₹ 1,285.6 crore in the same quarter. Reliance Jio had at that time gained significantly from the cut in IUC to six paise a minute as it meant lower costs for it.
In September 2017, Trai said it would keep a close watch on developments in the sector, particularly with respect to the adoption of new technologies and their impact on termination costs.
“We are glad that Trai has chosen to review the date for scrapping IUC. The authority had in the 2017 order’s explanatory memorandum said that it would review this,"" said an Airtel executive, requesting anonymity.
“We welcome the consultation paper from Trai for it acknowledges the continuing traffic asymmetry between operators because of popular use of 2G devices. We look forward to participating in this consultation,"" a Vodafone Idea spokesperson said.
Email queries sent to Bharti Airtel and and Reliance Jio remained unanswered till press time.
Zero IUC means operators would make no money for receiving calls on their networks. If the traffic flow among operators is symmetrical, it will not have a negative impact on any operator as it is simply a charge paid from one operator to another.
“Though the imbalance in the inter-operator off-net traffic is reducing over a period, it still exists,"" Trai said in the paper."

5) Airtel Payments Bank offers digital banking services through a network of 5,00,000 neighbourhood banking points spread across India.
What are payment banks?
According to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines for licensing of payments banks, the main objective of a payments bank is to enhance financial inclusion. This is expected to be done by providing small savings accounts. In August 2015, RBI had given in-principle approval to 11 entities to start payments bank in India, which included the department of posts. Airtel Payments Bank was the first one to launch it.
How is it different?
A payments bank is not allowed to give any form of loan or issue a credit card. Even in case of savings accounts, a payments bank has certain restrictions. Customers can open a savings account with deposits of only up to  ₹1 lakh."
259,2019-09-19,Airtel,"The panel will also review the government’s plan to roll out public wifi hotspotsTrai had first sent its suggestions in August last year and stood by its spectrum pricing proposal again in July this year

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC) will meet on Thursday to deliberate on a roadmap to roll out the next generation of wireless technology 5G, and to auction airwaves this year. The panel will also review the government’s plan to roll out public wifi hotspots.
The panel, which comprises officials from the departments of telecommunications, electronics and information technology, revenue and think tank NITI Aayog, will review the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s pending suggestions on conducting the upcoming auctions, India’s first for 5G airwaves.
Trai had first sent its suggestions in August last year and stood by its spectrum pricing proposal again in July this year after the panel urged it to take a relook.
5G will lead to much higher data speeds and propel Internet of Things, which will transform sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and education.
The government did not auction any spectrum in fiscals 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, the government had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965MHz.
Operators which have been complaining of high reserve prices set by Trai are hoping that the panel may decide to lower 5G spectrum prices.
The telecom regulator in July this year said it would stick to its earlier stand on the pricing for next spectrum auctions, as it believes that the auction is an open process and players other than existing licencees could also participate.
This had caused a setback to debt laden telcos which have been clamouring for lower spectrum prices.
The regulator’s response had come after the panel in July sought a comprehensive review of the Trai’s recommendations. The government’s call to review came with an aim to to ensure greater competition, sale of all spectrum on offer, and bringing the benefits of 5G to social sectors.
In August last year, Trai had said the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, should be auctioned as a single band and in blocks of 20MHz each at  ₹492 crore per megahertz.
While Bharti Airtel Ltd has said these prices are exorbitant and it would not participate in an auction held at these prices, Vodafone Idea Ltd suggested the 5G auction take place in 2020. In South Korea, the same band was priced at roughly  ₹131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June last year.
The sector has seen intense disruption after Jio’s entry in September 2016 brought down data prices to rock bottom and made voice calls free. This forced other operators to match tariffs and many shut shop or were acquired by bigger players. Now, just Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are left to compete with Jio."

Shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd surged as much as 16.5%, its biggest jump in one month, after Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) floated consultation paper to postpone scrapping interconnect usage charges (IUC).
So far, the stock touched a high of  ₹5.66 a share and gained as much as 16.46%, its biggest gain since 16 August. At 9.45am, Vodofone Idea stock was trading at  ₹5.36 on the BSE, up 10.29% from its previous close. So far this year the scrip has slumped nearly 77.2%.
Rivals Bharati Airtel Ltd rose 1.9%, while Reliance Industries Ltd gained 0.3%.
The regulator on Wednesday floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic. The paper also seeks to discuss with stakeholders what parameters should be looked at to decide on an alternate date, if any.
Analyst says that the Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea which have higher incoming than outgoing traffic will benefit if TRAI decides to postpone scrapping IUC.
The latest subscriber data, released by TRAI, showed Vodafone Idea leading with 38 crore subscribers, followed by Reliance Jio with 33.98 crore, and Airtel with 32.85 crore users.
However, Vodafone Idea's subscriber base fell 33.91 lakh in July from 38.34 crore users in June. Jio had added 85.3 lakh users in June."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio has the widest 4G network in the country with more than 7.46 lakh 4G base stations, according to Trai data.
Bharti Airtel's 4G coverage is less than half of Reliance Jio's but it has expanded its network more than three-folds since September 2017.
According to the data published by Trai in a consultation paper for reviewing deadline to end mobile call termination charges, Jio's 4G network almost doubled from 3.81 lakh 4G base transceiver stations (BTS) in September 2017 to 7.46 lakh BTS in June 2019.
Airtel's 4G network more than tripled from 97,130 BTS to over 3.26 lakh BTS.
Vodafone Idea holds the highest amount of spectrum that can be used for 4G services, around 1.5 times of Reliance Jio, but its 4G network grew only 62 per cent.
4G base stations now constitute around 60 per cent of the total network, which has grown from 5.91 lakh to 12.55 lakh within a span of two years.
2G network size in the country has now reduced by around 27 per cent to 4.79 lakh BTS from 6.61 lakh BTS in September 2017.
Similarly, 3G base stations have declined to 3.43 lakh in June 2019 from 3.6 lakh in September 2017, according to Trai.

NEW DELHI :
The roadmap for the rollout of 5G technology in India is still under examination and the government will appoint an auctioneer soon as it plans to conduct an auction for the premium airwaves by January, telecom secretary Anshu Prakash said on Thursday.
“By end of this year or by January, we should have the auction (for 5G airwaves),"" said Prakash, the chairperson of the Digital Communications Commission, which comprises officials from the departments of telecommunications, electronics and information technology, and revenue, as well as government think-tank NITI Aayog.
The 5G technology will lead to much higher data speeds and propel Internet of Things, which will transform sectors such as agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, and education.
“We have already started the process of deciding who will conduct the auction. The request for proposal is done, inter-ministerial committees are happening, hopefully very soon we will decide who the auctioneer is and in parallel, we take all these other decisions such as what the reserve prices are. We will take a call on it,"" he said.

The Digital Communications Commission met on Thursday to approve 4G connectivity proposals for uncovered regions and measures to make access to telecom services and smartphones easier for those with disabilities. It has also sent a formal request to the ministry of housing and urban affairs to ensure that telcos are able to improve network coverage inside buildings.
“We will request the ministry of housing and urban affairs to issue guidelines to resident welfare associations (RWAs) to provide access to telcos on a fair, transparent, and non-discriminatory manner. No RWA or any building should enter into any arrangement that results in any exclusive access to any particular telco,"" Prakash said. This may require a relook at unified building bylaws, he said.
The department has also decided to urge telcos to identify customers with disabilities and provide special benefits and suggest mobile manufacturing companies that make more than five phone models to make one model for such persons.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had first sent its suggestions on 5G, in August last year. Trai has priced the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, at  ₹492 crore per megahertz.

257,2019-09-20,Airtel,"With Jio’s market share rising rapidly, there is a view it may soon become a net receiver of IUCOn the other hand, Jefferies' analysts estimate the move will result in an 18% drag on Reliance Jio Infocomm's operating profits

Exactly two years ago, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had slashed the interconnection usage charge (IUC) by more than half to six paise. It had also said that the fee will be abolished from January 2020. This newspaper’s headline then read, ‘Trai lowers IUC, Reliance Jio prevails over Airtel, Idea’.
As it turned out, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s net outgo on IUC fell to  ₹1,082 crore in the December quarter of FY18, when the charge was slashed, from Rs2,140 crore in the preceding quarter. With annualised savings of over  ₹4,200 crore for Jio, it was amply clear who had gained the most from Trai’s change of rules.
Now, Trai appears to have a change of heart, and has asked telecom operators and other stakeholders to give feedback on whether it makes sense to postpone the abolition of IUC.
There is a conspiracy theory that the seeming U-turn in Trai’s thought process will in some way work to the advantage of Jio again. The reasoning given is that Jio is now the market leader and is gaining subscriber market share at a rapid pace every month. As a result, it would soon have more incoming calls into its network, than outgoing calls to other networks. It would then be a net receiver of IUC, which is paid to the operator where the call terminates. Against this backdrop, it makes sense for Jio if IUC was not abolished.
But those arguments are too simplistic. As the chart alongside shows, Jio’s share of outgoing to incoming calls with other operators stood at 85.6% in December 2017, two months after IUC was sshed. In June 2019, it has fallen to only 64.3%. One would have imagined that with the sharp increase in its subscriber base, the asymmetry in voice traffic would have disappeared.
In July, Jio had a subscriber market share of 29.1%, up from 19% in the year-ago period, and higher than Airtel’s 28.1% share. Vodafone Idea had a subscriber share of 32.5% in July. With these companies almost neck-and-neck in terms of their subscriber base, why isn’t Jio’s network receiving as many incoming calls as the number of outgoing calls by its subscribers?
The simple reason is that Jio’s purely 4G network makes little room for subscribers at the lower end of the pyramid, who primarily receive incoming calls. While the incumbents support this set of customers on their 2G networks with low tariff plans, Jio mostly has customers who can make unlimited calls.
Even though Airtel’s 4G reach is now nearly as large as its 2G reach, this relatively poorer set of customers have stayed on the 2G part of its network, given the lower cost of handsets and tariff plans available for this technology. As long as this difference remains in the profile of subscribers, the outgoing to incoming ratio will remain skewed.
Also note that Jio paid out net access charges of Rs851 crore in the June 2019 quarter, not vastly lower than what it had paid soon after the IUC was reduced in 2017. This means the continuation of the IUC regime will hurt it more, and incumbents will naturally gain.
It’s heartening to note that Trai is willing to revisit its decision two years ago, now that its earlier assumptions are proving untrue. “After 2 years, majority of the calls will be terminating on the packet based technology in which voice will be like an application,"" Trai had said while announcing the IUC cut on 19 September 2017. But as it turns out, only 5% and 18% of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s voice traffic is now carried over their 4G networks.
The continuation of IUC will mean that low value 2G subscribers can continue to be subsidised to some extent by their richer cousins using 4G technology. As this column pointed out last year , the reduction in this subsidy had resulted in higher costs for these low value subscribers, because of the minimum recharge plans launched by incumbents."

252,2019-09-23,Airtel,"IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networksTrai has floated a consultation paper to see if the date for scrapping IUC should be revised

NEW DELHI :
Without naming Reliance Jio directly, Bharti Airtel has alleged that it was gaming the interconnect usage system by reducing its outgoing call ringing time. It added that the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on another network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio.
This diverted incoming traffic would help Jio, which has just 36% of its total voice traffic as incoming calls, make 6 paise on every call that lands on its network, Airtel, India’s second largest operator by revenue, has alleged.
Interconnect usage charge, or IUC, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute.
Airtel’s allegation comes a week after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) floated two separate consultation papers. On 18 September, the regulator floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
On 16 September also, Trai had issued a consultation paper to decide the ideal call ringing time, after receiving complaints that an operator had reduced the duration to 20 seconds on its network.
“This could be true (one large 4G-only particular operator gaming the IUC regime),"" an Airtel official said, requesting anonymity without naming Jio.
Reliance Jio is the only operator in the country which has a 4G-only network. All other telcos have 2G and 3G as well.
“For example, if one operator reduces the ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks (say from 45 seconds to 20 seconds) it leads to a lot of customer inconvenience since the calls are cut off even before the receiving customer had the time to pick it up,"" the official added.
Once a customer receives a missed call he or she usually calls back the originating operator’s network. “By converting such outgoing calls to incoming calls, one large operator is not only getting IUC from other operators, but also trying to reduce the asymmetry of traffic artificially. This is to show symmetry in traffic in the run up to the proposed implementation of zero IUC,"" the official alleged.
Jio, on the other hand, has alleged that while the incumbent operators have a ringing time of 30 seconds, globally, most operators have an average ringing time of 15-20 seconds, which includes Vodafone UK. “25-30% of calls landing onto the large 4G operator’s network are missed calls. Users from incumbents network, who are paying  ₹1.5/min for calls, request Jio users to make a free voice call to them by giving a missed call, thereby creating this traffic mismatch. Incumbent operators are creating this mismatch and wanting to monetize it, too, by asking for 6p/min IUC revenue,"" a Jio official said, requesting anonymity.
Jio has also alleged that if all operators were made to upgrade their networks to 4G and charge their customers at par, there will not be any traffic asymmetry.
Mint has ascertained that a call made from Jio to Vodafone rang for 20 seconds, while a call from Vodafone to Jio lasted 44 seconds.
Email queries to Airtel and Jio were unanswered till press time.
In September 2017, Trai reduced IUC to 6 paise per minute, effective 1 October 2017 and to zero from 1 January 2020. Earlier it was 14 paise. Incumbents, already reeling under the fierce price war triggered by the launch of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were severely impacted by the Trai order. Airtel and Vodafone resisted the change, while Jio was in favour."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd is exploring the option of completely selling its stake in its tower infrastructure business to private equity funds so that it can sharpen its focus on its core business of offering wireless services, said two people familiar with the plan.
A stake sale in the merged entity combining its telecom tower unit, Bharti Infratel Ltd, and Indus Towers Ltd may, however, take place only when valuations improve from the current subdued levels, said one of the two people cited above.
A potential deal will allow India’s second-largest telecom operator by revenue to reinforce its war chest to take on market leader Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in this intensely competitive market. Since its entry in September 2016, Jio, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, has rattled incumbents with a brutal price war, forcing them to either merge or exit.
“Some of the private equity funds are trying to come together to buy a majority stake in Airtel’s tower assets as these are usually yield-generating and operating them isn’t very complex,"" the first person said on condition of anonymity. “All the three telcos (Jio, Vodafone Idea and Airtel) are trying to reduce their respective stakes in this business, while Bharti in the long term is looking for a complete exit.""
Jio’s strategy to garner subscribers through cheap data has prompted rivals to pump in funds in the cash-guzzling telecom business. As of 30 June, Airtel had a consolidated net debt of  ₹1.16 trillion.
“Sunil Mittal is very clear that he wants to compete fiercely with Jio. He will hence divest all non-core infrastructure and put money into mobile network and compete,"" the second person said, requesting anonymity. “But the tower stake sale may take some time as currently valuations don’t look too great. This isn’t the ideal time to sell. The tower stake sale will happen when prices improve.""
Bharti Airtel did not respond to an emailed query sent by Mint on Monday.
“It makes sense for them to completely exit the tower business as they won’t be a majority stakeholder in the merged entity anyway,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said on condition of anonymity. “Based on current market cap, Airtel would be able to raise at least  ₹35,000 crore if it sells all its stake in the Indus-Infratel merged entity. They can use this to reduce debt so that they are in a better position to raise money for 5G.""
Airtel said in November 2017 that it had been approached by a few “global investors"" to buy a significant stake in its tower unit, Bharti Infratel. If their interests are accepted, this “could result in such investors acquiring control of Bharti Infratel"", the company had said then.
Airtel currently holds 53.51% in Bharti Infratel. The remaining stake is held by domestic and foreign investors.
To be sure, Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are in the final phase of completing their merger and only government approval is pending. Indus Towers was started as a joint venture between Vodafone India, Bharti Infratel and Idea Cellular.
The two tower companies had in April last year agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest telecom tower company outside China. The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower Corp. Ltd.
Once the merger is completed, Airtel will hold between 33.8% and 37.2% in the merged entity. Vodafone Group Plc will own between 26.7% and 29.4%. Airtel and Vodafone will have equal rights in the merged entity.
Vodafone Idea’s 11.15% stake in Indus Towers had an implied value of  ₹5,630 crore as of June-end, which it plans to monetize on completion, the telecom firm said on 29 July.
Airtel and its rival operators need to raise cash ahead of a planned auction of airwaves in January by the telecommunications department for the launch of 5G services. The operators are already saddled with a mountain of debt, largely due to spectrum-related dues to the government.
Raising more funds is critical for Airtel as its revenue from the domestic wireless business was  ₹10,724 crore for the June quarter. Reliance Jio, in comparison, generated  ₹11,679 crore in operating revenue in the same quarter."
246,2019-10-01,Airtel,"Airtel has told Trai that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45Last week, Airtel, without naming Reliance Jio directly, alleged that it was gaming the interconnect usage system by reducing its outgoing call ringing time

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel has slashed how long an outgoing phone call will ring before getting disconnected—a tit-for-tat retaliation to a similar move by rival Reliance Jio, as the two companies fight for dominance in the world’s second largest telecom market.
Bharti Airtel, the second-ranked operator by revenue, has told the telecom regulator that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
The company said it took the step as despite its repeated requests, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has neither directed Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, the biggest telecom operator, to restore the timer to its original duration of 45 seconds nor issued a direction to operators to set the timer to 30 seconds as proposed by most of the operators.
“Therefore, we have reduced the ringing timer to 25 seconds in our network as well,"" Airtel said in its letter to Trai dated 28 September. Mint has reviewed a copy of the letter.
“In the absence of any direction from Trai and to prevent further loss of IUC (interconnect usage charge), we are left with no other option than to reduce the timer in our network as well,"" Airtel wrote.
An emailed query to Airtel went unanswered till press time.
A Jio official, responding to a Mint email, said: “Incumbent operators, to hide their inefficiencies, are blaming it on IUC. It is they who are gaming the IUC regime by charging their 2G/ 3G customers high voice tariffs. Users from incumbents network who are paying  ₹1.5/min for calls request Jio users to make a free voice call to them by giving a missed call, which is as high as 25-30%. Globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice.""
Last week, Airtel, without naming Reliance Jio directly, alleged that it was gaming the interconnect usage system by reducing its outgoing call ringing time.
Airtel said the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the person receiving the call on another network to dial back, thus creating incoming call traffic for Jio.
This diverted incoming traffic would help Jio, which has just 36% of its total voice traffic as incoming calls, make 6 paise on every call that lands on its network, Airtel had then alleged.
Interconnect usage charge is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. At present, the IUC is 6 paise a minute.

On 18 September, the regulator floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic. This followed its consultation paper on 16 September to decide the ideal call ringing time, after receiving complaints that an operator had reduced the duration to 20 seconds on its network.
Airtel alleged that once a customer receives a missed call, he or she tends to call back the originating operator’s network.
By converting such outgoing calls to incoming, a large operator was not only getting IUC from other operators, but also trying to reduce the asymmetry of traffic artificially, Airtel alleged, adding that this is to show symmetry in traffic in the run-up to the proposed implementation of zero IUC.
Trai reduced IUC to 6 paise per minute, effective 1 October 2017 and to zero from 1 January 2020. Earlier, it was 14 paise. Incumbents, already reeling under the fierce price war triggered by the launch of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were severely hit by the Trai order. Airtel and Vodafone Idea resisted the change, while Reliance Jio was in favour."

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have slashed ring time on outgoing calls from their network to 25 seconds to counter a similar move by Jio and plug losses amid a high decibel feud over the issue.
While Airtel informed regulator TRAI about its decision in a letter, sources said Vodafone Idea too has cut the ring time in select circles.
Airtel, in its letter, rued that while its decision to cut call ring time, in response to a similar move by Jio, may cause customer inconvenience, the company was left with no choice in the absence of a firm directive from the regulator despite repeated industry representations.
The company said cutting the ring time would also help it in plugging further losses on Interconnect Usage Charges (IUC).
Airtel, in the letter dated September 28, informed TRAI secretary that the company has reduced the ringing timer to 25 seconds on its network ""as well"".
Originally the operators had a ring time of 45 seconds but Airtel had earlier accused Jio of arbitrarily slashing the ring duration.
Sources said Vodafone Idea too has cut call ring duration to 25 seconds for select circles. When contacted, a company spokesperson declined to comment on the issue.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) had asked the warring operators to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution over the dispute until it concludes a formal consultation on the matter.
TRAI sources told PTI that the regulator is planning an open house discussion on the issue of 'duration of alert for the called party' on October 14, and the entire matter, for which a consultation paper has already been floated, will be decided soon.
The subject line of Airtel's letter said ""RJIL converting outgoing calls to incoming calls by forcefully disconnecting the calls towards Airtel network"".
The Sunil Mittal-led firm lamented that despite repeated requests for last 7-8 weeks, ""TRAI has neither directed Reliance Jio to restore the timer to its original value nor issued any general direction to all operators to set the timer to 30 seconds as proposed by majority of operators during the meetings"".
Airtel contended that it repeatedly brought to the regulator's notice the consequences of Jio's move to reduce the ringer duration, including higher incidence of missed calls in cases where the called party is not able to answer immediately.
Airtel said it had pointed out that the move would also lead to increase in number of call attempts to reach out to the called party; and the called party having to call back after they see missed calls, ""thereby adversely impacting the consumers’ experience as well as network Quality of Service.""
Moreover, Airtel argued, the reduction in the ringing timer by Jio also deprives the called party the facility of call forwarding feature in case of 'no reply and voice mail', besides ""gaming the IUC payouts by converting these outgoing calls to incoming calls, which is ultimately causing a huge loss of revenue to Airtel"".
Late last month, as the contentious IUC issue came back on the regulator's radar, the industry -- polarised over the issue -- erupted into a war of words.
Airtel accused Reliance Jio of ""gaming"" the system of paying for calls to rival network, and Jio returned fire arguing that incumbents are charging high voice tariffs and manipulating the system to the detriment of their users.
A senior Airtel official recently alleged that ""one large 4G-only operator"" has arbitrarily slashed ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks.
This, Airtel had said, not only led to customer inconvenience (since the calls are cut-off midway before answering), but prompted a barrage of call backs to artificially convert outgoing calls to incoming on its network. Jio had hit back saying globally most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds.
Typically, a telecom operator pays for connecting calls of its subscribers to the company on whose network a call terminates. Currently, an operator is required to pay 6 paise per minute as mobile call termination charge, called IUC.
The IUC was originally proposed to be made nil from 1 January, 2020. But TRAI is now reviewing the timeline."

248,2019-10-02,Airtel,"Telco to use funds to reduce its consolidated net debt of  ₹1.16 tnBHARTI Airtel’s undersea cable unit Network i2i Ltd will be the official borrower

New Delhi: India’s second largest operator by revenue Bharti Airtel has appointed seven joint bookrunners and joint lead managers to kick start the process of a potential fund raising exercise through dollar denominated perpetual bonds, the company said in an exchange filing on Tuesday.
BofA Merrill Lynch, Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, HSBC, J.P. Morgan and Standard Chartered Bank will conduct a series of fixed income investor meetings/calls across Asia, Europe and the US commencing 2 October for this purpose.
Airtel’s wholly-owned subsidiary Networki2i will be the official borrower and is expected to issue the bonds, the company said, without divulging how much it plans to raise and the use of such proceeds.
The operator is likely to raise $750 million to $1 billion and will use it to reduce debt, a person aware of the development said requesting anonymity. Airtel’s consolidated net debt was  ₹1.16 trillion as of June end.
The exercise to explore a fund raise comes at a time when the company is battling intense competition from rival Reliance Jio that entered the sector in September 2016.
Jio’s strategy to garner subscribers through cheap data tariffs has made it imperative for rivals to pump in funds in the cash-guzzling telecom sector.
To be sure, in March, Bharti Airtel’s promoters and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC had said they will together invest  ₹16,785 crore as part of a rights issue approved by the operator’s board in February as it aims to strengthen its balance sheet and continue investment in networks in a hyper-competitive telecom market.
This had come just a week after the company’s board in February approved a rights issue of  ₹25000 crore as well as raising  ₹7000 crore through foreign currency perpetual bond issue, taking the total capital raise to  ₹32000 crore.
Raising more funds for India business is crucial for Airtel as its profit has fallen every quarter since the entry of Reliance Jio. In fact, in the June quarter, Airtel posted its first quarterly loss in 14 years at  ₹2,866 crore as finance costs rose and it incurred a one-time loss of  ₹1,445 crore. It had recorded a net profit of  ₹97 crore in the June quarter a year earlier.
Airtel’s revenue from India wireless business was  ₹10,724 crore for the June quarter. In comparison, Reliance Jio generated  ₹11,679 crore in operating revenue in the June quarter, beating Airtel on this metric.
The launch of low-cost tariff plans by Reliance Jio, a unit of Reliance Industries Ltd, forced rivals to drop their rates, hurting profit margins. Smaller companies were forced to either shut shop or get acquired, leaving just Airtel, Jio and the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea to compete in the Indian market.
Operators, including Airtel, also need funds to buy airwaves for the launch of 5G services. The department of telecommunications plans to hold the auction in January.
Airtel is also toying with the idea of completely divesting its stake in the proposed merged entity of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel by selling stake to PE funds, Mint had reported on Monday.
The company’s Africa arm -- Airtel Africa -- had in June raised $750 million through an initial public offering (IPO). Prior to that, six investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International, in October invested $1.25 billion through a primary equity issuance in Airtel Africa. Sunil Kant Munjal of the Hero group was also part of this consortium. In January, Qatar Investment Authority, invested $200 million in the Africa arm."

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel promoter Sunil Mittal, who currently holds an 8% stake in CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd, is likely to infuse capital into the fraud hit company as he looks to lead efforts to turn around the company, said two people aware of the matter.
Mittal held 8.3% in the company through an entity Bharti (SBM) Holdings Pvt. Ltd, as of 30 June.
“The investor shareholders of the company and the management are in talks with Mittal, who has shown keen interest in reviving the company by bringing in fresh capital and helping the company meet its liquidity requirements,"" said the first person cited above, requesting anonymity as the talks were private.
Mittal could buy more stake in the company or bring in the capital in the form of debt to help with working capital needs, along with a clutch of other new investors, he said, adding that the consortium led by Mittal is also reaching out to lenders of the company to implement the turn around plan for CG Power.
A spokesperson for the Bharti group declined to comment on the development. The spokesperson of CG Power could not be immediately reached for a comment. The Economic Times, on Thursday, was first to report Mittal’s efforts to revive the fraud hit company.
CG Power, in August, said the company will restate accounts after discovering “significant accounting irregularities"" and governance lapses that have led to significant understatement of the company’s liabilities and advances to related and unrelated parties.
“The total liabilities of the company and the group may have been potentially understated by approximately  ₹1,053.54 crore and  ₹1,608.17 crore, respectively as on 31 March 2018,"" CG Power had said in its exchange filing.
The company is now controlled by several lenders, who invoked the pledged shareholding of promoters earlier this year. As on 30 June, Thapar’s Avantha Group had a negligible stake in the company, while private sector lender Yes Bank held a 12.79% stake and private equity investor KKR holds close to 10%. Other major shareholders include HDFC Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management, Franklin Templeton and Life Insurance Corp. of India.
As part of efforts to turn around the company’s operations, CG Power’s board on 27 August said the company was considering selling non-core assets and exploring various fundraising avenues to deleverage the company.
In a presentation, the board said it was evaluating divestments of non-core assets, including the sale of the Kanjurmarg land and CG House, where its headquarter is located. The board is also considering other fundraising avenues, including an equity raise for bridging cash flow gaps and meeting working capital requirements to avoid business disruption, it said.
It is also reviewing its international operations which span Europe and South-East Asia (SEA).
“CG Power continues to be a leader in the areas that it operates in. It is either number one or number two in these businesses in India. Its overseas businesses, especially its Southeast Asia operations are doing very well, and any turnaround plan could involve a monetization of this business,"" said the second person cited above, also requesting anonymity.
“I don’t have any idea where is this story coming from,"" Sunil Bharti Mittal told Mint in response to a query about whether he would be investing additional capital in CG Power."
242,2019-10-04,Airtel,"Last week, Airtel letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, saying that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45Every call that lands on a mobile network fetches it money; at present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute

New Delhi: The hyper-competitive Indian telecom sector has seen many battles as operators compete for revenue and subscribers but the latest round of war between telcos is over how long should your mobile phone ring with Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio yet again crossing swords.
Last week, Airtel, the country’s second-ranked operator by revenue, shot off a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, saying that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
This was a tit-for-tat move after its bitter rival Jio did the same. Airtel said it had to take this step as despite its repeated requests, Trai had neither directed Jio to restore the timer to its original duration of 45 seconds nor issued a direction to operators to set the timer to 30 seconds as proposed by most operators.
To be sure, Trai has already floated a consultation paper on the matter and will also hold an open house discussion with stakeholders on 17 October with an aim to resolve this impasse. Trai also seeks to find out whether customers need to be offered options to change or modify the duration of ringing time particularly for them.
But is the ringer time even important? It is. Two reasons.
If these ringing timers are set differently by different network operators, the chances of answering the call by user of one network would be different from the user of another network as one party would get more time to answer the call than the other party.
The second reason is money.
Every call that lands on a mobile network fetches it money. The interconnect usage charge or IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, and is a source of revenue for telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone Idea who enjoy more incoming traffic than outgoing. At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute.
Interestingly, Jio, which reduced its outgoing call ringer time to 25 seconds, has more outgoing traffic than incoming. Jio’s outgoing traffic is 64% of its total voice traffic, as of June end.
Airtel has alleged that by reducing its outgoing call ringing time, the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on the rival network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio.
Jio, however, has argued that globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice.
Now Airtel has also cut the ringer time to 25 seconds. Vodafone Idea too has done this in a few circles.
This behaviour, however, is a race to the bottom.
And Trai, in its consultation paper floated on 16 September, probably saw this retaliation coming even before Airtel conveyed this in its letter to the regulator dated 28 September.
“The absence of any guiding principle or specific values may lead to a situation where reduction of the duration of ringing by one telecom service provider for its certain advantages may cause reactions by the other service providers in response to it by further reducing the values to even more lower levels and thereby causing chain reaction. It is apprehended that if such chain reaction or race among service providers happens to set lower and lower values of timers (it) will severely impact the interests of the customers,"" Trai had said.
“In case of emergence of such situations, it would be difficult to arrest the fall of value below a critical point as there will not be any reference value or range of values,"" the regulator had said.
It is important to note that the timer for domestic calls is not regulated by any authority in India. Operators have the freedom to choose the timers.
Jio has gone a step ahead and also said that there is no need for any regulatory intervention in this matter.
“In case Trai still decides to fix a value for the alert timer, it should be done only post a detailed study by a technical committee comprising experts from department of telecommunications and Telecommunication Engineering Centre,"" Jio said in its comments on the consultation paper floated by Trai.
There is no logic of keeping these limits on the higher side as mobile handsets are usually kept close to the user, Jio has said, adding that the optimum value of this timer is 20-25 seconds.
Airtel wants this ringer time set at 40 seconds. Vodafone Idea says the minimum ringing timer should be retained at 30 seconds.
“We strongly recommend a minimum value of 30 seconds for ringing timer at terminating side, to be uniformly applied by all operators for mobile networks which will ensure high call success in first attempt and help improve customer satisfaction,"" Vodafone Idea has told Trai.
The ringing time also impacts network efficiency. The maximum time allowed to answer the call takes on more importance as the alerting phase also engages scarce radio spectrum resources. Ringing for a long time, when a user is unlikely to accept the phone call, would led to non-optimal utilization of resources.
The reverse also has implications. Configuring duration of ringing time on lower side might save resources but on the other hand it may cause concerns related to network performance, if duration is much lower than the typical time one takes to answer the call.
The best scenario hence is for operators to sit across the table and figure this out. Else, this will be one more item on what is anyway a long list of disputes between hostile competitors. The biggest victim of this: the hapless consumer."
243,2019-10-04,Airtel,"JioPhones will now be available for an upfront cost of  ₹699, compared to  ₹1,095 in the previous schemeApart from accelerating its market share gains, what this also means is that Vodafone Idea’s and Bharti Airtel’s revenues from IUC can drop materially.

In the past month, Vodafone Idea Ltd’s shares jumped by 20% twice, in two consecutive trading sessions on both occasions. The first was when the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India suggested it might rethink the abolition of interconnection usage charge (IUC) from January 2020. Then again, last week, in the backdrop of rumours of an increase in tariffs by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
But these hopes have come to nought. If IUC stays, it will certainly be a positive for Vodafone Idea, but a mere band-aid in the overall scheme of things.
The news, which sent the company’s shares down 16% in the past two trading sessions, and shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd by about 6% earlier this week, was Reliance Jio’s announcement of a sharp increase in the subsidy offered on its 4G feature phone. JioPhones will now be available for an upfront cost of  ₹699, compared to  ₹1,095 in the previous scheme.
This offers Reliance Jio a much better chance to capture the low-end of incumbents’ subscriber base. Jio also offers an unlimited voice plan for as low as  ₹49 per month. Currently only about one-fifth of the company’s subscriber base uses the JioPhone.
Unlike smartphone users, who shifted in droves to Jio’s network, feature phone users of Vodafone Idea and Airtel haven’t had the same opportunity, given the cost advantage of 2G handsets vis-à-vis 4G devices. “The offer clearly targets non-data/2G subscribers of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which stand at 42% and 52%, respectively,"" analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd said in a note. As such, a hitherto protected segment for the incumbents now stands the risk of being captured by Jio.
“Jio’s average monthly subscriber additions of around 8 million per month can be expected to rise as a result of the higher subsidy; maybe to 11-12 million,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, requesting anonymity. With the company expected to end the September quarter with a subscriber base of 350 million, and assuming monthly additions of 12 million, Jio may well reach the 500 million subscriber mark within a year from now, to have over 50% market share.
Apart from accelerating its market share gains, what this also means is that Vodafone Idea’s and Bharti Airtel’s revenues from IUC can drop materially. After all, users at the low-end mostly receive calls and earn IUC for incumbents. If more of them start using the subsidized JioPhone, the above-mentioned traffic imbalance may reverse, and hurt incumbents.
Moreover, given Jio’s continued aggression with regards to subscriber acquisition, it seems unlikely that a tariff hike is anywhere around the corner."
241,2019-10-06,Airtel,"Jio said if at all the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) wants to take a view on the issue, it should be in form of a 'reference guideline and not in form of a mandated value'Rival Bharti Airtel had charged Jio of arbitrarily shortening the ring time for outgoing calls from its network

NEW DELHI :
Amid an industry feud over call ringing time, Reliance Jio has urged the telecom regulator to abstain from mandating a specific duration for calls to ring, and said the matter should be kept under forbearance as ""there is no need for any regulatory intervention"".
Jio said if at all the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) wants to take a view on the issue, it should be in form of a ""reference guideline and not in form of a mandated value"".
""In such case, the range of 20 seconds to 25 seconds may be prescribed as reference guideline,"" Jio informed Trai, which is in the process of finalising its views on the issue through a consultation paper.
Rival Bharti Airtel -- which had charged Jio of arbitrarily shortening the ring time for outgoing calls from its network -- has argued that low ringing time for calls directly impacts the customer experience, and asserted that standardising the value at both originating and terminating ends ""is paramount at this stage"".
Airtel has recommended that the terminating exchange timer should be fixed at 45 seconds and the origination exchange timer at 75 seconds.
In its submission, Vodafone Idea has argued that the minimum ringing timer should be retained at 30 seconds, which, the company claimed is in tune with global practices.
Jio, meanwhile, has contended that in case Trai still decides to fix a value for call alert timer, the same should be done only after a detailed study by a technical panel comprising experts from the telecom department and Telecom Engineering Centre (TEC).
The company lamented that the only time objection has been raised on the ringing duration of calls is against the current implementation by Jio, and alleged that this ""is clearly a case of vested interests"".
""...we have not faced any customer issues and even the alleged customer issues being faced by one operator remain unsubstantiated, the authority may validate such claims and not take the same on face value,"" Jio said.
On the missed calls, Jio has told Trai that it is ""more of a victim here instead of being a perpetrator"".
In its comments on the Trai consultation paper, the Mukesh Ambani-led company said that the considered regulatory position so far has been that such timers fall under the domain of ""commercial freedom"" accorded to telecom operators.
""Reliance Jio Infocomm (RJIL) submits that this policy should continue in the interest of light touch regulation and forbearance,"" it said.
Jio noted that the operators in the past never felt compelled to disclose the timer to other players. Globally, too, this parameter is kept at the discretion of the service provider and many leading operators keep this minimal levels close to 20 seconds, some even 15 seconds.
RJIL believes that the optimum value of this timer is 20 seconds and argued that there is no logic of keeping these limits at the higher side as handheld devices are generally kept close to the users and most calls are being answered within 15 seconds, it said.
Late last month, as the contentious interconnect usage charges (IUC) issue came back on the regulator's radar, the industry -- polarised over the issue -- had erupted into a war of words.
Airtel had accused Reliance Jio of ""gaming"" the system of paying for calls to rival network, and Jio had returned fire arguing that incumbents are charging high voice tariffs and manipulating the system to the detriment of their users.
A senior Airtel official recently alleged that ""one large 4G-only operator"" has arbitrarily slashed ringing time for outgoing calls to other networks.
This, Airtel had said, not only led to customer inconvenience (since the calls are cut-off midway before answering), but prompted a barrage of call backs to artificially convert outgoing calls to incoming on its network. Jio had hit back saying globally most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds.
The call ringing time issue is an important one for telecom players. Typically, a telecom operator pays for connecting calls of its subscribers to the company on whose network a call terminates. Currently, an operator is required to pay 6 paise per minute as mobile call termination charge, called IUC.
The IUC was originally proposed to be made nil from January 1, 2020. But TRAI is now reviewing the timeline, as part of a separate consultation exercise.
Earlier this week, telecom operators Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea slashed ring time on outgoing calls from their network to 25 seconds to counter a similar move by Jio and plug losses amid a high voltage dispute, over the issue. This is an interim measure, and the final decision on the call ring time will be taken by TRAI soon.

240,2019-10-07,Airtel,"Some distortions of the telecom market caused by India’s ‘caller pays’ regime are showing up only now. This system was to be phased out, but it’s taking much longer than envisaged

Cell phone users in India must sharpen their reflexes, now that telecom service providers have reduced the ringing limit for outgoing calls to 25 seconds. The sounds that alert us to incoming calls are not exactly costless. Every ring eats up radio frequency, and Indian telecom companies cannot be faulted for wanting to move towards international standards, particularly after the telecom regulator flagged the issue last month. A majority view in favour of rings that last 30 seconds, though, was lost in a haze once Reliance Jio set the cut-off limit for its outgoing calls to 25 seconds, and its rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea followed suit. Such a short ring duration lends itself to accusations of being designed to induce call backs from call recipients who are unable to respond in time. Under a “calling party pays"" framework, an operator that originates a call must pay a termination fee to the network that answers. This means a net gain is made if more calls come in than go out to other networks. This intake constitutes a sizeable chunk of operator revenues, now that consumers themselves pay so little for the services they avail of.
However, as technology pulls down the cost of carrying voice traffic, termination fees are to be phased out. The payment system is currently the subject of a policy rethink on a sunset date for it. Packet switched networks, such as those using 4G cellular technology, render these charges redundant. The government is hopeful that domestic telecom firms would have upgraded their grids and moved enough of their legacy subscribers onto these networks by the end of this year. Disappointingly, the shift has been very slow. Every second cellular subscriber in India is still on either a 2G or 3G network. Although Jio has all its users on a 4G network and Airtel has tripled the size of its 4G grid in two years, only about half the handsets selling are 4G-enabled. Setting up spiffy new networks is one thing, getting subscribers to embrace them is quite another. For Jio, it was part of its game plan. Having bet its future on a rapid upgradation curve, it took just three years to expand its share of subscribers to around one-third of the total by bundling cheap tariff plans with elementary handsets hooked to its network. For Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which were left vastly indebted by the large sums they paid for 2G and 3G spectrum, pushing most of their subscribers to the latest available generation of mobile technology has been a far stiffer challenge.
The axing of termination fees was to mark India’s mass upgradation, and the regulator’s second thoughts over a deadline for it amounts to an admission that progress has been slower than envisaged. Any reassessment of the situation would have to address the incentive that operators have to resist change, reluctant as some may be to let go of the money raked in that way. If the status quo persists, millions of mobile subscribers could be left with outdated means of communication. The burden of high spectrum fees has already acted as a drag on the adoption of new technologies. As India gears up to roll out 5G services, telecom regulation must help the sector strike an optimal balance. The country has always taken a dual-lane approach to wireless telephony. A slow lane is alright, so long as the fast lane keeps up with the rest of the world."
239,2019-10-09,Airtel,"The 6 paisa charge will remain in place till the time telecom operators are required to pay rivals for mobile phone calls made by their users to other operators' networkReliance Jio on Wednesday announced it will compensate them by giving free data of equal value

NEW DELHI :
Forced by regulatory uncertainty over review of sunset clause for call termination charges, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Wednesday announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value.
In a statement, Jio said the 6 paisa charge will remain in place till the time telecom operators are required to pay rivals for mobile phone calls made by their users to other operators' network.
These charges are not applicable on calls made by Jio users to other Jio phones and to landline phones and calls made using WhatsApp, FaceTime and other such platforms. Incoming calls from all networks will continue to be free.
Telecom regulator TRAI in 2017 had slashed the so-called interconnect usage charge (IUC) to 6 paise per minute from 14 paise and had said this regime will end by January 2020. But it has now floated a consultation paper to review whether the regime timeline needs to be extended.
Since voice calls on Jio network are free, the company had to bear the  ₹13,500 crore payment made to rivals such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. To recover the losses created by the TRAI move, the company has decided to charge customers 6 paise per minute for every call they make to a rival's network.
This will be the first time that Jio users will pay for voice calls.
Currently, Jio charges only for data, and voice calls to anywhere in the country and to any network are free.
""...The consultation paper has created regulatory uncertainty and therefore Jio has been compelled, most reluctantly and unavoidably, to recover this regulatory charge of 6 paise per minute for all off-net mobile voice calls so long as IUC charges exist,"" the statement said.
For all recharges done by Jio customers starting Wednesday, calls made to other mobile operators will be charged at the prevailing IUC rate of 6 paise per minute through IUC top-up vouchers till such time that TRAI moves to zero termination charge regime.
""Jio will provide additional data entitlement of equivalent value based on IUC top-up voucher consumption. This will ensure no increase in tariff for customers,"" Jio said.
Jio said it has, in last three years, paid other operators like Airtel and Vodafone-Idea nearly  ₹13,500 crore as net IUC charges.

238,2019-10-09,Airtel,"Investors have lapped up debt sales in 2019 from Indian issuersBharti Airtel Ltd. and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd. are among Indian issuers mulling dollar note sales ahead

Indian issuers look set to keep tapping the dollar bond market in the fourth quarter even after record issuance so far this year, as US currency borrowing costs remain attractive and strains persist in rupee debt markets.
Investors have lapped up debt sales in 2019 from Indian issuers, which still account for less than 7% of offerings in the Asia ex-Japan market and offer diversification from Chinese deals. After significant tightening in India dollar spreads in 2019, however, investors in the fourth quarter can probably expect returns mainly from holding the notes and earning interest, according to Bharat Shettigar, head of Asia ex-China corporate credit research at Standard Chartered Bank.
“The pipeline is healthy and there will be continued issuance in October and November as all in yields in dollar are very attractive for issuers and domestic credit conditions remain tight,"" Shettigar said. In the dollar market “spreads for Indian companies tightened because of investor demand, especially for high-yield names,"" he said.
Dwindling Profits
Tough borrowing conditions back home due to a deepening shadow bank crisis has pushed issuers overseas, and dollar bond sales are running to an all-time high of about $18 billion so far in 2019. While most Indian US currency credit spreads have tightened this year, the recent slump in the bond prices of financier Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. and Yes Bank Ltd. highlight risks of investing in some Indian names tied to the domestic credit squeeze.
Dollar bonds issued by Indian companies posted their lowest return this year in September, but they still managed to avoid losses seen in Chinese and Indonesian notes in that period.
Bharti Airtel Ltd. and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd. are among Indian issuers mulling dollar note sales ahead, and state-run Power Finance Corp., the top issuer of offshore bonds this year, increased its global medium-term note program to $5 billion from $3 billion in September.
“There is strong interest in bonds that provide the much-needed diversification from this year’s abundant Chinese property developers and local government financing vehicles,"" said Owen Gallimore, head of credit strategy at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., in an interview. “Indian paper is a key beneficiary, despite macro headwinds, as there is a mix of highly-rated state owned issuers and high-yield private-sector borrowers with global businesses.""
The sale amount of investment-grade Indian dollar bonds in 2020 could be similar to this year, but the outlook for junk notes is less clear due to the country’s slowing economic growth, said Krishnakumar S., director and lead analyst for corporate ratings, south Asia at S&P Global Ratings.
“High-yield issuance will depend on how India’s growth trajectory shapes up,"" he said in an interview.

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel on Wednesday alleged that Jio's decision to levy 6 paise per minute on voice calls to rival phone networks is geared to ""force IUC to be brought down"", and said ongoing review of call connect charges or IUC is consistent with TRAI's previously-stated intent.
The comments by Sunil Mittal-led Bharti Airtel came after Jio blamed Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) of regulatory flip-flop on the IUC issue while announcing a levy of 6 paise per minute on voice calls made to rival phone networks. Jio has, however, also said it will compensate customers for the IUC charge by giving free data of equal value.
Without naming Jio, Airtel in a statement said, ""One of our competitors has imposed a rate of 6 paise for all off net calls made to other operators to cover the termination charge of IUC (Interconnect Usage Charge). They have gone on to suggest that TRAI has re-opened this issue"". Airtel argued that the review was, in fact, in line with TRAI’s stated position on the matter in 2017 where it had made it clear that the issue will the revisited based on factors like adoption of new technologies (their impact on termination cost) and traffic patterns.
""Both these have not materialised. There are still over 400 million 2G customers from the poorest sections of society living in rural areas paying less than Rs50 per month and who can still not afford to buy a 4G device. Second, there still is significant asymmetry of traffic,"" Airtel said.
Airtel rued that even the current rate of 6 paise is significantly below the real cost of completing the call.
""...on 19 September, 2017, when TRAI reduced the IUC from 14 paise to 6 paise and proposed a move towards Bill and Keep (zero IUC rate) with effect from Jan 1, 2020 they had specifically mentioned the following...The authority, if deems it necessary may re-visit the afore mentioned scheme of termination charge applicable on Wireless to Wireless calls after one year from the implementation of the regulation,"" Airtel statement recalled.
Airtel further noted that the telecom industry is in a state of deep financial stress since the last three years with several operators having gone bankrupt and thousands of jobs having being lost. ""The IUC is determined based on the cost per call. Given the massive 2G customer base in India the cost of the call at 6 paise is already significantly below the real cost of completing the call,"" it added.
Airtel said: ""Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued By TRAI,"" Airtel said."
235,2019-10-09,Airtel,"Jio’s move to charge users 6 paise/min for calls to rivals' network will come as a major relief for Airtel and Voda Idea, which have been bleeding because of cut-price tariffsAs of June-end, 64% of Jio’s traffic was outgoing. Airtel, Voda Idea could gain if date of scrapping IUC is postponed

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s most profitable telecom operator, will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers and signalling the end of a bruising tariff war.
The operator said it “has been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
“For all recharges done by Jio customers starting today, calls made to other mobile operators will be charged at the prevailing IUC rate of 6 paise per minute through IUC top-up vouchers till such time that Trai moves to zero termination charge regime,"" Jio said in a statement on Wednesday.
That Jio will start charging for outgoing calls for the first time will come as a major relief to Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which have been left bleeding financially as a result of the rock-bottom tariffs offered by the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company.
“This is an indication that the price war is close to its end. This bodes well for both Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea as they have been hoping for an upward movement in tariff levels for long,"" a Mumbai-based telecom analyst said on condition of anonymity.
Jio, however, will compensate customers by providing free additional data of equivalent value based on the customer’s IUC top-up voucher consumption so as to ensure there is no increase in tariff.
The move comes three weeks after Trai on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
“Despite Jio having comparable subscribers with rivals, termination of traffic is skewed in favour of incumbents. Now, even Jio feels it can’t justify this subsidy forever—as they were paying IUC charges, but still keeping voice calls free,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India, said. “For Jio consumers, this is not good news as they were used to free calls. Jio starting to charge calls is good for rivals as this is an upward movement in tariffs for Jio customers. This gives some breathing room to incumbents.""
Jio, however, believes that the traffic is asymmetric because rivals have kept 2G voice tariffs high. “The price differential of free voice on Jio network and exorbitantly high tariffs on 2G networks causes the 35-40 crore 2G customers of Airtel and Vodafone-Idea to give missed calls to Jio customers. Jio network receives 25 to 30 crore missed calls on a daily basis,"" Jio said on Wednesday.
Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said that one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel said in a statement on Wednesday.
“The announcement by one of the telecom service providers today to charge for calls made to other service providers to cover the termination charge of IUC is not only an action of undue haste but it also does not bring out the fact that interconnect is a settlement between operators and not a consumer pricing matter,"" Vodafone Idea said in a statement.
Meanwhile, Jio has said these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC."
227,2019-10-10,Airtel,"Analysts say the hike by Jio will provide other operators leeway to raise their charges proportionatelyShares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd ended 5-6% higher while RIL was up nearly 3% on Thursday

Telecom stocks rallied on Thursday on hopes that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s unconventional tariff move may enable other operators to raise tariffs too. Reliance Jio said on Wednesday that due to undergoing regulatory policy changes for Interconnect Usage Charge (IUC), it is compelled to recover IUC from non-Jio users and hence post 10 October, all calls to non-Jio mobile numbers will be charged at 6 paise per minute.
Shares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd ended 5-6% higher while Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) was up nearly 3% on Thursday.
Analysts believe the tariff hike from the price-setter is positive for the telecom industry and will provide other operators leeway to raise their charges proportionately. However, analysts were cautious that the way the price increase has been taken is perplexing considering it may cause inconvenience and anxiety to subscribers.
According to Nomura, RJio’s move is a step to pressure the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to keep unchanged the current plan of making IUC charges zero from 1 January 2020. In September 2017, by a change in regulation, Trai reduced the IUC from 14 paise to 6 paise per minute effective 1 October 2017 until 31 December 2019. It had further prescribed a bill-and-keep (BAK) regime, i.e. zero IUC or termination charge effective, from 1 January 2020. However, on 18 September 2019, the regulator floated a consultation paper to review the implementation of the zero IUC regime from 1 January 2020, following representation from some stakeholders.
Analysts at Nomura said in the near term, the move will likely boost average revenue per user (Arpu) but, more importantly, it could make the regulator rethink its move to defer implementing the zero IUC regime from the current plan of 1 January 2020. It said that if free calls from Jio subscribers to 2G subscribers of other operators reduce, the pace of subscriber switch (from 2G of incumbent operator to Jio) could increase further.
“We currently assume no IUC charges for domestic calls from Q4FY20. While Jio’s IUC charges are on a declining trend, these are still very high ( ₹850 crore in 1QFY20). We estimate that if IUC charges were to continue beyond 1 Jan 2020, nearly  ₹2500-3000 of Jio’s FY21 Ebitda could be at risk,"" Nomura said in a report on 10 October.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, at roughly 6.6 paise/min charge, this would mean incremental revenues of  ₹1,790 crore per quarter. “One needs to adjust for the  ₹720 crore IUC cost that was assumed to be going down to zero. Net revenue uplift would be  ₹1,070 crore a quarter or  ₹4,300 crore per annum. ..So, gross Arpu uplift of  ₹19 per subscribers per month, assuming no price elasticity on off-net volumes,"" Kotak said in a report on Thursday."
229,2019-10-10,Airtel,"Reliance Jio’s move on tariffs is in response to Trai’s consultation paper on the matterShares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are up 10% and 20% respectively in the past two trading sessions

There has never been a dull moment in the telecom industry since Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd launched commercial operations in 2016.
In the three years since its launch, it has been accused of predatory pricing – for charging ‘no tariffs’ and then ‘low tariffs’ to gain market share. Incumbents such as Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd are now miffed that Jio has suddenly decided to charge its subscribers ‘more tariffs’.
Jio said on Wednesday it will start charging its customers for outgoing calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute. This is to recover the interconnect usage charge (IUC) applicable on calls made to other networks, also known as off-net calls. Based on the quantum of such calls made from Jio’s network to Airtel, Vodafone Idea and the state-run mobile networks in the June quarter, analysts estimate a quarterly revenue bump of about  ₹1800 crore for Jio.
Average revenue per user, or Arpu, is expected to rise by about 15%. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect a roughly 6-8% increase in Arpu for the incumbents if they adopt a similar hike in tariffs for customers who use bundled data and voice packs.
Not surprisingly, shares of Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are up 10% and 20% respectively in the past two trading sessions. Why then are the incumbents complaining?
Airtel said in a statement, “This off-net charge... is to force IUC to be brought down."" The incumbents are net receivers of the IUC charge, while Jio has a quarterly outgo of about Rs800 crore on this count. Indeed, even Reliance Jio’s statements clearly suggest that the increased tariff will be in force only till the time the IUC charge is retained by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
For perspective, Trai had suggested two years ago that the fee will be abolished with effect from January 2020. But last month, it asked telecom operators and other stakeholders to give feedback on whether it makes sense to postpone the abolition of IUC.
The unwritten subtext of Jio’s move is that costs for telecom consumers are increasing because Trai isn’t going ahead with its original plan of abolishing IUC. This will doubtlessly be highlighted in the telecom regulator’s consultation process. The suggestion that a ‘voice will always be free’ network is forced to charge for outgoing voice calls because of Trai’s move may well be an argument that gains popular support. It’s another matter that while Jio’s net IUC outgo is around Rs800 crore, it may end up getting a far higher amount as a result of the new charge. After all, while it is charging customers for off-net outgoing calls, it isn’t compensating them for off-net incoming calls, where it receives IUC from rivals.
Besides, the suggestion that voice has always been free on Jio’s network is also debatable. “We aren’t in sync with Jio’s views of having paid IUC “from its own resources while offering free voice to its customers"". Of the bundled price paid by a customer, any attribution to voice, data, off-net outgoing IUC recovery etc. is an arbitrary one,"" say analysts at Kotak.
A moot question is if the friction caused by the additional charge will hurt Jio’s subscriber addition numbers. While this may well be true in the near-term, Jio has given ample evidence that it will take corrective action as soon as it is necessary.
“Jio could have taken a clean price hike, as expected, given it has become the market leader. The move to charge for IUC, with a sunset clause, indicates its sustained focus on subscriber additions and that tariff increase is not a near-term focus. Indeed, this move encourages voice-only subscribers to move to Jio's network,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. Indeed, the additional charge for off-net calls will incentivise existing Jio users to bring friends and family on to the Jio network.
But rather than banking on such gains, Reliance Jio seems to be betting that its tariff move will put Trai on notice and that IUC would be abolished sooner than later. For a precariously placed company such as Vodafone Idea, net IUC receipts accounted for about 30% of Ebitda in Q1. An end of the IUC regime will hasten the depletion of its already low cash balances.
Rather than celebrate a possible temporary increase in tariffs, investors in Vodafone Idea and Airtel should worry about Jio’s aggressive approach with regards to not only subscriber additions but also regulatory debates such as IUC."

Mumbai: Reliance Jio Infocomm’s (RJio) decision to pass on the interconnect usage charge (IUC) for off-net calls (calls to other networks) to its subscribers may enable other operators to raise tariffs too, say analysts.
For RJio, this move is expected to drive up revenue by 5%, which would translate into a 10% increase in operating profit, according to Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
""This works out to a price hike of about 14%. However, we believe that additional charges for off-net calls would disincentivise users to call other operators, which would reduce off-net call volumes for RJio,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note published on 9 October.
Analysts believe the tariff hike is positive for the telecom industry and will provide other operators leeway to hike prices proportionately. Other operators may follow suit, but by simply raising the tariff.
“We believe competition will follow suit, with tariff hikes for their bundled plan subscribers, which should result in an Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) increase of  ₹7 and  ₹4 for Bharti and Vodafone-Idea, respectively,"" Emkay’s note to shareholders said.
“RJio, on the other hand, will witness an ARPU increase of about  ₹17 following the move,"" it added.
On Wednesday, RJio announced it would charge its customers 6 paise per minute for calls to rival networks. The Mukesh Ambani-led company was actually passing on the IUC charges to the subscriber.
RJio will recover the IUC for off-net calls from its subscribers at 6 paise a minute via a separate recharge voucher. It would compensate for the hike by offering an equivalent value of data, signalling no effective change in tariffs for subscribers per se.
Analysts view it as a circuitous price hike that may not go down well with subscribers and may prompt a behavioural change among Jio subscribers, discouraging them from making off-net calls."

Shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd. and Bharti Airtel Ltd. surged after the wireless carrier controlled by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani said it will end free voice calls on its network. Vodafone Idea jumped as much as 18%, set for the biggest intraday gain since August, while Bharti climbed 4.8% at 10:48 a.m. in Mumbai. Reliance Industries Ltd.’s shares rose for a third day.

The move “seems like a big deal, insofar as the market has been waiting for Jio to move from a land grabber to focusing on profitable growth,"" Chris Lane, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note.
Reliance Jio stormed into the industry in 2016, and became the nation’s top telecom operator after free calls and cheap data lured millions of users and left rivals struggling under mounting debt. Vodafone Idea’s shares, for instance, are down 71% this year despite Thursday’s surge.
Jio has paid about  ₹13,500 crore in user fees to rival operators since its launch, according to the statement. The regulator had planned to scrap these charges from January next year, but floated a fresh consultation paper to see if the date needed to be revised --a move that forced Jio to go back on its promise to keep voice calls free.
Here’s what brokerages said about Jio’s announcement:
Sanford C. Bernstein
“Jio’s effective 10% price increase should be a breadth of fresh air for the likes of Vodafone Idea, which has been left for dead, and Bharti Airtel""
The first has an outperform recommendation on Bharti Airtel, while Vodafone is the preferred play on the sector due to “the extreme, asymmetric risk-reward.""
Edelweiss Securities
“Reliance Jio’s tariff hike is prima facie positive for the industry as it enables other operators to raise tariffs too.
Other operators may see a drop in calls terminating on their networks, but the tariff hike should be able to compensate for it well. We are already building in 4% higher Q4FY20 ARPU (average revenue per user) for Bharti and Vodafone Idea than Q1FY20.""
Dolat Capital Market
“Jio’s majority subscriber base is on bundled plans and it is thus easier for it to charge for off-net calls which may not be the case with Bharti and Vodafone Idea.
Nevertheless, we believe Bharti and Vodafone Idea may either replicate Jio’s move or innovate on product front to capitalize from Jio’s price increase.""
Emkay Global Financial Services
“Competition will follow suit with tariff hikes for their bundled plan subscribers, which should result in an ARPU increase of 7 rupee and 4 rupees for Bharti and Vodafone, respectively.

Vodafone Idea: Shares pared their early double-digit rise, trading 6% higher as the country’s telecom operator Reliance Jio’s announcement on charging voice calls, giving hopes to rival companies for raising tariffs. The telecom industry has been suffering financially ever since Jio was launched in September 2016 offering free voice calls and zero roaming charges for its customers.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: Shares fell as RBI rejected its proposed merger with IHF. The stock has 71% value since the announcement of the merger in April. The bank was in September placed under the PCA list due to insufficient capital adequacy ratio, high level of bad loans and negative return on asset (RoA) for two consecutive years. The stock was trading 5% lower.
Yes Bank: Concerns over exposure to stressed sectors, especially housing finance companies (HFC), dragged the stock lower.

Last month, RBI placed Lakshmi Vilas Bank under prompt corrective action (PCA) owing to the high level of bad loans, insufficient capital adequacy ratio, negative return on assets (RoA) for two consecutive years and high leverage. For the year ended 31 March, the bank’s net non-performing assets stood at 7.49%, capital adequacy ratio at 7.72% and RoA at -2.32%. Lakshmi Vilas Bank will now have to independently explore options for raising capital to help lift the restrictions placed on it.
Altico Capital looks to raise  ₹2,000 crore
Altico Capital India Ltd, the real estate-focused lender that defaulted on interest payments in September, has proposed to sell loans worth around  ₹2,000 crore as part of its debt resolution plan, Mint reported citing two people directly aware of the development. The resolution plan is expected to be submitted to Altico’s lenders and investors by the end of next week. The Mumbai-based real estate lender has already identified the assets that it plans to sell as part of its resolution plan and it will offer the proceeds from such a sale, upfront to its lenders, said the first person mentioned above. Altico currently has a collateral cover of close to  ₹11,000 crore against its present loan book size of around  ₹7,000 crore. Located across seven cities, including Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru, these assets are land parcels, commercial and residential projects at different stages of constructions. The company’s portfolio of real estate investment spread across 30% commercial office, 60% residential and the remaining in logistics and warehousing. At present, Altico’s total outstanding debt stands at  ₹4,361.5 crore, from 27 lenders including Yes Bank, State Bank of India and HDFC Bank, among others.
Edelweiss eyes first close of $1 billion credit fund by year end
Financial services focused Edelweiss Group is eyeing the first close of its latest alternative investment fund, Edelweiss Special Opportunities Fund (ESOF) III, at $600-700 million by December-January, Mint reported citing Venkat Ramaswamy, executive director of Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd and co-head at Edelweiss Global Investment Advisors. ESOF III is a credit fund that focuses on investing in the performing credit space and will lend to companies that need funds for growth. It will not invest in areas such as real estate and distressed credit opportunities. The third fund’s corpus will be nearly three times the size of the previous fund, ESOF II, which closed at $340 million in April 2017. Its first credit fund ESOF I garnered $230 million. The financial services group hopes to raise the capital from 10-12 large foreign institutional investors, including some of the largest global, predominantly North American and European insurance companies and pension funds. The firm expects to close the third fund in the next six months, which will take its assets under management in the alternative investments business from $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion. ESOF III will invest in Indian holding or operating firms that are seeking growth, but will not fund real estate and distressed opportunities.
Lightbox leads investment in online jeweller Melorra
Online jewellery brand Melorra has raised $12 million in a Series C round led by existing investor, venture capital firm Lightbox Ventures, Mint reported citing founder and chief executive officer Saroja Yeramilli. Other investors include the Burman family office, the private investment arm of the promoters of Dabur India, and the Jeejeebhoy family office. Melorra also raised $2 million in debt from BlackSoil Capital, which provides debt to startups and other firms. The company sells necklaces, bracelets, rings, and other jewellery items on its website and claims to deliver to 1,300 towns across the country. It caters to the affordable and daily wear jewellery segment, with an average transaction value of  ₹20,000. Melorra achieved gross revenue of about  ₹55 crore last fiscal, which it expects to jump to  ₹150 crore this fiscal through March, and  ₹400 crore next year. The jewellery startup segment, online and offline, has seen rising investor interest, driven by young users seeking affordable, better designed, and innovative products with rapidly changing trends. CaratLane, which counted Tiger Global Management among its investors, was acquired by Tata Group’s Titan Co. Ltd in 2016. Titan invested a further  ₹100 crore in the venture this April to increase its stake. Jewellery retailer BlueStone, backed by firms such as Accel, Saama Capital, and IvyCap Ventures, aims to raise $25 million to expand its offline presence, Mint reported on 12 February.
Airtel Raises $750 m via bond issue to lower its debt burden
Bharti Airtel has raised $750 million ( ₹5,325 crore) through subordinated perpetual security bonds issued by its wholly-owned subsidiary Network i2i Ltd, proceeds from which will be used for reducing debt and strengthening the carrier’s balance sheet to invest in expanding its 4G network, The Economic Times reported. Fund asset managers, insurance companies, pension funds and banks across Europe, Asia and the US have picked up the bonds, which have been priced on a par with coupon and yield of 5.650%. The proceeds shall be used for deleveraging through refinancing, investments in subsidiaries and general corporate purpose. The perpetual bonds are a quasi-equity obligation without a fixed maturity, which will have a five-and-a-half years non-call period, which means that debt cannot be repaid before this period. The bonds are guaranteed by Bharti Airtel, the company added. They have been rated as BB by Fitch. Barclays Bank, BNP Paribas, Citigroup Global Markets, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, JP Morgan Securities, Merrill Lynch (Singapore) and Standard Chartered Bank were joint bookrunners for this fund raise. This is the ninth time that India’s No. 2 carrier by subscribers has raised money through bonds since 2013, of which all but one tapped international investors. Two of these nine bonds issued matured in 2018. The other six bonds issued earlier, which collectively raised about  ₹43,888 crore, are due in the coming years. Airtel reported a debt of  ₹1.16 lakh crore at the end of June. The company is trying to strengthen its balance sheet by halving debt by the end of this fiscal year, while retaining only its liabilities to the government for spectrum purchased at auction. This will allow it to compete aggressively for subscribers with Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea.
Inventus Cap Closes Third Fund at  ₹369 crore
Inventus Capital Partners has made the final close of its third fund — Inventus-III — at  ₹369 crore, the latest in a line of early-stage, technology-focused funds that have raised fresh capital this year, The Economic Times reported. Inventus-III is the Silicon Valley and Bengaluru-based venture capital firm’s first India-dedicated fund, and is led by its local team, which comprises general partners Samir Kumar, Parag Dhol and Rutvik Doshi. The latest investment vehicle — which had an initial target corpus of  ₹325 crore and which primarily looks to make Series-A bets — has been backed by a mix of institutional investors, such as Small Industries Development Bank of India, family offices and technology entrepreneurs, including founders from its portfolio companies such as Phanindra Sama of red-Bus and Ramesh Emani of Insta Health. Prior to setting up Inventus-III, Inventus Capital Partners had primarily invested through its two US-based funds, which cumulatively had about $158 million under management. Inventus-III made its first close of  ₹200 crore in July last year. The new fund, which typically invests  ₹5-15 crore, has made five investments so far, including in SaaS startup Worxogo, smart helmet accessory maker BluArmor, local experiences and product discovery platform LBB, blockchain-based supply chain app Koinearth and children’s educational toy venture PlayShifu. The fund-III will look to make about 15 investments in total."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday:
Indiabulls Housing: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has rejected the proposed merger of Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd (LVB) with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd (IHF), puncturing the shadow bank’s attempt to get a banking licence. This comes after the RBI in September placed LVB in the prompt corrective action (PCA) list due to inadequate capital ratio, high level of bad loans and negative return on asset (RoA) for two years in a row.
TCS: The IT major will kick start the earnings season for the September quarter on Thursday. This is likely to set the tone and steer the Indian equity market. A slowdown in the economy combined with liquidity concerns in non-banking financial companies(NBFCs) may not bode well for the earnings season. IndusInd Bank Ltd will also announce its earnings today.
RIL: Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio on Wednesday announced it will charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks, but will compensate them by giving free data of equal value. The decision came in the wake of regulatory uncertainty over review of sunset clause for call termination charges.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: Shares of the bank are seen under pressure as RBI has rejected its proposed merger with IHF. The stock has lost 71% value since the all-stock merger was announced in April. The bank has been placed in the PCA list as it is way below the capital adequacy, RoA and non-performing asset (NPA) thresholds.
Yes Bank: The private lender was the top loser in Wednesday’s trade. Shares tanked after the company declined commenting on a Mint report that the bank was in talks with Microsoft Corp to raise funds. The bank said it was not aware of the news source. The stock has been losing value due to concern over exposure to stressed sectors, especially housing-finance companies, and weak financials of the bank.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Wednesday said it has raised $750 million (about  ₹5,330 crore) from investors based in Asia, Europe and the US through a hybrid financial instrument. The telecom operator will use the proceeds for refinancing, investments in subsidiaries and general corporate purpose.
Lupin: The pharmaceutical company has received a good manufacturing practice (GMP) certificate from Japan’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) for its bulk drug manufacturing facility at Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh. The certificate was issued after PMDA did not make any critical observation in an inspection at Mandideep Unit II from May 14-17, 2019.
JBM Auto: Shares of JBM Auto Ltd surged, ending up 20% on Wednesday after the company said it had received orders for supply of 300 buses. In an exchange filing, the company said it has bagged orders from Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System Limited (DIMTS), Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport Corporation (NMMTC) and two airline companies.
MTNL: Shares of the state-owned telecom company have been under pressure as the finance ministry is not keen on infusing fresh capital to bail out Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL). According to a Financial Express report, the ministry has rejected a massive bail-out package worth Rs.74,000 crore sought by the Department of Telecommunications to revive the debt-ridden company.
Bank of Maharashtra: The state-owned bank on Wednesday said the RBI has denied permission to settle its accumulated losses of  ₹7,360 crore against the balance lying in its share premium account and revenue reserve account."
224,2019-10-11,Airtel,"Haryana is the the second telecom circle after Kolkata to see the discontinuation of 3G services by AirtelAirtel will continue to provide 2G services in Haryana to serve the connectivity needs of customers on feature phones

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel has shut down its 3G network in Haryana and its mobile broadband services will now be available to customers on the 4G network, the company said.
Haryana is the the second telecom circle after Kolkata to see the discontinuation of 3G services by Airtel.
“Customers who are yet to upgrade their 3G handsets/SIMs will continue to get access to voice services. Airtel will continue to provide 2G services in Haryana to serve the connectivity needs of customers on feature phones,"" the company said.
In August this year, the company had said that will shut down its 3G network across India’s 22 telecom circles by March 2020, and increase its focus on providing 4G services.
The company started the process in July, when it wound down the 3G network in the Kolkata circle. It, however, continues to provide 2G services for feature phone users.
“This has worked very well in Kolkata. Now we will do this process across India. By September, we will shut down six to seven circles and by March, the entire 3G network pan-India will shut down,"" Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said in the post-earnings call with analysts in August.
This marks the first phase-out of the 3G technology in India, which is now increasingly moving to 4G, triggered by the entry of 4G-only Reliance Jio in September 2016. Rival Vodafone Idea continues to provide 2G, 3G and 4G services.
In Kolkata, Airtel has already reformed the 900MHz spectrum band, used for 3G, to strengthen its 4G network. The telecom operator is deploying L900 technology in the 900MHz band to complement its 4G services in the 2300MHz and 1800MHz bands.
The move, Airtel expects, will improve 4G availability inside buildings and coverage across homes in Kolkata.
However, the company does not expect much cost savings by shutting down 3G as it would continue to use the same equipment to offer 4G services."
226,2019-10-11,Airtel,"Shares of IndusInd Bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarterInfosys will report its second quarter earnings today

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may remain in focus on Friday:
TCS: The IT major, in its July-September earnings announced on Thursday, reported a constant currency revenue growth of 8.4% year-on-year, missing the Street's estimate of 9-9.5%. This may not bode well for the stock. The company along with IndusInd Bank Ltd kick started the earnings season for the September quarter and is likely to set the mood for the Indian equity market.
Yes Bank: The private lender on Thursday said it has appointed Anita Pai as its chief operating officer and Jasneet Bachal as chief marketing officer. Despite the announcement, shares remained in the red due to worries over the bank’s exposure to stressed sectors, mainly housing finance companies (HFCs) and weak financials.
IndusInd Bank: Shares of the bank slumped more than 6% on Thursday after it announced its earnings for the September quarter. Though the bank saw a 52% year-on-year jump in net profit, a sharp rise in provisions dragged the stock lower. The net profit number also missed analysts’ estimate. The bank’s exposure to a large HFC has been weighing on the investor sentiment.
Lupin: The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has pulled up Lupin Ltd for failing to maintain records of batches of manufactured medicines and their sales at the company’s Tarapur plant. The regulator also pointed out that the batch production and control records at the plant do not include complete information relating to production and control of each batch.
Indiabulls Housing: Shares of the company plunged on Thursday, closing down more than 19% as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) rejected its proposed merger with Lakshmi Vilas Bank. This has spoiled the non-bank’s plans to get a banking licence amid concerns over tight liquidity and weak asset quality faced by housing finance companies.
Lakshmi Vilas Bank: The stock hit an all-time low on Thursday and was locked in the lower circuit limit of 5% at Rs.25.65 on the BSE as the Reserve Bank did not approve its merger with Indiabulls Housing Finance Ltd. In September, the bank was placed under the prompt corrective action list by the RBI for not meeting certain regulatory thresholds.
Infosys: The IT company will report its second quarter earnings today. Experts believe that this earnings season may not do well due to weakness in demand that has led to a slowdown in the economy along with liquidity crisis that has affected the non-banking financial companies, automobile and real estate sectors.
Bharti Airtel: The company on Thursday was the top gainer among the Nifty 50 stocks as investors cheered Reliance Jio’s announcement that it will end free voice calls. The most profitable operator Jio will now charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival phone networks.
SpiceJet: The company on Thursday said no cracks have been found in its fleet of older Boeing 737 NG after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation ordered inspections following a similar move from the US Federal Aviation Administration's to conduct checks for structural cracks on a portion of the 737 fleet operating in the country.
IOB: Indian Overseas Bank said on Thursday it would reduce the interest rates in retail and micro small and medium enterprises by 25 basis points with effect from 1 November. This after the RBI cut the key lending rate by 25 basis points in the October monetary policy meeting."
225,2019-10-11,Airtel,"Vodafone which paid  ₹4,214 crore followed by Airtel at  ₹3,411 crore and Jio at  ₹2,809 croreThe IUC charges are paid for off-net calls to the operator on whose network a call terminates

GURUGRAM :
The telecom operators paid a total of  ₹11,838 crore as IUC or interconnect user charges in 2018, led by Vodafone which paid  ₹4,214 crore followed by Airtel at  ₹3,411 crore and Jio at  ₹2,809 crore, a new report by market research firm techARC said on Friday.
BSNL/MTNL paid  ₹1,405 crore as IUC charges, said the techINSIGHT report which is based on TRAI's annual report published in September this year.
With Reliance Jio announcing 6 paise per minute charge for voice calls to rival networks, Vodafone Idea termed the announcement ""an action of undue haste"" and Airtel termed the Mukesh Ambani-owned company's move a forced tactics to reduce interconnection charges.
The IUC charges are paid for off-net calls to the operator on whose network a call terminates.
In 2018, Vodafone-Idea, Airtel and Jio paid 35 per cent, 29 per cent and 24 per cent of the total amount of  ₹11,838 crore, respectively.
""While Jio has invested in an all-IP network to support offering free voice calls --the disruption it entered with -- incumbents are still not pure IP networks,"" said Faisal Kawoosa, Founder &amp; Chief Analyst, techARC.
""VoLTE enablement is still an ongoing process for other operators, thus would require IUC to offset the infrastructure cost they bear on terminating a call,"" he added.
The average outgoing MoUs (minutes of usage) per annum were 312 minutes in 2018, out of which 84.01 per cent of the usage terminates on another wireless network.
Currently, an operator pays a little over  ₹100 per annum per subscriber as IUC to other operators, which is a little over  ₹8 per month.
Also, the subscriber number range for the three main operators isn't too wide that would make one operator benefit more than the other, the findings showed.
On account of taking a hit of  ₹13,500 crore due to network connection charges, or interconnet usage charges (IUC), Reliance Jio on Wednesday said it would charge customers 6 paise per minute for voice calls made to rival networks till IUC charges were eliminated.
It's the first time that Jio users will pay for voice calls, free since September 2016.
According to Kawoosa, there has to be a different mechanism to be worked out regarding IUC where nobody loses money and there is harmony among operators.
""One possible way could be allowing operators to charge a flat monthly fee per subscriber that they can offset the IUC against. Instead of settling interconnect charges, they would be deducting at source,"" said Faisal.

223,2019-10-13,Airtel,"Mittal and Ambani are expected to give the expo a miss at a time when their telecom companies engage in a fresh battle over interconnect usage chargesAmbani’s Reliance Jio and Mittal’s Bharti Airtel last week again locked horns over the interconnect usage charge

New Delhi: India Inc titans Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries and Sunil Mittal of Bharti Enterprises will be missing in attendance at the largest stage of the country’s telecom sector — India Mobile Congress.
The two have managed to draw crowds at the first two editions of the expo in 2017 and 2018 where they shared stage and addressed each other as ‘dear friends’.
The three-day India Mobile Congress, which is the country’s attempt to showcase it as a vibrant telecom market and woo investors, starts on Monday.
Mittal and Ambani are expected to give the expo a miss at a time when their telecom companies engage in a fresh battle over interconnect usage charges.
Ambani’s Reliance Jio and Mittal’s Bharti Airtel last week again locked horns over the interconnect usage charge.
The fresh war of words between the two operators erupted when last week Jio, India’s only profitable telecom operator, said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers.
Jio said it “had been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
Jio’s move came three weeks after Trai on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
immediately after Jio’s announcement to charge for calls, Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said that one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel had then said.
Meanwhile, Jio has said these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC."

New Delhi: From a connected car that keeps tabs on your driver through voice command to a miniature version of an airport that runs on next generation 5G technology, telecom equipment manufacturers and service providers are set to showcase a range of 5G applications at the third edition of the India Mobile Congress in New Delhi on Monday.
Top executives of telecom operators will attend the inaugural session of the three-day flagship event, to be also attended by Telecom Minister Ravi Shanker Prasad and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal will also be present.
Huawei, which is under scrutiny worldwide over 5G network security concerns, will showcase a tiny glimpse of a 5G connected airport, apart from other smart transport solutions.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio will demonstrate solutions from their internet of things ecosystem and some industrial 5G applications.
India’s largest operator by subscriber base Vodafone Idea will demonstrate consumer IoT solutions apart from connected car Kia Seltos which has 37 smart features under five separate sections -- navigation, safety and security, vehicle management, remote control and convenience.
The smart features include, AI voice command, stolen vehicle tracking and immobilization, auto collision notification, SOS-emergency assistance, remote engine start and stop, remotely operated air purifier and in-car air quality monitor.
It will also come equipped with safety alerts for geo fence, time fence, speed and valet.
Simply put, a connected car has seamless connectivity to the internet which enables a host of features which can make driving an easier and safer experience. A user can also get notifications on fuel usage, over-speeding and prevent accidents through smart emergency brakes.
Bharti Airtel, on the other hand, will demonstrate industrial applications for smart factories and solutions for smart cities such as such as adaptive traffic control system, pollution check, traffic enforcement system, street lighting and smart signages, etc. It will also showcase connected car MG Hector.Through India Mobile Congress, the government aims to promote India as a vibrant telecom market.
The event is being held against the backdrop of a bitter war of words that erupted last week after Jio said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers.
The operator said it “has been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
Jio’s rival Airtel said the move is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. Vodafone Idea said that this seemed like the consultative process by Trai is being challenged and is potentially drawing attention away from the real issue that the industry is in deep financial stress."
221,2019-10-14,Airtel,"'We seek an enabling regulatory environment so that we can make the necessary investment in this sector''We look forward to working with the government to take the leap for the next wave of growth'

New Delhi: The telecom sector needs an enabling regulatory environment as the growth of the sector is key to the digital transformation of the Indian economy, industry leader Kumar Mangalam Birla said on Monday.
Birla is the chairman of Vodafone Idea Ltd — India’s largest telecom operator by subscriber base.
“We seek an enabling regulatory environment so that we can make the necessary investment in this sector...we look forward to working with the government to take the leap for the next wave of growth,"" Birla said in his speech at the inauguration of the India Mobile Congress.
The statement comes in the backdrop of the latest war of words that has emerged between Reliance Jio and rivals Airtel and Vodafone Idea after the telecom regulator sought to review the move to scrap interconnect usage charges. Jio wants IUC to be scrapped as it is a cost for it, while Airtel and Vodafone Idea want the 6 paise a minute charge to continue as both earn revenue from the charge.
The three-day India Mobile Congress is India’s attempt to showcase itself as a vibrant telecom market and woo investors
Kumar Mangalam Birla’s statement comes two weeks Vodafone Group chairman Gerard Kleisterlee and CEO Nick Read came to India.
The two executives were expected to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad but could not as Modi was in Chennai while Prasad was in Bihar monitoring the flood situation. Instead, Read and Kleisterlee had a half-an-hour meeting with telecom secretary Anshu Prakash. Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar was also present at the meeting.
Vodafone has sought lowering of levies paid to the government and easier payment schedule for spectrum purchases.
Birla’s statement also assumes significance given the loss-making Indian entity has been witnessing a fall in revenue generation streams, and comes over two months after Vodafone Idea Ltd, which is in the midst of a complex integration process, said its chief executive Balesh Sharma has resigned citing “personal reasons"" and was replaced by Takkar.
Sharma’s exit came less than a year after the merged entity started operations on 31 August 2018. The merged company has since lost market share and posted losses in every quarter of the past year, amid a bruising tariff war.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular announced their merger in March 2017 in response to the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016.
Vodafone Idea has so far completed the network integration process in 11 of 22 circles and hopes to complete the rest by June 2020. Despite the merger, Vodafone Idea has been facing a rough ride, with shrinking revenue and gross debt of  ₹1.2 trillion as on 30 June.
Since the completion of the merger, the company has lost subscribers every month. Its active subscriber base declined from 334.1 million in the March quarter to 320 million in the June quarter.
Because of the customer churn that was triggered by the introduction of minimum monthly recharge plans in November to weed out low-paying users, Vodafone Idea’s revenue fell 4.3% to  ₹11,269.9 crore in the June quarter from  ₹11,775 crore in the preceding three months.
The telecom operator had posted a loss of  ₹4,873.9 crore in the June quarter, despite witnessing higher data consumption on its network and signing up more 4G subscribers.
Before that, the company posted a loss of  ₹4,881.9 crore in the March quarter,  ₹5,004.6 crore loss in the three months ended December, and  ₹4,973.8 crore in the September quarter."
220,2019-10-14,Airtel,"Minister’s remarks come as a relief to debt-laden telecom firms clamouring for lower spectrum pricesDoT will review prices, said Ravi Shankar Prasad at the India Mobile Congress

New Delhi: The government is aware of the concerns raised by mobile service providers about expensive spectrum, Union telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, adding the department of telecommunications (DoT) will review prices and expects to see a healthy competition among operators for upcoming auctions.
Prasad’s statement comes as a relief to telecom operators clamouring for lower spectrum prices as they struggle with rising debt, mainly on account of airwaves bought in previous auctions, amid a brutal tariff war.
“Spectrum auction will be conducted in this financial year (2019-20) itself. We are also in the process of undertaking some reform in the spectrum pricing,"" Prasad said at the inaugural session of India Mobile Congress (IMC).
Apart from 4G spectrum, India is planning its first auction of 5G airwaves this year.
The government did not auction any spectrum in 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, it raised  ₹65,789 crore through the sale of spectrum at base price, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum it had offered for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44 megahertz (MHz) across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965 MHz. There were no takers for 4G spectrum in the 700 Mhz band.
Telecom operators have always complained that compared to the rest of the world, airwaves in India are priced exorbitantly. In fact, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal in February said the telecom company would not buy any spectrum at the base prices suggested by the telecom regulator in the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, the first band identified for 5G in the country.
Even after the DoT asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in July to review reserve prices of spectrum that it had suggested in August last year given the government’s objectives of deploying 5G for social sectors and ensuring broadband for all, the regulator stuck to the spectrum pricing architecture it had suggested earlier.
“Prices for 5G spectrum need to be critically looked at,"" said Mahendra Nahata, board member, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. “Higher floor prices will lead to 5G networks being unviable and therefore getting delayed. An equilibrium, therefore, needs to be established between government revenue and overall growth,"" Nahata said at the inaugural session of IMC, now in its third edition.
Jio also urged the government to avoid long delays in spectrum auction and ensure that airwaves are continuously available to operators between two auctions.
Vodafone Idea chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla sought an “enabling regulatory environment"" in the telecom sector so that companies can make the “necessary investments"".
Mukesh Ambani of Reliance Industries and Sunil Mittal of Bharti Enterprises skipped the IMC, the first time in its three years. Ambani’s daughter Isha and son Akash, and Mittal’s son and founder of Hike Messenger Kavin Mittal, who were expected to participate in a panel on “next generation leaders"" were absent as well.
The absence of top leaders at the expo comes at a time when their telecom companies engage in a fresh battle over the interconnect usage charges. The war of words erupted last week when Jio, India’s only profitable telecom operator, said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep calls free. IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks."
218,2019-10-14,Airtel,"It comes as relief for India’s telecom industry that the government is ready to revise the manner in which air waves are allotted. Let’s hope it spells good news for the rest of us too

Telecom companies would be relieved by the government’s assurance that it will review the pricing mechanism of radio frequencies that carry the voice and data traffic of over a billion people. Telecommunications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad’s statement at the India Mobile Congress, an industry gathering, that policymakers were alive to the industry’s concerns and were instituting a process to reform the pricing of spectrum is likely to revive flagging interest in auctions slated for later this fiscal year. Mobile service operators had previously indicated that the base prices of air waves that were to go under the hammer in this round were exorbitant. Older telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are already laden with large debts incurred in bidding for spectrum at earlier auctions, and had indicated that they might have to sit out this round if the minimum bid prices arrived at by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, or Trai, were not lowered significantly. Also, they argued, not enough radio frequencies were being put up for sale for the country’s networks to shift to fifth generation (5G) telecom services.
Now that Prasad has indicated that base prices are not yet final and that they would be reviewed, the Cellular Operators Association of India, an industry lobby, could pat itself on the back. The regulator had refused to reconsider its price estimates for upcoming auctions despite it being pointed out that air waves were being sold in India at rates that were almost four times those in other countries. Trai had argued that its projections were based on a holistic appraisal of circumstances. For Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, both involved in a bruising price war with new entrant Reliance Jio since 2016, that stance was a deep disappointment. Having lost nearly all their pricing power, telecom service operators were in no position to pass on the costs of high spectrum fees to subscribers. Analysts had even forecast tepid interest in spectrum for 4G services, given that Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have excess radio frequencies for these and their networks are still being rolled out. Half their subscribers are still on 2G and 3G networks, which make for high carriage charges.
The government, however, is not solely to blame for expensive spectrum, although successive regimes have displayed an inordinate dependence on the sale of radio frequencies to shore up their capital receipts. Air waves are a scarce national resource, and, in general, the Centre has tried assorted methods to allot them. At various stages, India has rationed radio frequencies, made companies queue up for them, and put them up for auction. As a result, the country’s telecom market has undergone several transformations, with all twists and turns leading to the conclusion that auctions were the most efficient mechanism. This has meant that top bidders suffer the so-called “winner’s curse"", often having overpaid for spectrum. This time around, this is what needs to be guarded against. As the government gets down to revisit the process, apart from reducing base prices, perhaps it could consider auction models that are specifically designed to overcome that curse. High spectrum prices cannot co-exist with cheap mobile telephony for too long. Something has to give. Let’s hope it’s not service charges. Low-cost communication helps turn the economy competitive. But for that, the market needs to be bustling with competition. Cheap spectrum could enable that."

New Delhi: Ericsson and Airtel enabled a 5G powered ‘Connected Music’ performance during the inauguration of the India Mobile Congress (IMC) 2019 on Monday. A first for India, the show involved connecting two parts of a musical performance using a live 5G network and presenting it as one, for live audiences at both locations. One half of the performance had the singer and music composer, Siddharth Shankar Mahadevan perform ‘Jai Ho’ from the film ‘Slum Dog Millionaire’, while a Swedish band played at the Ericsson booth, about 100 meters away.
The demonstration showcased how 5G can develop robust and efficient ways of creating immersive experiences, giving audiences the feeling of immediacy.
The ultra-low latency of the 5G network powered the connected music showcase at the IMC. According to the company, this remote music collaboration in real time is a boon for the performing art industry as it helps eliminate travel time and the costs that limit collaboration, performance, practice and learning. It also increases productivity for professionals in the music industry, including producers, event organizers and teachers. The performance highlights how 5G can transform interaction with the arts and opens new opportunities for industries.
Nunzio Mirtillo, Head of Ericsson South East Asia, Oceania and India said: “We have been studying the impact 5G technology will have on industries across the world.

NEW DELHI :
Interconnect usage charge (IUC) is not related to the tariff charged by telecom operators from users and is simply a bilateral arrangement between operators, Bharti Airtel chief executive Gopal Vittal said on Tuesday.
“IUC has nothing to do with tariff. It’s a clearing house for the cost of carrying the call. It’s a bilateral thing between carriers,"" Vittal said on the sidelines of a session at the India Mobile Congress on Tuesday.
Vittal’s statement comes a week after a fresh war of words erupted between Airtel and Reliance Jio after the latter, India’s only profitable telecom operator, said it will start charging for calls made to rival networks at 6 paise a minute, reneging on a promise to keep voice calls free for its customers.
Jio said it “had been compelled most reluctantly and unavoidably"" to do this following the decision of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to review the date for scrapping interconnect usage charge from 1 January 2020, which has led to regulatory uncertainty.
“Over the last 20 years, the IUC has always been absorbed in the cost of doing business and the tariff is what it is,"" Vittal said.
Jio’s move came three weeks after Trai on 18 September floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
“As far as IUC is concerned, there is a consultation paper that Trai has released. We await the outcome of that,"" Vittal said.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls.
As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
Immediately after Jio’s announcement to charge for calls, Bharti Airtel, without naming Jio, said that one of its competitors suggested that Trai reopen this issue, while the regulator had in September 2017 already said it might undertake an exercise to revisit the matter at a later date.
“Clearly, this off net charge being levied, therefore, is to force IUC to be brought down despite the heavy burden it puts in the receiving network. We are grateful that this very timely consultation paper to reassess IUC has been issued by Trai,"" Airtel had then said.
Jio has said that these charges will only continue till the time the regulator abolishes IUC."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel today said it had resumed postpaid mobile services in Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) on the orders of the authorities. The service provider has waived off rental charges for the period the services were suspended.
""Mobile phone connections, to be specific, all postpaid mobile phone connections, irrespective of service provider, will resume from Monday - October 14th at noon. This will happen across the state, in all 10 districts of Kashmir,"" J&K Principal Secretary Rohit Kansal had said at a news briefing Monday.
The Centre had ended J&K’s special status on August 5 and split it into two union territories (UT) of J&K and Ladakh, saying the move would help ensure that people of the state get the same constitutional benefits as the rest of the country and spur development.
J&K is now a UT with a Delhi-like legislative assembly. Ladakh has no legislative assembly, much like Chandigarh.
Mobile services were suspended in August the wake of the dilution of Article 370 and Article 35-A that gave the troubled state special status under the Indian constitution.
Curbs on movement of people and security restrictions have been in place ever since the special status was withdrawn. Politicians belonging to rival parties were either locked up in jail or put under house arrest to prevent any untoward incident.
Some of the curbs are now being relaxed. An advisory preventing tourists from visiting the state was lifted on Thursday."

New Delhi: The telecom regulator's move to re-examine the decision of scrapping interconnect usage charges from 1 January, 2020 is a regressive step and will further the digital divide in the country, a top Jio official said on Tuesday.
""Starting a fresh consultation process just 3 months before the date to implement the decision (to scrap IUC) is an incentivisation programme to continue to keep 400 million customers on 2G networks without digital connectivity,"" Jio’s President-Networks, Mathew Oommen said in an interview.
""This is not a progressive technology adoption process,"" Oommen said, adding that the concept of point of interconnect and interconnect usage charge is related to 2G technology and hence obsolete.
Oommen's scathing attack on the regulator comes in the midst of a fresh battle that has erupted among operators after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India last month said that it would start fresh consultation with stakeholders to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea have welcomed Trai's regulatory rethink.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to six paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020. Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
""If IUC is not scrapped, it is unfair to the carrier and to the customers...There are 400 million people that are still on 2G networks and hence digitally unconnected...the guys (telcos) in the 2G world are thinking about IUC,"" he said, adding that the industry will become obsolete if operators don't invest in their 4G networks.
""Why are incumbent operators managing several networks,"" Oommen said.
IUC, at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks. Scrapping the IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator such as Jio which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
Jio however believes the IUC will subsidize operators which manage inefficient, voice-only networks.
""2G customers at the bottom of the pyramid who recharge for 20 or 30 rupees are the ones continue to pay for voice calls. Tariffs plans above  ₹120 are unlimited plans so you don't know what you are being charged for (voice or data),"" he said.
Jio is the only pure-4G network in India. Vodafone Idea operate 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Airtel operates 2G and 4G and is in the process of phasing out 3G networks by March 2020.
""The industry, the regulator, and the whole framework have to together decide when we move from 2G to 4G rather than deliberating now about 5G because if you don’t have the baseline of all IT and all VoLTE, I’m not sure how you will do 5G,"" Oommen said."

NEW DELHI :
Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson on Wednesday signed a deal with Bharti Airtel to deploy its 5G-ready Cloud packet core in the domestic telecom major's network in the country.

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd are masquerading fixed landline numbers as mobile numbers to earn undue revenue through the interconnect usage charge.
In a letter to the telecom regulator, Jio has alleged this is a fraudulent attempt by incumbent telecom operators for which they must be penalised.
“The incumbent operators have implemented a process under which various enterprises are offered mobile numbers as their customer care or helpline numbers. In these cases, the mobile number is used just as a virtual number for routing all such calls to call centres,"" Jio said in a letter dated 14 October.
Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
This exercise, Jio has alleged, changes the nature of the call from ‘mobile to wireline’ to ‘mobile to mobile’ which is a “fraudulent attempt"" made by incumbent operators to illegally extract the interconnect usage charge at 6 paise a minute.
This fresh letter from Jio comes in the midst of the latest controversy over the IUC which has erupted after TRAI last month said it will review its decision to scrap IUC from 1 January 2020. The regulator has floated a consultation paper to deliberate on this matter with stakeholders.
IUC, which has been set at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator like Jio with more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. As of June-end, 64% of Jio’s total traffic was outgoing.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea would stand to gain if Trai decides to postpone the date of scrapping IUC as these telecom operators get more incoming calls than outgoing.
With the fresh letter, Jio has also alleged that incumbent operators are not only earning IUC revenue illegally but are also denying Jio of the revenue it should earn at 52 paise a minute that originating operators earn for calls made to universal access and toll-free numbers.
“We suspect that thousands of such numbers are operational in the market deployed by incumbent operators,"" Jio said in the letter.
“Such illegal, fraudulent and cheating practice has resulted in millions of minutes originating on Jio network getting considered as mobile terminating minutes instead of wireline termination, not only causing huge loss in hundreds of crores to Jio and undue enrichment to incumbent operators but also to influence the authority on apparent traffic asymmetry between Jio and incumbents, which is the only reason cited by the authority to review IUC regulations,"" Jio alleged."
210,2019-10-17,Airtel,"Vodafone Idea has batted for the ringer time to be set at 30 secondsThis was a tit-for-tat move after its bitter rival Jio did the same

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio locked horns again on Thursday over how long should a voice call ring on your mobile phone even as the telecom regulator is set to issue a regulation on this matter in two weeks.
While Bharti Airtel wants the ringing time be set at 45 seconds and has argued that networks receiving the call must be allowed sufficient time, Jio has batted for a reduction in this to 20-25 seconds stating that this will save spectrum resources.
After floating a consultation paper on the matter on 16 September, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India on Thursday conducted an open house discussion with stakeholders.
Last month, Airtel, the country’s second-ranked operator by revenue, shot off a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, saying that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
This was a tit-for-tat move after its bitter rival Jio did the same.
“Every second reduction on the ringing time saves spectrum resources for us,"" Mahipal Singh, Associate Vice-President of Jio, said on Thursday.
“94% calls on Jio’s network are answered within 25 seconds,"" he said, adding that the ringer time should be outside regulatory intervention.
Rival Airtel, on the other hand, said that the timer should be set based on the preference of the network which is receiving the phone call.
“The time taken to terminate the call on a network should be uniform across networks. And the terminating or receiving network should be allowed sufficient time to answer the call. This should be 45 seconds,"" Ravi Gandhi, Chief Regulatory Officer, Bharti Airtel, said.
If these ringing timers are set differently by different network operators, the chances of answering the call by user of one network would be different from the user of another network as one party would get more time to answer the call than the other party.
Also, every call that lands on a mobile network fetches it money. The interconnect usage charge or IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, and is a source of revenue for telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone Idea who enjoy more incoming traffic than outgoing.
At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute.
Interestingly, Jio, which reduced its outgoing call ringer time to 25 seconds, has more outgoing traffic than incoming. Jio’s outgoing traffic is 64% of its total voice traffic, as of June end.
Airtel had last month alleged that by Jio reducing its outgoing call ringing time, the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on the rival network network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio.
“Reducing the call ringing time and hence reducing traffic asymmetry artificially is not the way to go,"" Gandhi said.
Jio, however, has argued that globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice.
It is important to note that the timer for domestic calls is not regulated by any authority in India at present. Operators have the freedom to choose the ringer timers.
Vodafone Idea has batted for the ringer time to be set at 30 seconds.
“Networks where a call originates should not have any timer. This timer should be set only for terminating or receiving networks,"" Sundeep Kathuria, Executive Vice-President, Policy and Regulation, Regulatory Affairs, Vodafone Idea, said at the open house.
The ringing time also impacts network efficiency. The maximum time allowed to answer the call takes on more importance as the alerting phase also engages scarce radio spectrum resources. Ringing for a long time, when a user is unlikely to accept the phone call, would led to non-optimal utilization of resources.
The reverse also has implications. Configuring duration of ringing time on lower side might save resources but on the other hand it may cause concerns related to network performance, if duration is much lower than the typical time one takes to answer the call."

NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India will soon issue a regulation on what should be the ideal time that a voice call should ring on your mobile phone.
“We will issue this within 2 weeks. It could be a regulation or we could also issue a recommendation to the concerned department,"" a senior Trai official said requesting anonymity.
Last month, Airtel, the country’s second-ranked operator by revenue, shot off a letter to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, saying that it has cut the ringing time for outgoing calls on a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
This was a tit-for-tat move after its bitter rival Jio did the same. Airtel said it had to take this step as despite its repeated requests, Trai has neither directed Jio to restore the timer to its original duration of 45 seconds nor issued a direction to operators to set the timer to 30 seconds as proposed by most operators.
Trai had on 16 September floated a consultation paper on the matter.
Trai also seeks to find out whether customers need to be offered options to change or modify the duration of ringing time particularly for them.
If these ringing timers are set differently by different network operators, the chances of answering the call by user of one network would be different from the user of another network as one party would get more time to answer the call than the other party.

It is important to note that the timer for domestic calls is not regulated by any authority in India. Operators have the freedom to choose the ringer timers.
Jio also said that there is no need for any regulatory intervention in this matter.
“In case Trai still decides to fix a value for the alert timer, it should be done only post a detailed study by a technical committee comprising of experts from department of telecommunications and Telecommunication Engineering Centre,"" Jio said in its comments on the consultation paper floated by Trai.
There is no logic of keeping these limits on the higher side as mobile handsets are usually kept close to the user, Jio has said, adding that the optimum value of this timer is 20-25 seconds.
Airtel wants this ringer time set at 40 seconds. Vodafone Idea says the minimum ringing timer should be retained at 30 seconds.
“We strongly recommend a minimum value of 30 seconds for ringing timer at terminating side, to be uniformly applied by all operators for mobile networks which will ensure high call success in first attempt and help improve customer satisfaction,"" Vodafone Idea has told Trai.

What took shape was the outcome of the 2017 summer cohort of JioGenNext, a startup accelerator backed by RIL.
Not only did RIL guide Logisure by alerting them to all the “logistics challenges they face"" but it “also made us a part of their initiatives to optimize their logistics"", said Sethia.
JioGenNext has mentored 131 startups including Udaan Logisure in agritech, digital consumer services, edtech, fintech, healthtech, fitness, and retail with more than $60 million of funding raised.
Udaan Logisure is a case in point that the startup ecosystem has never had it better. Thousands of aspiring unicorns across India are being nurtured by multinational and homegrown companies, including Bharti Airtel, Reliance Industries, Accenture Ventures, Google, Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle. Besides mentoring the founders, companies are also acqui-hiring many of these early- and growth-stage startups for their domain expertise.
In 2017, Bharti Airtel Ltd acquired a strategic stake in Juggernaut Books and a strategic equity stake in Seynse Technologies, a fintech company. In 2018, the telecom company announced an acqui-hire deal with AuthMe ID Services, a Bengaluru-based AI startup. The Accenture Ventures programme that seeks to provide Indian startups a global platform tracks more than a thousand business-to-business (B2B) deep-tech startups at any given time, said Avnish Sabharwal, managing director (MD), Accenture Ventures and Open Innovation in India and the Middle-East.
“In India, we track more than 1,300 B2B deep-tech startups, engage with nearly 200 startups and have deployed more than 100 startup solutions with clients in the last financial year. We work with B2B growth-stage, deep-tech startups using disruptive technologies such as AI (artificial intelligence), analytics, blockchain, IoT (Internet of Things), and automation,"" said Sabharwal.

In a letter written to Trai, the telecom operator said that if the authority does not scrap IUC, there will be little incentive for mobile service providers to invest in technology migration as long as the returns are assured to them in the form of this subsidy.
“The consultation paper aids and abets sabotage of the Prime Minister’s Digital India mission because it protects and perpetuates the vested interests of certain incumbent telecom operators who do want their large body of 2G customers to forever remain digitally disempowered and deprived of the fruits of the Digital Revolution,"" Jio said in the letter dated 18 October.
Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
The letter contains Jio’s official response to the consultation paper floated by Trai on 18 September to see if there is a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC from 1 January, 2020, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to six paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020.
Telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
IUC, at 6 paise a minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping the IUC or reducing it would benefit an operator such as Jio which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are currently battling shrinking revenue streams thanks to Jio’s cut-throat tariffs, have welcomed Trai's regulatory rethink.
Jio, however, has alleged that perfect traffic symmetry is statistically impossible and Trai’s rethink will result in “protectionism which is bound to result into technology stagnation"" which will jeopardise Digital India programme.
In a scathing attack on the regulator, Jio has also said that it is “unfortunate that instead of profiting the poor and marginalised sections of Indian society, the consultation paper has chosen to help profiteers in the telecom business"".
Jio, which is the newest entrant and the only profitable telecom operator, has also alleged that incumbent operators are deliberately keeping users on 2G networks and that the date to scrap IUC – 1 January, 2020, must be adhered to.
“This is a malicious intent to keep a large number of subscribers on the per minute calling plans by forcing them to use 2G voice technology and ensuring they make missed calls to Jio’s network in order to perpetuate traffic asymmetry which can be used to justify the continued use of the subsidy given to them in form of IUC charges,"" Jio said.
Jio is the only pure-4G network in India. Vodafone Idea operates 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Airtel operates 2G and 4G and is in the process of phasing out 3G networks by March 2020."

NEW DELHI :
More cracks have emerged in the already divided telecom sector with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in favour of scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from next year, while Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, or BSNL, opposing the move.
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had recently floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC from 1 January 2020, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are currently battling shrinking revenue, thanks to Jio’s cut-throat tariffs, have welcomed Trai’s regulatory rethink.
Jio, however, said it believes this rethink to scrap IUC was unwarranted, arbitrary and anti-poor, and not only affects the credibility of the authority, but also sabotages the government’s Digital India mission.
“We firmly recommend that the applicable date for Bill and Keep regime be moved by at least three years,"" Airtel said in its comments on Trai’s consultation paper.
Under the Bill and Keep regime, operators do not pay any charge to each other for receiving calls on their network. Simply put, Bill and Keep means scrapping IUC.
IUC, at 6 paise per minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC, or reducing it, would benefit Jio, which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
Airtel has backed the extension as it believes that traffic symmetry has not been achieved. Vodafone Idea, too, has said in its comments that there was a need to extend the applicable date to move to a zero-IUC regime and, wherever Bill and Keep exists, it is based on mutual agreement among operators when there is symmetry in traffic.
However, Jio has alleged that perfect traffic symmetry is statistically impossible and Trai’s rethink will result in “protectionism, which is bound to result into technology stagnation"". This, Jio said, will jeopardize the government’s Digital India programme.
On Monday, Trai uploaded the submissions made by operators on its website. In its comments to the regulator, Jio said if the authority does not scrap IUC, there will be little incentive for mobile service providers to invest in technology migration as long as the returns are assured to them in the form of this subsidy.
Meanwhile, Airtel and Vodafone Idea have said many customers in India still remain on legacy networks. “The projections by GSMA for India also predict that 12-13% of customers will continue to be on 2G handsets till 2025,"" Airtel said.
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to 6 paise per minute from 1 October 2017 from 14 paise earlier and an end to it from 1 January 2020.
The telecom operators, already reeling from a fierce price war that started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, were hit hard by the order. At the time Trai decided to scrap IUC, Airtel, Vodafone and Idea had resisted the change, while Jio was in favour.
“Even after considering that 100% subscribers of new greenfield operator i.e. Jio are on 4G VoLTE, 56% of overall subscribers are on 2G/3G networks... Also, 78% of Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base is on 2G/3G despite 4G VoLTE offered by the company and also competition,"" Vodafone Idea said in its comments to Trai.
State-run BSNL has also urged Trai to reconsider scrapping IUC."

New Delhi: The merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers has been hit by a delay due to to delay in securing government approvals and a new committee will now explore “all possible options"".
“The scheme (of merger) contemplated the closing by October 24, 2019 (long stop date), by which time a large number of processes and conditions precedent were required to be completed, which included but were not limited to all requisite Government approvals and filings,"" Bharti Infratel said in an exchange filing on Monday.
“The Board noted that all the requisite government approvals have not been received till date and conditions precedent and processes not completed. It therefore concluded that it is not possible to complete the scheme by the long stop date. Accordingly, the Board authorized a Committee of Directors to explore and evaluate all possible options to secure the best interests of the company and its shareholders under the current facts and circumstances,"" the company told the exchanges.
The companies had aimed to complete the merger by August, Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta had told analysts at a post-earnings conference call in July.
The two tower companies had in April last year agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company outside China. The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower. The merged company will be listed on the stock exchanges as Bharti Infratel is a publicly traded company. Its nearest rival in India will be ATC, which has 78,000 towers.
The merger will help Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group, promoters of Indus Towers, to sell their stake, bring down debt and invest in their wireless operations in India, which has been facing the heat of a tariff war started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.
Bimal Dayal, chief executive officer, Indus Towers, and Hemant Ruia, chief financial officer, Indus Towers, have been appointed CEO and CFO, respectively, of the merged entity of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel.
Dayal, who had joined Indus Towers as its chief operating officer in 2010, will now be responsible for the combined business and will take forward integration of the two companies in preparation of the merger. He has previously worked with Ericsson and Qualcomm."

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel in its submission to sector regulator Trai has favoured charging incoming calls originating from network of other mobile phone service provider till 2022.
Vodafone Idea and state-owned BSNL have also favoured levying of the interconnect usage charge (IUC), currently 6 paise per minute, on every incoming calls from network of other operators. However, Jio has opposed continuation of the charges.
Trai had proposed to move from the current IUC regime to the BAK (bill and keep), regime where no operator will charge for mobile call transmission, from January 1, 2020. However, the regulator recently floated consultation paper on whether there is a need to defer the date of removing mobile call termination charges.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea have said IUC is a fee charged from a telecom operator for using infrastructure of other service provider to complete call of his subscriber.
""There is a dire need to move the applicable date for BAK (bill and keep) regime by at least 3 years,"" Airtel said in its submission to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).
Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has alleged that review of call connect charges by Trai ""sabotages"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for Digital India and will hit not only the regulator's credibility but also investor confidence, as the move protects vested interests of some old operators.
Any change in implementation of original timeline of January 1, 2020, will end the free voice call regime and is likely to increase tariffs which is against consumer interest, Jio claimed.
Think-tank Broadband India Forum said there is absolutely no need to revise the applicable date of January 1, 2020, for zero termination charge and that it should be firmly held, as earlier scheduled by the Trai.
""Continuing to incentivise or subsidise operators in the form of IUC for managing the significantly less-efficient 2G voice networks will not only be detrimental to consumers, but also adversely impact the growth of all digital players, start-ups, OTTs (over-the-top players), application developers, etc,"" BIF said.
However, Airtel and Vodafone Idea claimed that many users continue to use 2G network, and transmission of calls incurs expenses more than 6 paise per minute fixed by the Trai at present.
IUC has been considered to be applicable in case of 2G and 3G network, while negligible in case of VoLTE which is voice calls using 4G networks.
Trai was under the impression that the reduction of IUC will push operator to deploy modern IP (internet protocol)-based network.
Airtel said it has invested about  ₹40,000 crore into the network only in the past two years but still, 67 per cent subscribers on its network use non-4G devices.
The company said its 4G network currently covers about 93 per cent population as compared to the 94.5 per cent population covered by 2G. Still the adoption of 4G by customers both in terms of migration to 4G handsets and use of VoLTE for voice has been slow primarily due to costlier 4G hand, said the Sunil Bharti Mittal-led firm.
""Out of the total 328 million Airtel customers, only 107 million (33 per cent) are using the 4G–LTE data network. The remaining (67 per cent) are still using non-4G (2G/3G) handsets, as these handsets are more affordable,"" Airtel said.
Vodafone Idea said that even after the roll-out of 4G networks, there is a huge demand for 2G devices with 80 lakh to 1 crore phones being sold every month.
""Thus a large base of consumers in India uses voice only as a service and they are using or buying 2G, 3G devices by choice...Therefore, the consumer behaviour and demand is the reason for the continuing substantial use of circuit switch networks (technology used 2G and 3G networks) for voice,"" Vodafone Idea said.
BSNL said removing of termination charges should be kept in abeyance."
203,2019-10-22,Airtel,"The government, in March last year, enhanced the number of annual instalments for spectrum payment from 10 to 16 yearsThe telecom sector has been battered by falling tariffs, eroding profitability and mounting debt

NEW DELHI :
Private telecom operators Reliance Jio, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have paid the Telecom Department over  ₹4,500 crore in spectrum dues in the last three to four days, according to sources.
Sources said that the payments came in before the due date.
The sparring telcos -- some of which are reeling under acute financial stress and are seeking immediate relief measures -- have made the payment towards deferred spectrum liability (or instalment payment for radiowaves bought in past auctions) which fell due on October 21.
While Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has paid  ₹1,133 crore to the Department of Telecom, Vodafone Idea has made  ₹2,421 crore payment towards spectrum dues. Sunil Mittal's Bharti Airtel has paid  ₹977 crore. Taken together, these three players have paid over  ₹4,531 crore towards spectrum dues late last week.
Emails sent to Reliance Jio and Airtel went unanswered, while a Vodafone Idea spokesperson said that the company does not comment on matters that are business as usual.
The government, in March last year, enhanced the number of annual instalments for spectrum payment from 10 to 16 years to provide a breather to the debt-laden telecom sector.
But with the industry reeling under financial stress, Vodafone Group Chairman Gerard Kleisterlee and CEO Nick Read recently met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, as the company sought a two-year moratorium on deferred spectrum payments, and other relief measures from the government.
The British telecom giant has asserted that it is focused on the successful integration of business between Vodafone and Idea.
The telecom sector has been battered by falling tariffs, eroding profitability and mounting debt in the face of stiff competition triggered by disruptive offerings of Reliance Jio. The industry has been seeking urgent relief such as cut in levies like licence fee and spectrum charges, and release of GST input tax credit locked up with the government.
In a sector stung by policy and regulatory issues, battlelines have been drawn more recently over the contentious matter of call connect charges, where the regulator is reviewing whether or not the zero termination charge regime should be pushed back from the originally-stated timeline of January 1, 2020.
Reliance Jio has alleged that any review of call connect charges by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) ""sabotages"" the Prime Minister's vision for Digital India, and will hit not only the regulator's credibility but also investor confidence as the move protects vested interests of some old operators. Bharti Airtel has favoured continuation of call connect charges till 2022.

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel has displayed fastest download speeds of 9.6 mbps and best video experience across all telecom circles in India, while Reliance Jio has extended its 4G availability to 97 per cent, according to OpenSignal's latest mobile network experience report.
Airtel has excelled in the download speed experience category by scoring 9.6 mbps, followed by Vodafone (7.9 mbps), Idea (7.6 mbps), Jio (6.7 mbps) and 3G-only BSNL (3.1 mbps).
The download speeds are key for streaming of online content, especially videos and games, said mobile analytics company Opensignal.
Latency is crucial for response time. Jio has won the battle on latency with users on its network experiencing response time of 54.2 milliseconds, followed by Airtel at 57.1 milliseconds.
The latencies have improved over the past six months across all operators. As per April 2019 data, Jio's latency was 62.5 milliseconds.
""The lower latency is on a network, the better experience you'll receive on a host of mobile applications and services, from web browsing to voice over IP to real-time multi-player gaming,"" the report says.
Vodafone topped in voice app experience -- a new metric introduced by Opensignal in the latest survey. This captures the quality perceived by users of voice communication mobile apps -- WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype.
Vodafone scored 72.6 that was marginally better than Airtel's 72. Though this parameter is important from the users' point of view, for operators, voice calls made through OTT (over-the-top) apps directly compete with their own voice call services.

The Supreme Court has ruled that private telcos such as Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd need to shell out hefty payouts to the government, on account of license fee dues and penalties. The disputed license fee in question was about Rs23000 crore. But the amount the government was claiming, and is now likely to get as a result of the Supreme Court order, is over Rs90,000 crore, including penalties and interest.
This is a huge blow to the private telcos who have been running losses for the past many quarters, and show no signs of making money in the near future. Vodafone Idea Ltd is likely to find its entire cash balance of about Rs21000 crore at the end of June wiped out as a result of the SC order. Its shares crashed by 26.6% on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday, while those of its peer, Bharti Airtel rose by about 3%, as investors started pricing in the possibility of a two player market.
Incidentally, the government has announced a hefty revival package for ailing public sector telecom firms, BSNL Ltd and MTNL Ltd. The fines can easily fund this package. “These hefty payouts could fund the announced revival package (for BSNL and MTNL) and another two, perhaps, should the need arise,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note to clients on 24 October.
The revival plan involves a merger of the two firms, a fund infusion of Rs20,000 crore by the government, a further Rs30,000 crore burden for a voluntary retirement scheme for employees, besides other measures such as asset monetisation and allotment of 4G spectrum.
As this column had pointed out, Vodafone is already hanging by a thread; with its cash balance expected to run out in a few quarters from now.
Now, questions and concerns about bankruptcy will start appearing sooner than later. “A 3-player market with the post-MTNL merger BSNL being the 3rd one... is a realistic scenario if the Supreme Court judgment in the AGR case goes against the telecom operators,"" analysts at Kotak said in the note ahead of the SC judgment. Worries about debt defaults by telcos have led to a fall in shares of banks such as State Bank of India, which was down over 4% at the time of writing."

The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT), putting an end to a 14-year old legal battle between telecom operators and the government.
This comes as a major blow for telecom operators as they will have to shell out a massive  ₹92,000 crore in past dues at a time when they are already grappling with debt pressure and shrinking revenues.
Telecom operators have asked for a minimum of six months to pay their AGR dues. The apex court said it will consider their request.
While shares of Vodafone Idea slumped 23.4% to end at  ₹4.33, those of Bharti Airtel, which had plunged nearly 6% after the news, recovered and ended more than 3% higher at 372.45 rupees.
""Bharti Airtel shares are up even though it will be impacted by the SC order. This is because investors are pricing in a two-player market, with the assumption that Vodafone Idea will not be able to survive under the weight of the penalty,"" said analysts at two domestic institutional brokerages requesting anonymity.
AGR is the basis on which DoT calculates levies payable by operators and it has been a bone of contention in the sector for over a decade. Telecom operators are liable to pay around 3-5% and 8% of the AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT.
The matter has been under litigation for 14 years with operators arguing that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisting that AGR should include all revenue earned by an operator, including that from non-core telecom operations.
The battle started when telcos migrated to new system offered by the government in 1999 under which operators agreed to share certain percentage of revenue with the government.
The case has seen multiple judgments by telecom tribunals and the final hearing by the Supreme Court was held on 1 August, 2019.
With the government’s win, Bharti Airtel will have to pay  ₹21,682 crore and Vodafone Idea will have to pay  ₹28,308 crore. For Jio, the amount is just  ₹13 crore as it entered the sector only three years ago. This amount includes interest, penalty and interest on penalty ballooning liabilities.
Back in 2005, telecom industry body Cellular Operators Association of India had challenged the definition of AGR and certain components included in AGR as being contrary to Telegraph Act and the recommendations made by the TRAI.
COAI had alleged that DoT unilaterally changed the earlier understanding of the definition of revenue share to include the revenue received by the licensees from their non-licensed activity."

For Indian executive Bibhas Chakraborty, Diwali used to mean shiny expensive gifts from business associates keen to use the auspicious -- and spectacular -- Hindu festival to deepen ties. Now it's mostly sweets and nuts.
As Asia's third-largest economy battles waning consumer demand, extravagant corporate gifts risk becoming a thing of the past, leaving many worried that this weekend's festival of lights -- and presents -- is losing its lustre.
""Earlier, the quality of gifts we received was higher and often included gold and silver-plated picture frames or bowls. But now, with the economic slowdown, that's all changed,"" Chakraborty, a Mumbai-based 48-year-old, told AFP.
""The joy of opening wrappers to find surprising items has been replaced with the usual sweets... which has taken the sheen off the festival somewhat.""
India's corporate gift industry usually works overtime in the run-up to Diwali to meet a surge in demand -- with the annual ritual seen as a convenient way to nurture business relationships while avoiding accusations of outright bribery.
But in Mumbai's busy Mangaldas market, a street lined with shops offering festive discounts, third-generation entrepreneur Jatin Shah is a worried man.
Shutters down
The owner of Rainbow Dry Fruits, an 80-year-old gift packaging firm, Shah added 20 temporary workers to his staff of 15 to account for the anticipated Diwali rush.
But orders have yet to materialise.
""In previous years... we would work till two in the morning. Now since the orders are lower in size and scale, we finish work and pull down the shutters by 10 pm,"" Shah told AFP.
Even orders for the cheapest items -- small boxes of Indian almonds, walnuts, and cashews -- have fallen by more than half, he said, bringing down the firm's annual turnover by 35 percent and leaving him with no funds for employee bonuses, another Diwali tradition.
""Diwali is not only the festival of lights but also represents economic prosperity,"" Shah said.
Hindus mark Diwali with prayers to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, and the weeks leading up to the holiday usually see an uptick in consumer spending, similar to Thanksgiving or Christmas in the West.
Mood of gloom
But this year Indians don't appear to be in a mood to spend, with the slowdown hitting sales of everything from cars to cookies.
""I am not sure if there will be many gifts coming my way this year,"" said finance executive Chakraborty.
Some of the biggest companies have slashed their corporate gift budgets for Diwali, said Ritu Grover, CEO of TGH Lifestyle, which works with more than 350 firms including telecom giant Airtel and IT outsourcing firm Wipro.
Analysts said the curtailed spending was a reflection of the gloom surrounding the business community, with economic growth its most sluggish in years.
""Reduction in corporate gifting is an indicator of economic slowdown and there is no ambiguity on that front,"" N. Chandramouli, chief of Mumbai-based TRA Research, told AFP.
""All indicators show it is going to be a slow Diwali this year.""

New Delhi: Industry body COAI on Thursday expressed deep disappointment over SC ruling on telecom revenue definition, and termed it the last straw in contributing to the sector's financial distress.
The Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI) said in a statement that it remains to be seen whether the industry -- which is reeling under a daunting debt of about  ₹4 lakh crore and is in dire financial straits -- will be able to recover from this setback.
""The Supreme Court's judgment is the last straw in contributing to financial distress and it remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to recover from this setback. The immense financial pressure on the sector will also adversely impact 'Digital India' rollout,"" Rajan S. Mathews, director general of COAI, said.
The association expressed ""deep disappointment"" over the judgment on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) which it said will have an impact of over  ₹92,000 crore on the industry.
""With over 1.19 billion subscribers, the telecom sector is a key contributor to the Indian economy in terms of consumer benefit, employment, revenue generation and contributes 6.5 per cent to the GDP (gross domestic product).
""The sector has the lowest tariffs in the world backed by the investment of over  ₹10 lakh crore in setting up world-class mobile networks over the last 20 years but is going through one of its most disruptive phases,"" Mathews said.
The telecom sector's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) continues to contract, while the interest expense of the industry continues to increase, Mathews added.
In a setback to telecom service providers, the Supreme Court on Thursday allowed the Centre's plea to recover AGR of running into thousands of crore from them. It added that the service providers would have to pay penalties and interests to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT).
Telecom major Vodafone Idea has warned that the latest verdict on definition of telecom revenue will have ""damaging implications"" for the industry, and indicated it could explore filing a review application after legal consultation.
Expressing disappointment over the SC ruling, Vodafone Idea also exhorted the government to engage on the matter to find ways to mitigate financial stress of the industry.

The Supreme Court (SC) dealt a crushing blow to India’s telecom service providers on Thursday. It upheld the Centre’s demand of  ₹92,000 crore in arrears on licence and spectrum usage fees, which are charged as a fraction of their adjusted gross revenues (AGR) under India’s revenue-sharing regime. For 14 years, telecom operators had argued that only their intake from core telecom services should qualify as AGR, and had paid accordingly. The government, which contended that all revenue streams had to be counted, won its case.
The blow is especially severe for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are laden with heavy debt that was incurred for buying expensive telecom airwaves in government auctions. They have not been able to raise tariffs ever since Reliance Jio entered the market in 2016, sparking a price war. Jio, having been in this business for just three years, has much less money to cough up as arrears. Now, with 5G spectrum auctions on the anvil, it’s unclear whether its cash-strapped rivals have the resources needed to fight another round of battle. The minimum bids for 5G airwaves were to be lowered, but this may not help them much."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a  ₹92,000 crore blow to an industry already reeling from a collapse in tariffs and mounting debt.
The top court rejected the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) proposed by the telecom operators that excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal tussle between the department of telecommunications (DoT) and operators.
Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in unpaid spectrum and licence fee dues that have accrued over these years. Among the companies that have survived a brutal consolidation in the sector, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd will be the worst affected by the order.
Telecom operators can now only hope that the government will reconsider its decision to apply the broader definition. They pay around 3-5% and 8% of AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fees, respectively, to DoT.
Operators had argued that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisted that it should include all revenue earned by an operator.
Thursday’s judgement was pronounced by a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra and comprised Justices S. Abdul Nazeer and M.R. Shah.
The judgement also makes it clear that service providers will also have to pay penalties and interest to DoT.
As the 153-page judgement does not contain the time frame for the payment of accrued dues, it is most likely that a separate order detailing the same would be uploaded on the court’s website soon. Telecom operators have asked for a minimum of six months to make the payment, which the bench said it would consider.
Clarifying further, Justice Mishra said there would be no further rounds of litigation in this case.
Expressing its disappointment, Vodafone Idea issued a statement saying the “judgement has significantly damaging implications for India’s telecom industry, which is already reeling under huge financial stress and is left with only four operators. Significant investment of several billion dollars has been made in creating world class networks. Today’s order has huge impact on two private operators, while most of the other impacted operators have exited the sector. We urgently request that the government engage on this matter in order to find ways to mitigate the financial stress for the industry.""
Airtel also expressed its disappointment with the verdict and stated: “Telecom Service Providers have invested billions of dollars in developing the telecom sector and providing world-class services to consumers. This decision has come at a time when the sector is facing severe financial stress and may further weaken the viability of the sector as a whole. Of the 15 old operators impacted by the order, only two private sector operators remain in service today. The government must review the impact of this decision and find suitable ways to mitigate the financial burden on the already stressed industry.""
The tussle started when telecom operators migrated to a new system offered by the government in 1999 under which they agreed to share a certain percentage of revenue with the government.
The case has seen multiple judgements by telecom tribunals and the final hearing by the Supreme Court was held on 1 August.
DoT, in an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court during its hearing earlier this year, had listed the revenue owed by the different operators to it. According to its calculations, Bharti Airtel will have to cough up an estimated  ₹21,682.13 crore, Vodafone idea will have to pay roughly  ₹28,308 crore. For Reliance Jio, the amount will be just  ₹13 crore as it entered the sector only three years ago. BSNL owed  ₹2,098.72 crore, while MTNL owed  ₹2,537.48 crore.
These figures will be recalculated in line with the definition of AGR mentioned in the judgement of the Supreme Court.
The amount will also include interest, penalty and interest on penalty and ballooning liabilities of the telecom service providers.
Lobby group Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) had challenged the definition of AGR and certain components included in AGR as being contrary to the Telegraph Act and the recommendations made by the telecom regulator in 2005.
Rajan S. Mathews, director general of COAI, said: “The telecom sector expresses its deep disappointment on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgement on the definition of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) which will have an impact of over  ₹92,000 crore on the industry. The sector is already reeling under a daunting debt of approx.  ₹4 trillion and is in dire financial straits as operators are making negative returns on their investments. The Supreme Court’s judgement is the last straw in contributing to financial distress and it remains to be seen whether the industry will be able to recover from this setback."""

Bharti Airtel Ltd has acquired a minority stake of 8.82% in Bengaluru-based software development startup Vahan Inc, the telecom operator said in a filing with stock exchanges.
The acquisition of Vahan is a part of Airtel’s Startup Accelerator Program to support growth of early-stage Indian tech startups. Vahan, which specialises in providing jobs by using artificial intelligence driven bot (web robot) and a messaging platform, is the first company to join the program.
“Airtel announced the induction of Bengaluru-based tech startup Vahan into its Startup Accelerator Program. Airtel will acquire a stake in Vahan and partner with them in building significant scale to achieve their vision of enabling jobs for the next billion internet users"" the release said.
The initiative will give startups early access to Airtel’s online and offline distribution network, deep market understanding and ecosystem of global strategic partners. Airtel has also developed strong in-house capabilities around machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can be leveraged to aid the growth of startups. Startups will also access to advisory services from Airtel's executive team.
“Vahan is is focused on finding blue collar jobs for millions of young Indians in delivery, driving, retail, BFSI (banking, financial services and insurance), BPO (business process outsourcing) and hospitality sectors with companies such as Zomato, Swiggy and Dunzo as clients,"" the release said.
Airtel's scale and digital capabilities around distribution and payment can drive growth for startups that face multiple challenges in scaling up, said Airtel Chief Product Officer Adarsh Nair.
In a separate development, the Supreme Court upheld the department of telecommunications’ (DoT) definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), dealing a severe blow to the country’s telecom operators. Airtel alone will have to pay  ₹21,682 crore in past dues as per the government’s AGR concept. Shares of Bharti Airtel traded down 1.4% at  ₹367.3 on the news."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Friday:
Bharti Airtel: The stock closed more than 3% higher on Thursday, having slumped 6% after the Supreme Court upheld the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) provided by the department of telecommunications (DoT). This came as a major blow for telecom companies as they will now have to pay  ₹92,000 crore in past dues at a time of rising debt and shrinking revenues.
Vodafone Idea: The stock crashed 23% on Thursday due to concerns over the telecom operator shutting down as investors anticipated that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the DoT’s definition of AGR. Vodafone Idea Ltd alone has to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore as the SC ruled in favour of the government.
Indigo: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline IndiGo, reported its first quarterly loss during the current fiscal as higher maintenance and overhaul costs outweighed an increase in passenger traffic. It posted a loss of  ₹1,062 crore in the September quarter as against a loss of  ₹652 crore a year ago.
SBI: The largest public-sector bank will announce its September quarter earnings later today. Shares were under pressure on Thursday after the SC rejected telecom operators’ definition of AGR. The bank has huge exposure to the sector and more financial stress for telecom companies would increase the risk of fresh bad loans for the lender.
ITC: FMCG major ITC Ltd on Thursday posted a 36.2% year-on-year rise in its standalone profit to  ₹4,023.1 crore for the quarter ended September. The company had posted a profit of  ₹2,954.7 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The profit number, which was also boosted by a one-time tax credit of  ₹166.2 crore, was largely in line with the Street’s estimate.
Tata Steel BSL: The steelmaker released its earnings for July-September on Thursday. It reported a standalone net loss of  ₹255.9 crore for the quarter compared with a net profit of 60.7 crore in the year-ago period. The stock has been under pressure as its parent Tata Steel stares at uncertainty around a no-deal Brexit. Tata Steel has a significant presence in the UK and Europe.
Biocon: The pharmaceutical company has set a target of $1 billion for annual sales of its biologics business by 2021-22 (Apr-Mar). To achieve the aim, the company, among other strategies, plans to supply recombinant human insulin to diabetes patients in countries at low and middle income levels at less than 10 cents per day, roughly one-third the cost of current prices in these countries.
Tata Motors: The company will announce its earnings for the September quarter today. The stock may be in focus as the numbers will be announced at a time when the auto sector has been grappling with severe demand slowdown. The company’s sales had nearly halved to 36,376 units in September from 69,991 a year ago.
PNB Housing: The company announced its earnings for the September quarter on Thursday after market hours. PNB Housing Finance Ltd reported a 45% rise in net profit to  ₹366.8 crore in the second quarter-ended September of this fiscal. It had posted a net profit of  ₹253 crore in the same period last year.
Jubilant Life Sciences: The pharmaceutical company will report its July-September earnings today. Marico Ltd will also announce the numbers for the said quarter."
194,2019-10-25,Airtel,"Ironically, the govt stands to lose more by winning in the Supreme Court against the telcosMost of the licence fee dues are from companies that are already bankrupt or facing bankruptcy

Regardless of who has been at the helm of affairs, the Indian government has been known to treat the telecom industry as the goose that lays golden eggs. For years, the industry met the expectations by buying spectrum at absurd prices, enriching the government in the process.
It’s another matter the goose has progressively grown weaker, and golden eggs have been a thing of the past. There seems to be a glimmer of hope, with the Supreme Court (SC) ruling that telcos need to pay the government licence fee dues, along with penalties and interest, amounting to more than  ₹92,500 crore, according to numbers collated by the industry.
Ironically, this was a case the government was better off losing. It should now be the first to protest the court ruling.
Here’s why. More than 40% of the dues to the government, affirmed by the apex court ruling, need to come from firms such as Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd, which have either filed for bankruptcy or shut shop.
The bulk of the remainder needs to come from Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd, which together owe about  ₹50,000 crore, in a 4:3 proportion. Following the SC ruling, shares of Vodafone Idea fell by 23% to  ₹4.35 apiece on Thursday. After all, its cash balance at the end of the June quarter stood at  ₹21,200 crore, far lower than what is needed to meet the latest government demand.
Traders expect telecom to be a two-player market soon, with Vodafone Idea crushed under the weight of the SC order. Therefore, even though Bharti Airtel needs to shell out a huge amount as dues and penalties, its shares rose 3.3% on Thursday in early celebration of the prospects of a duopoly. Shares of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), parent of market leader Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, rose 3.2% as well.
The big irony about the government winning in the apex court is that it stands to lose far more than what it would gain. Vodafone Idea owes the government roughly  ₹90,000 crore in deferred spectrum payment dues. “If the court order is enforced, the government is likely to get neither the licence fee dues from Vodafone Idea nor the deferred spectrum dues,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm, requesting anonymity. Talk of pyrrhic victories.
Of course, the moot question would be why the government has fought it thus far, if it stands to lose more, with yet another telco facing bankruptcy.
Perhaps it believes the future will be better with a duopoly, rather than with a struggling three-player market. Besides, it might be thinking that some of the licence fee dues may be used to revive Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, and the two state-owned firms may stop being a burden on the exchequer.
Whatever the thought process, the fact remains that the government’s actions increasingly resemble the part in the fable where the goose is killed to get all the golden eggs at once."
191,2019-10-28,Airtel,"According to the DoT's calculations, Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹42,000 croreSources said Sunil Bharti Mittal first met Prasad and then Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, apparently over the liability that arises from the Supreme Court upholding

NEW DELHI :
Telecom tycoon Sunil Bharti Mittal on Monday came knocking at the doors of top government officials including Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, over billions of dollars in statutory dues like spectrum and licence fee liability that his and other telcos had not fully provisioned in their accounts.
Sources said Mittal first met Prasad and then Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, apparently over the liability that arises from the Supreme Court upholding government's view on how revenues should be calculated for sharing of statutory dues.
Kumar Mangalam Birla, head of Vodafone-Idea Ltd that also has been severely hit by the apex court ruling, was expected to come for meeting but has now sought a different time, they said.
Delivering its verdict, the Supreme Court had on October 24 upheld government contention that non-core revenue in telecoms groups should be included in adjusted gross revenue -- the figure on which statutory levies are charged.
Sources said the telecom operators are looking at the government for a possible relief such as waiver of penalties and interest though the Supreme Court had categorically stated that companies must pay many years worth of charges plus interest and penalties.
Ideally, companies are required to make provisions in their books for any potential liability that may arise from a legal dispute.
While emails sent to Bharti Airtel and Vodafone-Idea on the impact of the Supreme Court judgment and provisioning remained went unanswered, industry sources said provisioning for the full amount was not made. The companies also did not response to a seperate email on meeting with the Government.
Also, there is no sight of promoters willing to infuse more equity into the companies to clear the liabilities.
According to the DoT's calculations, Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹42,000 crore after including licence fees and spectrum usage charges while Vodafone-Idea may have to pay about  ₹40,000 crore.
Initially, Telecom Service provider (TSPs) had to pay a fixed license fee. The Government in 1999 offered a new package, known as 'Migration Package', giving an option to the licensees to migrate from fixed license fee to revenue sharing fee with a principle of 'Pay as you Earn'. This was accepted by the operators unconditionally.
License fee and interest till the date of migration i.e. July 31, 1999, was paid by them and no dues were waived off.
The 'revenue sharing' regime was so designed that the Central Government becomes a partner or sharer of 'gross revenue of the company'. An annual license fee is payable as a percentage of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). The license fee initially was 15 per cent of the AGR and progressively reduced to 8 per cent in 2013 and many saw it as an extremely beneficial regime for telcos.
However, AGR calculations became a point of dispute with some in the government feeling that funds due to the exchequer were being diverted to create new businesses within and outside the country.
The Supreme Court had in an order way back in 2010 ruled that ""it was not open to a TSP to turn around and agitate any dispute after availing of the migration package"". And then again in October 2011, it held that ""TDSAT has no jurisdiction to exclude certain items of revenue, which were included in the definition of AGR.""
But the TSPs neither paid the government nor created any provisions in their books of accounts for past and future payment of license fee (LC) and spectrum usage charge (SUC) on the basis of law laid down by the Supreme Court, sources said.
Non-disclosure of known contingent liability and outstanding dues pertaining to LF and SUC in the statement of accounts and balance sheet is an economic offense under the Companies Act.
Supreme Court in the judgment last week said that ""No litigant can be permitted to reap fruits on such inconsistent and litigate for decades in several rounds which is not so uncommon but is disturbing scenario projected in many cases. We have examined the matter upon merits and then the aforementioned conclusions indicate the frivolous nature of objections.""
After the judgment, the telcos have stated that they don't have money to pay the government.
Government officials, however, feel both companies have enough capacity and capability to raise funds through means such as equity from promoters and monetizing some of their assets. Any waiver of dues would be at the cost of taxpayers and public exchequer money and open to review by government auditor, CAG, they added."

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operator Bharti Airtel today announced that it has deferred its quarterly results after the Supreme Court allowed the Centre's plea last week to recover adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of  ₹92,000 crore from telecom service providers.
""Please be informed that the management of the Company recommended to the Board of Directors that the agenda item related to the approval of audited financial results for the second quarter (Q2) and half year ended September 30, 2019 which was to be a part of the Board meeting today be deferred till November 14, 2019 on account of the fact that more clarity is needed on the AGR matter arising out of recent judgement of Hon'ble Supreme Court,"" Airtel said in a BSE filing.
Bharti Airtel said it is approaching the telecom department to seek clarity on the total amounts involved and request for their support to deal with this adverse outcome.
Last week, after the apex court verdict was announced, Bharti Airtel had said the outcome on AGR will weaken viability of telecom sector. It had also appealed the government to review its impact and find ways to mitigate financial burden on the already stressed industry.
Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said the ruling will deal a ""disastrous blow"" to the industry, given its precarious financial condition.
According to the new telecom policy, telecom licensees are required to share a percentage of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) with the government as annual license fee.
In addition, mobile telephone operators were also required to pay spectrum usage charges for the use of radio frequency spectrum allotted to them."

IIFL Research expects that robust September quarter earnings by banks such as State Bank of India and ICICI Bank will lead to more action in financials today. Strength in the Indian rupee, fall in bond yields, and rise in consumption in the festive month bode well for credit expansion. It also expects the broader market to participate in the rally as valuation discount to large-caps narrows.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, a weaker-than-expected performance by the Bharatiya Janata Party in the state elections may possibly spur the government to focus on demand-revival and/or structural reforms. However, the market is already expecting a fiscal stimulus to consumption in the form of goods and services tax or individual income tax rate cuts. It would be interesting to see how the government balances its economic and political objectives within the constraints of a stretched fiscal situation, the brokerage firm said.
Tata Motors advanced 12.7%, extending gains from Sunday, after the company reported lower-than-expected loss for the September quarter. The board of the carmaker has approved an allotment of equity share and warrants on a preferential basis to Tata Sons for an aggregate consideration of  ₹6,494 crore.

Tata Motors: Shares extended Sunday’s gains during Diwali Muhurat trading, jumping nearly 14% in early deals due to the auto major’s strong September quarter performance. Improved operating performance and the impact of a better product mix on sales at its UK-arm Jaguar Land Rover Ltd, which has been a drag for last several quarters, also buoyed sentiment.

The Supreme Court (SC) had upheld DoT’s definition of AGR, which may lead to Airtel alone paying  ₹21,682 crore in past dues.
Tata Steel: Shares of the steel major traded 7% higher as uncertainty around a no-deal Brexit was put to rest after the European Union on Monday agreed to delay Brexit until 31 January, increasing the chances of a UK election before the end of the year. The steelmaker has a significant presence in the UK and Europe. The stock of another steel company JSW Steel Ltd was also up 5%.
Vodafone Idea: The stock slumped nearly 6% in early deals due to concerns over mounting stress in the telco’s financials after SC ordered telecom firms to clear past dues within three months. This came as a major blow at a time when the company is grappling with piling debt and shrinking revenues. Vodafone Idea may have to pay  ₹28,308 crore as past dues to the government.

New Delhi: The Centre has set up a Committee of Secretaries under the cabinet secretary to suggest measures to alleviate financial stress in the telecom sector. The committee will look at ways of creating a favourable investment environment for the sector, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
“The CoS (Committee of Secretaries) will look into the demand of telcos for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 in order to ease cash flow,"" the person said requesting anonymity. It will also look at reducing payments such as spectrum usage charges and the universal service obligation fund levy paid by telcos.
“In parallel, it is expected that the TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) will also examine the aspect of minimum charge (floor tariff) for voice and data services to ensure that the financial health of the telecom sector remains robust and viability is sustained,"" the person said.
The decision to set up a new panel comes a week after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a  ₹92,000 crore blow to an industry reeling under a collapse in tariffs and mounting debt.
The top court rejected the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) proposed by telecom operators that excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal tussle between the department of telecommunications (DoT) and operators.
Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in unpaid spectrum and licence fee dues that have accrued over these years. Among the companies that have survived a brutal consolidation in the sector, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd are the worst hit by the apex court order."

Telecom shares were the biggest laggards today due to concerns over financial stress in the firms after the Supreme Court ordered telcos to repay their dues to the government within three months. Bharti Airtel was down 3.41% to close at  ₹359.95, while Vodafone Idea tumbled 8.11% to close at  ₹3.85. Airtel also fell as it deferred the announcement of its September quarter earnings till 14 November, seeking more clarity on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) issue from the department of telecommunications (DoT) on dues payable. The Supreme Court (SC) had upheld DoT’s definition of AGR, which may lead to Airtel alone paying  ₹21,682 crore in past dues.
The market breadth was positive. On the BSE, 1,439 shares rose and 1,027 shares fell. A total of 211 shares were unchanged. On Nifty, 39 stocks advanced and 11 stocks declined. In the broader market, the BSE Mid-Cap index was up 1.12%. The BSE Small-Cap index was up 0.55%."
182,2019-10-29,Airtel,"Ailing firms’ demands, measures to relieve financial stress to be examinedBharti Airtel on Tuesday delayed its September quarter results, saying it was awaiting clarity on an SC order on revenue

New Delhi: A government panel will examine the problems faced by telecom operators and suggest ways to revive their financial health, amid plunging industry revenues and mounting debt.
A committee of secretaries (CoS) under the cabinet secretary will consider the demands of telcos and suggest ways to alleviate their financial stress and create a favourable investment environment, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
“The CoS will look into the demand of telcos for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 in order to ease cash flow,"" the person said on condition of anonymity.
In the latest fallout of the cloud of uncertainty that has darkened the industry’s prospects, Bharti Airtel on Tuesday postponed announcing its September quarter earnings as it awaits clarity on a Supreme Court verdict that directed operators to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government. The Bharti Airtel stock plunged 3.41% on Tuesday.
The financial health of telcos was already under severe pressure after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company disrupted the industry, first through free services and later through ultra-cheap data tariffs, triggering a wave of consolidation. Smaller operators either shut shop or sold their assets to bigger telcos.
As part of the relief measures proposed for the industry, the government is also considering a floor price for telecom services. At present, operators are free to charge users any tariff they want.
“In parallel, it is expected that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will also examine the aspect of minimum charge (floor tariff) for voice and data services to ensure that the financial health of the telecom sector remains robust and viability is sustained,"" the person said.
The government panel will also look at measures such as reducing levies, including spectrum usage charges and the universal service obligation fund (Usof) fee paid by telcos.
Currently, telcos pay 3-6% and 8% of their adjusted gross revenue (AGR) as spectrum usage charges and licence fee (including Usof), respectively.
Emails sent to the department of telecommunications (DoT), Trai, Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Jio were unanswered till press time.
The decision to set up a panel comes a week after the Supreme Court upheld the Centre’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telcos. The court rejected the interpretation proposed by telcos that excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income. Among the companies that have survived the consolidation in the sector, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea are the worst hit by the apex court order."
173,2019-10-30,Airtel,"The company released its operating highlights for the three months ended September 2019According to the DoT's calculations, Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹42,000 crore

NEW DELHI :
A day after a panel of secretaries was formed to suggest ways to mitigate financial stress in the telecom sector, Bharti Airtel on Wednesday said it is in the best interest of all parties to formulate a ""constructive mechanism"" to ensure that large levies, including AGR, can be addressed in a ""fair manner"".
Asserting that telecom operators in India have invested billions of dollars in developing the telecom sector and providing world-class services to customers, Sunil Mittal-led Airtel said the Supreme Court's decision comes at a time when the sector is facing severe financial stress.
Senior leadership of Airtel, in an investor call on Wednesday, said the company is hopeful that the government will take a ""balanced approach"" on the AGR (Adjusted Gross Revenue) issue to ensure long term viability of the industry.
""It is indeed in the best interest of all parties to formulate a constructive mechanism to ensure large levies including this one at hand can be resolve in a fair manner,"" Badal Bagri, chief financial officer of Bharti Airtel, said addressing the investor call.
The company had on Tuesday released its operating highlights for the three months ended September 2019, but postponed the release of its full Q2 earnings to November 14 citing the uncertainty that has arisen in the sector in the wake of the recent Supreme Court ruling on definition of telecom revenue.
""We are evaluating the judgement in detail and its overall implication and accordingly request that we won't be able to comment on it much,"" Bagri said, even as questions around the burning issue and its impact on the company continued to dominate the investor call.
Bharti Airtel Chairman Sunil Mittal and his brother Rajan Mittal had on Monday met Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash in the aftermath of the October 24 Supreme Court order that accepted the government's way of calculating revenues of the companies, based on which statutory dues to exchequer are calculated.
According to the DoT's calculations, Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹42,000 crore after including licence fees and spectrum usage charges, while Vodafone-Idea may have to pay about  ₹40,000 crore.
The telcos are pitching for a waiver of interest and penalties on the unpaid amount, as well as staggering payment of principal licence fee over 10 years, sources said.
The government has constituted a Committee of Secretaries to work out a financial bailout package that may include lowering of spectrum charges as well as ending the era of free mobile phone calls and dirt cheap data.
The Committee of Secretaries, headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, has been asked to examine ""all aspects"" of ""financial stress"" faced by service providers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea and suggest measures to mitigate them, sources in the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) said.
Meanwhile, Airtel said that it has no plans to shut down its 2G network.
The company, during the investor call, also stated that it does not want to look at temporary price movements triggered by regulatory changes but would rather look at more sustained price increases.
Asked about Jio's new tariff, Bharti Airtel MD and CEO (India and South Asia) Gopal Vittal said, ""We have maintained that tariffs are unsustainable and are low and must go up, so we welcome any move to increase tariffs.""
""We have historically been at a premium to our competition in pricing, and the only thing we would like to do is not look at temporary price movements led out of regulatory changes but look at more sustained price increases. The current move is a tariff only meant for off-net calling based on regulation, and if regulation were to unpeel then that tariff will go away,"" he said.
Hence Airtel has not made any decision to respond accordingly, he added.
While detailed Q2 numbers will be released around mid-November, Bharti Airtel said its revenue from India mobile services rose 7 per cent year-on-year during the September 2019 quarter to  ₹10,981.4 crore, while the subscriber base stood at 279.4 million."
174,2019-10-30,Airtel,"Reliance Jio has claimed that the telecom group’s plea to the government does not represent the industry’s viewJio points out to COAI that the Supreme Court order on adjusted gross revenue is final and should be implemented as law of the land

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, one of the three core members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), objected to the lobby group seeking relief for the telecom sector and claimed that the group’s plea to the government does not represent the view of the industry.
COAI’s petition came after the Supreme Court ordered legacy telecom companies to pay up  ₹92,000 crore in dues, rejecting Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd’s plea that the government’s revenue share be calculated excluding income from non-core operations such as rent, dividend and interest income.
In a letter to the industry body, Jio alleged that COAI has acted as “a mouthpiece of two service providers"", without naming Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
“COAI’s intent of using this as an opportunity to seek non-enforcement of the Supreme Court judgement and asking for relief is strongly objected by Jio,"" the company said in a 30 October letter, reviewed by Mint. “Jio will like to point out to COAI that the judgement of Supreme Court is final and to be implemented as law of the land. These operators have capacity and enough monetization possibilities to comfortably pay government dues.""
Last week, the top court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a blow to telecom operators that are already burdened with losses and mounting debt.
The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications and operators. Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum and licence fee dues, plus interest that has accrued over these years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the only non-state firms that have survived a brutal consolidation in the sector over the past three years and posted a loss in the June quarter, have been the worst-hit by the order.
“In this letter (to the government), COAI has again attempted to rake up the issue of merits of AGR case like notional revenue, which has already been settled by the Supreme Court judgement,"" Jio said, adding that “seeking relief on the very same grounds amounts to seeking relief for these operators for their wilful decision of continuing non-compliance by withholding legitimate government dues"".
COAI director general Rajan Mathews said the issue is a private matter between the members of the group. “We respect the inputs, feedback and opinions of all our members even though we may disagree with some of them. We stand by our letter on behalf of the majority of our members and it stands on its own merits and needs no further explanation,"" he said"
175,2019-10-30,Airtel,"The company has approached the government to seek clarity on the exact amount and relief on the unpaid duesThe court also ruled that telcos are liable to pay not just the principal but also the interest and penalty within three months of the order.

NEW DELHI :
Fitch Ratings has placed Bharti Airtel Ltd on 'rating watch negative' over unpaid regulatory dues arising from a recent Supreme Court ruling.
Fitch placed Bharti's 'BBB-' Long-Term Foreign-Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) as well as its and Bharti Airtel International (Netherlands) BV's senior unsecured bonds and Network i2i's subordinated perpetual bonds on RWN.
""The RWN reflects uncertainty on the amount and timing of unpaid regulatory dues, after India's Supreme Court ruled on October 24 in favour of the country's Department of Telecommunication's (DoT) definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR).
""This led to DOT's demand that Bharti pay unpaid dues on licence fees of $3 billion. There may be another potential demand of $2.9 billion in regard to unpaid dues on spectrum usage charges,"" Fitch said in a statement.
The resolution of the RWN, which may take more than six months, requires clarity on the exact amount and timing of the payment of unpaid dues and whether the government will provide any financial relief to the telecom sector affected by the court ruling, it said.
Fitch estimated that Bharti's funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage could worsen to around 3.1x-3.4x for the financial year ending March 2020 (FY20, earlier estimate of 2.0x-2.2x) -- excluding USD 6.3 billion in deferred spectrum costs -- if the company had to pay entire estimated unpaid dues of $5.9 billion, funded out of debt.
""This leverage would be significantly higher than 2.5x threshold above which Fitch would consider negative rating action. However, Bharti may be able to partly fund the unpaid dues through a planned stake sale of USD2.5-3.5 billion in the combined Bharti Infratel (Infratel) and Indus Tower entity, which is awaiting regulatory approval of the merger,"" it said.
However, deconsolidation of Infratel-Indus would lead to cash outflow for tower lease rentals, nullifying any significant leverage benefits.
The company has approached the government to seek clarity on the exact amount and relief on the unpaid dues, out of which interest and penalties constitute about 75 per cent.
The Supreme Court ruling is credit-negative for the industry, after DoT's demand of unpaid dues on licence fees and spectrum usage charges of at least $19 billion from telcos, it said.
The court also ruled that telcos are liable to pay not just the principal but also the interest and penalty within three months of the order.
The demand for unpaid dues pertains to a 14-year-old dispute regarding the definition of AGR, which DoT said should include all kinds of income generated by the telcos. Typically, telcos pay about 3-5 per cent of AGR as spectrum usages charges and 8 per cent as licence fees.
Fitch said Bharti's leverage is unlikely to materially improve the case due to negative free cash flow (FCF).
""We forecast negative FCF in FY20 (FY19: negative  ₹21,900 crore), as cash flow from operations of  ₹22,000-24,500 crore will be insufficient to fund large capex plans and moderate dividends of  ₹3,000-4,000 crore.
""Barring regulatory dues, we expect FY20 capex/revenue to remain high at 34%-37%, with forecast capex of around USD4 billion, as Bharti continues to strengthen its 4G network and fibre infrastructure. However, the company expects core capex, which excludes deferred spectrum payments, to have peaked and to decline significantly in FY20,"" it said.
The rating agency expected the government to hold 5G spectrum auction in the next 12-18 months but felt the incumbents may not participate if they have to pay unpaid regulatory dues in the short term."

NEW DELHI :
All DTH TV subscribers of Airtel, Tata Sky, Dish TV and Sun Direct will now need to complete their KYC (Know Your Customer) criteria as mandated by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The regulator has released a new set of rules asking all DTH operators to ensure the identity of the subscriber.
""DTH operator should install the DTH connection at the address mentioned in the Customer Application Form (CAF) only and the address of such installed set top box must be verified by the representative of the DTH operator,"" TRAI said in its recommendation
The customer application form contains information such as subscriber name, address, contact number etc.
According to the rules, the DTH TV operator will have to ensure your identity by sending a one-time password (OTP) to your registered mobile number.
In cases where you fail to provide a mobile number which can be linked to your DTH connection, the DTH TV service provider has been mandated to collect a proof of identity document.
TRAI rules further states that for existing set-top boxes, which are not attached to any mobile number of the subscribers, service providers should try to link them with a mobile number within two years. ""Further in case where it is not possible to link with a mobile number, document for proof of identity of the subscriber should be collected by the DTH operator,"" TRAI said.
Telecom players have been demanding KYC to curb smuggling of boxes outside India where they are used for illegal and unauthorised reception or re-transmission of signals of channels. Due to such piracy, broadcasters have been facing revenue losses."
172,2019-10-30,Airtel,"Shares of Airtel gained 2% as headline numbers on revenue and subscribers beat expectationsThe telco hasn’t yet released its full Q2 earnings, citing lack of clarity on the recent SC verdict

Investors predictably cheered Bharti Airtel Ltd’s September quarter headline numbers. The stock gained 2% on Wednesday after the operating metrics showed an improvement in customer base and revenue from the June quarter. On Tuesday, the stock had fallen about 3% after the company said it has deferred its Q2 results announcement owing to the uncertainty caused by the Supreme Court verdict against telecom companies on the calculation of license fees.
While the headline numbers on revenue and subscribers were better than expectations, part of the gains in the stock can also be attributed to the government’s conciliatory tone on the financial stress in the telecom sector. It has appointed a committee to suggest measures to alleviate stress in the sector.
The headline numbers underscore the recovery in the mainstay India mobile services business. Sequential revenues from mobile services grew 0.8%, which makes it the third consecutive quarter of expansion. At least two large domestic brokers had estimated a sequential fall in revenue for the September quarter.
Customer losses eased considerably and the company added subscribers on a net basis, after four consecutive quarters of losses. Monthly churn in subscriber base eased considerably from 2.6% in June to 2.1% last quarter.
Importantly, better yielding 4G data customers continued to expand; the subscriber base in this segment increased 8.3% in the last quarter. They now constitute 83% of the total data subscriber base. As a consequence, data volumes on the firm’s network grew by a healthy 15.2%.
Average revenue-per-user (RPU) dropped slightly (down 1%) and voice minutes on the network fell 2.8%. But given the seasonal weakness in the second quarter, the softness is not something investors need to worry about.
The company did not provide other metrics, such as operating profit and net earnings, pending clarity on the liability arising out of the recent Supreme Court verdict on license fee dues. Also, the segmental data indicate a weak show at home services business. The business saw a notable fall in net additions, customer-additions and average RPU. But the fact that the customer base and revenue at the mainstay mobile services business are on the mend is comforting. “Barring a cost shocker in India wireless, we believe Ebitda (earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization) print should be quite decent and ahead of expectations. We continue to like what we see,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note.
The performance strengthens the Street’s view that Airtel’s relatively better financial position and 4G network execution is helping it withstand the volatility in the market better than its rival, Vodafone Idea Ltd. How well it is delivering on earnings will be known when it releases its full quarterly earnings."

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd fell 3.3% on Tuesday after the company deferred its September quarter results as it was trying to determine the liability arising out of Supreme Court verdict on license fee dues.
Incidentally, the company released operating highlights for the September quarter late on Tuesday. However unprecedented, investors would do well to focus on the numbers, because from the looks of it the troubled India mobile services business is not only stabilizing but also showing signs of recovery.
Not surprisingly, Bharti Airtel’s stock was up 2.2% in early deals on Wednesday.
The company’s customer base and revenue from mobile services expanded 0.8-0.9% from June quarter. At least two large domestic brokers had forecast a sequential fall in revenues. Encouragingly, net additions have seen a notable improvement and monthly churn in customers eased considerably.
Average revenues per user dropped slightly--down 1%--and voice minutes on the company’s network fell 2.8%. But given the seasonal weakness in the fiscal second quarter it is understandable.
The company did not provide other metrics such as operating profit and net earnings. But the fact that customer base and revenue are on the mend will bring comfort to investors. “Barring a cost shocker in India wireless, we believe Ebitda print should be quite decent and ahead of expectations. We continue to like what we see,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities said in a note. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.
Subdued voice volumes aside, the company did decently well on the data business. Data subscriber base expanded 3.5%. More importantly, the better yielding 4G customers grew 8.3%. Total data usage on the company’s network grew 15.2%.
The performance will please investors, strengthening the Street’s view that Airtel’s relatively better financial position and 4G network execution is helping it withstand market changes better. How well it will deliver on earnings will be known only when it releases the full quarterly results."

The S&P 500 ended down 0.08% and the Nasdaq Composite 0.59%.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Wednesday:
Infosys: Financial services firm ICICI Securities said the tech major does not have any “perceivable inconsistency"" in data points shared by Infosys Ltd as alleged in a whistleblower letter. This may reverse the negative sentiment surrounding the company over accounting malpractices. Separately, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs has sought information regarding the whistleblower complaints, which have triggered an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Bharti Airtel: Shares plunged more than 3.3% on Tuesday as the Supreme Court rejected telcos’ definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), ordering mobile operators to repay past dues within three months to the government amid piling debt and shrinking revenues.

RIL: The company said it will infuse  ₹1.08 trillion into its telecom subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Proceeds from the infusion will be used to pare debt of the largest telecom operator by revenue market share. As a result, Reliance Jio's debt to equity ratio will fall from about 2.5 times to 0.3 times. Shares of the largest company by market capitalisation had touched a fresh 52-week high on Tuesday.
IndiGo: InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline IndiGo, has sought support from its employees following its biggest quarterly loss in July-September, saying that it will have to deal with weakening revenue environment going ahead.

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel reported a fall in its average revenue per user (ARPU) in the September quarter, with growth in its subscriber base outpacing revenue growth from mobile services in India.
Airtel recorded an ARPU of  ₹128 in the September quarter, down from  ₹129 in the June quarter. ARPU is the total revenue of an operator divided by the number of users, or connections, on its network.
Airtel’s revenue from mobile services in India was  ₹10,811 crore in the three months ended 30 September, up from  ₹10,724 crore in the June quarter. Its subscriber base grew from 276.81 million in the preceding quarter to 279.43 million in the September quarter.
Reliance Jio also recorded a drop in ARPU in the September quarter. Its ARPU fell to  ₹120 with 355.2 million users as of September end, from  ₹122 with 331.3 million users as of June end. Vodafone Idea has not announced operational highlights or financial statements for the quarter.
Bharti Airtel on Tuesday also said that it has postponed the announcement of its financial results for the September quarter from 29 October to 14 November, as the company awaits clarity on the recent Supreme Court verdict. It will also approach the department of telecommunications (DoT) for clarity on the total amount due. The company, thus, restricted itself to sharing the operational highlights for the quarter.
Last week, the top court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a  ₹92,000 crore blow to the telecom industry, which is already burdened with falling tariffs and mounting debt.
The apex court rejected the definition of the adjusted gross revenue proposed by telecom operators and excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations, such as rent, dividend and interest income. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the DoT and operators.
Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum and licence fee dues, plus interest that has accrued over these years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the companies that survived the brutal consolidation witnessed in the sector over the past three years, and posted a loss in the June quarter, have been the worst hit by the order.
Bharti Airtel also saw an increase in data consumption on its network in the three months ended September. Data usage per customer rose from 11.9 GB in the June quarter to 13.1 GB in the September quarter."

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel Ltd plans to keep its 2G networks operational since they continue to fetch substantial revenue, chief executive officer Gopal Vittal said, even as the telco has started shutting its 3G networks due to thinning revenue from them.
“Airtel has no plans to shut down its 2G network as substantial revenue is coming from 2G phone users even in circles like Delhi...also older devices do not have VoLTE (Voice over Long-Term Evolution) integration,"" Vittal said in a post-earnings call with analysts.
Voice over Long-Term Evolution (VoLTE) is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones. In India, only Jio operates a pure 4G-VoLTE network. Airtel, India’s second-largest telecom operator by revenue, is in the process of phasing out 3G to focus solely on 2G and 4G. Vodafone Idea operates 2G, 3G and 4G networks.
“2G still has a runway for next few years...we plan to shut down 3G because the revenue from 3G devices was very insignificant; so we took that call,"" Vittal said.
In August this year, the company had said that it will shut down its 3G network across India’s 22 telecom circles by March 2020, and increase its focus on providing 4G services. The company started the process in July by shutting the 3G network in Kolkata, followed by the Haryana and Punjab circles. It, however, continues to provide 2G services for feature phone users.
This marks the first phase-out of 3G technology in India, which is now increasingly moving to 4G, triggered by the entry of 4G-only Reliance Jio in September 2016.
Vittal’s remarks on 2G come a week after Bharti Airtel told the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) that it should not scrap interconnect usage charge (IUC) from next year, given that a chunk of India’s population is still on legacy networks.
“The projections by GSMA for India also predict that 12-13% of customers will continue to be on 2G handsets till 2025,"" Airtel said in its submissions to Trai last week.
Last month, Trai had floated a fresh consultation paper to see if there was a need to revise the date for scrapping IUC from 1 January 2020, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are battling shrinking revenue as they match Jio’s low tariffs, have welcomed Trai’s rethink.
Jio, however, said it believes this rethink to scrap IUC was unwarranted, arbitrary and anti-poor, and not only affects the credibility of the authority, but also sabotages the government’s Digital India mission.
IUC, at six paise per minute, is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks.
Scrapping IUC, or reducing it, would benefit Jio, which has more outgoing traffic than incoming calls.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea earn a portion of their revenue from IUC as their incoming traffic is higher than outgoing.
“Even after considering that 100% subscribers of new greenfield operator i.e. Jio are on 4G VoLTE, 56% of overall subscribers are on 2G/3G networks... Also, 78% of Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base is on 2G/3G despite 4G VoLTE offered by the company and also competition,"" Vodafone Idea said in its comments to Trai."

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday:
SBI: Chairman Rajnish Kumar on Wednesday pitched analysts for a higher valuation of the bank’s enterprise value, asking them to take into account the growth prospects of its subsidiaries and better-than-expected performance in the fiscal ending March 2021 due to improvement in asset quality and higher growth.
RIL: Reliance Jio on Wednesday said the Cellular Operators Association of India’s plea to the government seeking relief for the sector after an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict on the definition of adjusted gross revenue is “unwarranted"" and does not “represent the industry view by any stretch of imagination"".
IndiGo: Budget carrier IndiGo, owned and operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, has joined the International Air Transport Association as a member on Wednesday. The move will help the airline develop strong partnerships in international markets and help it align with global practices. Air India and SpiceJet are already members of the global trade association.
Bharti Airtel: The telecom operator has no plan to shut down its 2G network, which continues too generate “substantial revenue"". Chief Executive Gopal Vittal said older devices do not have VoLTE or Voice Over Long-Term Evolution integration, which is a standard for high-speed wireless communication for mobile phones.
Vodafone Idea: Shares may be in focus due to talks of the company shutting down its India operations. According to an IANS report, the telecom regulatory world is abuzz with talks of Vodafone Idea exiting India. Meanwhile, traders fear that the company may end up in bankruptcy as the penalty levied in the adjusted gross revenue case is higher than the cash on its books.
United Bank: Shares gained 20% on Wednesday after the bank reported a profit of  ₹124 crore during July-September due to lower provisions and healthy growth in net interest income compared with a loss of  ₹883.2 crore in the same period last year.

170,2019-10-31,Airtel,"Reliance Jio alleges that incumbent operators have enough funds to pay dues to the governmentGovernment should not be obliged to bail out telecom operators for their own commercial failure and financial mismanagement, says Jio

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd on Thursday urged telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad not to grant any relief sought by rival telecom operators, a day after it said the telecom lobby’s call for relief does not reflect the industry view.
Without specifically naming Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, Jio alleged that the operators have enough funds to pay their dues to the government, after a court order went against them.
“We request the government to reject the COAI demand for a financial relief on the Supreme Court judgement and their other outstanding liabilities including the spectrum payments etc and all operators should be mandated to deposit applicable amounts within the three-month time period, as mandated by the Supreme Court,"" Jio said in a 31 October letter to Prasad. Mint has seen a copy of the letter.
The government should not be obliged to bail out telecom operators for their own commercial failure and financial mismanagement, said Jio, which has clashed with other members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) over relief for the sector.
“It will not be out of context to mention that any such package which prima facie appears to mitigate perceived financial strains, if granted, is likely to raise similar demands from other sectors such as aviation,"" Jio added.
Jio had written to COAI on Wednesday alleging the industry body was acting as “a mouthpiece of two service providers"".
Jio, the only profitable telecom operator in India, said it does not agree with a single contention in the COAI’s letter, which it said was submitted under the influence of two of its members in pursuance of their vested interests.
The other two members of COAI are Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
Last week, the Supreme Court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a blow to telecom operators that are already burdened with losses and mounting debt.
Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum and licence fee dues, plus interest that has accrued over these years. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have been the worst-hit by the order. Jio said “the so-called affected service providers"" have sufficient financial capacity to pay the government dues by monetizing their existing assets and by issuing fresh equity in their companies."

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocom on Thursday wrote to top government functionaries, stating that telecom operators, Airtel and Vodafone Idea, have sufficient financial capacity to pay the dues to the government by monetising assets and issuing fresh equity.
In response to the missive by the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) seeking urgent relief for these service providers, Reliance Jio wrote a letter to Telecom Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, a copy of which was marked to the Prime Minister's Principal Secretary, P.K. Mishra, Prime Minister's Principal Advisor, P.K. Sinha, Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash, Economic Affairs Secretary Atanu Chakraborty, Law Secretary Anoop Kumar Mendiratta, and Member, Finance, Department of Telecom, P.K. Sinha.
In the letter, Reliance Jio wrote: ""We submit the so-called affected service providers have sufficient financial capacity to pay the government dues by monetising their existing assets/investments and by issuing fresh equity in their companies."" Although it did not name Airtel and Vodafone Idea, it is implicit that the reference is to these private operators.
""These service providers have stakes in many profitable ventures in the country and abroad and have made multi-million dollars of profits in the countries post investing the proceeds from the telecom business including the regulatory levies withheld for decades,"" Reliance Jio said.
Making the argument about financial ability to pay, it said that the telecom assets of these service providers have been further divested in their profitable telecom tower ventures like Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel.
""Moreover, these operators have 'Principals' with sound financial positions and they must step in to clear the dues which were withheld by them and utilised elsewhere. Thus there is no constraint of making funds available to pay-off their legal obligations, the issue seems to be only with the intent, which is being manifested by COAI through its letter,"" the letter reads.
It pointed out the service providers are also in violation of the Indian accounting standards and have wilfully violated all disclosure norms continuously since 2011 by not provisioning for these liabilities. Reliance Jio has asked the government to take cognisance of such blatant violations and take appropriate action.
Despite the COAI's and these two operators' continued highlighting of the so-called financial stress, Reliance Jio said these service providers have chosen to continue with their below cost tariffs, especially when there is no competitive pressure compelling these tariffs.
""We submit that COAI's intent of using this is an opportunity to seek non-enforcement of the Supreme Court judgement and asking for relief is strongly objected by RJIL. The Judgement of Hon. Supreme Court is final and to be implemented as law of land. These operators have capacity and enough monetization possibilities to comfortably pay government dues,"" Reliance Jio said in the communication to the Telecom Minister."

NEW DELHI :
UK-based Vodafone Group on Thursday quashed rumours of it exiting its India operations, and said that it was supportive of the local management and was also actively engaging with the Indian government.
“Vodafone is aware of the unfounded and baseless rumours circulating in some of the Indian media that we have decided to exit the market. We would like to categorically state that this is not true and is malicious,"" Vodafone Group said in a statement, which comes a day after news agency IANS reported that the telecom major was planning to exit India given its mounting losses.
“Vodafone is actively engaging with the government and we are fully supportive of our local management as they continue to manage our joint venture in these challenging times,"" it added.
Vodafone Idea, the merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, which is India’s largest operator by subscriber base, said it was not in a position to comment on media reports, as it was not aware of anything regarding Vodafone Group’s exit from India.
In a clarification to BSE on Thursday, Vodafone Idea said: “As regards exit of India operations by Vodafone Group is concerned, we wish to inform you that the company is not aware about anything on the subject as it pertains to Vodafone Group and, hence, cannot comment on the same.""
In March 2017, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular had announced their merger following Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s entry in 2016.

166,2019-11-01,Airtel,"In a market that had a dozen carriers two years ago, just three are left standing today — two of them, barelyReliance Jio’s entry shook up the industry that was already hobbling

When Arun Sarin, Vodafone Group Plc’s India-born former CEO, was charting the British telecommunications firm’s expansion into emerging markets in the mid-2000s, his home country with more than a billion potential phone users seemed a compelling choice.
Sarin wasn’t alone. Norway’s Telenor ASA, Russia’s Mobile TeleSystems PJSC and Malaysia’s Maxis Bhd were also among a slew of companies that flocked to this fast-growing market. The carriers banded with local partners, bid for airwaves and licenses, spending billions of dollars to prepare their networks.
But what once appeared to be their most-promising Asian wireless market has turned sour. Vodafone’s Indian venture with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, saddled with $14 billion of debt, is said to be seeking to revamp its borrowings amid mounting losses and a tariff war. Tycoon Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. is rated junk by Moody’s Investors Service. In a market that had a dozen carriers two years ago, just three are left standing today — two of them, barely.
High fees, frequent policy flip-flops, endless tax demands from an unsympathetic bureaucracy that treated carriers as cash cows have driven most of the operators aground. The industry has become the latest cautionary tale for investors in India, showing why despite moving up the global rankings for ease of business, the burgeoning $2.7 trillion economy with a massive consumer base remains a tough, unpredictable place for those who still dare.
The latest blow to the survivors came last week. The nation’s Supreme Court, ruling on a years-long dispute, ordered several carriers to pay the government an additional $13 billion in past fees. The British firm’s venture, Vodafone Idea Ltd., faces a bill of $4 billion, a burden that could sink the company.
“The government is becoming greedy and extracting the maximum from them,"" said Mohan Guruswamy, a former finance ministry official and now chairman of the Centre for Policy Alternatives in New Delhi. “The whole sector is in the doldrums. This judgment will effectively destroy Vodafone Idea, and what you’ll have is an emerging duopoly.""
When India announced its New Telecom Policy in 1999, it said the industry was of “vital importance"" with “widespread ramifications on the entire economy,"" and vowed to create an “enabling framework for the development"" of telecommunications.
Record Raking
While that worked in theory, policy makers also realized that the auction of airwaves and sale of licenses could fetch billions of dollars, a revenue source key to narrowing the government’s budget deficit. For instance, in a 2015 auction, India raised a record $18 billion, after getting almost $10 billion in the previous year. But in 2012, a plan to collect as much as 400 billion rupees ($7.3 billion at the then exchange rate) flopped as bidders balked, prompting it to cut prices later.
Spectrum costs in India are among the highest in the world, according to data compiled by Analysys Mason Spectrum Tracker. The leading telecom operators in India pay the largest share of their aggregate revenue for airwaves at 7.6%, followed by Thailand at 7.3% and Bangladesh at 7%, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
Driving Up Costs
While the government set high prices, the carriers had themselves to blame too. Competition drove the operators to outbid each other at spectrum auctions, driving up their costs.
As a result, companies took on billions of dollars in debt to stay in the game even as competition among a dozen operators for a slice of the market drove down tariffs to less than a cent, weighing on their earnings. Then came Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. in 2016, offering free calls and cheap data on its 4G network, backed by the deep pockets of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s oil-to-petrochemicals empire.
Jio’s entry shook up the industry that was already hobbling.
In the past two years, two of India’s larger telecom operators -- Malaysian tycoon T. Ananda Krishnan’s Aircel Ltd., and Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd. -- went into bankruptcy. Vodafone’s India unit announced its merger with Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd. in 2017 to take on Jio, but it has reported losses every quarter since.
“The Indian telecom market had three major challenges,"" said Sanjay Kapoor, former CEO of Bharti Airtel’s India and South Asia operations and now a director on the board of Saudi Telecom Co. “Intense competition, high cost structure with exorbitant spectrum prices coupled with government charges and lowest average revenue per user.""
But there were other equally daunting hurdles too. Some examples of policy flip-flops here:
A decade after its struggle in India, Newbury, England-based Vodafone Group has one foot out the door. CEO Nick Read said in September that the company isn’t keen to plow any more money into the local venture, in which Vodafone holds about 44%. Sarin didn’t immediately respond to requests for comments.
Warned Lenders
Vodafone Idea has approached creditors for better terms, including a temporary halt to payments, and has warned lenders it won’t be able to honor its comments for long under current conditions, people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The company denied making such a move, but said “all telecom operators have asked for requisite help in reducing"" the financial stress.
Following the Supreme Court ruling on the extra fees, Bharti Airtel deferred its quarterly earnings announcement by two weeks to Nov. 14. Fitch Ratings said Oct. 30 that it’s placed Bharti on negative watch at BBB-, the lowest investment grade.
The court order is the “last straw,"" the Cellular Operators Association of India said last week, while Bharti and Vodafone Idea urged the government to address their concerns and mitigate their financial stress.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government said this week that it is considering some relief measures. A panel of senior bureaucrats will look into steps including deferment of airwaves payments that are due by March 2021 and 2022.
“The government on its end is in a difficult position where if it lets Vodafone Idea fail, it will lead to a duopoly, which is not the healthiest market structure for any country,"" said Rohan Dhamija, head of South Asia and Middle East at Analysys Mason. “We, hence, feel that the government might step in with subtle help for the sector.""

165,2019-11-01,Airtel,"Trai had floated a consultation paper on the matter on 16 SeptemberThe interconnect usage charge or IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks

NEW DELHI :
The telecom regulator has ruled that an incoming voice call on a mobile phone must ring for at least 30 seconds, resolving the deadlock that emerged when Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel had locked horns over the matter.
Operators would have to maintain the time duration of alert for an incoming voice call, which is neither answered nor rejected by the called party, to 30 seconds for cellular mobile telephone services, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said on Friday. “However, originating network may release an unanswered call after 90 seconds in case the call release message is not received from the terminating network.""
While Bharti Airtel had said the ringing time be set at 45 seconds and argued that networks receiving the call must be allowed sufficient time, Jio had batted for a reduction to 20-25 seconds saying that it will save spectrum resources. Vodafone Idea wanted ringer time to be set at 30 seconds.
Trai had floated a consultation paper on the matter on 16 September.
Airtel, the country’s second-largest operator by revenue, had in September said it had cut the ringing time for outgoing calls to a rival network to 25 seconds from 45.
This was in retaliation to its bitter rival Jio’s move.
“Every second reduction on the ringing time saves spectrum resources for us,"" Mahipal Singh, associate vice-president of Jio, had said on 16 October in an open house held by the regulator. “94% calls on Jio’s network are answered within 25 seconds,"" he said, adding that the ringer time should be outside regulatory intervention.
Rival Airtel, on the other hand, said the timer should be set based on the preference of the network which is receiving the phone call.
“The time taken to terminate the call on a network should be uniform across networks. And the terminating or receiving network should be allowed sufficient time to answer the call. This should be 45 seconds,"" Ravi Gandhi, chief regulatory officer, Bharti Airtel, had then said.
If these ringing timers are set differently by different network operators, the chances of answering the call by user of one network would be different from the user of another network as one party would get more time to answer the call than the other party.
Also, every call that lands on a mobile network fetches it money. The interconnect usage charge or IUC is levied by mobile networks handling incoming calls from rival networks, and is a source of revenue for telcos such as Airtel and Vodafone Idea who enjoy more incoming traffic than outgoing.
At present, the IUC is at 6 paise a minute.
Interestingly, Jio, which reduced its outgoing call ringer time to 25 seconds, has more outgoing traffic than incoming. Jio’s outgoing traffic was 64% of its total voice traffic as of June end.
Airtel had alleged in September that with Jio reducing its outgoing call ringing time, the change in pattern results in a missed call, and forces the call receiver on the rival network to dial back and, hence, create incoming call traffic for Jio.
Jio, however, has argued that globally, most operators have an average ringing time of only 15-20 seconds, and 25 seconds ringing time on Jio network is in line with global practice.
The ringing time also impacts network efficiency. The maximum time allowed to answer the call takes on more importance as the alerting phase also engages scarce radio spectrum resources. Ringing for a long time, when a user is unlikely to accept the phone call, would led to non-optimal utilization of resources.
The reverse also has implications. Configuring duration of ringing time on lower side might save resources but may leaf to concerns over network performance, if duration is much lower than the typical time one takes to answer the call."

162,2019-11-03,Airtel,"Reliance Jio has alleged that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have enough funds to pay their duesLast week, SC upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has cautioned that offering any relief to rival operators after a Supreme Court judgement put a  ₹92,000 crore burden on the telecom industry would go against the judgement and set a wrong precedent for other sectors. In a 1 November letter to Union telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd also alleged that Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have enough funds to pay dues.
“Any reduction in the financial liability of the licensees arising from the judgement of the Court would in effect be rewarding them for their conduct in initiating frivolous and vexatious proceedings to delay payment of their just dues,"" Jio said in its letter, a copy of which was seen by Mint.
“Any proposal for waiver will be considered as loss to the public exchequer and contrary to the Supreme Court judgement,"" Jio said.
The fresh salvo from Jio, one of the three core members of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), came just a day after it wrote to the government on 31 October stating that COAI’s plea to the government seeking relief measures does not represent the view of the industry.
Last month, the top court upheld the government’s broader definition of telecom revenue, on which it calculates levies, dealing a blow to operators already burdened with losses and mounting debt. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications and telcos. Telcos will now have to pay the government  ₹92,000 crore in spectrum fees, licence fees and accumulated interest. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, the only non-state firms that have survived a brutal consolidation in the sector over the past three years and posted a loss in the June quarter, have been the worst-hit by the order.
The verdict stated that dues must be paid in three months. However, COAI has urged the government to offer operators a moratorium of two years and 10-year term for payment of dues, post waiver of interest, penalty and interest on penalty.
An email query sent to COAI was unanswered till press time.
“Such largesse, if granted, will become an iniquitous precedent emboldening and encouraging others in similar situations including other sectors and spreading across industry to commit similar breaches and get away with it,"" Jio said in its latest letter.
It has also alleged that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have “no dearth of funds"" to pay government dues.
“While the market cap of Airtel is over  ₹2,50,000 crore, Bharti Infratel which is 100% owned by Airtel, is having market cap of  ₹37,000 crore. The market cap of Indus Towers, as and when listed, will be three times that of Bharti Infratel. Airtel is having 33% stake in Indus Towers. If Airtel liquidates small parts of its assets or issue 15-20% new equity, it can easily arrange  ₹40,000 crore to pay its obligations,"" Jio said.
“Similarly, market cap of Aditya Birla group, one of the Principals of Vodafone Idea, is around  ₹2.3 lakh crore and of Vodafone, the other Principal of Vodafone Idea is $54.88 billion. Vodafone Idea also has stake in Indus Towers,"" it said.
Jio, which is currently the only profitable operator in the sector, has also said that it does not agree with even a single contention in COAI’s letter seeking relief, which was submitted under the influence of two of its members.
“The government has set up the committee of secretaries and we expect they will independently evaluate the situation and make the right decision for the country, its citizens and the industry. This situation did not arise overnight but has been the result of multiple dynamics which COAI has been highlighting over the past several years. We expect and encourage the CoS not to be distracted by motivated rhetoric from any source but do the right thing. We fully respect the honourable SC’s ruling which deals with the past, but believe an independent arm of government can make policy decisions going forward that impact the citizens, economy and industry for the betterment of all,"" Rajan Mathews, Director General, COAI, told Mint."

159,2019-11-05,Airtel,"Raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India is likely to hit a significant roadblockOperators have pinned their hopes on a govt panel set up to suggest relief measures for sector

NEW DELHI :
Two weeks after the country’s top court ordered the telecom industry to pay  ₹92,000 crore in dues to the government, operators have pinned their hopes on a government panel that was set up to suggest relief measures for the sector that is struggling with heavy debt and mounting losses.
The relief measures, experts said, will not only help the telecom industry stay viable and protect billions of dollars in investments, but also prevent the digital economy, which runs on the mobile services infrastructure, from being disrupted.
“The demand of  ₹92,000 crore will dampen the sentiment of telecom operators, and raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India will hit a significant roadblock. The impact is not limited to telecom operators but will have a domino effect on the larger digital value chain. This requires immediate intervention by all stakeholders to get the sector back in shape,"" said Prashant Singhal, emerging markets, technology, media and telecom leader, EY India.
Following the court verdict, the Centre last week set up a Committee of Secretaries under the cabinet secretary to suggest measures to alleviate financial stress in the sector. The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has sought an easier payment schedule for spectrum bought in previous auctions, waiving penalty and interest arising out of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, and a 14-year period to pay the principal amount of AGR dues.
“We expect they will independently evaluate the situation and make the right decision for the country, its citizens and the industry,"" Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI, said.
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which reported losses in the June quarter, were the worst hit by the apex court order.
Bharti Airtel’s dues are roughly  ₹21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea will need to cough up at least  ₹28,309 crore. In contrast, Jio’s dues are just  ₹13 crore. There is no other private operator left in the sector. Aircel and Reliance Communications are bankrupt and Tatas have sold their business to Airtel.
“In a cruel twist of fate, the two companies which actually survived the competitive intensity post Jio’s entry and the consolidation that followed in the three years have effectively been penalised by the verdict on AGR. No one will knock on the doors of companies that shut shop but owed money to the government,"" a senior industry executive said requesting anonymity.
A bruising price war, initiated after Reliance Jio launched services in September 2016 at rock bottom tariffs, has left Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd bleeding financially. In addition, the continuous need for large capital investments and spectrum acquisitions through auctions has resulted in ballooning debt.
If the current wave of consolidation further reduces the number of operators, India may become a monopoly or a duopoly market which will not only reduce customer choices but may potentially lead to higher prices for telecom services.
The DoT is yet to formally issue demand notices to operators.
These dues, incumbent operators believe, will be the straw that breaks the camel’s back.
“Vodafone Idea’s future depends on relief measures at this stage. If it goes to NCLT, the government will not be able to recover even the spectrum dues that the company owes for airwaves bought in the past. If that happens, the question of recovering AGR dues goes out of the window,"" the executive cited above said.
The stress on Vodafone Idea is clear from the fall in its stock price. It was  ₹30 on 31 August 2018, when it started trading as a merged entity. On Monday, the share price closed at  ₹4.51.
After the verdict, even Bharti Airtel has postponed its September quarter earnings as it awaits clarity from the government.
“We fully respect the SC’s ruling which deals with the past, but believe an independent arm of government can make policy decisions going forward that impact the citizens, economy and industry for the betterment of all,"" Mathews said.

MUMBAI :
India won’t back down from collecting $13 billion of past dues from debt-laden telecom carriers because the industry is not under stress, a government official with knowledge of the matter said, a move that could deepen Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Vodafone Idea Ltd.’s financial woes.
India expects the carriers to pay up within 90 days as ordered by the Supreme Court last month, the official said, asking not to be identified, as the discussions are private. A panel of top bureaucrats could look at deferred payment plan for some of the dues, the person said.
The government’s stand about the health of the industry mirrors comments made by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which has said it has a “divergent view"" from its rivals. High fees, frequent flip-flops and endless tax demands over the years have driven most operators aground. From over 10 operators few years ago, India has just three non-state players left with two of them saddled with a mountain of debt.
Vodafone Group Plc’s Indian venture has $14 billion worth of obligations, while Bharti Airtel is rated junk by Moody’s Investors Service. “All telecom operators have asked for requisite help in reducing"" the financial stress, Vodafone Idea said last month.
The “extraordinary scenario"" being shown is “just a machination to extract relief,"" Reliance Jio said in a letter to the minister of communications on Oct. 31.
In the latest instance, the court ordered operators to pay dues using a disputed method for calculating the annual adjusted gross revenue, a share of which is paid as license and spectrum fees. It upheld the government’s method that includes income from non-telecom businesses like dividend from income and capital gains from the sale of assets while rejecting a plea to exclude them.
Spectrum payment
Still, the official said the government is working on a plan to reduce the license fee and providing a two-year moratorium on pending spectrum payments. The proposal will be sent to the finance ministry first before it is taken up by the cabinet, the official said, adding that this may happen in the current financial year.
The telecom ministry spokesman didn’t immediately respond to requests for a comment.
A panel of senior government officials is examining feasibility of deferring payment for airwaves that are due by March 2021 and March 2022 as demanded by telecom companies, a government official told reporters last week. It will also consider the demand for reduction in spectrum usage levies and the Universal Service Obligation Fund charge.
On the introduction of 5G airwaves, the official said there will be no delay in auction, which is due this financial year, and that the government isn’t presuming the telecom sector is under stress. The reserve price for 5G spectrum will not be lowered, he said.
India has fallen behind China and some other countries in plans to introduce 5G, super fast networks seen as essential to developing factory automation, autonomous driving and other artificial intelligence applications.

Here is a list of top stocks that are buzzing in early trade on Wednesday:
Sun Pharma: Shares surged more than 4% after the company said it has entered into a licensing agreement with AstraZeneca UK Ltd to introduce certain novel ready-to-use infusion oncology products in China. The Indian pharma major will look into development, regulatory filings and manufacturing the products while AstraZeneca will exclusively promote and distribute these products in China.
Titan: The stock was the biggest loser among Nifty 50 companies and traded nearly 9% lower in early deals as many brokerages downgraded the stock and cut target price following muted financial performance in the September quarter. Brokerages also reduced the growth outlook for jewellery sales for the second half of this fiscal. The jewellery business had a subdued quarter due to high gold prices.
Bharti Airtel: Shares of the company and its tower business subsidiary Bharti Infratel Ltd fell 1-3% on news reports that the government may not waive dues of the telecom operators under the Supreme Court verdict on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) to ease their financial pressure amid mounting debt and narrowing revenues.
MTNL: Shares jumped nearly 5% as the board of the state-run telecom operator on Monday approved rolling out a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for its employees, days after the government announced a revival package for the stressed telecom company. The government has cleared the proposed merger of MTNL Ltd into state-owned BSNL.
Apollo Tyres: The stock slipped more than 3% after the tyre maker reported a 43.2% decline in its net profit at  ₹83 crore in July-September due to weak performance in the domestic market. The company had posted a net profit of  ₹146 crore a year ago. Slowdown in the auto sector combined with poor demand for tyres from original equipment manufacturers beat the company’s performance.
Aurobindo Pharma: Shares traded down 4% after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued four observations to the company’s Hyderabad units. The health regulator inspected Unit V, API manufacturing facility at Pashamylaram, Hyderabad and Unit VIII, API manufacturing facility at Gaddapotharam, Hyderabad of the company from 21-28 October and 21-25 October respectively."
157,2019-11-06,Airtel,"Current crisis may have an adverse impact on roll-out of 5G, which has a different ecosystem altogetherAnalysts suggest that the telecom companies should be allowed to make the payments later

NEW DELHI :
India’s telecom sector needs a fresh impetus, ranging from cutting the plethora of levies the sector is burdened with, to lowering the reserve price for spectrum in forthcoming auctions, according to experts.
“Rather than taxing the performance of the operators at a fixed rate in perpetuity, the government should look at a variable rate which would leave more investible surplus in the hands of the operators. This will cut borrowings, save interest costs, resulting in some sort of revenue-neutral rate which could be indexed to inflation with another 1% for exigencies,"" said B.K. Syngal, senior principal at Delhi-based Dua Consulting.
The government has generated lower revenue from telecom in each of the past three years. It got a total of  ₹12,100 crore as licence fee and spectrum charges in the year ended 31 March, a 13% decline from  ₹13,700 crore it received in the previous year. It had collected  ₹18,400 crore in FY17.
Telecom services currently attract a goods and services tax of 18%. Companies also pay a licence fee of 8% and spectrum user charges of 3-5%, besides paying corporate tax.
To tide over the immediate crisis, Syngal suggests waiving interest charges from the  ₹92,000 crore in dues that the Supreme Court has directed telecom companies to pay in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case two weeks ago. Syngal said companies should be allowed to pay only the principal amount.
Jaideep Ghosh, partner at KPMG, suggests that telecom companies should be allowed to make the payments later.
Industry stakeholders are also worried about the impact the current crisis could have on the proposed auction of 5G spectrum. The companies are already burdened with massive debt. At the end of March 2019, Bharti Airtel, the ‘healthiest’ of the remaining legacy operators, had a net debt of  ₹1.08 trillion. The company’s annualized FY20 revenue is seen 22.5% lower from 2015-16. Vodafone Idea is expected to fare worse, with revenue likely to decline by 43.4% during the same period.
“5G isn’t an extension of 4G. It’s a different ecosystem altogether. China has already raced ahead in 5G. The government could look at incentivizing users. This will help its Digital India goals as well as improve the health of the companies,"" said Harsh Gupta, chief investment officer at Ashika Group, a financial services firm
Gupta suggests a monthly  ₹30 ‘Digital Literacy Voucher’ for every mobile user for a year.
“You have JAM (Jan Dhan-Aadhar-Mobile) in place. Every mobile user could be given `30 as a monthly recharge with any telecom service provider. That will improve the ARPUs too,"" he said. ARPUs in India are currently the lowest in the world, ranging between  ₹110 and  ₹130 per month for the companies, a clear reflection of the intense competition in the sector.
The industry has for long complained that governments, short of options to raise revenues to finance their social welfare schemes, have used it as a cash cow to make up for their deficits. Their grouse has been that governments haven’t looked at the sector in a holistic manner.
“Many of the problems would be solved if it looked at it holistically and not just as a telecom services provider. All telecom operators are now enablers of digital literacy in some way. They are content providers. What impacts telecom companies also impacts network element providers, logistics providers, tower companies and so on,"" KPMG’s Ghosh said.
He is also not against the idea of deferring the spectrum auction but cautions it shouldn’t be for too long. Ghosh said the auction could be deferred by a few months but added a caveat: “China has moved ahead in 5G. It would not be prudent to delay it for too long,"" he said.
Syngal favours redefining the concept of AGR which currently also includes dividend income, interest and revenues from sale of handsets bundled with services. “The current definition leaves a lot of grey area on what comprises telecom services. A revenue neutral mechanism will eliminate that ambiguity,"" he said.

154,2019-11-07,Airtel,"A DoT official privy to the development said instructions have gone to the licencing wing to carefully examine the implication of the apex court's recent ruling The Supreme Court last month upheld the government's way of calculating telecom revenue

The communications ministry has started examining whether the Supreme Court's ruling on definition of telecom revenue may apply to any company that utilises radiowaves and has a telecom licence, throwing up the possibility of statutory dues swelling beyond  ₹3 lakh crore, according to a source.
A DoT official privy to the development said instructions have gone to the licencing wing to carefully examine the implication of the apex court's recent ruling for all such companies.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will take a week or so to arrive at a definitive conclusion on the matter, the source added.
The Supreme Court last month upheld the government's way of calculating telecom revenue, on which licence fee and spectrum usage charges are computed.
As per the initial calculations, access players like Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators may have to pay the government a whopping  ₹1.42 lakh crore within three months.
Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹42,000 crore after including licence fees and spectrum usage charges, while Vodafone Idea may have to pay about  ₹40,000 crore. Jio may have to pay around  ₹14 crore. The remaining liability is with state-owned BSNL/MTNL and some of the shut/bankrupt companies.
However, DoT is now applying its mind on whether the apex court order also impacts any other company which uses spectrum or has a licence. Discussions are going beyond the scope of 4-5 pure play telecom access providers.
""As we dwell deeper, the issue of larger implications of the SC order is coming up for other firms,"" the source said.
These may even include other category of licences or companies utilising radiowaves in oil and gas, power and even railways sectors, the source said, adding that the question before the telecom department is whether the statutory dues therefore have to be calculated on the overall revenue.
The matter has, however, not been placed before the newly-constituted Committee of Secretaries, as the telecom department first needs to arrive at a final view on the matter, the source added.
Back-of-the-envelope calculations show that if indeed the impact of the SC judgement on AGR goes beyond the pure-play telecom access firms, the statutory dues may climb beyond  ₹3 lakh crore, the source added.
The government recently constituted a Committee of Secretaries to work out a financial bailout package that may include lowering of spectrum charges as well as ending the era of free mobile phone calls and dirt cheap data.
The Committee of Secretaries, headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba, has been asked to examine ""all aspects"" of ""financial stress"" faced by service providers such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea and suggest measures to mitigate them. The panel has already held two meetings since it was constituted."

The telecom department has directed all circle heads to treat Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices as separate entities, as it is in process to challenge their merger in the Supreme Court, according to an official source.
The Department of Telecom has also asked all its entities to deal customer acquisition process and all compliance related issues of both the companies as separate companies.

""The DoT has written that it is in process of two separate special leave petitions before the Supreme Court,"" the source said.
The department in the communication to circle heads asked them to audit customer acquisition form of both companies separately and even the compliance related to subscriber base should be handled separately.
""DoT has directed circle heads that there should be segregation of CAF audit process of Airtel and Tata Teleservices such as submission of separate subscriber database, submission of separate sampled CAF's, calculation of separate compliance percentage and issuance of separate demand notice for imposition of penalty of Airtel and Tata Teleservices,"" the source said.
Bharti Airtel has been submitting Tata Teleservices subscriber base as part of its overall customer base July onwards.

NEW DELHI :
Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it,"" goes the saying. Government policy for India’s telecom sector over the past 25 years has left much to be desired. Not only have mistakes been repeated, but the industry has also had to grapple with various flip-flops in policy.
The upshot: exactly two decades after the government’s relief package for the industry through the New Telecom Policy of 1999, the present government is considering another relief package for the industry. Besides, from the looks of it, Indian telecom seems headed towards a duopoly market again, which is ironic given that this is how it all began for the industry."

JLR-owner Tata Group approaches Geely, BMW in hunt for partners
Tata Group, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has approached carmakers including China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. and BMW AG as it seeks partnerships for the beleaguered British automotive business, Bloomberg reported citing people with knowledge of the matter. India’s largest conglomerate has said it’s open to finding partners for JLR to save on costs and share the burden of investing in electric vehicles. The deliberations were at an early stage and Tata could still approach other potential partners. Any tie-up with a Chinese automaker could potentially help JLR in that market, where its struggles led to a $3.9 billion writedown earlier this year. Deeper ties between the British luxury brand and BMW would build on an existing collaboration to develop engines and electric-drive technology, though the German carmaker’s former chief executive officer in August ruled out any equity investment.

The proposals were submitted on November 4, the deadline for bids. The offers are being vetted and negotiations will follow.The company’s valuation has plummeted by more than 50% from the last time it was put up for sale because the buyer will not be allowed to use IDBI Bank’s network of almost 2,000 branches to sell insurance policies. The three shareholders of the company – state-run IDBI Bank (48% stake), Brussels-based insurer Ageas (26%) and Federal Bank (26%) – had quoted a valuation of  ₹6,000 crore to potential buyers last year before shelving the sale process as the bids did not match expectations.

NEW DELHI :
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has issued notice to telecom operators to pay their revenue share dues within three months as directed by the Supreme Court, according to an industry source.
The DoT has given option to telecom operators to clear all the dues on self-assessment basis.
The Supreme Court in its last month's ruling said, ""We give three months' time to deposit the amount, which is due and compliance be reported.""
""...you are therefore directed to make the payment in accordance with the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court dated October 24, 2019 and submit the requisite documents to ensure the compliance within the stipulated timeframe,"" said a notice which is received by the source.
According to an internal estimate prepared by the DoT, total dues on the telecom service providers arising out of SC order are around  ₹1.33 lakh crore.
As per DoT's estimate, liability of Bharti Airtel Group is  ₹62,187.73 crore, Vodafone Idea  ₹54,183.9 crore and BSNL and MTNL  ₹10,675.18 crore.

NEW DELHI :
Vodafone Group is confident of the India growth story and the country remains a key market for the telecom company, chief executive officer Nick Read has told Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“Read has sent a letter to the PM and other senior government officials to clarify that some of the coverage, particularly in India, has been distorted. Neither he nor his team spoke to any Indian media. Quotes were attributed to him that he never made,"" a person aware of the matter said requesting anonymity.
Mint has not seen a copy of the letter. Emails sent to Vodafone Group and Ministry of Communications were not answered immediately.
""Read spoke specifically about financial stress in telecom sector in India and that situation had become critical,"" the person cited above said, adding that the group appreciates the government’s efforts to set up a special panel to suggest relief measures.
The letter comes a day after news reports suggested that Vodafone Group said that its Indian venture may be headed for liquidation unless the government eases off on demands for mobile spectrum fees.
“If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical,"" Vodafone CEO Nick Read said at a press round-table in London on Tuesday. “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario—can’t get any clearer than that,"" Read said according to a report by Reuters on 12 November.
""Financially there's been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation, excessive taxes and on top of that we got the negative supreme court decision,"" the Reuters report said quoting Read.
His statement come after Vodafone Idea and its arch-rival Airtel are fighting for survival having been dealt a body-blow after the recent Supreme Court verdict upheld the union government’s definition of revenue, which requires these telcos to pay past dues to the government -- Bharti Airtel’s dues are roughly Rs21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea will need to cough up at least Rs28,309 crore. In contrast, Jio’s dues are just Rs13 crore. There is no other private operator left in the sector.
To be sure, following the court verdict, the Centre last month set up a Committee of Secretaries under the cabinet secretary to suggest measures to alleviate financial stress in the sector. The panel will look into the demand of telcos for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 in order to ease cash flow. It will also look at measures such as reducing levies, including spectrum usage charges and the universal service obligation fund (Usof) fee paid by telcos.
Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has sought an easier payment schedule for spectrum bought in previous auctions, waiving penalty and interest arising out of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, and a 14-year period to pay the principal amount of AGR dues."

NEW DELHI :
Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have posted record losses in the September quarter, ravaged by an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter widened to  ₹50,922 crore from  ₹4,874 crore in the year earlier, as it set aside money to pay dues to the government following last month’s adverse court order. Vodafone Idea’s loss is roughly five times its consolidated revenue from operations, which fell to  ₹10,844 crore in the September quarter from  ₹11,270 crore in the year-ago period.
Rival Bharti Airtel Ltd too posted a massive loss, its highest and second quarterly loss in 14 years, amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio that has reshaped India’s telecom market. The New Delhi-based operator swung to a  ₹23,045 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 September from a profit of  ₹118 crore in the year earlier. Bharti Airtel’s loss exceeded its consolidated revenue from operations, which grew 4.9% from a year earlier to  ₹21,131 crore in the September quarter.
The earnings come three weeks after the apex court rejected the contention of telecom operators to exclude revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications (DoT) and telecom operators.
On Wednesday, DoT asked operators to conduct a self-assessment of dues.
Bharti Airtel said it has made provisions without prejudice to the company’s right to contest DoT’s demands on facts as well as on rights available in law and that the liabilities/provisions as on 30 September aggregate  ₹34,260 crore (comprising principal of  ₹8,747 crore, interest of  ₹15,446 crore, penalty of  ₹3,760 crore and  ₹6,307 crore as interest on penalty).
“On the AGR (adjusted gross revenue) verdict of the Supreme Court, we continue to engage with the government and are evaluating various options available to us. We are hopeful that the government will take a considerate view in this matter given the fragile state of the industry,"" said Gopal Vittal, managing director and CEO for India and South Asia at Bharti Airtel.
Airtel said it would require additional financing to meet the liabilities arising from the court verdict.
“The company has an established track record of accessing diversified sources of finance across markets and currencies. However, there can be no assurance of the success of management’s plans to access additional sources of finance to the extent required, on terms acceptable to the company, and to raise these amounts in a timely manner,"" the company said on Friday. “This represents a material uncertainty whereby, it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, and accordingly may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.""
Vodafone Idea said it is in the process of filing a review petition.
“It is to be noted that our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on obtaining the reliefs from the government as discussed above and positive outcome of the proposed legal remedy,"" Vodafone Idea said in its statement on Thursday. After the Supreme Court judgement on AGR, the telecom operator has recognized a charge of  ₹25,677.9 crore in the financial statements."

“Telecom sector is under immense financial stress (as) admitted by all stakeholders. Further demand of  ₹92,000 crore will dampen the sentiment of telecom operators and raising funds for broadband, network expansion and Digital India will hit a significant roadblock.

This requires immediate intervention by all stakeholders to get the sector back in shape,"" said Prashant Singhal, emerging markets, technology, media and telecom leader, EY India.

When telcos such as Aircel Ltd and Reliance Communications Ltd went bust, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal had said that the consolidation in the sector had happened in a disorderly fashion and that a whopping $50 billion in investments in the sector had been wiped out.
Vodafone Idea Ltd is certainly in a far bigger league. It happens to be India’s largest telecom company by number of subscribers and it is also the company with the largest foreign direct investment into the country.
Its possible demise will clearly be more disorderly, both in terms of the disruption it causes in the industry, but also for future foreign direct investment prospects.
Among other things, experts have blamed an unstable regulatory environment, high cost of operations, hyper-intensive competition and rock-bottom tariffs for the current state of the company.
On Tuesday, however, its chief executive officer Nick Read said that Vodafone has pledged not to put any more money into the business in India, and Vodafone Idea may be headed for liquidation unless the government eases off on demands for mobile spectrum fees, according to a Reuters report.
“If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical,"" Read said at a press round-table in London on Tuesday. “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario—can’t get any clearer than that.""
The UK-based telecom company’s 12-year journey in India has seen highs and lows, much like the telecom sector. The big hit came with the government enacting a retrospective tax rule to recover what it thought was its rightful share of profit from Hutchison’s sale of its stake in its India operations to Vodafone Group.
Even as the operator was reeling under the effects of this blow, the next big shock hit Vodafone India when Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani’s new telecom venture Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd entered the market in September 2016.
Jio disrupted the market with free data and voice offerings, shrinking revenue streams of all other operators. This also led to a brutal consolidation that reshaped the entire telecom sector. Companies that were already saddled with debt, due to expensive airwaves bought in previous spectrum auctions could not compete with the sharply low tariffs offered by Jio.
As a result, Vodafone India and Idea Cellular in March 2017 decided to merge their pan India networks to stay in the battlefield. Airtel acquired Tata Teleservices, Telenor and Tikona Digital. Aircel and Reliance Communications went bankrupt.
The next hit to both Airtel and Vodafone Idea came in September 2017 when the regulator decided to slash interconnect usage charges (IUC) from 14 paise to 6 paise a minute. The two incumbents which both enjoyed huge incoming traffic were hit hard. On the other hand, Jio’s costs on delivering voice calls to rival networks also came down.
At that time, Vodafone also lashed out at the regulator. “We only ask for a level-playing field in terms of regulation. I think it’s fair to say that for the last two years, we have had many regulatory outcomes that have worked against everyone in the market except Jio. We have made these points clear even earlier,"" Read said at a press briefing at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February.
Today, however, Vodafone Idea and its arch-rival Airtel are fighting for survival, having been dealt a body-blow after the recent Supreme Court verdict upheld the Union government’s definition of revenue, which requires these telcos to pay past dues to the government. Bharti Airtel on Thursday said that its liabilities/provisions as on 30 September aggregate  ₹34,260 crore. Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore. This demand, at a time when the industry faces a mountain of debt and rock-bottom revenues, will not only hurt investment climate in the country, but will also be detrimental given the huge resources that telcos need to raise for broadband proliferation, network expansion and to realize Digital India.
Telcos are the backbone of digital services and a crucial stakeholder for the country to unlock the $5 trillion GDP dream by 2024. Without government offering relief, there will be a domino effect on the larger digital value chain.
However, Reliance Jio disagrees with this prognosis. In a letter to the government, the company said, “We further submit that the failure of two operators, even in the unlikely event of it actually happening, will not have an impact on the sector dynamics with existence of vibrant competition including presence of the PSUs and there is no restriction on entry by new operators. Further, there will be no impact on digitization and government programmes, as these operators, anyway were not investing sufficiently in the sector and have been claiming a financial stress for a long time now and they have not shown any inclination to modernize the networks, as evident for Trai data in its IUC consultation paper."" Incumbents such as Vodafone Idea and Airtel, on the other hand, claim that their networks reach the poorest of the poor, given the fact that 4G compatible handsets are out of the reach for this set of customers.
“A sudden demise of a player in India will reduce competition within the sector becoming a two-player market. The market will not be able to handle extra subscribers and quality of service will be impacted especially in rural markets which has a large 2G and 3G base, which is not catered to by Jio’s pure 4G network,"" said Rajiv Sharma, head of institutional equity research, SBICAP Securities.
To be sure, following the court verdict, the Centre last month set up a Committee of Secretaries under the cabinet secretary to suggest measures to alleviate financial stress in the sector. The panel will look into the demand of telcos for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 in order to ease cash flow. It will also look at measures such as reducing levies, including spectrum usage charges and the universal service obligation fund (Usof) fee paid by telcos.
Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has sought an easier payment schedule for spectrum bought in previous auctions, waiving penalty and interest arising out of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues, and a 14-year period to pay the principal amount of AGR dues.
The DoT, however, has now demanded payments from telcos within the three-month deadline set by the SC. Even as it awaits recommendations of the top panel, Union telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has assured operators that the department of telecommunications (DoT) will review prices for upcoming auctions."
146,2019-11-14,Airtel,"Indian telcos, which offer cheapest data, pay more for airwaves, a situation that has proved ruinous for manyEffectively, of every  ₹100 telcos receive from customers, the government gets  ₹30

NEW DELHI :
In levying taxes and in shearing sheep, it is well to stop when you get down to the skin"" said American author Austin O’Malley.
The aphorism pithily captures what Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Airtel Ltd, and other top executives of the Indian telecom industry have been trying to convey to the government in many ways.
Mittal, in fact, went to the extent of comparing the taxation on the sector to that of the tobacco industry, a target of high taxes because of its harmful impact on society.
“On the one hand, we have the prime minister’s vision of a digitally enabled India, which requires tremendous investments, and on the other, we keep spectrum prices very high, licence fee is high, spectrum charges are high and GST is at 18%, which is almost at the highest tax bracket. We cannot have these two competing positions in the industry,"" Mittal said at the India Mobile Congress in October last year.
Ironically, Indian telecom operators, which offer the cheapest mobile data services in the world, pay more for airwaves than any of their global counterparts, an unsustainable situation that has proved ruinous for many.
In addition, they pay 18% goods and services tax (GST) and also 3-5% of the adjusted gross revenue as spectrum usage charges and 8% as licence fee to the government.
Effectively, for every  ₹100 telcos receive from customers,  ₹30 go straight to the government’s coffers. If one were to include the high interest costs associated with the deferred spectrum liabilities owed to the government, the amount of revenues shared with the government would be of a higher order. In Vodafone Idea Ltd’s case, net interest costs accounted for 30% of revenue in the quarter ended 30 June.
With a significant share of its revenue going to the government in the form of levies and interest payments, it’s little wonder that the company hasn’t had enough left to cover its other costs, leave alone capital expenditure needs. In the June quarter, the firm’s pre-tax loss stood at as high as  ₹5,900 crore.
Vodafone Group Plc has now written off its investment in the India joint venture with the Birla group. “Financially, there’s been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation and excessive taxes..."" the London-based company’s CEO Nick Read said about its India operations while announcing the September quarter earnings."
145,2019-11-14,Airtel,"The government issued the notices even as it has constituted a committee to suggest relief measures for the troubled sectorOne estimate pegs combined AGR related liability Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel at over  ₹70,000 crore

The government’s notices to telecom operators asking them to assess licence and spectrum fee dues as per the Supreme Court ruling on the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) has come as surprise. Shares of both Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd slumped in trade on Thursday. The government issued the notices even as it has constituted a committee to suggest relief measures for the troubled sector.
Incidentally, incumbents Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel are slated to release their September quarter earnings today. Given the size of the amounts being discussed, the focus is on the operating financial performance. “Obviously the focus is on the profit and loss account but AGR payment remains a key overhang on the balance sheets of both companies,"" says Abhishek Shindadkar, analyst at Elara Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd.
One estimate pegs combined AGR related liability Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel at over  ₹70,000 crore. September quarter results will provide clarity on the telcos’ ability to assume and clear such amounts in a time-bound manner.
Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel released its key operating metrics last month. The headline numbers indicated stability. Sequentially, India mobile services business revenue expanded for the third consecutive quarter, albeit slightly. Overall customer losses eased considerably and better yielding 4G data customers saw notable additions.
Pending clarity on the liability arising out of the Supreme Court verdict on license fee dues, Bharti Airtel delayed the release of the rest of the operating metrics to 14 November. Tracking telcos’ pleas for relief measures and the government’s move (formation of a panel), investors were led to believe that the Supreme Court verdict may not be implemented in spirit. But the latest notice on the dues questions this assumption.
If Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel need to cough-up the said amounts, it can worsen their already weak financial condition, warn analysts. “It (AGR) will be a drag on both Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel but substantial for Vodafone Idea given its relatively high leverage,"" adds Shindadkar of Elara Securities.
Incumbents which are already lagging behind Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in capital expenditure will have to curb investments. This can accentuate customer, business losses.
Even Bharti Airtel, which is seen to be better placed, may be forced to curb investments, warn analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd. The prognosis for Vodafone Idea is precarious. “For Vodafone Idea, the payments itself will use up all existing and operating cash flows excluding interest over next three years. Even with a moratorium on spectrum dues, it will not have funding for capex,"" adds analysts at Jefferies.
Many investors expect the market to move towards duopoly with Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio assuming pole positions. But such a scenario will have far reaching implications.
One, scale-down of a large incumbent telco will adversely impact the cost structure of Bharti Airtel. “A sharp, abrupt change in market structure may raise concerns over Bharti’s ability to continue with a low cost model as the decline in tower sharing may jeopardize its benefits from tower sharing model, and result in rising costs and overall capex (led by incremental investments in towers),"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
Second, it will adversely affect the business of infrastructure service providers such as Bharti Infratel Ltd, whose shares were also in the red, down 7%, on Thursday."
148,2019-11-14,Airtel,"On 24 October, SC directed telcos to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the govt within three monthsDoT’s letter comes about three weeks after SC rejected the definition of AGR proposed by telcos

The department of telecommunications has asked operators to conduct a self-assessment of dues after last month’s Supreme Court verdict upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue.
“It is the responsibility of licencees to pay licence fees and other dues after carrying out their own assessment as prescribed in the licence agreement. You are therefore directed to make the payment in accordance with the order of Supreme Court and submit requisite documents to ensure compliance within stipulated timeframe,"" DoT said in a 13 November letter to operators, a copy of which was reviewed by Mint. Self-assessment of dues will minimize the risk of mismatch in calculations. On 24 October, the court directed operators to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months.
The latest demand may spell more trouble for the telecom operators, which are struggling under a mountain of debt, declining revenues and widening losses. Further pressure on telcos to pay the dues may also hurt the investment climate in the country, and the forthcoming roll-out of 5G services.
Bharti Airtel Ltd’s dues are roughly  ₹21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea Ltd will need to cough up at least  ₹28,309 crore. In contrast, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s dues are just  ₹13 crore.
DoT’s letter comes about three weeks after the top court rejected the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) proposed by the telecom operators that excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
The tussle started when telecom operators migrated to a new revenue-sharing system offered by the government in 1999 under which they agreed to share a certain percentage of revenue with the government.
Operators had argued that AGR should comprise revenue from telecom services, but DoT insisted that it should include all revenue generated by an operator. Currently, telcos pay 3-6% and 8% of their AGR as spectrum usage charges and licence fee (including USOF), respectively.
Meanwhile, a committee of secretaries under the cabinet secretary is considering demands of telcos for relief and will suggest ways to alleviate their financial stress and create a favourable investment environment.

Bharti Airtel Ltd posted a massive net loss, its second quarterly loss in 14 years, amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that has ravaged its rivals and reshaped India’s telecom market.
The New Delhi-based operator swung to a  ₹23,045 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 September from a net profit of  ₹118 crore in the year earlier, due to provisions made for an unfavourable court verdict.
Bharti Airtel’s net loss exceeded its consolidated revenue from operations which grew 4.9% year on year to  ₹21,131 crore in the September quarter.
Airtel’s results come three weeks after the apex court upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, on which it calculates levies on telecom operators, dealing a  ₹92,000 crore blow to the telecom industry, which is already burdened with falling tariffs and mounting debt.
The top court rejected the definition of the adjusted gross revenue proposed by telecom operators and excluded revenue from non-core telecom operations, such as rent, dividend and interest income. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the DoT and operators.
The department of telecommunications has also asked operators to conduct a self-assessment of dues.
Bharti Airtel, in a statement on Thursday, said it is hopeful of relief and in the absence of the same, has provided for an additional amount aggregating  ₹28,450 crore as a charge for the quarter (comprising of Principal of Rs. 6,164 crore, interest of  ₹12,219 crore, penalty of Rs. 3,760 crore, and interest on penalty of Rs. 6,307 crore) with respect to the license fee as estimated based on the Court Judgement and spectrum usage charges as estimated based on the definition of AGR.
Airtel’s revenue from mobile services in India was  ₹10,811 crore in the three months ended 30 September, up from  ₹10,724 crore in the June quarter. Its subscriber base grew from 276.81 million in the preceding quarter to 279.43 million in the September quarter."

NEW DELHI :
India is considering requests for financial relief from mobile carriers Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd, the federal finance minister said on Friday.
Bharti and Vodafone Idea are due to pay the bulk of 920 billion rupees ($13 billion) in overdue levies and interest owed by telecoms firms to the state, after India's Supreme Court last month upheld a demand by the telecoms department.
Both companies reported combined losses amounting to more than $10 billion on Thursday, after making provisions for the dues owed to the government. They have also asked the government for relief from the charge. Relief measures could include a waiver or deferred payment terms.
New Delhi is not rushing to account for the money it will receive from telecom operators after the Supreme Court ruling, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters on Friday, adding the government was yet to take a final decision on companies' requests.
India has formed a panel of bureaucrats to suggest ways to alleviate financial pressures on the telecoms sector which once comprised more than a dozen carriers but is now left with three major private players."

Bharti Infratel stock was 5.7% up at  ₹220.55 per share.
While Vodafone Idea’s September quarter loss of  ₹50,921 crore was its biggest, the company’s revenue from operations surged more than 37% at  ₹10,844 crore in the same quarter last year.
While provisions of  ₹28,450 crore forced Bharti Airtel to report a loss of  ₹23,044 crore in July-September, its second quarterly loss in 14 years and also its highest ever, the company’s consolidated revenue from operations grew 4.9% from a year earlier to  ₹21,131 crore in the last concluded quarter.
Last month, the Supreme Court (SC) had rejected the contention of telecom operators to exclude revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications (DoT) and telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea is staring at an insolvency, the top management of the two partners in the company, Vodafone and Idea, having suggested that there will be no further equity infusion. Vodafone retracted the statement later.

NEW DELHI :
 Reliance Jio on Friday said that delaying the implementation of zero call connect charges beyond January 2020 will hurt affordability of telecom services in a sector where users have benefited from free voice calls.
Reliance Jio Director Mahendra Nahata said that the ratio of incoming and outgoing call is now at par with each other and traffic asymmetry can, therefore, no longer be the reason to delay implementation of Bill and Keep (BAK) regime (that is zero mobile termination charge from January 1, 2020).
Traffic symmetry indicates that telecom operator will not have any outstanding balance of interconnect usage charges (IUC) against other networks.
Speaking at Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's (Trai) open house on IUC issue, Nahata said Airtel had expanded 4G network and Vodafone Idea too is talking about expanding their 4G network.
""We are not considering any profit or loss, but opposing it on the basis of principle. Criticising the decision of government or regulatory authorities from a distant location is beyond our understanding. Therefore, please take a decision after due diligence on all the points that we have raised,"" he said.
Nahata questioned data being shown by telecom operators and alleged that the subscriber traffic is being diverted to 2G, 3G network to show cost of voice is high.
Nahata said that in case Trai does not favour implementation of BAK regime from January 2020 then at least interconnect usage charges currently at 6 paise should be brought down.
""When you had implemented 6 paise charge, 4G traffic was one per cent. Today that traffic is much higher so the costs must have come down,"" he said.
A Vodafone Idea official said that consumers today have the option of moving to other networks through mobile number portability (MNP).
""Today customers have option of MNP and they can move to other network. It is wrong to say that any operator is holding back customers on 2G network,"" the official said, demanding that the mobile call termination charges should continue.
Airtel said that IUC should not come down to zero and the BAK regime should be postponed by at least three years.
Meanwhile, Bharti Airtel's Chief Regulatory Officer Ravi Gandhi rejected allegations of data fudging terming them as ""misplaced"" and said that people at times used the company's SIM into second slot of mobile phone which generally supports 2G or 3G network.
He said there are 40 crore consumers are on 2G network and they use low-cost feature phones. Shutting down 2G network will mean depriving such consumers of telecom services."

Vodafone Idea: The company reported a whopping net loss of  ₹50,922 crore in the quarter-ended September compared with a net loss of  ₹4,874 crore a year ago, as the Supreme Court’s verdict in favour of the department of telecommunications led to provisions made for dues and penalties to be paid to the government.

138,2019-11-15,Airtel,"Vodafone Idea Ltd. took a one-time charge that led to a net loss of  ₹50,900 crore loss in the three months through September

After posting the worst quarterly loss in India’s corporate history, Vodafone Group Plc’s besieged local venture is appealing for urgent relief from the government to help avert a collapse. Facing a $4 billion demand from India to cover past dues, Vodafone Idea Ltd. took a one-time charge that led to a net loss of 509 billion rupees ($7.1 billion) in the three months through September.
The nation’s second-largest phone operator, formed by the merger of the British firm’s local unit with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular Ltd., hasn’t seen any profit since the deal was announced in 2017.
“The company’s ability to continue as going concern is dependent on obtaining the reliefs from the government,"" Vodafone Idea said in a statement late Thursday. It is “in active discussions with the government seeking financial relief,"" it said.
Saddled with $14 billion of net debt, Vodafone Idea is fighting for survival after India’s top court last month ordered it to pay additional fees the government said were due from prior years. Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Nick Read told reporters this week in London that the situation was “critical"" and unless India eases off on its demands, the venture may be headed for liquidation.
Rival Bharti Airtel Ltd. also posted a record net loss on Thursday after the close of market hours, highlighting the extreme financial stress of the Indian telecom operators as they battle high levels of debt, a bruising price war unleashed by billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. and more recently, the adverse court verdict.
In its Oct. 24 verdict, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favor of the government’s method of calculating operators’ revenue, a decision that means carriers must pay about $13 billion combined - mostly license and spectrum fees built up over years. Tycoon Sunil Mittal’s Bharti Airtel owes $3 billion, while Reliance Jio needs to pay 130 million rupees, the least, since it has only been in business since 2016.
The finance ministry won’t back down from collecting the amount, which needs to be paid within three months as per the court order, an official with knowledge of the matter said this month.
The demand has come as a severe blow to Vodafone Idea at a time when it is facing competitive pressure from Jio. The upstart controlled by Asia’s richest man barreled into India’s wireless market three years ago and vaulted to the top with free calls and cheap data, acquiring about 380 million users.
Jio’s entry drove some incumbents to bankruptcy, while some like Vodafone and Idea merged. But the pressure on earnings continued. Bharti Airtel, whose parent counts Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. as an investor, reported the highest ever quarterly loss of 230.4 billion rupees for three months ended September.
Losses at Bharti Airtel forced SingTel to also make such a hefty provision that it slipped into a quarterly loss for the first time. Vodafone Idea took a one-time charge of 256.8 billion rupees.
Airtel continues to engage with the government, Gopal Vittal, company’s chief executive officer for India and South Asia operations said in a statement, referring to India’s top court verdict on dues. “We are hopeful that the government will take a considerate view in this matter given the fragile state of the industry,"" said Vittal.
To ease the pressure on its Indian venture’s finances, Newbury, England-based Vodafone, which owns about 45% of the venture, said this week that it wants a two-year delay on spectrum payments and lower license fees and taxes. It’s also called for the spectrum payment demanded by the court to be spread over 10 years and is asking for waiver and penalties.
“If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical,"" Vodafone CEO Read said on Nov. 12. “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario -- can’t get any clearer than that.""
Earlier, Read said Vodafone would refrain from plowing more money into India. The other partner, Birla, won’t inject fresh equity and will opt for insolvency if the government doesn’t provide relief, the Economic Times reported Thursday, citing people it didn’t identify.
At the same time, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., the largest carrier, has insisted its two smaller rivals can and should pay up on time.
A government panel is considering deferring payments due by March 2021 and March 2022, an official said last month. It will also consider cutting spectrum fees and other charges, said another official, who asked not to be identified citing rules.
India had a dozen independent carriers two years ago, and just three non-state operators are left standing today. The only clear winner has been Jio, which is backed by the deep pockets of Ambani’s sprawling energy-to-petrochemicals empire.

Mumbai: Indian stock markets may continue to be in a range on Friday even as global peers rose. Asian equities gained after S&P 500 index hit a new record closing high. However, investor sentiment remained fragile following weak data from China and Germany, which reinforced concerns of a slowing global economy.
Early in the Asian trading day, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.34%. Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.58% and Australian shares climbed up 0.53%.
On the currency front, the safe-haven yen weakened, with the dollar rising 0.11% to buy 108.50 yen. The euro was unchanged at $1.1021 and the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals was flat at 98.163.
Higher US Treasury yields also indicated a slight risk-on tone in the Asian session, with the 10-year yield rising to 1.8307% from a US close of 1.815% on Thursday.
The policy-sensitive two-year yield rose to 1.6036% from 1.593% on Thursday after the US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the risk of the US economy facing a dramatic bust is remote.
A Reuters poll of more than 100 economists showed that while concerns have eased over a recession in the US, few see an economic rebound, and most believe a trade truce is unlikely in the coming year.
Global sentiment has been buffeted in recent weeks by conflicting assessments of progress in talks between the US and China over ending their 16-month-long trade war.
On Thursday, China's commerce ministry said the two countries are holding ""in-depth"" discussions on a first phase trade agreement, and that cancelling tariffs is an important condition to reaching a deal. China has also ended a nearly five-year ban on imports of US poultry meat, which the US Trade Representative said would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.
These developments followed comments from officials from both countries last week that they had a deal to roll back tariffs, only to have US President Donald Trump deny that any such deal was not agreed to.

Back home, telecom stocks will be in focus today. Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have posted record losses in the July-September, ravaged by an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of adjusted gross revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter widened to  ₹50,922 crore from  ₹4,874 crore in the year earlier, as it set aside money to pay dues to the government following last month’s adverse court order. The company’s loss is roughly five times its revenue from operations, which fell to  ₹10,844 crore in the September quarter from  ₹11,270 crore in the year-ago period.
Rival Bharti Airtel too posted a massive loss, its highest and second quarterly loss in 14 years, amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that has reshaped India’s telecom market.
India and China said a new committee, headed by senior ministers, will meet at the earliest and discuss ways to pare the $53-billion trade deficit between the two countries.

143,2019-11-15,Airtel,"Bharti Airtel has provided for a liability of  ₹34,260 cr ($4.8 bn), in keeping with the court orderInvestors are pricing in higher market share gains from Vodafone Idea, if no relief is provided

One man’s poison is another man’s meat Ever since the Supreme Court pronounced its verdict on licence and spectrum fee dues by telcos to the government, shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd have fallen by 48% to a mere  ₹2.95 per share. Meanwhile, shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd have been resolute at the  ₹360 levels.
It’s not that Airtel has not been affected. On Thursday, while announcing its September quarter results, the company said it has provided for a liability of  ₹34,260 crore ($4.8 billion), in keeping with the apex court’s directions on calculating its dues. Airtel had cash, cash equivalents and investments worth  ₹18,473 crore at the end of September 2019. Its net debt stood at  ₹1.18 trillion. Undoubtedly, its leverage ratio will spike as a result of the order.
Airtel’s investors are, however, taking courage from the fact that even in the worst-case scenario, that is, even if it does not get any relief from the government, the Sunil Mittal-led telco will stand to gain market share, which will result from the exit of Vodafone Idea from the market.
Besides, if the government provided significant relief, Airtel still stands to gain. For stock markets, therefore, Airtel is far better placed. Vodafone Idea, in turn, reported a  ₹44,150 crore liability, and a cash balance of around  ₹15,390 crore.
The government has asked telcos to pay the dues within the three-month deadline set by the Supreme Court, which ends in end-January.
Airtel’s leverage ratios are far better than Vodafone Idea’s and it is expected to have better access to funding to pay the dues demanded by the government. The firm’s stronger financial position is also reflected in its better financial performance.
Airtel reported 3% sequential increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) on the back of 1% growth in revenue. Most analysts were projecting a sequential fall in operating earnings, with Q2 being a seasonally weak quarter.
Vodafone Idea, on the other hand, reported an 8.3% sequential decline in Ebitda on a like-to-like basis, on the back of a 3.8% fall in revenue. The company’s weak network is resulting in market share losses.
Part of Airtel’s gains in profitability were due to a one-off recovery in bad debt, although the quantum of the write-back was not revealed by the company.
The improvement in sequential performance considerably reduced operating losses (i.e. losses before interest and tax) at the company’s India mobile services unit. As a consequence, the loss before tax at the consolidated entity more than halved sequentially to  ₹623 crore.
But these changes of a few hundred crore in quarterly losses are insignificant in light of the larger issue of government dues and the possibility of a relief package. News flow on the extent of relief and the possibility of a duopoly market will determine the direction of the Airtel stock."
135,2019-11-16,Airtel,"Mobile tariffs are now under forbearance, which means operators have a free hand in fixing ratesIf a floor price is set, free services could be passé

The telecom regulator has not received any communication regarding the setting up of a floor price on voice or data services either from the department of telecommunications or the government panel looking into the revival of the sector.
“We have not received any reference,"" Telecom Regulatory Authority of India chairman R.S. Sharma told reporters on Friday.
At present, mobile tariffs are under forbearance, which means operators have a free hand in fixing rates—they only have to report tariff plans to Trai within seven days of the launch.
If a floor price is set, free services could be passé.
In 2017, after Reliance Jio entered the telecom space with free data and voice tariffs, existing telcos had approached the regulator to consider setting up a floor price as their revenue streams started shrinking. Back then, Trai had said a floor price “was not a workable idea"" and, subsequently, operators, too, were in agreement.
Sharma’s statement comes at a time when the sector is reeling under severe financial stress. The Centre has set up a committee to look into relief measures, such as reduction of levies and a moratorium on spectrum fees.
This panel will also examine the aspect of minimum charge (floor tariff) for voice and data services to ensure that the financial health of the sector remains robust and viable, Mint had reported on 29 October.
Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have reported record losses for the September quarter, ravaged by a Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue, based on which it calculates the licence fees of telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter was at  ₹50,922 crore—the highest in India’s corporate history—as it set aside money to pay dues to the government following the court order. The loss is roughly five times the telecom operator’s consolidated revenue.
Airtel, too, reported its highest quarterly loss in 14 years, amid a brutal price war unleashed by Jio, which has reshaped India’s telecom market. The New Delhi-based operator swung to a  ₹23,045 crore loss in the quarter ended 30 September from a profit of  ₹118 crore in the year earlier."

Without naming Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel Director (Finance) Harjeet Kohli in a letter to resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty said his company's request to extend the deadline was turned down by the committee of creditors (CoC) of RCom but surprisingly, the dates have been extended to accommodate submission by a bidder.
""Given the complexities involved in the proposed transaction, vide our letter dated October 31, 2019, we requested for an extension of time to submit the resolution plan from November 11, 2019, till December 1, 2019... Disappointingly, our request for extension was rejected by CoC,"" Kohli said.
Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and private equity firm Varde Partners have already submitted their bids for assets of Reliance Communications, while Reliance Jio has sought extension of the asset sale deal deadline by another 10 days. Airtel has placed conditional bid to buy spectrum of RCom, while Bharti Infratel has submitted bids for mobile towers.
The CoC extended the deadline by 10 days and has decided to open bid now on November 25.
""To our utter shock, we have learnt that the CoC has now decided to extend the submission timeline to November 25, 2019, until 1200 hours, solely based on the request of another potential bidder,"" Kohli said.
He said that since Bharti Airtel's request was formally declined by the CoC, the company was constrained to submit the bids under due haste without the benefit of sufficient time to complete the resolution plan within the set deadline.
""We find this conduct, inequitable, questionable and against the spirit of what should be a highly transparent process. To say the least, it is extremely unfair and rather biased...we hereby formally withdraw our resolution plans while reserving all rights, including the right to submit our resolution plan afresh within the new deadline communicated now,"" Kohli said.
RCom tried to sell assets to various companies, including Reliance Jio, to clear debt but the deals did not crystallise. Reliance Jio cancelled agreement to buy RCom assets, including spectrum, as it did not want to bear the past liabilities of the debt-ridden firm.
Later, the insolvency proceedings against RCom started on a plea filed by Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson after the company failed to clear its dues.
RCom Chairman Anil Ambani has tendered his resignation after the company posted a consolidated loss of  ₹30,142 crore for July-September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
This was the second-highest loss posted by any Indian corporate till date.
The National Company Law Tribunal has handed over the control of the company to an insolvency resolution professional.
Sources estimate that RCom Group's total secured debt is around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claim of around  ₹49,000 crore in August.
RCom has put its all assets for sale which include spectrum holding of 122 MHz that the company before insolvency proceedings estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, towers business for  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.

NEW DELHI :
The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) has approached Chinese telecom gear maker Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd and three Indian telcos, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, to display their connected car technologies at the 2020 Auto Expo in Delhi, two people aware of the matter said.
In its first such outreach, the lobby group has also asked the companies to think of ways to collaborate with it for the event.
The companies, all of which are in various stages of building connected car technologies, are yet to respond to the invite, the people said, requesting anonymity.
The move to partner with telcos comes amid the year-long slowdown in the auto industry, which has prompted top manufacturers, including Toyota Kirloskar Motors Pvt. Ltd, Honda Cars India Ltd, TVS Motor Co. Ltd, Hero MotoCorp Ltd and Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Ltd, deciding to skip the biennial event to save costs.
According to the first person, Siam’s move indicates that auto shows were no longer just about launching vehicles, but about displaying the technologies on offer.
“Connected car technology is going to be an essential part of the automobile industry going forward and is evolving rapidly. Hence, Siam has approached them, but the companies have not yet confirmed their participation for the event. This is for the first time Siam has approached so many players from another sector for the Expo,"" he added.
As global automakers increase investments in new eco-friendly technologies for electric and autonomous vehicles, regional auto shows are losing relevance.
Email queries to Huawei, Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea remained unanswered.
Huawei, which is facing global scrutiny over 5G network security concerns, has already made significant strides with connected car technologies.
In July 2018, Huawei and Audi had signed a memorandum of understanding on strategic cooperation in Berlin to jointly develop intelligent connected vehicles. Subsequently in October the same year, Huawei and Audi showcased their plans for such vehicles at a Shanghai event, which featured the new Audi Q7 with its state-of-the-art technology.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have also been working on connected cars. Jio, too, is working on an IoT platform for connected cars.
At the India Mobile Congress in October, Bharti Airtel showcased a connected car, MG Motor’s Hector, which is powered by Airtel’s connectivity suite.
Likewise, Vodafone Idea and Korean automobile company Kia Motors signed a partnership in October for the India debut of the UVO connected car system with the new Kia Seltos.
Vodafone Idea’s ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT) will boost Kia by integrating e-SIMs, which enables voice, 3G/4G data, SMS, and an application programming interface.
Simply put, a connected car has seamless connectivity to the internet which enables a host of features for easier and safer driving experience.

Stung by the ongoing telecom crisis, Bharti Airtel said on Monday it will increase telecom service rates from 1 December, 2019. The announcement comes hours after Vodafone Idea saying on Monday that it will ""suitably increase the prices of its tariffs"" from 1 December. Both the players, however, did not announce the quantum of hike that is expected to be worked out between now and 1 December.
""We understand that TRAI is likely to initiate a consultation for bringing rationality in pricing in the Indian mobile sector which has been operating at prices that have been eroding the viability of the sector,"" Airtel said in its statement.
""Sector is highly capital intensive with fast changing tech cycles that require continuing investments. It is, therefore, extremely important that industry remains viable to support vision of Digital India. Accordingly, company will hike prices from December,"" the company further said.

125,2019-11-18,Airtel,"The companies are raising prices for the first time in more than a decade, but did not specify the quantum of hikesA committee of secretaries under the cabinet secretary is considering demands of telcos for relief

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd will next month raise prices of their services for the first time in more than a decade, the two companies said in separate statements on Monday.
The increase comes after a prolonged period of hypercompetition in India, where telecom tariffs are the cheapest in the world. The companies did not say by how much they plan to raise tariffs.
The move follows an adverse Supreme Court judgement that dealt a  ₹92,000 crore blow to legacy telecom operators, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have been struggling with mounting debt, declining revenue and record losses.
The decisions come amid reports that the government plans to introduce a floor price for telecom tariffs to prevent predatory pricing. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), with whom the jurisdiction on tariffs rests, is yet to receive a reference from the department of telecommunications (DoT), a senior Trai official said on condition of anonymity. Trai has so far let telecom tariffs to be determined by market forces of demand and supply.
“While continuing to provide affordable tariffs to customers, it (price hike) would balance the needs of the company to remain viable and thereby continue to invest in the much needed digital infrastructure and maintain the quality standards required by our customer,"" Bharti Airtel said in the statement.
In the 24 October judgement, the top court directed telecom operators to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months, upholding the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) which included revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
Following the verdict, Nick Read, chief executive officer of Vodafone Group Plc, the joint venture partner in Vodafone Idea, said, “If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical."" Bloomberg also cited him as saying in London that “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario—can’t get any clearer than that."" Read later clarified that he was misquoted
Vodafone Idea “will continue to actively invest in making its network future-fit by embedding new age technologies and launching new products/services to cater to the evolving needs of its over 300 million customers"", the firm said in a statement on Monday.
Incumbent operators, no strangers to competition, were delivered a jolt by the 2016 entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd that bundled free unlimited voice services with its cut-price data offering. The legacy companies were forced to match the tariffs and in the price war that ensued, several operators such as Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices either went bust or had to sell out.
Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said the government doesn’t want any mobile services company to shut shop.
A committee of secretaries under the cabinet secretary is considering demands of telecom companies for relief and will suggest ways to alleviate their financial stress and create a favourable investment climate. The government panel will also look into the demand of telecom companies for deferment of spectrum auction payment dues for FY21 and FY22 in order to ease cash flow as well as measures such as reducing levies, including spectrum usage charges.
At 1.17 billion mobile users at the end of August, India is the world’s second-largest market by number of subscribers."
113,2019-11-19,Airtel,"Tariff hikes may not be enough for older telecom operators to overcome their financial woes. But, with 5G on its way, sensible policies could work in favour of the whole market

Indian telecom companies have decided to raise tariffs after a particularly challenging phase of flux that saw disruptive technological change, intense competition, and bitter disputes over policy compliance. A glaring sign of the funk that much of this sector finds itself in was the eye-popping losses posted by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea for the last quarter, with little clarity on how they will pay their accumulated dues to the Union exchequer—yes, the large sums arrived at by a widened definition of the “revenues"" that telecom operators must share with the government. 
The concerted price response by Airtel and Vodafone Idea may be a bid to stay afloat, but it is also the kind of market behaviour that regulators are wont to frown upon. Late on Tuesday, Reliance Jio also said it will raise tariffs. In a field of just three major players, the former two are arrayed on the wrong side of technology; Jio uses superior systems to offer calls and data at throwaway rates. Varying network technologies seem to have caused cost differentials that are likely to result in industry consolidation, and the government, as an assurer of market efficiency, will have to step in at some point. It’s clear that survival in telecom requires every operator to adapt to disruptive technology and policy settings without losing consumer orientation. It’s not easy.
So what are the lessons from the latest telecom crisis? First, the government must price spectrum sensibly. It needs to lower its reliance on the sale of radio frequencies to plug its fiscal gaps. These receipts filter through the industry to the consumer; if they don’t, they balloon as losses somewhere along the value chain, and investors get lumped with the tab. Second, don’t put a price on a permit. A licence comes with a set of obligations; a holder must provide services of acceptable quality to telecom subscribers, for example. Licence fees, however, provide no signals that could adjust demand and supply. That’s the job of airwaves, the main resource that operators depend on, and this can be done well so long as they are priced correctly through auctions. Finally, don’t thwart technology. Telecom companies are always keen on the efficiencies of modern advancements, and policymakers need to be alive to factors holding back their adoption.
The policy environment is vital as India begins preparations for adopting fifth generation (5G) cellular technology that can carry data at a tenth of the cost that current 4G networks do. Ericsson, a telecom equipment maker that has tested the technology in the country, estimates the business potential of 5G-enabled digitalization in India by 2026 at $27 billion, as the country adds every fourth new subscriber in the world. A government committee sees a $1 trillion economic impact of 5G by 2035 once stuff like Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and augmented reality gets going. Gigabit-speed networks that give rise to various new ways to use the internet could significantly alter the nature of telecom regulation; 5G architecture is radically different from existing networks, and would call for considerable investment by cellular operators as they go about setting up their grids. Airtel and Vodafone Idea have indicated that the price floor set by the government for 5G spectrum is beyond their reach. If they are forced to sell assets or take on fresh debt to pay the sums demanded by the government, their ability to join the upcoming auctions could diminish further. That would leave India’s telecom market in worse shape."
114,2019-11-19,Airtel,"The tax department has in past adjusted refunds against a company's other liabilities towards the governmentThe older telecom operators -- Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel -- are staring at massive financial outgo in unpaid statutory dues

NEW DELHI :
Vodafone Idea, India's third-largest telecom service provider, is seeking about  ₹7,000 crore in tax refunds for past years even as it faces fresh statutory dues liability - running into thousands of crore - that has put the income tax department in a bind, sources privy to the development said.
The tax department has in past adjusted refunds against a company's other liabilities towards the government. It had famously adjusted  ₹1,500 crore in tax refunds due to Cairn Energy plc of UK to part settle a retrospective tax demand of  ₹10,247 crore even though the matter was under arbitration.
Sources said Vodafone has to receive an aggregate of about  ₹1,000 crore from Mumbai unit of income tax department and another  ₹6,000 crore from its Delhi office for multiple assessment years dating back to 2004-05.
The company has got favourable rulings from High Courts and appellate tribunals in some and is now pressing the department to quickly refund the dues, they said.
The income tax department is, however, caught in a bind as Vodafone-Idea Ltd has to pay  ₹44,150 crore to the government in past statutory dues following the Supreme Court ruling that non-telecom revenues have to be included for calculating the payout towards license fee and spectrum usage charge.
Sources said the department is of the view that the refund should be adjusted against this demand as there have been some concerns raised in a section of media about the very existence of the company if it were asked to cough up the past statutory liabilities.
The department wants the Finance Ministry in consultation with the Telecom Ministry to decide on dealing with the refund.
Vodafone Idea declined to comment on an email sent to the company on the matter.
Vodafone Idea, last week, reported a consolidated loss of  ₹50,921 crore -- the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate -- for September quarter on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court's order in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case.
The Supreme Court ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea, to pay dues as demanded by the Department of Telecom. Vodafone Idea has said that its ability to continue business will depend on reliefs sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has (the company is in the process of filing a review petition on the AGR matter).
Both Vodafone India and Idea Cellular merged their telecom business to handle the tariff war in the sector, triggered by the new entrant Reliance Jio in 2016. The merged entity Vodafone Idea came into existence on August 31 last year as the biggest telecom operator in the country with 408 million mobile customers.
However, the financial woes for the company did not end and the company lost over 100 million mobile subscribers since merger due to the cut throat tariff war, and chasing higher revenue-yielding minimum recharges.
The company has been investing in building networks. However, low return from tariffs added to its financial worries.
The older telecom operators -- Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel -- are staring at massive financial outgo in unpaid statutory dues as Supreme Court has upheld government's way of calculating the telecom revenue, on which licence fee and spectrum charges are computed.
As per latest estimates by the telecom department, Bharti Airtel faces a liability of around  ₹62,187 crore (including share of Tata Group of companies and Telenor India), while Vodafone Idea may have to pay about  ₹54,184 crore. The remaining liability is with state-owned BSNL/MTNL and some of the shut/bankrupt telecom companies.
The Supreme Court has allowed three months to the affected telcos to cough up the amounts due to the DoT, and recently the telecom department shot-off notice to telcos to pay their revenue share dues within the timelines stipulated by the court. The department has given option to operators to clear all the dues on self-assessment basis."

New Delhi: Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s only profitable telecom company, unexpectedly said it will join rivals Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd in raising tariffs, indicating that a three-year-long price war that unleashed an unprecedented consolidation in the industry is nearing an end.
The Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Jio will “take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in the next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments,"" the company said on Tuesday.
If Reliance Jio indeed raises tariffs, it will provide much-needed relief for rivals Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, which have reported record losses in the September quarter. If the truce sustains, it will also mark the end of the bloodiest chapter in India’s telecom history that saw units of large Indian conglomerates as well as overseas telcos, including UAE’s Etisalat, Japan’s Docomo and Norway’s Telenor shutting shop or selling their India businesses.
“Much will depend on the quantum of price hikes but this is a welcome step given that the companies needed to boost their revenues,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm Com First India.
Separately, a spokesperson for Reliance Jio said the company will hike tariffs in compliance with any regulatory action that sets a price floor on services of telecom operators. He was referring to media reports that the government plans to introduce a floor price for telecom tariffs to prevent predatory pricing.
In a statement directed at its rivals who still operate 2G networks, Reliance Jio called upon the government and the regulator to mandate a ‘2G-mukt’ policy to achieve the objectives of Digital India. Reliance Jio is the only operator in the country to have a pan-India 4G network. ‘
Others operate a mix of 2G, 3G and 4G services.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea had on Monday said they would hike tariffs of their services from 1 December. The tariff hike will come after a decade-long period of hyper competition and adverse regulatory orders. The news of the tariff hike catapulted Bharti Airtel to the top of the gainers in the S&P BSE Sensex on Tuesday. The shares climbed 7.4% to close the session at  ₹439.25.
Similarly, Vodafone Idea’s market cap climbed by more than a third as its share rose 34.7% to  ₹6.02 on BSE.
“Ahead-of-the-event press releases, without specifics, on price increases is a first-of-its-kind development in the sector, if our memory serves us right,"" an earlier Mint story earlier cited analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities as saying in a note to its clients.
Jio’s surprise move adds an interesting twist in the saga that has only seen it setting the agenda for the industry right from the day of its launch in 2016.
Bundling of unlimited free voice services with very cheap data prices had then forced established rivals like Airtel and Vodafone Idea to match tariffs, leading to a deterioration in their finances.
A price hike had come to be an “unheard-of event"" in an industry that has seen unrelenting competition and had at one point more than a dozen operators in the country.
Dealing a severe blow to older telecom operators, the Supreme Court on 24 October directed them to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months.
Many of these companies have shut shop following the bruising price war unleashed by the deep-pocketed Reliance Jio.
The verdict upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) which included revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
“Nobody asked them to take the tariffs to ridiculously low levels. They must have realized this was unsustainable. It’s a good sign in the interest of the sectors as consumers need the companies to survive as much as the companies need the consumers,"" a senior official at Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said."

118,2019-11-19,Airtel,"Even if the three operators raise tariffs by only 10%, losses in the industry will reduce significantlyApart from better tariffs, telcos also need a breather on the debt front, and clarity on that as well

Mumbai: Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have added about $5.5 billion and $1.25 billion, respectively, to their market capitalization in the past three trading sessions alone.
Just last week, they reported record losses and it seemed like at least one of these companies was staring at the end. Evidently, things have gotten so bad for the industry that help from the government has become increasingly certain.
But it looks like telcos have been asked to help themselves before the government can. Before news of any relief package, Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and surprisingly, even Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, have announced that they will raise tariffs within the next few weeks.
For Reliance Jio, which has become the market leader thanks to aggressive, price-based competition, a truce over tariffs seems uncharacteristic.
Besides, being the only telco to report profits in recent quarters, it has suggested in the past that there is no pressing need for it to raise tariffs. “There are evidently bigger forces at play,"" said an analyst at a domestic institutional brokerage firm on condition of anonymity.
The transformation in the industry is striking. In the past, the incumbents and Reliance Jio have dragged each other to the Competition Commission of India, citing anticompetitive practices. Their latest decision to hike tariffs in tandem may raise anticompetition issues of a new order.
But given the dire straits the industry is in, and given the hole this was expected to cause in the government’s finances, anticompetition issues aren’t exactly at the top of anyone’s mind.
“After years of wealth destruction, the industry will now be headed in the right direction,"" said the analyst quoted above. “I would be surprised if the tariff hikes being talked about will be anything less than 20%,"" he added.
In Vodafone Idea’s case, this means that its Ebit (earnings before interest and tax) loss of  ₹2,962 crore in Q2 can reduce by about 64%, while for Bharti Airtel, instead of an Ebit loss of  ₹1,145 crore in its India mobile services division, there would be a profit of around  ₹750 crore instead. Quarterly revenues in both cases are around  ₹11,000 crore.
If tariffs and revenues increase by a much lower 10% even, losses would fall by 32% and 83%, respectively, for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s India mobile division.
It’s little wonder investors are so excited.
But if Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea gain so much by raising tariffs, why wait until December?
“It looks like the incumbents want greater clarity from the telecom regulator on the official view on pricing and about the extension of the interconnection usage charges regime, which works effectively as a floor on voice tariffs,"" says the analyst quoted above.
Besides, apart from better tariffs, telcos also need a breather on the debt front, and need clarity from the government on that front as well."

121,2019-11-19,Airtel,"Jio is waiting for the tariffs numbers announcement by Airtel and VodafoneJio has already started charging 6 paise a minute for making calls to any non-Jio number

NEW DELHI :
Faced with almost no choice and amidst reports of government moving to set a floor price for voice and data, two hardest-hit telcos - Airtel and Vodafone - on Monday announced their decision to raise tariffs from next month while their arch-rival Reliance Jio has so far not made up its mind and is watching the developments.
According to BSNL sources, the PSU will examine the situation and react.
PSU sources said it is taking stock of the evolving scenario and as both the telcos have not announced how much the increase in the tariffs will be, so the PSU will examine and then react on the proposed hike once these two announce the quantum.
After remaining free on voice calls for three years, Reliance Jio, from October, started charging 6 paise a minute for making calls to any non-Jio number after Trai floated a consultation paper on seeking deferral of the zero IUC regime citing non-symmetry traffic. Currently tariffs are under forbearance.
A questionnaire on tariff hike from their side sent to Jio had not been responded at the time of writing and Jio officials were also not responsive to the tariff hike query of IANS.
However, sources said Jio is waiting for the tariffs numbers announcement by the telcos duo and will react after that.
After tariffs remained subdued for the last three years since Jio's entry, finally Airtel and Vodafone announced plans to hike them after the Supreme Court asked them to follow DoT's AGR computation method on revenue sharing with the government. By that both are liable to pay about  ₹74,000 crore by January 24, 2020, though a panel of Secretaries to the Central government are looking at options of giving them some relief through cut in levies and moratoriums and a longer repayment period.
Vodafone Idea last week reported a consolidated loss of  ₹50,921 crore - highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate - for the second quarter ended September 30, on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court order in the adjusted gross revenue case. Airtel posted a record quarterly loss of  ₹23,045 crore.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Tuesday:
Bharti Airtel: The telecom operator said it will raise call charges starting December. This comes after the Supreme Court ordered telecom companies to pay massive dues and penalties to the government in the adjusted gross revenue case. The sector, which has seen more than a decade of only price cuts due to hyper competition, has been dealing with mounting debt amid shrinking revenue.
Tata Steel: The steel maker plans to axe about 3,000 jobs across its European operations to cut costs in the latest blow to the region’s industry. According to a statement, about two-thirds of the estimated reduction in staff would be office-based, or white collar positions. The company did not give a detailed breakdown of where the job losses would take place.
PSU Stocks: The Cabinet has given in-principle approval for strategic stake sale in 28 state-owned companies including Air India, Junior Finance Minister Anurag Singh Thakur said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The government has so far raised 173.64 billion rupees in the 2019-20 fiscal year ending March, against the target of 1.05 trillion rupees, Thakur added.
Vodafone Idea: The company will also raise call charges starting next month. Price cuts due to hyper competition, stretched balance sheets, eroding profitability and the spectre of going bust have forced the company to reverse the trend and effect a price hike. It did not specify the quantum of price hike. Last month, the Supreme Court judgement had penalised telecom operators for what the department of telecommunications maintained as under-reporting of revenues.
Yes Bank: The private lender said it has acquired 20.61% stake in Tulip Star Hotels over invocation of pledge of shares. The bank has been in news due to its plans to raise capital, for which it announced last month that it has received offers worth $3 billion from potential investors for fund raising. Separately, ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buying shares of the bank have also buoyed investor sentiment.
Zee Entertainment: Brickwork Ratings has downgraded the non-convertible preference share issuer to BWR AA+ from BWR AAA, with a credit watch negative implication due to deteriorating financial position of the group following increase in pledge of promoter holding. Shares of the media conglomerate have been under pressure due to concerns around the company’s ability to meet its financial obligations to lenders.
PNB: The state-owned bank said it has received board approval for the merger of Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India into Punjab National Bank. This merger is part of the government’s mega plan to consolidate weak and small PSU banks with healthy and bigger ones. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had made the announcement in August, with which India will have only 12 state-run banks.
SpiceJet: The low-cost carrier is in talks with Boeing Co to buy more 737 Max aircraft to feed its expansion plans, a deal that could mark a Dubai Airshow coup for the grounded narrow-body, according to a Bloomberg report. Chairman Ajay Singh said the carrier is looking at setting up a new hub in the Middle East and expand to eastern Europe. A global sales lull for the Max since March has allowed SpiceJet Ltd to acquire planes at a lower cost, Singh added.
OMCs: India’s oil imports from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) fell to 73% in October, its lowest monthly share since 2011, a Reuters report said, quoting tanker data from sources. Refiners in India imported fuel from the US and other suppliers. India usually imports about 80% of its fuel from OPEC members.
Wockhardt: The pharmaceutical company said it is looking at various options for sustainable growth of the company. Separately, Cipla Ltd clarified on the news of the company acquiring select business segment of Wockhardt Ltd, saying that it is exploring opportunities for growth and has nothing concrete at present."

NEW DELHI :
Following in the footsteps of Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, which will hike the mobile tariffs on 1 December, Reliance Jio too on Tuesday said it would hike tariffs in ‘next few weeks’. While this could mark the long-awaited beginning of price recovery for telecom companies, the extent of gains could be decided by the quantum of hike and government relief.
Is the hike sustainable?
According to equity research analysts at Jefferies Financial Group, “The tariff hikes are positive, in our view, and come five months ahead of our expectation. However, the move does not materially change our price targets, unless the hike is significantly above 20%. Our estimates currently factor in a 20% hike in early FY21.""
Besides tariff hike, government relief for the ailing telecom sector is also important. The sector has been reeling under stress due to intense competition, adverse regulatory and judicial orders.
The last nail in the coffin of the beleaguered industry was the 24 October SC judgement that imposed a penalty of at least Rs92,000 crore on the operators, many of whom have also since folded up. The verdict upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) which included revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income, marking the end of a 14-year-long legal battle.
A committee of secretaries under the cabinet secretary is considering demand of telecom companies for relief and will suggest ways to alleviate their financial stress and create a favourable investment climate.
“Despite the tariff hike, we think relief from the government on AGR dues and other measures remain important for the incumbents, especially for Vodafone Idea. We expect the government to put a moratorium on AGR and spectrum dues for the next two years, aiding cash flows. A reduction in license fee and an extension of Interconnection Usage Charges (IUC) is also likely,"" Jefferies added.
Should you buy?
The telecom stocks have rallied sharply in the last few days, and analysts expect the positive momentum to continue in the near-term. Vodafone Idea stock has more than doubled this month to  ₹7.07 from its 30-day low of  ₹2.61.
Goldman Sachs recommends ‘buy’ for shares of Bharti Airtel with a target price of  ₹415. Bharti Airtel has surged over 34% to  ₹437.25 from its 30-day low of 325.60 in the last month.
“Despite recent outperformance, we reiterate our buy rating on Bharti, as we believe a sustained tariff hike, market share gains and government relief will help business momentum. Given sector stress and government focus, we expect the tariff hike to be sustained for the next few months. We consider Vodafone Idea to be the biggest beneficiary, but overhang from the AGR case still puts a question on long-term recovery,"" say analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Mogran Stanley has raised the price target for Bharti Airtel to  ₹410 from  ₹360 per share."

NEW DELHI :
The Union cabinet on Wednesday gave beleaguered telecom operators Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd a breather by allowing them to defer payments for spectrum purchases by up to two years.
The move to defer payments for 2020-21 and 2021-22 will be a relief to these companies while helping Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as well. It follows the Supreme Court’s 24 October ruling that directed older telecom firms to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months.
“Department of Telecommunication will give an option to the Telecom Service Providers (TSPs) to defer payment of the spectrum auction instalments due for 2020-21 & 2021-22, either for one or both years. These deferred amounts bill be spread equally in the remaining instalments to be paid by TSPs. Interest as stipulated while auctioning of the concerned spectrum will however be charged so that NPV (net present value) is protected,"" the government said.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel suffered record losses in the September quarter, hit by the apex court’s ruling that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators. Bundling of unlimited free voice services with very cheap data prices by Reliance Jio had forced Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to match tariffs, leading to an erosion in earnings.
“The decision for deferring spectrum payment instalments for two years will be implemented within a fortnight. Amendment to the license shall be issued expeditiously with the approval of hon’ble minister of communications,"" the government statement added.
This also comes at a time when Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio are raising tariffs, indicating that a three-year-long price war that led to an unprecedented industry consolidation is nearing an end.
“Deferment of spectrum auction instalments will ease the cash outflow of the stressed TSPs and facilitate payment of statutory liabilities and interest on bank loans. Continued operation by TSPs will give a fillip to employment and economic growth. Improved financial health of TSPs will facilitate maintenance of quality of services to consumer,"" the statement said."

NEW DELHI :
The Department of Telecom (DoT) has suggested telcos to take steps to improve their ARPUs (average revenue per user), which essentially translates into tariff hike.
A 15-20 per cent gradual hike has been suggested to partly tide over the current AGR fallout scenario. Airtel and Vodafone Idea have to pay  ₹83,000 crore together for the AGR dues of 14 years.
The price per GB of data plummeted to  ₹11.78 at the end of 2018 from  ₹226 in 2015. Vodafone Idea's ARPU in the second quarter was  ₹107 and Airtel's  ₹128.
While the government has also taken credit many times for cheap data in the telecom sector, now under severe stress on account of AGR dues, huge debts and mounting losses, the telcos are looking to the government for relief in terms of cut in levies, increase in spectrum dues repayment period and moratorium.
The government is keen that they explore the channel of tariff hikes, which have not been raised since three years due to Jio's cheap data and free voice calls till October this year.
Though tariff hikes are commercial calls of the telcos and their own decisions, in wake of the AGR dues levies by the DoT and pending relief to the sector by the secretaries panel, the operators had been in regular touch with the DoT officials where it was conveyed to them that they instead of solely depending on the government relief, could to take steps to increase ARPUs, a source said. But that could happen if they look at tariff hike, the source added.
Officials said the DoT had just reminded the telcos that they should not be shy of taking some tough decisions themselves to spurce up their revenues. Tariff hike is one of them.

New Delhi: Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday.
Bharti Airtel: The Cabinet late on Wednesday allowed telecom firms to defer spectrum payment to the government by two years. The decision to delay payments for the years 2020-21 and 2021-22 will provide relief to debt-laden Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd that reported massive losses in the September quarter as they made provisions for dues and penalties following an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict in the adjusted gross revenue case.
BPCL: The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the privatisation of the state-owned fuel retailer. The government will sell its entire 53.29% stake in the company to a strategic buyer along with giving up management control, Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said. The sale will not include Numaligarh Refinery Ltd in Assam. The refinery will become a separate entity to be later hived off to another public-sector firm.
DHFL: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Wednesday superseded the board of the debt-ridden company and appointed former managing director and chief executive of Indian Overseas Bank R. Subramaniakumar as administrator in the board’s place, moving a step closer to referring the firm to National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings. Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd will be the first housing finance company to be resolved via NCLT.
Zee Entertainment: Promoter Subhash Chandra will sell 16.5% shareholding in the media conglomerate to financial investors. This is a part of the promoter’s efforts to raise funds and repay lenders to the company. Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd said part of this new stake sale, about 2.3%, will be sold to OFI Global China Fund, LLC and its affiliates. Shares have been under pressure due to concerns surrounding the stressed financial position of the company.
RIL: Reliance Industries Ltd-owned telecom operator Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd will benefit from the government’s decision to defer spectrum payments for 2020-21 and 2021-22. RIL is on its way to become a  ₹10-trillion entity in terms of market capitalisation, becoming the first Indian company to do so. On Tuesday, RIL announced that it will hike tariffs on mobile services within a few weeks after rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea made similar announcements on Monday.
Tata Motors: Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday assigned a B1 instrument rating to Tata Motors Ltd-owned Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC’s (JLR) new unsecured notes worth 500 million euros that are due for payment in 2024. Separately, the Indian auto major had reported a loss of  ₹217 crore for the September quarter, a massive improvement from  ₹1,049 a year ago crore due to JLR’s recovery in its largest market China.
IndiGo: The airline, owned and operated by InterGlobe Aviation Ltd, will have to replace 111 Pratt and Whitney (PW) engines within the next 72 days in their A320neo planes, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. The minister said IndiGo and GoAir, earlier this month, were asked by the regulator Directorate General of Civil Aviation to replace 196 and 76 PW engines, respectively, with midfield engines.
Union Bank: The state-owned bank reported a divergence of  ₹589 crore in its non-performing assets for the financial year ended March 2019. Divergence, the difference between a bank’s report and RBI’s assessment, in provisions stood at  ₹1,587.7 crore. After taking into account divergence in provisioning, the bank’s net loss widened to  ₹3,978 crore in 2018-19 from  ₹2,947 crore reported earlier. Separately, Central Bank of India and Yes Bank Ltd on Tuesday reported divergence in bad loans and provisioning.
Concor: The government has announced selling its 30.8% shareholding in Container Corporation of India Ltd to a strategic buyer along with handing over the management control. The decision was part of the Cabinet approvals given on Wednesday. The government currently holds 54.8% in the company. The Centre will also dilute its stake in Shipping Corporation of India Ltd.
Thomas Cook: The Indian company’s wholly-owned subsidiary Travel Corporation (India) Ltd completed the acquisition of 51% stake in BDC Digiphoto Imaging Solutions Pvt Ltd, according to a regulatory filing. Shares have been under pressure since the British travel and leisure firm Thomas Cook Group PLC declared bankruptcy in September, despite repeated clarifications by the Indian firm that the two are not related and share a name."

104,2019-11-21,Airtel,"Spectrum and licence fee constitute a significant part of telcos’ costsMoratorium on telcos’ spectrum instalments and tariff hikes will help improve cash flows

Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd tumbled 2-6% on Thursday despite the government giving telecom operators the option to defer payment of spectrum dues by two fiscal years. The fall is in contrast to the gains the stocks had made earlier this week when private operators including Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd announced plans to raise tariffs.
Deferment of spectrum payment dues will bring a reprieve for the troubled telcos. In the September quarter, licence fee and spectrum usage charges for Vodafone Idea was  ₹1,114 crore, amounting to 37% of its operating loss, or earnings before interest and taxes. For Bharti Airtel, licence fee, revenue share and spectrum charges amounted to  ₹1,325 crore, while operating loss was at  ₹1,144 crore.
Click here to view the enlarged image
The waiver, combined with the proposed tariff hikes, is sure to improve cash flows at the companies. Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd estimate the move will provide an annual cash flow relief of about  ₹12,000 crore for Vodafone Idea and  ₹8,300 crore for Bharti Airtel.
Much of this, though, seems to have been captured in the recent rally in share prices of these companies. Given the dire state of some telcos, the Street was expecting bigger relief measures. “The measures were slightly lower than expected. There was consideration of lowering interest rates, which has not been incorporated. We expect further relief measures from the government even with the price hike in December; Vodafone Idea will need support, especially around aggregate gross revenue (AGR) dues payment,"" the analysts said.
Importantly, analysts fear the financial situation of the troubled telcos may not see sustained improvement. The government will have to provide significant relief on the dues arising out of the recent Supreme Court verdict on spectrum and licence fee dues, or the way AGR is calculated. Worryingly, the government’s provisional estimates of AGR dues are substantially higher than the calculations of telecom companies. The government told the Parliament there was no proposal under consideration to waive penalties, implying no immediate relief.
While the Street expects relief measures on AGR, any delay or piecemeal measures will adversely impact the telcos’ ability to invest in network upgradation and prolong the indebtedness. This will adversely impact the narrative on recovery of the telcos. “To our understanding, the department of telecom can possibly decide to either waive off penalties and interest on penalties entirely, and/or allow for staggered payments. However, without any AGR payout relief, the ability of telcos to invest in networks will remain challenged and even raise concerns on the market structure,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
Considering the pain in the telecom sector, the relief over spectrum instalments was warranted. But it is clear that telcos need more to stop the bleeding, and for their stocks to see light again."
103,2019-11-22,Airtel,"The matter pertained to the DoT claiming that telecom companies had under reported their revenuesLevies in the telecom sector are based on a percentage of their adjusted gross revenues (AGR)

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea on Friday filed a petition with the Supreme Court (SC) to review its 24 October judgement that ordered telecom companies to pay over Rs92,000 crore to the department of telecommunications (DoT) in penalties in a 14-year-long case. The matter pertained to the DoT claiming that telecom companies had under reported their revenues.
Levies in the telecom sector are based on a percentage of their adjusted gross revenues (AGR). The DoT contended that the telecom companies’ AGR also included income from dividends and revenue from sale of handsets bundled with services, an argument that the companies had disputed.
The apex court had asked the companies to make the payments within three months of the judgement. The DoT had issued demand letters to these companies a little over a week ago.
The telecom sector has been reeling under stress due to the AGR norms and predatory pricing.
In a relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on 20 November approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments. Also, starting next month, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will raise prices of their services for the first time in more than a decade. Reliance Jio has also announced its intent to hike tariffs.
The moratorium on spectrum payments coupled with the upcoming price hike will help the ailing telcos only to some extent as AGR dues are substantial.
Analysts at Credit Suisse said, “While deferment of spectrum auction payment is in line with our expectations, no decision on license fees reduction is clearly negative. Besides, if Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel face challenges in paying the annual spectrum fee worth  ₹12,000 crore and  ₹6,000 crore respectively, it will be more challenging for them to pay AGR dues of  ₹53,000 crore and  ₹35,600 crore immediately.""
“The decision of the committee of secretaries on the AGR dues will be critical, as tariffs hikes alone may not be adequate to alleviate concerns on the telcos hefty payout requirements. To our understanding, DoT can possibly decide to either waive off penalties and interest on penalties entirely and/or allow for staggered payments. However, without any AGR payout relief, the ability of telcos to invest in networks will remain challenged and even raise concerns on the market structure,"" said brokerage firm SBICAP Securities."
102,2019-11-23,Airtel,"A three-judge bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra will decide if the review plea will be allowedThe matter pertained to the DoT’s claim that telecom companies had underreported their revenues, paying less levies to the government

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and two other companies on Friday filed a petition with the Supreme Court to review its 24 October judgement, ordering telecom companies to pay over  ₹92,000 crore in dues and interest to the department of telecommunications (DoT) in a 14-year-long case.
The matter pertained to the DoT’s claim that telecom companies had underreported their revenues, paying less levies to the government.
The two other companies which have filed a review petition are Tata Teleservices and Hughes Communications India. Tata Teleservices is currently undergoing a merger with Bharti Airtel, a process DoT opposes.
“It’s not a complete review of the judgement—Bharti has asked for review of the penalty, interest and the amount of interest on penalty,"" an official said, requesting anonymity. A Bharti Airtel spokesperson refused to comment on the matter as it is subjudice.
Levies in the telecom sector are based on a percentage of the adjusted gross revenues (AGR) of companies. The DoT contended that the telcos’ AGR should also include income from dividends and revenue from sale of handsets bundled with services, a view the companies disputed.
The apex court has asked the companies to make the payments within three months of the judgement. The DoT, in a 13 November letter, directed operators to conduct a self-assessment of dues in the wake of the SC verdict.
Bharti Airtel Ltd’s dues are around  ₹21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea Ltd will have to cough up  ₹28,309 crore. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s dues are just  ₹13 crore.
A three-judge bench, headed by Justice Arun Mishra, will decide if the review plea will be allowed. The bench also comprised S.A. Nazeer and M.R. Shah.
The telecom sector has been reeling under stress due to intense competition and adverse regulatory orders. The SC verdict dealt a hammer blow to the likes of Vodafone and Airtel, forcing Nick Read, the chief executive officer of Vodafone Plc., the joint venture partner in Vodafone India, to say: “If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical."" Bloomberg quoted him saying in London: “If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario—can’t get any clearer than that.""
The comments did not go down well with Indian authorities, forcing Read to eventually say that he had been misquoted. Read’s clarification notwithstanding, Vodafone has already written off the carrying value of its share in the loss-making Indian joint venture.
With fears of billions of rupees of new debt emerging in the troubled public sector banks, which are the major lenders to telecom companies, the government has now swung into action. The threat of the telecom sector becoming a monopoly or, at best, a duopoly, also hangs if the incumbent private operators are not offered a rescue plan.
In a relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on 20 November approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments. Also, starting next month, all the operators, including Vodafone, Airtel, Jio and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, will raise the prices of their services."

Mumbai: The network shutdown in Jammu and Kashmir impacted the subscriber base of telecom companies in the quarter ended September, owing to which Bharti Airtel lost up to 30 lakh customers, while Vodafone Idea too lost customers, according to a latest report by brokerage ICICI Securities.
Replying to questions over the situation in Jammu and Kashmir in the Rajya Sabha last week, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said that Internet services would resume in the newly reorganised union territory (UT) on the recommendations of the local administration.
""Bharti Airtel lost about 25-30 lakh customers due to network shutdown in Jammu and Kashmir, which would return on reported base post resumption of services there. On a like to like basis, the net sub addition was zero,"" the ICICI Securities report said.
On Vodafone Idea, the report said that it continued to lose subscribers with a net loss of 89 lakh customers during the quarter and resultant overall subscriber base at 32 crore.
""We note that this is the fifth consecutive quarter of subscriber base decline given the integration-led challenges and Jammu and Kashmir impact,"" the report said
Bharti Airtel's end of period (EoP) subscriber base, ICICI Securities said, was at 27.94 crore with reported net subscriber addition of 26 lakh subscribers quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) aided by the consolidation of 65 lakh Tata Teleservices Ltd (TTSL) subscribers in its reported subscriber base during the June-September quarter.

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd on Monday submitted bids for assets of bankrupt Reliance Communications Ltd and its two units, two people aware of the matter said.
Monday was the last day for submitting bids, 10 days after insolvency resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty of Deloitte India extended the previous deadline.
Airtel and Bharti Infratel, which had earlier bid together for RCom, are likely to have bid jointly again. That bid was withdrawn in protest against the deadline extension made on the request of Reliance Jio.
Spokespersons for Airtel and Reliance Jio declined to comment on the bids.
The Economic Times also named private equity (PE) investors I Squared Capital, Varde Partners and UV Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd as bidding, but this could not be confirmed.
“We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters,"" a Deloitte India spokesperson said in an email to Mint.
China Development Bank, Life Insurance Corp. of India, State Bank of India, Exim Bank of China and Bank of Baroda are among the 41 creditors to the beleaguered Anil Ambani group company.
According to information available on the company’s website, it owed financial creditors  ₹49,193.46 crore at the time of being taken to bankruptcy court in May last year.
The company’s subsidiaries are Reliance Telecom Ltd and Reliance Infratel Ltd. They owe financial creditors  ₹24,306.27 crore and  ₹12,687.65 crore, respectively. Reliance Communications thus owes debtors  ₹86,187.58 crore at a consolidated level. This is besides  ₹28,837 crore it owes to the department of telecommunications (DoT) in spectrum dues and other charges as well as the amounts it has to pay its operational creditors.
Reliance Communications’ assets include spectrum, towers, fibre, data centres and real estate housed under its subsidiaries Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel.
Reliance Jio, promoted by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh Ambani, had last year agreed to buy the assets of Reliance Communications that included its spectrum, 43,000 telecom towers and 178,000 route km of optic fibre. The deal failed to secure the requisite clearance from the DoT.
The resolution professional had on 13 November received bids from firms including the Airtel-Bharti Infratel combine and PE firm Varde Partners.
Anil Ambani had on 16 November, along with four other directors, resigned from the company. But the lenders rejected the resignations on Sunday, requesting Ambani and the other officials to cooperate in the ongoing insolvency resolution proceedings.
The company had pioneered CDMA services in the country when Mukesh Ambani ran it, before he handed it to younger brother Anil after the two brothers split family assets under a 2005 agreement. As its fortunes dwindled and cut-throat competition eroded margins in the sector, the company considered selling its assets, a process more than five years in the making. The entry of Reliance Jio in 2016, which came with free voice services bundled with ultra cheap data, sounded the death knell for the company.
The company, unable to bear the onslaught of Jio, shut its mobile voice operations in December 2017, then choosing to offer only data services.
Reliance Communications, once part of the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty index, is now reduced to a penny stock. It shot up 6.7% on Monday to close the session at 80 paise, spurred by reports of various firms showing interest in its assets."

Ratings on Bharti Airtel’s commercial paper were reaffirmed at 'A1+'Icra attributed the downgrade to the recognition of higher than anticipated provisions following the Supreme Court’s judgement on payment of dues

MUMBAI :
Rating agency Icra on Monday downgraded Bharti Airtel Ltd's long-term rating to ""AA-"" from “AA"", attributing the downgrade to the recognition of higher than anticipated provisions following the Supreme Court’s judgement on payment of dues for license fees on adjusted gross revenues (AGR) and spectrum usage charges in the latest quarterly results.
“Although the company has not tied up funds for the same, this liability, if materialises is expected to be funded through a bridge loan, which would result in deterioration in debt coverage metrics in near term,"" the rating agency said in a release
Icra said ratings continue to remain under watch with negative implications. Ratings on Bharti Airtel’s commercial paper were reaffirmed at “A1+"".
The downgrade follows Bharti Airtel’s September quarter results, with the company announcing massive losses for the quarter.
“Moreover, additional provisioning related to indemnities to be paid to certain investors of Airtel Africa is also a credit negative…However, Icra notes that the Government of India has appointed a Committee of Secretaries to examine the situation and come out with recommendations for the sector,"" the rating agency said.
On 24 October, the Supreme Court ordered telecom companies to pay over  ₹92,000 crore in dues and interest to the department of telecommunications (DoT) in a 14-year-long case. The matter pertained to the DoT’s claim that telecom companies had underreported their revenues, paying less levies to the government.
Bharti Airtel Ltd’s has dues around  ₹21,682 crore, while Vodafone Idea Ltd will have to cough up  ₹28,309 crore. Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s dues are just  ₹13 crore. The apex court has asked the companies to make the payments within three months of the judgement. The DoT, in a letter dated 13 November, directed operators to conduct a self-assessment of dues in the wake of the SC verdict.
The SC judgement came at a time when the telecom sector has been under stress due to intense competition and adverse regulatory orders.
On 20 November, in a bid to provide some relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments. Also, starting next month, all operators, including Vodafone, Airtel, Jio and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, will raise the prices of their services.
Last week, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and two other companies filed a petition with the Supreme Court to review its judgement.
“The outcome of these events is expected to resolve the rating watch,"" Icra said.
The additional liability comes at a time when the company was making attempts to deleverage its balance sheet which includes a rights issue, IPO in Airtel Africa and raising of funds through perpetual bonds of around Rs5,500 crore, it said. The debt on the books of the company has remained elevated as reflected by gross debt of  ₹1,365,79 as on 30 September, which has kept the debt coverage indicators under stress."

Bharti Airtel Ltd, VFSI Holdings Pte Ltd and UV Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd have submitted their resolution plans for Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom) that is undergoing insolvency proceedings.
The resolution plans were presented to the committee of creditors (CoC) of Reliance Communications in a meeting held on Monday, the Anil Ambani group company notified the stock exchanges.
Monday was also the last day for bid submission, 10 days after insolvency resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty of Deloitte India extended the previous deadline.
According to a Mint report, Airtel and its subsidiary Bharti Infratel Ltd, which had earlier bid together for assets of RCom, are likely to have bid jointly again. That bid was withdrawn in protest against the deadline extension made on the request of Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
“We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters,"" a Deloitte India spokesperson had said in an email to Mint.
China Development Bank, Life Insurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India (SBI), Exim Bank of China and Bank of Baroda are among the 41 creditors to the beleaguered company.
According to information available on the RCom’s website, the company owed financial creditors  ₹49,193.46 crore at the time of being taken to bankruptcy court in May last year.
The company has two subsidiaries — Reliance Telecom Ltd and Reliance Infratel Ltd. These two owe financial creditors  ₹24,306.27 crore and  ₹12,687.65 crore respectively.

91,2019-11-27,Airtel,"The floor price was among key issues flagged by the industry representatives at a meeting today to chalk out the regulatory agenda for 2020Any fresh move on floor prices does not make sense, given that operators have already announced plans to hike tariffs in coming days, experts said

NEW DELHI :
With large telecom operators planning a rate hike in coming days, Trai is unlikely to make an immediate intervention on tariff issues, including fixation of any floor price as of now, people familiar with the matter said
People aware of Trai's views on the issue said that making any fresh move on floor prices or intervention does not make sense at this point, given that operators have already announced plans to hike tariffs in coming days.
The sources told PTI that any move by Trai now may ""derail"" the process which has been initiated at the operators' end. The regulator considers intervention to be the ""last resort"".
As operators have already announced that they will increase tariffs, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will wait to see how the entire situation unfolds.
The floor price was among key issues flagged by the industry representatives at a crucial meeting held at Trai on Wednesday to chalk out the regulatory agenda for 2020. A section of the industry wanted a regulatory intervention by Trai on the tariff issue, the sources said.
According to industry sources, older operators attending the meeting told Trai that tariffs may require a ""regulatory intervention"" as the sector faces excessive competition which makes it difficult for players to raise prices of mobile services. Hence, they felt that a regulatory intervention will be desirable and that fixing floor price on tariffs by Trai would be a more effective mechanism.
However, they said, there is no decision in Trai on floor price as of now, and any call on the issue will be taken only at a later date. The regulator is in the process of finalising its agenda for 2020, and 6-7 issues are expected to be taken up in the coming year.
Issues that have been flagged by the industry for inclusion in Trai's 2020 agenda are tariff floor price, redefinition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) and infrastructure sharing, among others.
It is pertinent to mention here that telecom operators have announced plans to hike rates in the coming days, although they have not indicated just how much the tariffs will increase. On November 18, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced a hike in mobile phone call and data charges from December saying the increase was warranted for viability of their business.
The following day, billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio said it will increase mobile phone call and data charges in the next few weeks in compliance with rules.
Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators have to pay  ₹1.47 lakh crore in outstanding statutory dues following a Supreme Court order on October 24 that upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-core businesses in calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fees to the exchequer.
In the case of Bharti Airtel, the liabilities added up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (not including the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices). For Vodafone Idea, this number stands at a cumulative  ₹53,038 crore, including  ₹24,729 crore of SUC dues and  ₹28,309 crore in licence fee.
The government, last week, threw a  ₹42,000 crore lifeline to debt-laden telecom companies after it agreed not to take any payments for spectrum they use for the next two years. It has, however, expressed unwillingness to intervene in the Supreme Court-mandated statutory payments. It wants operators to make combined efforts to relieve the stress, including raising voice calls and data tariffs."
89,2019-11-28,Airtel,"Private equity-backed deals in India have risen to a record $16.8 billion so far this yearPrivate equity investments are expected to pick up in India as some companies look to sell shares to fund growth

Private equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC is looking to raise up to $1.5 billion for its first fund targeting deals in India, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, betting on a surge in investment opportunities in Asia's third-largest economy.
Warburg plans finish fundraising on its India-focussed fund, which will target industrial sectors such as financial, manufacturing and consumer, by the first half of next year, said one of the people.
Launches of India-focused private equity funds are rare, and big global buyout firms such as KKR & Co Inc, Bain Capital and Blackstone Group Inc typically invest in a country mainly from their regional funds.
Warburg declined to comment. The sources did not want to be identified as the firm's plans are not public yet.
Private equity investments are expected to pick up in India as some companies look to sell shares to fund growth, while some family-owned firms explore selling controlling stakes to pay off debt, bankers said.
Lower valuations, a rapidly growing middle class and reforms such as bankruptcy resolution rules are also enticing global private equity firms to invest in India.
Private equity-backed deals in India have risen to a record $16.8 billion so far this year, rising up from the previous high of $12.4 billion last year, according to data compiled by Refinitiv.
The news of Warburg's India fundraising plan comes as rival KKR is looking to raise a record $15 billion in 2020 for its latest Asia-focussed buyout fund, which will include India investments.
Warburg has not finalised the size or launch timing of the fund, which depend on market conditions, said one of the people.
Warburg has a 21-person investment team in Mumbai, according to its website. It was Indian telecom company Bharti Airtel's first marquee investor in the early 1990s and has recently invested in its digital TV and African arms.
The private equity firm also holds stakes in local insurer IndiaFirst, retail real estate platform Virgo Retail Ventures, and education financing provider Avanse Financial Services, according to its website.
In June, the US-based firm closed a $4.25 billion private equity fund focusing on Chinese and Southeast Asian investments after launching the exercise in January with a target to raise $3.5 billion.
That fund, China-Southeast Asia II, will focus on investing across consumer and services, healthcare, real estate, financial services, and technology, media and telecommunications, Warburg had said in June."

Mumbai: Indian stock markets are expected to consolidate further at current levels. Global shares ticked up on Friday, but hesitated to test an all-time peak as investors worried a new US law backing Hong Kong protests could derail Washington's and Beijing's efforts to end their trade war.
MSCI All Country world index, which tracks shares in 49 countries, was up 0.05% at 549.62, and would need to rise only 0.2% to reach all-time peak hit in January last year before the start of the US-China trade war.

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio has emerged as the highest bidder for mobile tower and optical fibre assets of Reliance Infratel by placing bids of around  ₹3,600 crore, according to banking sources privy to the development.
Bharti Airtel has placed a bid of around  ₹1,800 crore for the same, according to the sources.
""Reliance Infratel's tower and fibre is likely to go to Reliance Jio as its bid of  ₹3,600 crore is the highest and the company has committed to make the payment in 60 days. Bharti Airtel has placed a bid of  ₹1,800 crore for the same,"" a banking source said.
Another source privy to the development said the process of finalising the bids will take a minimum of one-two weeks as committee of creditors (CoC) will meet all the bidders and negotiate with them and then vote on it.
Bharti Airtel has also made conditional bid for spectrum of Reliance Communications (RCom).
The sources said the conditions placed by Bharti Airtel will make it difficult for the resolution professional (RP) to close the process by January 10 as directed by the National Company Law Tribunal.
Reliance Jio did not bid for RCom spectrum.
VFSI Holdings Pte Ltd and UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited have also submitted their bids for the assets of RCom.
RCom's secured debt is estimated to be around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claims of around  ₹49,000 crore in August.
Reliance Communications, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, has put all its assets for sale, which include spectrum holding of 122 MHz that the company before insolvency proceedings estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, tower business worth  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network worth  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.
According to an NCLT order, RP has to complete the process by January 10, 2020.
RCom in the past has tried to sell assets to various companies, including Reliance Jio, to clear debts but the deals did not crystallise. Reliance Jio cancelled the agreement to buy RCom assets as it did not want to bear the previous liabilities of the debt-ridden firm.
Later, the insolvency proceeding against RCom was started on a plea filed by Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson after the company failed to clear its dues.
RCom Chairman Anil Ambani had tendered his resignation after the company posted a consolidated loss of  ₹30,142 crore for July-September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
This was the second-highest loss posted by any Indian company till date.

MUMBAI :
Bharti Airtel Ltd has offered the highest upfront cash settlement among four bidders for Reliance Communications Ltd’s assets, which are currently under insolvency proceedings, said two people directly aware of the matter.
Bharti Airtel has offered about  ₹9,500 crore to acquire the assets that include spectrum, telecom towers, fibre, data centres and real estate, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Upfront cash is often a key factor that creditors evaluate while deciding on a winning bidder.
“The conditions put forth by Airtel in their bid could reduce the viability of their bid,"" one of the two people said, without elaborating. Mint could not immediately ascertain the nature of those conditions.
Reliance Jio, which had last year agreed to buy the assets of Reliance Communications, including its spectrum, did not bid for the spectrum and real estate assets this time.
“Reliance Jio Infocomm has offered  ₹3,600 crore as upfront cash payment, but has not placed a bid on RCom’s spectrum assets or the company’s real estate,"" the person cited earlier said. “The committee of creditors would like to sell all assets in a single transaction, and not separately.""
The person said New Delhi-based UV Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd has offered a bid of  ₹12,760 crore, which will be staggered over several years. This bid has a net present value of roughly  ₹9,000 crore. A fourth bidder, US-based private equity fund Varde Partners, is also offering staggered payments with little upfront cash for the assets on the block. The value of Varde’s offer could not be ascertained immediately.
Emailed queries to Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, UV Asset Reconstruction and insolvency resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty of Deloitte India, who is managing the sale process, remained unanswered. A spokesperson for Varde Partners declined to comment.
The last day for submitting bids was 25 November, which was an extension of 10 days from an earlier deadline.
Meanwhile, a Bharti Airtel spokesperson told The Economic Times that a conditional bid was submitted primarily for the spectrum, which is a precious asset.
“The bid conditions include that the overall consideration will primarily be by way of the deferred spectrum payables to the government being passed on to us on terms and schedules applicable to such deferred payments,’’ the spokesperson told the newspaper on 14 November.
“Thanks to the new structure of the telecom market, spectrum is not as scarce a resource as it was, say, 10 years ago,"" said Mahesh Uppal, telecom regulatory expert and director of Com First (India) Pvt. Ltd, explaining the different approaches by telecom operators. “This could explain Reliance Jio’s reluctance to take on RCom’s spectrum, especially when it comes encumbered. At the same time, Airtel might find some of RCom’s spectrum attractive, if the specific frequencies are of immediate commercial interest.""
In December, the department of telecommunications (DoT) did not approve a spectrum trading deal between Reliance Communications and Reliance Jio, as the proposed deal did not conform to the department’s spectrum trading guidelines. Jio had sought assurances from the government that it would not be held liable for past dues on RCom’s airwaves. The deal fell through as DoT did not accept the conditions. RCom owes DoT  ₹28,837 crore in past spectrum dues.
Reliance Jio had last year also agreed to acquire 43,000 telecom towers and 178,000 route kilometres of optic fibre network. The deal failed to secure the requisite clearance from lenders and DoT.
China Development Bank, Life Insurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India, Exim Bank of China and Bank of Baroda are among 41 creditors to the bankrupt telecom company.
According to information available on the company’s website, it owed financial creditors  ₹49,193.46 crore. RCom’s assets are housed under three companies—RCom, Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel. They owe financial creditors  ₹24,306.27 crore and  ₹12,687.65 crore, respectively. Reliance Communications thus owes debtors  ₹86,187.58 crore at a consolidated level. This is besides the  ₹28,837 crore it owes DoT in spectrum dues and other charges as well as the amounts it has to pay its operational creditors, Mint reported on Tuesday."

New Delhi: Industry bodies, CII and FICCI have closed ranks and written to the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to address the situation on the precarious financial position of telecom operators with a debt of  ₹7 lakh and to ensure there is robust competition for the vibrancy in the sector.
CII and FICCI Presidents have written similar letters to the Finance Minister arguing for robust competition, which is being seen as support for beleaguered operators, Airtel and Vodafone Idea.
They have also sought relief for the telecom sector arguing that it has an impact on several sectors and the economy as a whole. The chambers have also sought a meeting with Sitharaman to propose potential remedies for the sector.
""The recent developments on the adjusted gross revenues (AGR) dues of the telecom service providers, have triggered a great deal of concern not only to the seriously affected TSPs, but also mongst others who are part of the overall telecom ecosystem. The precarious financial health of key players in this sector and their massive financial burden (estimated to be  ₹7 lakh crore), threatens not only their individual existence but also the much-needed vibrancy in this sector of national importance,"" CII President Vikram Kirloskar wrote to the Finance Minister.
""In this context, CII urges the Government to consider addressing the situation in a manner which continues the robust competition in the industry and ensures further investments in infrastructure for new technologies,"" Kirloskar said.
Kirloskar said one of the important elements of vibrancy in any sector is the presence of multiple key players. In line with this, the Government has followed a policy of encouraging healthy competition in the telecom sector, with atleast 3-4 strong players, he added.
CII has prepared a detailed note which has been sent to the Finance Minister concerning the telecom sector. CII's argument is that telecom services are a ""raw material"" for the rest of the economy-on which acts as a productivity-enhancer, more so with new technologies driving rapid digitalization and increased digital penetration.
FICCI President Sandip Somany has also written to the Finance Minister on similar lines. ""FICCI has strongly urged the Government to take immediate steps for addressing the concerns of the sector.
FICCI has said the sector is saddled with a debt of  ₹7 lakh crore and has almost no appetite to invest in networks and future technologies.
""Adding further woes to the sector, the recent ruling on Adjusted Gross Revenues (AGR), dues of the TSPs will lead to an unfortunate and disastrous collapse of the already battered sector,"" Somany said.
FICCI President added that this ruling will have a cascading effect and will severely impact many other companies in multiple sectors such as Internet Service Providers (ISP), satellite communications providers, cable operators and even companies in power, steel and railways sector.
""FICCI is confident that a timely intervention and support will not only save the sector from the brink of collapse but ensure a healthy growth adding to the economic momentum of the country,"" Somany said.
India is the second largest telecom market in the world, with over a billion mobile subscribers. As per a BBC study, mobile data is the cheapest in India, among the 230 countries that the survey covered. The number of internet users in India is estimated to reach 821 million by 2021."
81,2019-12-01,Airtel,"The tariff hike by the three telecom operators is the first of its kind in more than a decade after years of competition ensured prices of calls and data services hit rock bottomVodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, reeling under debt, posted record losses in the September quarter

New Delhi: All three private telecom operators in the country, Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, said they will raise prices of their prepaid voice and data services, ending a protracted tariff war that dragged rates to the lowest in the world.
The increases in most plans announced by the three operators on Sunday evening are in the range of 15-47%. While the new tariffs for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be effective starting Tuesday, Reliance Jio’s revised tariffs will come into effect on 6 December.
The tariff hike by the three operators isthe first of its kind in more than a decade after years of competition ensured prices of calls and data services hit rock bottom.
The entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016 intensified the price war, triggering an industry-wide consolidation that left only three private telcos and caused record losses at Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd.
An adverse Supreme Court ruling and mounting losses prompted Vodafone Group Plc’s chief executive, Nick Read, to seek the Indian government’s intervention for saving the company’s local affiliate from heading towards bankruptcy.
Around a fortnight back, the three operators said they would raise prices, although it isn’t still clear whether the government nudged them to do so.
“Airtel’s new plans represent tariff increases in the range of a mere 50 paise per day to  ₹2.85 per day and offer generous data and calling benefits,"" the company said in a statement on Sunday.
Airtel has merged its popular  ₹169 and  ₹199 plans into a single  ₹248 pack. Their previous 28-day validity remains the same. The tariff hike for users of its  ₹169 pack comes to be 47%, although customers will now get 1.5GB of data per day, 50% more from what they were getting earlier and the same as what the  ₹199 plan user was enjoying.
Vodafone Idea also announced new plans for prepaid products and services with validity periods of 2 days, 28 days, 84 days and 365 days.
Reliance Jio said it will launch “all in one"" plans which, though 40% costlier, will offer 300% more benefits.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, already reeling under heavy debt, posted record losses in the September quarter because of the unfavourable Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter widened to  ₹50,922 crore from  ₹4,874 crore in the year earlier, as it set aside money to pay dues to the government. Rival Bharti Airtel swung to a  ₹23,045 crore loss in the quarter from a profit of  ₹118 crore in the year earlier.
On 24 October, the Supreme Court directed telcos to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, along with two others, have filed a plea in the Supreme Court to review the verdict.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is spectrum dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices, the companies that it acquired)."

Shares of telecom companies jumped in early deals on Monday as India’s major private operators—Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Reliance Jio Infocomm—are set to hike tariffs this week.
At 0926, shares of Bharti Airtel were up nearly 9% at  ₹480.80, while those of Vodafone Idea soared 17.3%. Reliance Industries Ltd—parent of Reliance Jio Infocomm--was nearly 4% higher at  ₹1609.50. The BSE telecom index surged 7.3% to 1,197.65 points.
Analysts at ICICI Securities are bullish on both Airtel, Vodafone Idea and have a ‘buy’ rating on the stocks.
“We have incorporated the just-announced tariff hikes in our model and increased our EBITDA estimate for Bharti by 23% and 24% for FY21E and FY22E respectively. Consequently, we increase our target price to Rs550 (from Rs450), but we cut our EBITDA multiple for India business to 9x FY22E (from 11x FY22E, as our earlier multiple had option value of tariff increase, or a 2-player market, which is now included in the model). We move Voda Idea’s rating from ‘under review’ to BUY with a target price of Rs8. We still see AGR liability resolution as key for VIL’s long-term value creation. Bharti Airtel remains our preferred pick,"" the brokerage said in a report.
On Sunday, Vodafone Idea Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd said they will raise prices of their prepaid voice and data services, ending a protracted tariff war that dragged rates to the lowest in the world. The increases in most plans announced by the three operators are in the range of 15-47%. While the new tariffs for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be effective starting Tuesday, Reliance Jio’s revised tariffs will come into effect on 6 December.
The tariff hike by the three operators is the first of its kind in more than a decade after years of competition ensured prices of calls and data services hit rock bottom.
“Telecom sector was reeling under multiple problems such as low tariffs, regulatory issues including AGR liability, cash burn, stretched balance sheet. We believe the just-announced tariff hikes of 15-40% were much required and will likely remedy most of the problems of the industry,"" said ICICI Securities.
With the latest tariff hike, the brokerage firm also expects the blended average revenue per user (ARPU) to increase by 21%.
“We have tried to work out the increase in blended ARPU for Bharti and Voda Idea based on their Q2FY20 numbers. However, since the companies don’t disclose the breakup, our entire working is based on our assumptions. Our working shows Bharti’s blended ARPU increasing by 21% to Rs156 from Rs128 and Voda Idea’s too by 21% to Rs131 from Rs107,"" ICICI Securities added.
According to brokerage firm Emkay Global, based on tariff hikes, sector revenues/EBITDA “will increase by  ₹530 billion/Rs420 billion given no major SIM consolidation. Risk can be on bottom-of-the-pyramid consumer spending behavior after the steep hikes.""
""We think, (tariff hike) would boost revenue growth. However, operators face large payouts after the adverse SC decision on the AGR matter and would need government support to mitigate the burden. We continue to like Bharti Airtel"", said BNP Paribas in a 25 November note.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel, already reeling under heavy debt, reported record losses in the September quarter because of an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of revenue on which it calculates levies on telecom operators. On 24 October, the Supreme Court directed telcos to pay at least  ₹92,000 crore in past dues to the government within three months. Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, along with two others, have filed a plea in the Supreme Court to review the verdict.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is spectrum dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices, the companies that it acquired).
In a relief to telecom companies, the Union Cabinet on 20 November approved a moratorium of two years for spectrum payments.
Jefferies India expect despite the price hike, additional government relief measures are important. The brokerage firm expect a moratorium on AGR dues for the next two years, aiding cash flows. A reduction in license fee (helps Bharti/VodaIdea's EBITDA by 5%/28%) and an extension of interconnect usage charges (IUC) are also likely."

Vodafone Idea on Sunday announced tariff hikes for its prepaid customers, which will be effective from 12 am, 3 December. The announcement comes after the telecom major posted a massive quarterly loss of  ₹50,921 crore amid an adverse Supreme Court ruling on adjusted gross revenue (AGR).
Apart from Vodafone Idea, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also announced new plans with tariff hikes. The surge in most of the plans provided by the three operators are in the range of 15-47%. While the new tariffs for Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel will be effective from 3 December for these two telecos, Reliance Jio’s revised plans will come into effect on 6 December.

Customers can avail their benefits by just selecting the plan best suited to their specific needs and continue to enjoy seamless connectivity across India,"" the company said in a statement.
According to the revised tariffs, the unlimited plans for Vodafone Idea prepaid customers will increase significantly regardless of which plans they opt for. The unlimited package comes in three validity schemes - 24 days, 84 days and 365 days validity.
Here is a break-up of the unlimited plans and their revised tariff:
To recall, Vodafone Idea has been providing various above mentioned unlimited packs at a lower rate than the current tariff hike announced by the telecom major. 
As shown for the 365 days validity section, the new plan will now be dearer for prepaid customers as it will cost  ₹1,499 instead of  ₹999 and will have data usage limit of 24 GB instead of 12 GB.
Similarly, the 2 GB data per day scheme for 28 days will now cost  ₹299 instead of  ₹229 for the same services. In the 84 days validity package, the new recharge will cost  ₹599 for 1.5 GB data per day and 100 SMS instead of  ₹458 for the same scheme. There is also a  ₹399 scheme that will provide 3 GB data and 100 SMS services for 28 days.
Apart from these,  ₹699 recharge for a validity of 84 days added to the prepaid recharge schemes that provides 2 GB data and 100 SMS. However, the  ₹569 scheme for 3GB data and 100 SMS per day, which was available for earlier, is not reflected in the revised unlimited packs shared by the company. 
All the other prepaid packages and their revised tariffs are mentioned in the screenshot shared above."
74,2019-12-02,Airtel,"Analysts termed the hike as ‘better than expected’ and painted a positive outlook on telecom sharesHikes in most of the plans across the three operators are in the range of 25-30%

Telecom shares, led by Bharti Airtel Ltd, were lapped up in Monday’s trade as investors cheered Sunday’s announcement by the country’s three private sector operators that they would hike pre-paid tariffs of their call and data packs. Airtel hit a 52-week high of  ₹485.75, gaining nearly 10% intra-day on BSE. It ended the day at  ₹458.55, higher by 3.7% from Friday’s close. The maximum tariff hike in Airtel’s case is pegged at 47%.
Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) closed 14% up at  ₹7.79 from its BSE close on Friday. Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) ended the session 2.3% higher, riding on a 40% tariff hike announced by its subsidiary Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
The Sensex ended the day up merely 0.02% at 40,802.17.
Airtel and Vodafone’s tariff hikes are effective Tuesday, while those of Reliance Jio come into force on Friday.
Analysts termed the increase by the operators as “better than expected"" and painted a positive outlook on telecom shares.
Hikes in most of the plans across the three operators are in the range of 25% to 30%, though in some cases, the increases are in excess of 40%. The operators have also tweaked their data offerings to make sure the price hikes don’t force customers to shift to a lower tariff pack (downtrading). The companies have also introduced the ‘fair usage’ concept in their plans. Freebies such as subscription of popular apps have also been added to more packs.
Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in a report on Monday, said it does not see any negative elasticity impact as all the operators will hike tariffs by the same magnitude.
“We expect more tariff hikes to follow and remain bullish. We consider Bharti and RIL as better telco names that benefit from tariff hikes and remain bullish. While VIL may show maximum upside, the overhang from the AGR issue does not make its risk-reward favourable,"" the research and investment banking powerhouse said in the report.
Goldman Sachs is bullish on telecom stocks but doesn’t foresee another hike by Airtel or Vodafone anytime soon. “We believe there could be some risk to subscriber additions for Bharti and VIL at the lower end (feature phones), given competition from JioPhone. On bundled plans for smartphones, Bharti and VIL are now at a 26-43% premium vs Jio’s plans, and if Jio were to fully close this gap, there could be a potential re-rating in telco stocks,"" Goldman Sachs said in a report.
Jefferies expects elasticity to reflect through SIM consolidation and downtrading. SIM consolidation could also lead to increased channel incentives by the operators, it said. Jefferies has a “hold"" on Airtel and “underperform"" on VIL shares.
Industry body Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) doesn’t foresee any impact on affordability as it believes consumers are already paying well in excess of the new tariffs with substantially less consumption of voice and data. “At a time when the nation is looking to improve its growth rate, we can see no better move to do, than to sustain and improve the financial health of the TSPs,"" a COAI release quoted its director general Rajan S. Mathews as saying.
Vodafone and Bharti, already reeling under heavy debt and a hit on profitability post the 2016 entry of Reliance Jio, were left with little choice after an adverse 24 October Supreme Court ruling that penalized the companies for what the department of telecommunications (DoT) has maintained was underreporting of revenues by them. The top court imposed a penalty of  ₹92,000 on the operators, many of whom have already folded. The operators were given three months to pay the dues.
The DoT has since asked the operators to work out the final numbers on their own and pay the dues. Bharti and Vodafone, along with two others, have filed a plea with the apex court bench to review its order. The tariff hike by the three operators is arguably the first of its kind in more than a decade after years of cutthroat competition ensured rock bottom prices of calls and data services. At 1.17 billion mobile users at the end of September, India is the world’s second-largest market by the number of subscribers with tariffs that are still the lowest in the world."
76,2019-12-03,Airtel,"The tariff increases will help Airtel’s India mobile business swing back into profit at pre-tax levelReliance Jio is expected to gain the most in terms of revenue accretion, market share gains

MUMBAI :
The tariff hikes announced by Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd over the weekend have been far higher than the Street’s estimates. So much so that it will help Airtel’s India mobile business swing back into profits at the pre-tax level, after several quarters of losses. In Vodafone Idea’s case, losses will reduce to a great extent. But given the fast pace of its market share losses, it would need to do much more to retain the gains from the tariff hike.
The biggest gainer, by far, is Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities estimate incremental quarterly revenues of  ₹2,400 crore and  ₹2,100 crore, respectively, for Airtel and Vodafone Idea as a result of tariff hikes. But in the case of Jio, which has said it will raise tariffs by 40% without giving details, JM’s analysts expect incremental quarterly revenues of as much as  ₹3,900 crore. Incremental revenues are compared to reported revenues in the September quarter, assuming no change in the respective subscriber base of the three firms.
These higher gains for Jio and the concerns around Vodafone Idea are reflected in the reaction on the Street as well. The market capitalization of Jio’s parent, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), rose by about  ₹22,650 crore on Monday, while that of Airtel and Vodafone Idea gained  ₹9,370 crore and  ₹2,730 crore, respectively.
The reason Jio gains more is that Airtel and Vodafone Idea have left post-paid tariffs untouched, presumably because tariffs in this segment are already far higher than prepaid tariffs. And the post-paid segment accounts for about 30% of revenues for these companies. Jio hardly has any post-paid subscribers on its network, which means a far higher proportion of its revenue base is impacted by the tariff hike.
What’s more, Jio has stated that it will provide its customers 300% higher benefits compared to its competition. This can potentially result in an increase in the pace of its market share gains. Jio’s revenue market share has risen from 13% in FY18 to 34.2% in the first six months of FY20, according to data collated by JM Financial. While Airtel has kept its share intact at around 30%, Vodafone Idea’s market share has fallen from 38.2% to 29.5%.
One of the main reasons for this is that Jio’s plans have offered a better price-value equation. In the past, when incumbents tried to offer tariff plans with a similar price-value equation as Jio, the latter had responded by cutting tariffs further, and stating that it will always provide customers plans that are 20% cheaper.
Even in the current rising tariffs scenario, Jio is likely to position its tariffs at far more attractive levels than competition to sustain the pace of its market share gains. Besides, the industry-wide truce on tariffs has included hikes in voice-only plans, a segment where Jio is currently almost absent. This may well give the RIL group company a better shot at gaining subscriber share with its JioPhone offering for feature-phone users. When Jio announces its new tariff plans later this week, there will be greater clarity on its strategy for the smartphone and feature phone segments.
The company that is at the biggest risk of losing subscribers remains Vodafone Idea, given its relatively weaker infrastructure. While the tariff hikes will certainly give the firm breathing space—for one, its rate of cash burn will reduce—it needs to do more to retain its subscriber base.
Vodafone Idea needs to consider a fund infusion to augment its network capabilities and provide effective competition. Of course, much also depends on the final outcome of the AGR (adjusted gross revenues)- related dispute with the government. While a reprieve will certainly help, Vodafone Idea’s future depends on many other things falling in place as well, and the company’s ability and willingness to make the most of this sudden reversal in fortunes for the telecom sector."

New Delhi: Even with an announced tariff hike of 40 per cent, Reliance Jio would be cheaper by 15-20 per cent than other incumbents, analyst firms said on Monday while still awaiting for details of the company's new plans.
Along with other telcom companies, even Jio has said it will raise rates by 40 per cent but has not formalised the changes. Jio said that it will be introducing an ""all in one"" plan from December 6 across multiple price points with unlimited voice and data, which will have 300 per cent more benefits than earlier.
""Similar to incumbents, we think only select packs (of Jio) will have 40 per cent increase but popular ones could have 25-30 per cent. We think the incremental 300 per cent benefit which Jio is talking about is by offering more data allowances. In our view that incrementally doesn't entice users much beyond 1.5 GB,"" Bank of America Merril Lynch said in a note.
""Even after these hikes, we believe Jio will continue to be 15-20 per cent cheaper than the incumbent operators. If Jio data allowances are not within ""fair usage policy"" control, then we see upside risks to our capex investments"", it said.
The report also said the tariff hikes announced by Vodafone Idea (VIL) and Bharti Airtel were better than expected, which will be effective from Tuesday. While very low and very high denomination tariffs were hiked by up to 41 per cent, the popular plans saw lesser tariff hikes of 25-30 per cent.
For VIL, the popular 1.5 GB/day, 84 day pack will cost 31 per cent more at  ₹599 versus  ₹458 (33 per cent hike for Bharti) and 25 per cdent hike for  ₹199 (will be now  ₹249), 1.5 GB/day pack. A 41 per cent increase comes on the annual plan of  ₹1,699 which will now cost now  ₹2,399.
On an average, the tariff hikes by Bharti and VIL are of similar magnitude.
Credit Suisse said after that Jio details its tariff, the premium of the Airtel and Vodafone hikes are likely to decline to 10-20 per cent for the more popular tariff plans.
""Jio has also announced its intention to participate in market repair. In addition to tariff hikes by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, Jio has also announced its intention to increase tariffs effective December 6. While the details of its new plans are awaited, the company quantified the hike to be up to 40 per cent for its 'All in one plans'"", Credit Suisse said.
""We note that post the announced tariff hikes, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea's plans are at a 20-60 per cent premium over Jio's October 2019 'All-in-plans'. We think after Jio's announced tariff hikes, the premium is likely to decline to 10-20 per cent for the more popular tariff plans"", it added.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have raised tariffs of their popular bundled prepaid plans by 25-41 per cent as well as the low-end plans by around 40 per cent.
""Jio has indicated hikes of a similar magnitude albeit with higher benefits; details awaited. We like the way the new pricing construct is designed - it encourages up-trading and discourages down-trading; this should help recreate parity in the industry. We await details from Jio to revise our models,"" Kotak said.

After Vodafone Idea announced tariff hikes on Sunday for its prepaid users, the telecom major has finally rolled out the new plans starting today midnight.
Apart from Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL), Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio also announced new plans with tariff hikes. The surge in most of the plans provided by the three operators are in the range of 15-47%. While Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have already rolled out the revised plans as previously mentioned by the telcos, Reliance Jio’s revised plans will come into effect on 6 December.
We bring you a break up of the major revised prepaid tariffs.
The significant rate hikes are reflected in the unlimited packs offered by the telecom company. Offering the plans in three schemes, mainly 24 days, 84 days and 365 days, the plans are listed as follows:
 ₹249 monthly plan - Unlimited Voice (FUP of 1000 mins for off-net calls), 1.5 GB/day of Data, 100 SMS/ day, 28 days validity
 ₹399 monthly plan: Unlimited voice (FUP of 1000 mins for off-net calls), 3 GB/day of Data, 100 SMS/ day, 28 days validity
 ₹379 three-month plan: Unlimited Voice (FUP of 3000 mins for off-net calls), 6 GB data, 1000 SMS, 84 days validity
 ₹599 three-month plan: Unlimited Voice (FUP of 3000 mins for off-net calls), 1.5 GB/day of Data, 100 SMS/day, 84 days validity. The same plan was offered by the telecom for  ₹458 earlier.
Apart from this, there is also a  ₹699 recharge for a validity of 84 days added to the prepaid recharge schemes that provides unlimited voice (FUP of 3000 mins for off-net calls), 2 GB data and 100 SMS
 ₹1,499 early plan: Unlimited Voice (FUP of 12000 mins for off-net calls), 24 GB data, 3600 SMS, 365 days validity. This plan has seen a significant rate hike of  ₹500. The same benefits were provided to the prepaid consumers for a much less price of  ₹999. However, the telecom major increased the data usage limit from 12 GB to 24 GB.
Apart from these major combo packs, the telecom major also has smaller talktime and data vouchers:
 ₹49 monthly plan: This plan will offer a  ₹38 talktime, 100 MB data, 2.5p/sec tariff, 28 days validity
 ₹79 monthly plan: This plan has a  ₹64 talktime, 200 MB data, 1p/sec tariff, 28 days validity.
Moreover, there is also a section for first recharges with the revised rates for monthly basis recharge:
 ₹97 plan:  ₹45 Talktime, 100 MB data, 1p/ sec tariff, 28 days validity
 ₹197 plan: Unlimited Voice (FUP of 1000 mins for off-net calls), 2 GB data, 300 SMS, 28 days validity

Note that the unlimited calls entail a cap on every recharge pack for off-net calls. Off net calls are essentially calls made from Vodafone Idea connection to other telecom connections. The company stated that off-net calls after the free usage in the plan, would be charged at 6p/min. However, Vodafone to Vodafone and Vodafone to Idea and vice versa are considered on-net and there is no charge on them, at all.

69,2019-12-03,Airtel,"This is the first hike over the past five years in the country's telecom sectorBharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea announced 15-50 per cent rise in 'unlimited' usage category prepaid plans

New Delhi: Increase in prepaid plan prices by telecom operators will help them raise revenues and the companies may soon hike prices for postpaid plans as well, according to sector analysts.
The analysts also said Reliance Jio's plans are expected to be cheaper as compared to its rivals even after 40 per cent hike in mobile call and internet charges announced by the company.
This is the first hike over the past five years in the country's telecom sector that is facing tariff war with voice calls becoming almost free in 2016 and steep 95 per cent fall in data prices to  ₹11.78 per GB at present from  ₹269 per GB in 2014.
They said the hike of up to 50 per cent in prepaid plan prices by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea (VIL) will help the operators increase their revenues.
""Over the next few days, we expect Bharti (Airtel) and VIL to announce tariff changes in their postpaid plans as well,"" Emkay Global said in its report.
Bharti Airtel and VIL announced 15-50 per cent rise in 'unlimited' usage category prepaid plans. The new plans will come into effect from December 3 and existing customers under these plans will have to pay the new rates after they complete six months in their existing plan.
""Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea have announced tariff hike of sub-25 per cent for  ₹349 and below plans, where about 60 per cent of subscribers reside. We believe average impact on ARPU (average revenue per user) would be 25-30 per cent due to tariff hike,"" Axis Capital said.
Kotak Institutional Equities said the hike in mobile rates is likely to enhance Bharti Airtel's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation in the range of  ₹8,000-9,500 crore and VIL about  ₹7,000-8,500 crore.
Goldman Sachs estimates VIL's revenues could be about 22 per cent higher, assuming a subsequent hike even for postpaid, compared to  ₹11,146 crore that company reported in the second quarter of current financial year.
""For Bharti Airtel, assuming the announced tariff details, revenues could potentially be 24/12 per cent higher for wireless/consolidated,"" Goldman Sachs said.
Bank of America Merrill-Lynch said Jio may raise prices by 40 per cent only on the select packs but still it may continue to be cheaper than its competitors.
""We think the incremental 300 per cent benefit which Jio is talking about is by offering more data allowances. In our view, it incrementally doesn't entice users much beyond 1.5 GB. Even after these hikes, we believe Jio will continue to be 15-20 per cent cheaper than the incumbent operators,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch said.
Emkay Global said content offering of telecom operators will play important role in retention of subscribers if data consumption pattern is not impacted by tariff hikes.
From December 3, customers of these two companies will have to shell out a minimum of  ₹49 to make calls, access the internet on mobile and stay connected for four weeks.
Telecom companies' move to raise mobile tariff follows the Supreme Court judgment, on October 24 this year, upholding the government's method of calculating revenue share that it should get from earnings of service providers.
Vodafone Idea last month reported a consolidated loss of  ₹50,921 crore -- the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate -- for the September quarter on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court's order.
The company has estimated liability of  ₹44,150 crore post the apex court order, and made provisioning of  ₹25,680 crore in the second quarter this fiscal.
Vodafone Idea which is reeling under massive debt of around  ₹1.17 lakh crore had earlier cited acute financial stress on the company behind the decision to raise mobile call and data charges.
Bharti Airtel has posted a staggering  ₹23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of  ₹28,450 crore in the aftermath of the SC ruling on statutory dues.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).
The government is currently not considering any proposal on waiver of penalties and interest on outstanding licence fee based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), or on extending the timelines for telecom companies to pay up their statutory dues.
Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said adjusted gross revenue dues on Bharti Airtel are credit negative for the telecom operator despite a two-year moratorium given by the government on spectrum payment and the firm's plan to raise mobile call and data charges.
The credit rating agency said that in case Bharti Airtel is required to make a payment of  ₹34,260 crore immediately and in full, the debt level of the company will rise 25 per cent if the company raises entire money to make payment through debt instruments."

65,2019-12-04,Airtel,"Telco will use funds to pay estimated dues of  ₹35,586 cr to DoTBharti Airtel will raise $2 bn through one or more instruments such as a QIP, ADR and GDR

NEW DELHI :
Directors of Bharti Airtel Ltd on Wednesday approved the telecom operator’s proposal to raise up to $3 billion (around  ₹21,500 crore) through a mix of equity and debt. The funds will be utilized to pay the company’s estimated dues of  ₹35,586 crore to the department of telecommunications (DoT).
The company will raise $2 billion through one or more instruments such as a qualified institutional placement, compulsory convertible debentures or other convertible securities, American depositary receipts (ADR) and global depositary receipts (GDR), according to a regulatory filing.
Bharti Airtel also plans to raise up to $1 billion by issuing foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), and similar security in a foreign currency, or through redeemable non-convertible debentures, it said.
Bharti Airtel informed the exchanges that, for now, the total quantum of funds to be raised would not exceed $3 billion.
The massive fundraising plan follows the 24 October order of the Supreme Court (SC) in the 14-year-long dispute over the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) between the DoT and telecom firms. The SC asked the firms to pay the dues within three months.
The DoT argued that telecom companies’ AGR included income from the sale of handsets bundled with services, dividends from subsidiaries, besides other income. The DoT contended that the firms had underreported their revenue and, hence, paid lower taxes and levies.
According to a PTI report, Bharti Airtel owes  ₹21,682 crore in licence fee dues and another  ₹13,904.01 crore as spectrum usage charges. This, however, does not include the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices, which were acquired by Airtel.
On 3 December, the company increased the charges of its prepaid voice and data services by up to 47%. Two other private operators, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have also raised charges by up to 40-42%. Vodafone’s new tariffs came into effect on Tuesday, while Reliance Jio’s revised charges will be applicable from 6 December.
The tariff hike by the three operators is the first of its kind in more than a decade, with years of competition ensuring that prices of calls and data services stay low.
Airtel, which took a hit on profitability since the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016, has been reeling under heavy debt, but was left with little choice after the SC ruling.
The company posted a massive  ₹23,045 crore loss in the quarter ended September due to provisions made towards unpaid dues to the government. It had posted a net profit of  ₹118 crore in the year-ago period.
While Airtel and Vodafone Idea have filed a petition in the Supreme court seeking review of the 24 October order, the government is meanwhile not considering a waiver of penalties and interest on outstanding licence fee dues based on AGR, or an extension of the payment deadline."

Mumbai: Mint brings you your dose of the top deals news, reported from newsrooms across the country.
Airtel gets board nod to raise up to $3 billion
Directors of Bharti Airtel Ltd have approved the telecom operator’s proposal to raise up to $3 billion (around  ₹21,500 crore) through a mix of equity and debt. The funds will be utilized to pay the company’s estimated dues of  ₹35,586 crore to the department of telecommunications (DoT). The company will raise $2 billion through one or more instruments such as a qualified institutional placement, compulsory convertible debentures or other convertible securities, American depositary receipts (ADR) and global depositary receipts (GDR), according to a regulatory filing. Bharti Airtel also plans to raise up to $1 billion by issuing foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), and similar security in a foreign currency, or through redeemable non-convertible debentures, it said. Bharti Airtel informed the exchanges that, for now, the total quantum of funds to be raised would not exceed $3 billion. The massive fundraising plan follows the 24 October order of the Supreme Court (SC) in the 14-year-long dispute over the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) between the DoT and telecom firms. The SC asked the firms to pay the dues within three months. According to a PTI report, Bharti Airtel owes  ₹21,682 crore in licence fee dues and another  ₹13,904.01 crore as spectrum usage charges. This, however, does not include the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices, which were acquired by Airtel. On 3 December, the company increased the charges of its prepaid voice and data services by up to 47%. Two other private operators, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd have also raised charges by up to 40-42%. Vodafone’s new tariffs came into effect on Tuesday, while Reliance Jio’s revised charges will be applicable from 6 December. The tariff hike by the three operators is the first of its kind in more than a decade, with years of competition ensuring that prices of calls and data services stay low.
Manipal, BRS Ventures in fray for Columbia Asia’s India hospitals
Ranjan Pai’s Manipal Hospitals and billionaire B.R. Shetty-owned BRS Ventures Investment Ltd are front-runners in the race for Columbia Asia Hospitals in India, Mint reported citing three people aware of the development. Seattle-based Columbia Pacific Management manages international healthcare businesses of Columbia Asia, a private healthcare company owned by a US-based investment fund, International Columbia USA Llc. Columbia Pacific, which had 17 hospitals in South-East Asia (12 in Malaysia, three in Indonesia and two hospitals and a clinic in Vietnam), now only operates 11 hospitals in India. The valuation of Columbia’s India hospitals is expected to be in the range of  ₹1,800-2,000 crore; however, more details are likely to emerge after binding bids are submitted. The transaction is likely to close by March 2020. The sale of its India hospitals follows the sale, in September, of Columbia Pacific’s South-East Asian operations to Malaysian conglomerate Hong Leong Group and TPG Capital, for an estimated $1.2 billion. Earlier, Columbia Asia wanted to sell its India and South-East Asian hospitals in a combined deal, but it did not attract enough interest, and hence it decided to run separate sale processes for them. Besides Manipal and BRS, private equity (PE) firm General Atlantic-backed Krishna Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS Hospitals) and Radiant Life Care Pvt. Ltd, backed by PE firm KKR and Co. have also shown interest in the asset. The process of due diligence is going on and binding bids are expected to be submitted by the end of this week. Morgan Stanley is acting as the exclusive financial advisor for the deal.
CPPIB’s Mark Machin stresses on sanctity of contracts
Sanctity of contracts, regulations and taxation is an important issue for investors around the world, said Mark Machin, president and chief executive officer at Canada’s largest pension fund manager, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB). To a query from Mint about foreign investor concerns on recent developments, such as in Andhra Pradesh and more recently in Maharashtra, which have seen newly elected governments review contracts signed by their predecessors, Machin said while governments have the right to review these agreements, it only creates more risks for investors. “Generally, the sanctity of contracts is an important issue around the world. It is a challenge around the world, when you have a change of government. Obviously, governments have the right to review lots of things when they come in, whether it’s at provincial, city or at the national level, but obviously, the more changes you make, the more risk you create and the more risk we have to price in the investments,"" Machin said at a media roundtable in Mumbai. While the recently elected government of Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy in Andhra Pradesh wanted to rework power purchase agreements signed by the previous government for wind and solar power, the newly-elected Shiv-Sena led Maharashtra government has said that it will review projects worth around  ₹7 trillion awarded by the previous government, which includes a refinery and petrochemicals project and the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. “When we go into an investment, especially infrastructure investments, having the certainty of the regulatory regime, certainty of taxation and certainty of contracts over a long period of time is important,"" said Machin. “Our job is to figure out what the risks are and to ensure that we are being sufficiently compensated for those risks. The higher the risk, the lower the valuation that is acceptable,"" he added.
Ujjivan SFB’s public offer subscribed 170 times on final day
The initial public offering (IPO) of Ujjivan Small Finance Bank Ltd was subscribed as many as 170 times on the final day of the share sale, making it one of the most subscribed IPOs in the last few years in India’s primary market. As of 5 pm, the small finance bank’s (SFB) share sale was subscribed 169.98 times, according to data from the stock exchanges. The portion of the share sale reserved for institutional investors was subscribed 113.8 times, while that reserved for high net-worth individuals and retail investors was subscribed 486.14 and 49.5 times, respectively.

The robust response to recent public offerings underscores a pent-up demand for new paper in a primary market that has seen just a handful of IPOs this year, as compared to the last two years. The  ₹750 crore IPO of Ujjivan SFB opened for subscription on 2 December. The lender had set a price band of  ₹36-37 for the share sale.

His cousin brother Kailash Jhaveri holds the remaining 45 percent stake and is set to make a partial exit by selling 21 percent stake. Badshah Masala is one of the oldest spice brands in the country and has a massive network of points of sales. General Atlantic wants Capital Foods to expand aggressively into newer, additional segments of food ingredients. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the value of the proposed transaction. Jhaveri Industries had revenues of around  ₹350-400 crores for FY19, as per reports. It sells 48 varieties of blended spices and ground spices ranging from red chilli powder to curry masala and has a manufacturing unit at Umbergaon, Gujarat. Exports to countries like USA, United Arab Emirates, Tanzania and Singapore account for a third of the firm's sales."

63,2019-12-05,Airtel,"Asian stocks edged higher in early deals today following signs on the US and China trade dealShares of rate sensitives like auto and bank stocks will be in focus on interest rates decision by RBI

Mumbai: Indian stock markets on Thursday will await the Reserve Bank of India’s monetary policy decision for definitive cues. Asian stocks edged higher in early deals today following signs that the United States and China were on track for a preliminary trade deal, though optimism was tempered by the almost daily shifts in prospects for defusing the damaging tariff war now in its second year.
The fluid situation around the Sino-US trade negotiations has cast a pall on financial markets heading into Christmas, with major economies grappling under the weight of weak exports, investments and corporate profits. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods in a 17-month long dispute over trade practices that Washington says are unfair. Beijing has responded in kind with its own tariffs on the US goods. If both sides cannot reach an agreement soon, the next important date to watch is 15 December, when Washington is scheduled to impose even more tariffs on Chinese goods.
Some investors are betting that US President Donald Trump will delay the additional tariffs on Chinese imports as long as he gets close enough to a compromise because the hike in duties would hurt US consumers during the crucial year-end shopping season. However, Trump has repeatedly sent mixed messages about the status of negotiations, sparking fits of optimism and despair in financial markets.
Market was quick to latch on to a Bloomberg report on Wednesday that Washington and Beijing are closer to agreeing how many tariffs would be rolled back in a ""phase one"" trade deal.
Trump later said negotiations with China are going ""very well,"" providing a boost to riskier assets and denting safe havens like the Japanese yen.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3%. Australian shares were up 0.9%, while Japan's Nikkei stock index rose 0.81%.
Trump's comments marked a reversal from Tuesday when he roiled global markets by saying a trade deal may not come until after the 2020 US presidential election.
The US stock futures were down 0.03% on Thursday in Asia after the S&P 500 gained 0.63% on Wednesday.
Traders are also bracing for the closely-watched US non-farm payrolls report due Friday to determine how well the US economy is holding up amid a global slowdown.
Back home, shares of rate sensitives like auto and bank stocks will be in focus on interest rates decision by the central bank.
Directors of Bharti Airtel Ltd on Wednesday approved the telecom operator’s proposal to raise up to $3 billion (around  ₹21,500 crore) through a mix of equity and debt. The funds will be utilized to pay the company’s estimated dues of  ₹35,586 crore to the department of telecommunications (DoT).
Among currencies, the yen traded at 108.81 per dollar, ceding some of the previous day's gains as positive signs about the trade dispute hurt demand for safe-haven currencies.
The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell slightly to 1.7723% in Asia, retracing some of the gains it made in the previous session.
US crude edged 0.03% lower to $58.41 a barrel on Thursday as a 3% rally overnight showed signs of fading. However, prices could be supported if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and allies including Russia, approve deeper crude output cuts when they meet in Vienna on Thursday and Friday.

Mumbai: Brokerage firm CLSA on Thursday said that the new tariffs announced by Reliance Jio are 7-20% lower than the new rates offered by its competitors.

""Despite this hike, Jio is at a 7-20% discount to its competition, maintaining its strong relative positioning. We see a good chance of further upside to Jio's profit as the tariff hike on the JioPhone is still awaited, interconnect costs may fall below our forecast and ARPU may be higher as customers may prefer 28-day over 84-day plans,"" it said.

Some of the excitement about the tariff hikes announced by telcos this week is wearing off. After Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd announced its new tariffs, shares of Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd have given up more than two-thirds of their gains for the week. Jio’s revised tariffs are at a meaningful discount to those announced by Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel. Earlier in the week, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel’s combined market capitalization surged by  ₹12,300 crore after they raised tariffs by up to 50%. After Jio’s tariff hikes, the gains for the week have fallen to around  ₹3,800 crore.
Jio’s unlimited plans in the one-month category are priced about 16-20% lower than its rivals, and about 7-14% lower in the three-month category. This means the company’s fast pace of market share gains can be expected to continue. “Jio has priced its base plan 20% cheaper than the comparable plans of both the companies. The quantum of the hike is lower for base packs and shorter duration packs, underscoring Jio’s continued aggression to continue garnering subscriber market share,"" say analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a note to clients.
To minimize the damage, incumbents would be forced to offer discounts to some customers on a selective basis, says an analyst at an institutional brokerage, requesting anonymity. As such, the increase in their revenue could be lower than what was anticipated when they announced the massive tariff hikes.
Some analysts are also beginning to worry about the possibility of downtrading among some customers. The price of monthly packs were raised the least, likely reflecting wallet-size constraints at this price point, analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. “India mobile ARPU (average revenue per user) as a percentage of income is above the global average, indicating a limit to wallet size,"" they added.
Of course, things are still far better compared to where they were last month. The tariff hikes are expected to result in profits for Bharti Airtel’s India mobile business, after several quarters of losses. But for Vodafone Idea, it remains a tough journey. Now that the much hoped-for tariff increases have come through, the company needs to quickly decide on additional measures it will take to defend market share and cut losses.
“Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base continues to remain vulnerable to Jio’s deep-discounting tactics in the base plan and will require further tariff hikes to neutralise its cash burn.

New Delhi: Telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal-led Bharti Airtel may consolidate its position at the expense of Vodafone Idea Ltd as it has better balance sheet strength to deal with the eventuality of having to pay past statutory dues in case the Supreme Court rejects their review petitions, brokerages said.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea have filed separate petitions in the Supreme Court seeking review of the October 24 order of the apex court that held them liable to pay statutory dues for past 14 years after including non-telecom revenue in their annual adjusted gross revenues (AGR). The dues totalling  ₹1.47 lakh crore for the industry are to be paid within three months of the order.
""The liabilities are large at $4.8 billion for Airtel and $5 billion for Vodafone Idea, and if the Supreme Court were to dismiss the review petition causing the entire liabilities to devolve, it would be a negative development for Airtel but even more serious for Vodafone Idea which may find it difficult to fund these liabilities before January 24, 2020,"" Morgan Stanley said in a report.
This, it said, ""could potentially lead to further market share consolidation in the industry thereby strengthening Airtel's positioning in the industry.""
The two firms have been lobbying together with the government for relief on payment of the statutory liabilities.
Bharti Airtel's board has already approved raising $3 billion through a combination of equity ($2 billion) and debt ($1 billion).
""In our view, this fundraise is primarily to take care of the worst-case outcome wherein the entire AGR dues become payable,"" it said. ""However, if part of the AGR liabilities were to be waived and/or were paid over a period of time, then the company could use the proceeds for repayment of existing debt. In either case, we see Airtel's balance sheet strength as a differentiating factor in the industry.""
Goldman Sachs said it hosted Mittal, founder and Chairman of Bharti Enterprises - the holding company of Bharti Airtel, on December 5.
""Mittal shared his thoughts on various aspects of the telecom business, including his outlook on industry structure and tariffs, the potential outcome of AGR liability, and his views on Bharti Airtel's balance sheet and the company's non-wireless subsidiaries, among other things,"" it said.
The meeting, it said, ""reinforces our constructive view on Bharti Airtel, with potential upside risk to estimates from higher-than-expected tariff hike and market share gains from Vodafone Idea,"" it added.
Bharti Airtel expects industry revenues to start growing again due to recent tariff hikes, and expects industry revenues to surpass $50 billion (timeline unspecified) as opposed $30 billion at present, per company.
""In the event of any market share re-allocation in the industry, Bharti Airtel believes it is well-positioned to capture 50 per cent or more of the incremental market share; per company, incremental revenues can come at a very high EBITDA margin,"" Goldman Sachs said.
The company saw a low possibility of a new player entering the India telecom market.
Morgan Stanley said the recent tariff hike announcements by all three operators is a step in the right direction towards self-repair.    ""While the transmission of these hikes into average revenue per user (ARPU) increases will take some time (as the new tariffs are applicable only on the next recharge and there is a possibility of downgrading to lower value packs), we believe FY21 ARPUs will nonetheless likely see substantial improvement,"" it said.
It saw a possible ARPU path towards  ₹180-200 over the next few years which is not insurmountable as per user earnings were at  ₹200 in FY15.
""Such large increases will be required for Vodafone Idea along with other government relief measures to bring down its leverage position to more sustainable levels,"" it said.
Before Reliance Jio entered the industry in 2016, Bharti's ARPU was around  ₹200 per month, and the company believes it can get to similar levels over the next few quarters, with levels of close to  ₹300/month over time, Goldman Sachs said.
""Return on capital in India telecom remains low, and per the company, ARPUs need to go up for this metric to improve; Bharti believes this is true even for competition. Bharti Airtel believes it can get to 35 per cent or more revenue market share over time, from about 32 per cent at present,"" it said.
According to the brokerage, Bharti Airtel believes that while its current debt levels are elevated, it remains under control.

New Delhi: Telecom operator Bharti Airtel has removed cap from free outgoing calls on other networks under its new plans for pre-paid customers that came into effect from 3 December.
The company had earlier capped outgoing calls to network of other telecom operator to 1,000 minutes in case of plans with 28 days validity, 3,000 in 84 days validity plans and 12,000 in 365 days validity plan. Beyond this limit, customers were required to pay 6 paisa per minute for outgoing calls.
""From tomorrow, enjoy unlimited calling to any network in India with all our unlimited plans. No conditions apply,"" Bharti Airtel said in a tweet on Friday.
The company on 1 December announced new plans under which call and data charges became dearer for its pre-paid customers by up to 50 per cent from 3 December.
The company had announced new plans in ""unlimited""category with 2 days, 28 days, 84 days, 365 days validity which on the back of the envelope calculations showed higher price of up to 50 per cent
Bharti Airtel increased its entry level unlimited plan with a year long validity by about 50 per cent to  ₹1,499, with 24 GB of data, in place of  ₹998 plan which comes with 12 GB data usage limit.
The price of 365-days validity plan in the same category with daily data usage limit of 1.5 GB per day now costs 41.2 per cent more at  ₹2,398.
The company also announced three new plans -  ₹219 with 28 days validity offering 1 GB per day,  ₹399 and  ₹449 plan with 56 days validity each, offering 1.5 Gb and 2 GB data usage, respectively.
With the removal of limit, Airtel's new  ₹399 plan with 56 days validity becomes cheaper than that of Reliance Jio plan at same price.
The move from both the companies follows Supreme Court judgement on adjusted gross revenue.
Bharti Airtel has posted a staggering  ₹23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of  ₹28,450 crore in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
According to government data, the liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices).
The government is currently not considering any proposal on waiver of penalties and interest on outstanding licence fee based on adjusted gross revenue (AGR), or on extending the timelines for telecom companies to pay up their statutory dues.

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Telecom, a promoter of Bharti Airtel, has sought government nod for the infusion of  ₹4,900 crore investment from Singapore-based Singtel and other foreign entities, a move that would make the country's oldest private telecom operator a foreign entity.The fund infusion will enhance foreign stakeholding in Bharti Telecom to over 50% that will make it a foreign-owned entity, an official source aware of the development told PTI. Sunil Bharti Mittal and his family own around 52% stake in Bharti Telecom, at present.
Bharti Telecom holds around 41% stake in Bharti Airtel while foreign promoter entities hold 21.46% stake in the telecom firm. Public shareholders have around 37% stake in the company.""Bharti Telecom has applied for infusion of  ₹4,900 crore in the company which includes investments from Singtel and some other foreign investors. With this Bharti Telecom will become a foreign entity as majority stake will be held by overseas investors. DoT is expected to approve this investment this month,"" the source said.
The Department of Telecom had earlier this year returned Bharti Airtel’s FDI application as the company had not provided clarity on the foreign investor.
Total foreign shareholding is 43% in Bharti Airtel, at present. With promoter firm Bharti Telecom becoming a foreign entity, foreign shareholding in the company will cross 84 per cent, the source said. Bharti Airtel has already been in discussion with Singtel and other entities for fund infusion.The company in August had informed stock exchanges that Bharti Telecom in order to retire some debt may seek equity from its existing promoter group which may include overseas entity and Singtel in proportionate to its holding.Bharti Airtel has said that even a marginal increase in foreign equity would take the foreign investment in Bharti Telecom above 50% making it a foreign owned entity.Bharti Airtel has already applied to raise FDI limit to 100%  in the company.Bharti Airtel board last week approved a proposal to raise $3 billion through QIP, stake sale and debt papers as the company owes AGR dues of  ₹43,000 crore to the government.

48,2019-12-09,Airtel,"Crisil said its analysis shows every Re 1 added to the Arpu adds about  ₹1,000 crore to the industry's operating profitThe average revenue per user, arguably the most widely tracked number by analysts, will go up by 25% following the price hikes

Mumbai: The steep tariff hikes, effected earlier this month by the battered telcos which held prices at rock bottom levels for nearly five years, can help more than double their operating profit to  ₹60,570 crore in FY21 from  ₹29,450 crore in FY19, says a report.
It is a ""structural positive"" for the sector which has been weighed down by weak cash flows and mounting debt levels, leading domestic ratings agency Crisil said on Monday, adding the hikes are a good opportunity for the industry to ""repair its financials and become sustainable"".
In the aftermath of the adjusted gross revenue order by the Supreme Court that favoured the government view, all the major telcos hiked subscriber tariffs by up to 40 percent, starting with the prepaid customers.
The Supreme Court order on the AGR puts a burden of  ₹1.47 lakh crore on the industry that has been bleeding for years and sitting on a debt pile of close to  ₹4 lakh crore.
""The crucial part now is pricing discipline and extent of down-trading from current plans to cheaper ones by subscribers. That will determine the kind of net gains that telcos will make in the near-term,"" said Sachin Gupta, a senior director at Crisil.
The industry's debt to operating profit ratio will come down to 4.6 times from the present 7.5 times, if the operating profit improvements indeed happen as expected, the agency said, adding the top three players presently owe  ₹3.3 lakh crore to the system.
The average revenue per user, arguably the most widely tracked number by analysts, will go up by 25 percent following the price hikes to  ₹145 next fiscal from  ₹116 earlier, the agency said.
It said 80 percent of the additional revenue will flow straight into the operating profit given the high operating leverage at which the companies operate.
The agency said its analysis shows every Re 1 added to the Arpu adds about  ₹1,000 crore to the industry's operating profit, and going by the same, the overall operating profit will double to  ₹60,570 crore in FY21 from  ₹29,450 crore in FY19.
The tariff hikes would accelerate SIM consolidation and curb subscriber additions, it added.
On the AGR, it said its base-case assumes a payout of  ₹50,000 crore in license fee arrears by the industry.
""Any additional liability will stretch their balance sheets and necessitate fresh equity infusion and support from sponsors to maintain credit profiles,"" another Crisil director Nitesh Jain said, adding he has not factored in the 5G spends.

NEW DELHI :
Leading telecom operator Bharti Airtel has announced new prepaid recharge plans with unlimited calling to any network in India. Airtel's earlier plans had limited number of free talktime minutes to non-Airtel numbers.
To offer unlimited calling across other networks as well, Airtel has launched three new unlimited plans --  ₹219,  ₹399 and  ₹449.
 ₹219 recharge plan:
It has a validity period of 28 days and offers 1 GB data per day. It also offers 100 SMS per day besides Free Hello Tunes, unlimited Wynk music and Airtel Xstream app as part of Airtel Thanks benefits.
 ₹399 plan:
This recharge plan has a validity period of 56 days and gives you 1.5 GB data per day. You also get 100 SMS per day and access to free Hello Tunes, Wynk music subscription and Airtel Xstream App premium.
 ₹449 plan:
This plan comes with 2GB data per day and is also valid for 56 days. You get 90 SMS per day besides Airtel Thanks benefits.

Plans with 28 days of validity had 1,000 minutes of talktime to other networks, 3,000 in 84 days validity plans and 12,000 in 365 days validity plan.

49,2019-12-09,Airtel,"The increase in tariffs was the highest for those using 1GB/day plans, because the new plans announced last week had done away with this categoryA week since, companies are having second thoughts, and concerns about demand elasticity have become a bit louder

When Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd raised tariffs by upto 50% in early December, analysts had said this can boost their revenues by about 23%. The increase in tariffs was the highest for those using 1GB/day plans, because the new plans announced last week had done away with this category. Upgrading to a 1.5GB/day pack meant a steep tariff increase of about 50%, although telcos seemed to have bet that customers will bite, given the higher data allowance.
A week since, companies are having second thoughts, and concerns about demand elasticity have become a bit louder. So the 1GB/day packs have been re-introduced at a price point that’s about 12% cheaper than the 1.5GB/day pack. “The lower price points are, in our view, a reflection of the wallet size constraints for consumers,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients. A large number of Indian customers use monthly packs, even though effective tariffs are cheaper for three-month plans, on account of wallet size constraints, the broker has pointed out in the past.
The monthly Arpu (average revenue per user) on these plans works out to Rs201.5, which is still far higher than the company-wide Apru for the two companies. But while the plans are, in that sense, Arpu-accretive, their introduction also means that the increase in telco revenues will be lower than what was anticipated last week.
It’s little wonder shares of Vodafone Idea have given up all the gains made in early December, while Bharti Airtel Ltd has given up most of its gains.
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd also launched a 1GB/day plan at an effective monthly Arpu of Rs159.9, which is at a 30% discount to peers. As pointed earlier in this column, Jio’s tariffs are far more attractive than competition, which positions it well in terms of gaining market share. In the 1.5GB/day category, Jio’s tariffs are at a 20% discount to peers."

Indian stock markets are expected to consolidate on Monday. Asian stocks edged up on Monday, catching some of Wall Street's momentum after surprisingly strong US jobs data, although regional gains were capped by concerns about China's economy due to the prolonged Sino-US trade war.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei advanced 0.3% ,while MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.3%. Australian stocks and South Korea's Kospi rose 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively.
The modest Asian gains compared with Wall Street, which rose to near record highs on Friday on a strong jobs report and some sign of optimism about US-China trade talks, with the benchmark S&P 500 closing within 0.2% of its peak set in late November.
US jobs grew the most in 10 months in November as the healthcare industry boosted hiring and production workers at General Motors returned to work after a strike, in the strongest sign that the economy is in no danger of stalling.
Meanwhile, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday that a 15 December deadline is still in place to impose a new round of US tariffs on Chinese consumer goods, but President Donald Trump likes where trade talks with China are going. Still, investors think things could change if trade tensions escalate further, especially if Trump goes ahead with planned tariffs on some $156 billion worth products from China from mid-December.
The market has been largely working on the assumption that those tariffs, which cover several consumer products such as cellphones and toys, will be dropped or at least postponed, given that Washington and Beijing agreed in October to work on a trade deal.
Meanwhile, China's exports shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November, underscoring persistent pressures on manufacturers from the prolonged trade war, although growth in imports may be a sign that Beijing's stimulus efforts are working.

Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, now wants a share of your diagnostics budget, in a move that can potentially shake up the sector similar to the disruption in telecom market after the entry of Reliance Jio.
Reliance Life Sciences or RLS, the biotechnology subsidiary of RIL, plans to start pathology labs across India through partnerships with local entrepreneurs, said two people aware of the development. RLS is controlled by the Ambani family, the promoter group of RIL.
“RLS is trying to build a network of pathology labs. To begin with, they plan to set up 20-30 labs,"" said the first person, who has received a partnership proposal from RLS. He said RLS is looking at a 15:85 ratio for revenue sharing, with RLS keeping 15%.
“Revenue sharing would be on net sales basis and the franchise would bear the cost of setting up the labs,"" the person said.
In an emailed response, a spokesperson for RIL said, “The information you have is speculative.""
The entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, an RIL subsidiary, in September 2016 caused a massive disruption in the mobile telecom market with low-cost tariff and data plans. This forced an industry-wide consolidation leaving only three private telcos, including Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd, the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea.
The RLS website says the company is developing business opportunities in bio-therapeutics (plasma proteins, biosimilars and novel proteins), pharmaceuticals (later-generation, oncology generics), clinical research services, regenerative medicine (stem cell therapies) and molecular medicine.
The company plans to follow a hub-and-spoke model for its pathology business, with a reference lab serving as a regional hub providing super-specialized tests. Supporting the reference lab would be a chain of network labs that would provide routine as well as specialised tests. And assisting the network labs would be collection centres and points which will collect tests and send them to reference and network labs for processing.
“RLS is selling it as a low investment-high return entrepreneurial joint venture. It has approached a number of players in the industry to partner with them to set up these labs,"" said the second person cited above.
The company would also collaborate with doctors, local collection centres, pathology labs and hospitals to bring in additional business.
RLS operates a state-of-the-art facility in the life sciences domain. Its flagship facility is the Dhirubhai Ambani Life Sciences Centre (DALC) in Navi Mumbai, Maharashtra.
“RLS is an integrated life sciences industry player with in-house capabilities in research, pre-clinical and clinical development, process development, quality management, commercial-scale manufacturing and marketing,"" according to its website.
RLS sees the pathology segment as a lucrative opportunity with health insurance coverage projected to grow, an increase in India’s ageing population and a prevalence of lifestyle disorders.
According to an Ernst & Young report of 2018 on health insurance, demand for high-quality medical care is rising in India, leading to growing private participation, thanks to a middle class estimated to grow at a CAGR of nearly 7% for the five years through 2021, and rising household prosperity.
RLS would provide human resource support to franchise partners in terms of hiring the right talent, training of franchisee lab staff, IT support and admin support. “To partner franchisees, RLS said it will provide three officials—one pathologist, one IT-cum-logistics official and one accounts-cum-materials staff. These would be on RLS rolls but the cost would be paid by the franchisee,"" said the first person."

NEW DELHI :
The Department of Telecom (DoT) has asked telecom licencees to speed up the process of self-assessment of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) based dues and the payment of over  ₹1.47 lakh crore and submit comprehensive representation on previous issued demands latest by December 13, 2019.
The letter issued by the DoT has been viewed by IANS. The deadline for payment of AGR dues is January 23, 2020.
Three telcos -- Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Tata Tele -- have filed review petition of the Supreme Court order in October, which paved the way for the DoT to seek AGR dues, penalty and interest from the telcos.
""The comprehensive representation shall be submitted within a week latest by December 13, 2019,"" DoT said in the letter to the telecom licensees, adding that majority of the licence fee assessments have been settled after the SC judgement and for any remaining issues, a comprehensive representation needs to be submitted to the department.
In light of the Supreme Court order on AGR computation, all the annual assessment for licence fees and spectrum usage charges for relevant years are being re-examined.
""And now since all the earlier demands are being re-examined with respect to the SC judgement, you are requested to kindly submit a comprehensive year-wise, circle-wise representation except for issues which have been decided by the SC,"" the letter said.
""In this regard, it is pointed out that over a course of time, multiple representations related to LF (licence fee) assessments were received from various licencees for consideration by the department,"" the DoT letter added.
Further, self-assessment of dues and payments along with the submission of relevant documents as per a licence finance wing letter of November 13 needs to be expedited, the letter said.
Any issues should be pointed out in the comprehensive representation to be submitted but in no case the self assessment of the dues and payments along with the submission of relevant documents are to be delayed, it pointed out.
The Supreme Court decided in favour of the government's contention that all revenues, including that from non-core sources, would be counted in calculating AGR. Licence holders have to pay about 8 per cent of AGR to the DoT as fees. Telcos also pay about 3-4 per cent of AGR as spectrum usage charges."

Bharti Airtel: The steep tariff hikes, effected by the troubled telcos earlier this month after five years of after rock bottom prices, can help more than double their operating profit to  ₹60,570 crore in fiscal 2021 from  ₹29,450 crore in 2018-19, according to a report by ratings agency Crisil. Telecom operators hiked tariffs after an unfavourable Supreme Court verdict in the adjusted gross revenue case.

The 60 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) refinery is a joint venture between Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (Adnoc), and three state-run oil marketers— Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd.
Airtel, Dish TV DTH divisions likely to merge soon
Bharti Airtel, promoters of Dish TV and private equity firm Warburg Pincus have agreed to merge direct-tohome operations of Airtel and Dish after months of negotiations, a move that will create the world’s largest TV distribution company, The Economic Times reported citing two people with direct knowledge of the development. The three parties have agreed on the structure of the deal, wherein the DTH business of Dish TV India will be hived off and merged in Bharti Telemedia, which houses Airtel Digital TV. The financial details of the deal or shareholding pattern after the merger were not disclosed, as the final scheme of arrangement and other details are being worked upon.. Warburg Pincus, which picked up 20% stake in Bharti Telemedia for $350 million in December 2017, is expected to remain invested in the company post merger. Bharti Telemedia will be subsequently listed on the stock exchanges. The Supreme Court had on October 24 ordered mobile operators to pay over  ₹92,000 crore to the telecom department in penalties in a 14-year-long case, putting pressure on the financials of Bharti Airtel that may have to pay more than  ₹21,000 crore. Dish TV India, a listed company, will continue to offer non-DTH services including Dish Infra Services (infra support business) and own 51% in C&S Medianet, its distribution consultancy joint venture with cable TV service provider Siti Networks. Company promoters own 55.27% stake in Dish TV. A merger may also ease off the pressure of ARPU on the DTH industry as there will only be two national players and one regional player. Together, Airtel Digital TV and Dish TV will create the world’s largest TV distribution company with just over 40 million subscribers and over 62% share of India’s DTH market. It will be followed by Tata Sky with about 25% market share and regional DTH player Sun Direct.
Voda Idea in talks with Brookfield and Edelweiss to sell some assets
Vodafone Idea is said to be in talks to sell its optic fibre business to Brookfield Asset Management and its data centre to the Edelweiss Group as the telco seeks to raise over $2.5 billion from asset sales ahead of a January deadline to pay statutory dues, The Economic Times reported citing a person privy to the discussions. The company is in talks with global asset manager Brookfield to sell its 156,000 km of optic fibre assets and Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are the bankers helping Vodafone negotiate with potential buyers.

The fibre network business is valued at $1.5 billion-$2 billion, while the data centre should fetch $60 million to $100 million. Vodafone Idea will have to pay over  ₹53,000 crore ($7.5 billion) after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) for telcos to include revenue from non-core activities. The telcos have sought a review of the October 24 order, which stated that the dues should be cleared within three months.
EaseMyTrip plans to raise  ₹700 crore from public issue
EaseMyTrip is planning a  ₹700 crore maiden public share sale that will make it the first online travel agency to be listed on the Indian stock market, The Economic Times reported citing two persons in the know. The company aims to file the initial document, called the draft red herring prospectus, with the capital markets regulator shortly, said two people aware of the developments. JM Financial and Axis Bank will manage the issue. Currently, two Indian online travel companies — Makemytrip and Yatra — are listed on New York’s Nasdaq. EaseMyTrip has bucked the travel and ticketing industry’s chronic loss-making trend by being consistently profitable, data from the Registrar of Companies compiled by business intelligence company Veratech, showed. EaseMyTrip was started in 2008 by founder brothers Rikant Pitti, Nishant Pitti and Prashant Pitti as a business-to-business venture, issuing air-tickets for travel agents, but making them park a fraction of the cash against sales that they would have to deposit if they dealt directly with airlines. In three years, it was dealing with more than 18,000 agents."

39,2019-12-12,Airtel,"Trai has come up with a new set of rules to decide whether a subscriber is eligible for mobile number portability or notUsers must have an active connection with the present operator for at least 90 days to request for potability

NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has revised the norms for mobile number portability (MNP) service in the country. The new regulations will be effective from 16 December, Trai said in a circular. The mobile number portability system is not available from 10 December to 15 December.
Under the new Trai rules, a Unique Porting Code (UPC) will be generated only when a subscriber is eligible to port his/her mobile number.
Trai has come up with a new set of rules to decide whether a subscriber is eligible for the mobile number portability or not.
Firstly, the post-paid subscribers must clear the 'outstanding dues' of the present service provider for the bill issued as per the normal billing cycle in order to apply for the mobile number potability. The second criterion is that users must have an active connection with the present operator for at least 90 days.
As a third condition, the telecom regulator said, ""There should not be any pending contractual obligations to be fulfilled by the subscriber as per the exit clause provided in the subscriber agreement.""
Trai has also added that the porting of the mobile number should not be prohibited by the court of law. ""The mobile number sought to be ported is not sub-judice,"" said Trai.
Unique Porting Code or UPC will be valid for four days for all licensed service areas except in few places. In Jammu & Kashmir, Assam and North East, the UPC will remain valid for 30 days.
If you want to port the number within the same circle, it will take up to three working days. If the porting is for another circle, it will be executed within five days. ""There is no change in the porting timelines for the corporate mobile connections."" Trai said.
For individual users, once the UPC is issued, the porting request will not be rejected till the UPC is valid. For corporate mobile users, the porting request shall be forwarded to donor operator to verify the authorisation letter submitted by the corporate entity."
38,2019-12-12,Airtel,"Free voice calls and dirt cheap data by billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio has wrecked havoc on the industryAfter the ruling, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators have to pay  ₹1.47 lakh crore in past dues

NEW DELHI :
Telecom sector regulator Trai on Thursday dropped broad hints that it may be open to the idea of setting a minimum tariff for calls and data to ensure viability of the sector.
Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had, in past, vehemently opposed any intervention by the regulator in setting either cap or floor tariffs, and the U-turn in its thought process came a day after Bharti Airtel head Sunil Mittal reportedly pressed Telecom Secretary for setting a floor or minimum rate for data.
Speaking at the AVIA India Video 360 event here, Trai Chairman R S Sharma said telecom tariffs have been under forebearance for the last 16 years that have been working fine, and it now looking at renewed industry demand for fixing a floor price.
Free voice calls and dirt cheap data by billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Jio has wrecked havoc on the industry, which squeezed finances to match them.
""It is only recently that the telecom companies have together written to us that regulate us, so it's for the first time,"" he said. ""In the past, in 2012, I remember they had opposed tooth and nail the Trai's proposal to regulate tariffs. They said tariffs must be left under forebearance.""
Stating that the regulator is focussed on three overarching principles of consumer protection, fair competition and growth of the industry, he said Trai had, in the past, allowed telecom companies to decide tariffs and stepped in only when operators sought intervention from the regulator.
""But if there are certain market failures, if there are certain abberations, if one of the objectives, for example consumer protection, is not being met with, then obviously we will have to think of ways to ensure that these objectives are met with,"" he said.
Sharma said the telcos in 2017 had given a proposal, asking the regulator to fix a floor price, which Trai had observed to be a ""bad idea"".
The proposal surfaced again after the October 24 ruling of the Supreme Court that upheld the government position on including non-telecom revenues in calculating statutory dues. After the ruling, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom operators have to pay  ₹1.47 lakh crore in past dues.
Mittal met Telecom Secretary Anshu Prakash on Wednesday after which he reportedly said setting a floor for tariffs was important. The telecom czar said tariff needs to go up and industry needs to become viable.
Sharma said in 2017, the telcos were consulted and ""all of them came to the conclusion that floor price is a bad idea, so regulatory intervention is not required"".
""And again they have said in a couple of weeks back, so we will have to consider what to do,"" he said. ""But what I am saying is that ideally we would not like to put any regulation, if the market is functioning in an efficient and fair manner, that is our broad principle. So, achieving the objective without doing anything is the best."""
37,2019-12-12,Airtel,"Priced at  ₹3,999, the Xstream Stick costs as much as the standalone ChromecastXstream Stick also gets you free access to movies, TV shows and music from Airtel’s own streaming platforms Xstream and Wynk

Users looking for a new streaming device that can make a dumb TV smart are currently spoilt for choice. While Google’s Chromecast and Fire Sticks are compelling options on their own, the likes of the Tata Sky Fire Stick and now Airtel’s Xstream Stick makes the deal even more exciting with a bevy of subsidized and free content offered by Tata Sky and Airtel.
Powered by Google’s Chromecast, the Xstream Stick uses HDMI for connectivity and has a round form-factor on the lines of Chromecast but with Airtel branding. It will essentially turn your television into a version of Google’s Android TV operating system.
Priced at  ₹3,999, the Xstream Stick costs as much as the standalone Chromecast, but comes with a whole host of movies and shows from platforms such as Hooq, Eros Now, Shemaroo, Zee5 and Hungama. However, it isn’t free and will cost  ₹999 annually. It’s a double-edged sword here. Separately, these platforms will cost you more, but paying extra for content after spending nearly  ₹4,000 may put off some users. Having said that, you have to do that on an Amazon Fire TV Stick too, so the value proposition remains almost the same.
The Xstream Stick also gets you free access to movies, TV shows and music from Airtel’s own streaming platforms Xstream (previously known as Airtel TV) and Wynk. However, to access all these goodies, users will have to sign up with an Airtel mobile number and also download the app on their smartphones.
Once the Stick is activated, users can access the content directly, using the hand-held remote (bundled with the Stick) or turn to Google Assistant and get things done with simple voice commands.
The fact that Airtel is bundling its own platforms through this seems to be a result of Reliance Jio’s bundling of its streaming services with various Jio subscriptions.
The Chromecast connection allows users to access other streaming platform such as Prime Video, Netflix, Hotstar and YouTube, and also stream content directly on the TV without involving the smartphone. While the Xstream is clearly a more wholesome version of Chromecast, access to Live TV channels is available on the Airtel 
Xstream only on your smartphone."
36,2019-12-12,Airtel,"This is a market that has thrived on competition and would serve the country well if it continues to thrive. But with major companies under survival stress, that looks unlikely

It is a market that boasts of more paying customers than the population of most countries. The transformation of Indian life that it has caused over the past decade or so, be it social or commercial, has held us spellbound. But, just as wireless web connectivity reaches another pivotal moment, with newer technology promising to open up even more expansive possibilities of what our handsets can do, leaders of the telecom sector are sending out distinct signals of distress. In separate statements made recently, Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Airtel and Kumar Mangalam Birla of Vodafone Idea have warned that the cost of staying in the business is becoming exorbitant. The two telecom operators posted record losses in the previous quarter after accounting for their accumulated dues to the government; these are vast sums they were directed to cough up after a widened definition of the revenues they are obliged to share with the Centre was upheld by the Supreme Court. Although the government has allowed them to defer payments, the two companies have argued that the relief was inadequate. They have survived a tariff war of attrition after Reliance Jio stormed into the field as a data-loaded price warrior three years ago, but even a tariff-raising truce may be unable to restore every operator to financial health, it is feared.
A market with some of its players too cash-strapped to compete effectively would begin to lose the vibrancy of competition that spurs growth and innovation. “The situation is dire,"" Mittal said, referring to the losses of Vodafone Idea, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), and his own firm, calling it “a matter of survival"". While Bharti Airtel plans to raise the amount it owes the government by diluting equity and taking fresh loans, both partners in Vodafone Idea have indicated that they are unlikely to pump fresh capital into their venture unless the government relaxes its revenue claims. The Centre, though, has said it will stick to the court timeline for collecting its dues. Subscribers have to bear some part of the burden. Along with rival Reliance Jio, the two in distress have raised their tariffs by up to 40%. Under usual circumstances, such a joint hike would attract the attention of India’s competition regulator, though the mitigating factors in this case are obvious. Moreover, the détente that allowed it to happen may not last. While Mittal has asked for the telecom regulator to set a floor for service prices and argued that industry viability requires the average telecom user to pay  ₹300 per month, up sharply from the current figure, there is little to justify such intervention in a market such as this.
As with any market, private operators must have pricing freedom. The only condition is that sufficient rivalry must prevail. On its part, the government has laid out a vision of an industry that has space for three private players, alongside the state-owned BSNL, and this seems fine so long as no operator finds itself hobbled and no cartelization takes place. The trouble in the past has been a policy framework marked by large swings and high uncertainty, with judicial interventions shaking the market up. How scarce airwaves are best priced was part of the problem. From throwaway rates, we moved to mega-bids for auctioned spectrum that left operators highly indebted. Auctions are fair, no doubt, but costs still need to be reasonable. In sum, we need a stable policy that promotes healthy rivalry."
35,2019-12-14,Airtel,"Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea have increased the price of their recharge plans by 15-47%Here is a comparison of Jio, Airtel and Vodafone's plans, data offers and talktime

NEW DELHI :
All the three major telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio revised their prepaid recharge plans this month. While Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel introduced the tariff hikes on 2 December, 2019, Reliance Jio’s revised plans came into effect from 6 December. However, owing to the cut-throat competition and similar prepaid recharge plans, the telcos introduced new plans once again. Airtel and Vodafone Idea have announced unlimited calling across networks under its 'Truly Unlimited' recharge plans.
Here is a break-up of some of the major recharge plans provided by the three telecom operators.
Airtel latest plans:
To offer unlimited calling across other networks as well, Airtel has launched three new unlimited plans --  ₹219,  ₹399 and  ₹449.
 ₹219 plan:
It has a validity period of 28 days and offers 1 GB data per day. It also offers 100 SMS per day besides Free Hello Tunes, unlimited Wynk music and Airtel Xstream app as part of Airtel Thanks benefits.
 ₹399 plan:
This recharge plan has a validity period of 56 days and gives you 1.5 GB data per day. You also get 100 SMS per day and access to free Hello Tunes, Wynk music subscription and Airtel Xstream App premium.
 ₹449 plan:
This plan comes with 2GB data per day and is also valid for 56 days. You get 90 SMS per day besides Airtel Thanks benefits.
Vodafone Idea latest plans:
 ₹149 monthly plan: Truly unlimited calls with 2 GB of Data and 300SMS for 28 days validity.
 ₹249 monthly plan: Truly unlimited local/national calls to all network with 1.5GB/Day and 100SMS/Day. Validity: 28Days
 ₹299 three-month plan: Truly unlimited local/national calls to all network with 2GB/Day and 100 SMS/Day. Validity: 28Days
 ₹699 three-month plan: Truly unlimited local/national calls to all network with 2GB/Day and 100 SMS/Day. Validity: 84Days
Apart from this, there is also a  ₹699 recharge for a validity of 84 days added to the prepaid recharge schemes that provides truly unlimited voice calls, 2 GB data and 100 SMS
 ₹1,499 yearly plan: Unlimited Voice calls, 24 GB data, 3600 SMS, 365 days validity. This plan has seen a significant rate hike of  ₹500. The same benefits were provided to the prepaid consumers for a much less price of  ₹999. However, the telecom major increased the data usage limit from 12 GB to 24 GB.
Reliance Jio latest plans:
It is important to note than unlike Airtel and Vodafone Idea who are now offering truly unlimited calls service for their customers, Reliance Jio still has a cap on free outgoing calls to other networks. Here are the new plans offered by the Mukesh Ambani-led company:
 ₹98 plan:
In its affordable pack category, Jio now has one more plan --  ₹98. The new recharge plan is valid for 28 days and gives you a total data of 2 GB after which speed is reduced to 64 Kbps. You are also entitled to a total of 300 SMSes.
Voice calls are free for all Jio to Jio and Jio to landline calls. You need to opt for IUC top-up vouchers for making calls to non-Jio mobile numbers. For every  ₹10 spent on off-net mobile voice calls, additional complementary 1 GB data will be given to you for free.
If you are opting for the  ₹98 recharge plan, you will have to buy the top-up voucher for making non-Jio calls.
 ₹149 plan:
Jio has now relaunched its  ₹149 plan which has a validity period of 24 days and comes with 24 GB data. You get 300 minutes of free talktime to non-Jio mobile numbers. You also get 100 SMS per data and a complimentary subscription to Jio Apps."

NEW DELHI :
In yet another massive data breach incident, data of over 32 crore subscribers of telecom major Bharti Airtel were exposed and became vulnerable due to a serious security flaw in its mobile application.
Ehraz Ahmed, a Bengaluru-based researcher, who first noticed the fault, said in his blog written that the flaw existed in one of Airtel's API (Application Program Interface) that allowed people to fetch sensitive user information of any Airtel subscriber.
According to reports, Airtel confirmed the breach saying that it has fixed the security flaw associated with its application.
Ahmed also posted a video, which shows a script being used to fetch the information from the Airtel mobile app's API.
""It revealed information like First and Last Name, Gender, Email, Date of Birth, Address, Subscription Information, Device Capability information for 4G, 3G & GPRS, Network Information, Activation Date, User Type [Prepaid/Postpaid] And Current IMEI number,"" he wrote in his blog.
The IMEI number can be used to identify the device of an user.
According to the blog, every user on Airtel network was at the risk of getting his/her information leaked through this vulnerability.
Airtel is the third largest telecom service provider in the country in terms of subscribers after Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio."

You no longer have to wait for a week to port your mobile number. With the new regulations, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has made the mobile number portability (MNP) system easier than before. The new rules will be applicable from 16 December.
The telecom regulator will generate a Unique Porting Code (UPC) only when a subscriber is eligible to port his/her mobile number. Trai will decide whether a customer is eligible for a mobile number portability or not. Here are a few conditions that Trai has listed:
1) Those who use post-paid service have to clear the 'outstanding dues' of the current telecom operator for the issued bill according to the normal billing cycle.
2) User will have to use the active connection of any mobile operator for at least 90 days.
3) Your number will not be eligible for portability if you have already made a request to change the ownership of your mobile number.
4) The porting of the mobile number should not be prohibited by the court of law.
5) If your mobile number is sub-judice, you won't be able to port it.
6) ""There should not be any pending contractual obligations to be fulfilled by the subscriber as per the exit clause provided in the subscriber agreement,"" said Trai.
Unique Porting Code or UPC will be valid for four days for all the places except Jammu & Kashmir, Assam and North East. The UPC will be available for 30 days in Jammu & Kashmir, Assam and North East.
Cost: The telecom regulator will charge  ₹6.46 as transaction fee for each porting request.
For individual users, the porting request shall not be rejected till the validity of UPC, said Trai. Corporate mobile number users need to submit a valid authorisation letter issued by the corporate entity for porting a number.
To port a number within the same circle, it will take up to three working days. If the porting is for another circle, it will be executed within five days."
32,2019-12-17,Airtel,"Watchdog kick-starts consultation process to determine if regulatory intervention is needed to fix tariffsMobile tariffs are under forbearance, which means telcos have a free hand in fixing rates

NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on Tuesday kick-started a consultation process to determine if regulatory intervention is required in fixing tariffs and the need for a floor price for mobile services.
The regulator has also sought consultation on issues such as the methodology to fix a floor price and how to ensure that it does not benefit a section of operators with windfall profits. It has also sought suggestions on whether floor prices should be fixed for both data and voice services.
Mobile tariffs are currently under forbearance, which means operators have a free hand in fixing rates—they only have to report tariff plans to Trai within seven days of the launch. If a floor price is set, free services could become a thing of the past. This would come as relief for Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd, which have been clamouring for an increase mobile tariffs.
The regulator’s fresh consultation paper comes at a time when the sector is reeling under severe financial stress. In fact, a special panel set up by the government in October to recommend steps to revive the telecom sector had suggested that the regulator examine the aspect of a minimum charge (floor tariff) for voice and data services to ensure that the sector remains financially viable.
“In the last few months, many concerns have been raised about the health of the Indian telecom sector and the need to fix a floor price for telecom services. The Department of Telecommunications has recently forwarded representations received by it from the telecom service providers, regarding various issues, inter alia, including plea from some of the telecom operators seeking floor tariff fixation by the regulator/government,"" the regulator said in a statement.
Even in 2017, following the September 2016 entry of Reliance Jio with free data and voice tariffs, existing telcos had approached the regulator to consider setting up a floor price as their revenue streams started shrinking. At the time, Trai had said a floor price “was not a workable idea""; subsequently, operators, too, were in agreement.
“The fast pace of technological changes in the sector require huge capital investments. Telecom sector is the infrastructure provider for many other sectors. Thus, making sure that the telecom sector remains healthy and its orderly growth are equally important. These are crucial issues currently impacting the telecom sector and a detailed deliberation by all the stakeholders is necessary to find the best way forward,"" Trai added.
Emailed queries to Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea did not elicit any response till press time.
Written comments on the issues raised in the consultation paper have been invited from the stakeholders by 17 January 2020, and counter-comments by 31 January, 2020.
Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have reported record losses for the September quarter, ravaged by a Supreme Court verdict that upheld the government’s broader definition of telecom revenues, based on which it calculates the licence fees of operators.
Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter was at  ₹50,922 crore—the highest in India’s corporate history. Airtel, too, reported its highest quarterly loss in 14 years at  ₹23,045 crore in the quarter ended 30 September."
33,2019-12-17,Airtel,"Telcos will continue earning 6 paise a minute for every mobile call they receive on their networks till 31 Dec, 2020Trai cites ‘inadequate’ adoption of 4G for voice calls, asymmetries in inter-operator traffic as reasons to defer scrapping of IUC

New Delhi: The telecom regulator on Tuesday deferred by a year a plan to scrap a levy charged by operators for handling incoming calls from rival networks, offering relief to older telcos that generate a part of their revenue from interconnect usage charges (IUC).
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will now scrap IUC from 1 January 2021 instead of next month. As a result, operators will continue to earn 6 paise a minute for every mobile call they receive on their networks till 31 December, 2020.
The regulator has changed its stance about two years after it decided to scrap the levy from 1 January, 2020, a move that older telcos Vodafone Idea Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd claimed favoured newer entrant Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd because its outgoing voice traffic was much higher than incoming. Scrapping IUC would benefit an operator with more outgoing traffic.
Trai’s decision comes as a major relief for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have reported record losses in the quarter ended 30 September. Jio, which had 64% of its total traffic as outgoing as of June-end, favoured the levy being scrapped.
A zero IUC, or bill and keep, regime means operators would not make any money for receiving calls on their networks. If the traffic flow among operators is symmetrical, it will not have a negative impact on any operator as it is simply a charge paid by one operator to another.
“Trai regulation to maintain IUC at the current 6p/min for a year is along expected lines and provides the most short-term relief to Vodafone Idea, while Jio would see a temporary adverse impact,"" IIFLCAP, a division of IIFL Securities Ltd, said in a note on Tuesday. “The extension of the IUC regime is a positive for Vodafone Idea from a near-term perspective—in line with the government’s stance of ensuring its financial viability.""
The regulator has cited “inadequate"" adoption of 4G technologies for voice calls and asymmetries in inter-operator traffic as reasons for deferring the scrapping of IUC. “At this point of time, it may not be advisable to implement ‘bill and keep’ from 1 January 2020,"" said Trai.
“Implementation of bill and keep from 1 January 2020, with present inadequate adoption of 4G technologies by consumers and asymmetries in traffic, may affect the level playing field among service providers and, in turn, effective competition in the market,"" said the regulator.
Emailed queries to Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea remained unanswered till press time.
Trai had floated a fresh consultation paper on 18 September to examine if there was a need to revise the applicable date for scrapping IUC, given the continuing imbalance in inter-operator traffic.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which are currently battling shrinking revenue following a price war triggered by the entry of Jio in September 2016, had then welcomed Trai’s regulatory rethink. Jio, however, said a delay in scrapping IUC was unwarranted, arbitrary and anti-poor, and not only affected the credibility of the authority, but also sabotaged the government’s Digital India mission.
“This is a welcome step in the right direction,"" said Rajan Mathews, director general of lobby Cellular Operators Association of India. “We look forward to continuing support from the government and regulator to address the severe financial stress in the telecom sector.""
In September 2017, Trai had ordered a reduction in IUC to 6 paise per minute from 1 October 2017, from 14 paise earlier and abolishing it from 1 January 2020. Local telecom operators, reeling from the fierce price war triggered by the entry of Jio, were hit hard by the order.
Jio is the only pure-4G network in India. Vodafone Idea operates a mix of 2G, 3G and 4G networks. Airtel operates 2G and 4G networks and is in the process of phasing out 3G by March next year."

NEW DELHI :
The telecom regulator has recently revised the norms for mobile number portability to make the process faster and easier than before. Starting from this week, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will decide whether you are eligible to port your mobile number or not.
The telecom regulator will generate a Unique Porting Code (UPC) only when a subscriber is eligible to port his/her mobile number. The Unique Porting Code or UPC will be valid for four days for all areas except in few places. Earlier, the UPC was valid for a time frame of 15 days for all License Service Area barring a few. The UPC will remain valid for 30 days in Jammu & Kashmir, Assam and North East.
If the customer wants to port to the other operator in the same circle, it will be executed within three days. For porting your number to another circle, it will take up to five working days.
For individual users, once the UPC is issued, the porting request will not be rejected as long as the UPC remains valid. For corporate mobile numbers, the porting request shall be forwarded to donor operator. An authorisation letter from the corporate entity should be submitted for verification purpose.
The telecom regulator will charge  ₹6.46 as transaction fee for each porting request. A subscriber may withdraw the porting request by sending SMS to 1900.
Trai has come up with a set of regulations to decide the eligibility of your porting request.
1) User will have to use the active connection of any mobile operator for at least 90 days.
2) The porting of mobile number not be prohibited by the court of law. Or the mobile number should not be sub-judice in order to port it.
3) ""There should not be any pending contractual obligations to be fulfilled by the subscriber as per the exit clause provided in the subscriber agreement,"" said Trai.
4) If you have made a request to change the ownership of your mobile number, your mobile number portability request will be cancelled.
5) Post-paid mobile customers must clear 'outstanding dues' of the current telecom operator for the issued bill according to the normal billing cycle. Otherwise his/her number will not be considered for portability."
29,2019-12-18,Airtel,"Before the recent tariff hikes, around 30% of operating earnings of Vodafone Idea was estimated to have been contributed by mobile termination revenuesThe recent tariff hikes have notably expanded the potential operating earnings base of these companies

Mumbai: Every little bit helps"" and telecom companies must be feeling quite the same. After facing a barrage of negative decisions lately, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai’s) extension of interconnect usage charges (IUC) has given a much-needed reprieve to incumbent telcos.
Telcos will continue earning 6 paise a minute for every mobile call they receive on their networks till 31 December 2020.
Analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd note that the extension of IUC will aid Bharti Airtel Ltd’s and Vodafone Idea Ltd’s operating earnings by 1% and 10%, respectively, in FY21.
“While off-net voice traffic imbalance between Jio and Bharti Airtel/Vodafone Idea is declining, it still remains meaningful with the difference between off-net incoming calls vs. off-net outgoing calls as of Oct-19 being ~12% net off-net incoming for Vodafone Idea while it was 6% for Bharti Airtel. Jio was the net payer of IUC charges with the difference being 19% net off-net outgoing,"" said Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients. Jio is Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Even then, these gains will not significantly alter the financial position of both companies. “Post the recently announced price increase, on an increasing Ebitda base and declining termination charge, the benefit for Bharti Airtel/Vodafone Idea would reduce to 2%/10% in FY21, while the impact on Reliance Jio would be 4%,"" analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
The recent tariff hikes are estimated to lift Bharti Airtel’s and Vodafone Idea’s average realizations (blended average revenue per user) by as much as one-fifth. So much so the incremental revenues are projected to help Bharti Airtel swing back to profit at the pre-tax level. The losses are expected to decrease considerably at Vodafone Idea.
Also by floating a consultation paper in September, the telecom regulator did indicate its intention to extend IUC.
So the latest decision is not much of a reprieve, and shares of incumbent telcos were not quite upbeat after the extension was announced. The Bharti Airtel stock lost 0.4%, while Vodafone Idea shares closed lower by more than 7% on Wednesday.
Further, the telecom regulator seems to be less enthusiastic about setting a floor price for voice and data services, as sought by some industry participants. While seeking stakeholders’ comments, Trai stated its preference for keeping tariffs in forbearance.
Meanwhile, Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have a long way to go before breathing easy. Vodafone Idea will have to beef up its balance sheet to keep pace with the competition. Analysts fear the company may lag behind in network investments, ceding market share to the competition.
The situation is relatively better for Bharti Airtel. But the spectrum and licence fee dues arising from the recent Supreme Court verdict can infuse a substantial financial burden unless the company raises fresh funds from investors."

NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) needs to step in now to ensure that mobile tariffs move up and the financial health of the sector is restored, Bharti Airtel chairman Sunil Mittal said on Thursday.
“Indian consumers have been enjoying low rates, they will continue to enjoy low rates, but I think we need to have a balance between requirement of investments and the consumer on the other side,"" Mittal told reporters after meeting finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for pre-Budget consutations.
“My view is  ₹200 ARPU, eventually going to  ₹300 ARPU... at the lower end  ₹100 per customer over a month of consuming rich data, voice and other services, and on the upper hand  ₹450-500 and therefore blended eventual landing point of  ₹300 a month which will still be $4 a month, and by far the lowest anywhere in the world, and yet consuming two-three times more data than anywhere else in the world,"" Mittal said.
“That’s the balance we need to get to. TRAI needs to work on this because the industry has not been able to have an orderly mechanism to get to that point,"" he said.
Airtel recorded an ARPU of  ₹128 in the September quarter, down from  ₹129 in the June quarter. ARPU is the total revenue of an operator divided by the number of users, or connections, on its network.
Mittal’s comments come two days after the sector regulator kick-started a consultation process to determine if regulatory intervention is required in fixing tariffs and the need for a floor price for mobile services.
The regulator has also sought consultation on issues such as the methodology to fix a floor price and how to ensure that it does not benefit a section of operators with windfall profits. It has also sought suggestions on whether floor prices should be fixed for both data and voice services.
Mobile tariffs are currently under forbearance, which means operators have a free hand in fixing rates—they only have to report tariff plans to Trai within seven days of the launch. If a floor price is set, free services could become a thing of the past. This would come as relief for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have been clamouring for an increase in mobile tariffs.

At the lower end,  ₹100 for a customer over a month of consuming rich data, voice and other services and on the upper end  ₹450-500... therefore, blended eventual landing point of  ₹300 a month, which will still be $ 4 a month... by far, the lowest anywhere in the world and yet consuming two or three times more data than anywhere else in the world,"" Mittal said.
The industry needs to get to that balance, he said adding that Trai needs to work on this as the industry ""has not been able to have an orderly mechanism to get to that point"".
""We are unnecessarily killing this industry in a manner and way that is not conducive for our industry, and that's why we need Trai intervention,"" Mittal added.
The comments of the Airtel chief come just days after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) initiated talks to prescribe floor price for call and data, and also deferred by one year the scrapping of the charge paid by mobile phone users for calls made to rival networks.
The two moves came as a big boost to Airtel and Vodafone Idea that are staring at a liability of thousands of crores in unpaid past statutory dues following a Supreme Court ruling. Through their association, the operators had been pitching to the government for fixing a floor rate for calls and data.
The telecom call and data rates are at present under forbearance or not regulated.
But, earlier this week, Trai released a consultation paper to fix minimum or floor rates for mobile phone calls and data, a move that will effectively end the regime of free calling and dirt cheap data.
The outcome is likely to lead to further hike in mobile call and data cost as the industry wants average revenue per user to reach  ₹300 per month from about  ₹125 at present over a period of two years -- better revenue realisation per user will offer a much-needed breather to the stressed telecom industry where debt levels have soared to  ₹7.8 lakh crore.
Bharti Airtel had posted a staggering  ₹23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of  ₹28,450 crore in the aftermath of the SC ruling on statutory dues.
According to government data, statutory liabilities in the case of Bharti Airtel add up to nearly  ₹35,586 crore, of which  ₹21,682 crore is licence fee and another  ₹13,904.01 crore is the SUC (spectrum usage charges) dues (excluding the dues of Telenor and Tata Teleservices)."
23,2019-12-20,Airtel,"The government has already floated an RFP (request for proposal) to appoint an auctioneer for the processThe government had last conducted auctions in 2016, managing to sell only a fraction of the spectrum on offer

NEW DELHI :
Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the highest decision making authority in the department of telecommunications, is set to meet today to deliberate on the process for conducting upcoming spectrum auctions.
The government has already floated an RFP (request for proposal) to appoint an auctioneer for the process. The government had last conducted auctions in 2016, managing to sell only a fraction of the spectrum on offer.
India’s telecom sector witnessed disruption after the entry of Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd, in September 2016, led to an intense tariff war, bringing down data prices to rock bottom and making voice calls free. Following which, many had to shut shop or were acquired by bigger players. The domestic telecom market is now largely a three-way play between Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, and Jio.
The spectrum auction that the government plans to hold in the current financial year will likely include airwaves for 5G services.
This puts the spotlight on the country’s roadmap for the rollout of next generation wireless technology which is set to catapult data speeds and propel Internet of Things, yielding industry altering changes for agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and education.
A decision today, if it comes, will likely set the ball rolling for operators' plans for launching such services in India. The industry will watch out for whether the government will agree to lower spectrum prices.
In August, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had said the 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services, should be auctioned as a single band and in blocks of 20MHz each at  ₹492 crore per megahertz. While Bharti Airtel Ltd has said these prices are exorbitant and it would not participate in an auction at these prices, Vodafone Idea Ltd has suggested the 5G auction take place in 2020. In South Korea, the same band was priced at roughly  ₹131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June last year.
The government did not auction any spectrum in fiscals 2017-18 and 2018-19. In 2016-17, the government had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to auction just 965MHz."

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Airtel added 12 million 4G subscribers during October-November, according to data submitted by the company to the Telecom Regulatory of Authority India Ltd (Trai). Of this, the company added 5 million 4G users in October and 7 million in November.
“This is a five-fold jump over the monthly average of around 1.5 million additions,"" a Bharti Airtel executive told Mint.
The telecom operator earlier this year rolled out a loyalty programme for subscribers called Airtel Thanks which hands out benefits such as access to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, preference in customer care, etc, based on a tier structure of monthly tariff.
“We are confident of exiting the quarter with record net 4G subscriber addition,"" the executive said.
Airtel has pan-India 4G network and had earlier this year announced its plans to shut down 3G network across the country by March 2020, and redeploy the spectrum for 4G. It has already shut down 3G networks in Haryana, Kolkata and Punjab and upgraded users to 4G. It continues to operate 2G network.
The company, however, remains way behind its bitter rival Jio which had 355.2 million 4G users as of September end. Airtel had a total of 125.42 million 4G users and Vodafone Idea had 112.17 million 4G users as of September end, according to data published by Trai.
The regulator has not published data for the subsequent months."
21,2019-12-20,Airtel,"Digital Communications Commission shrugs off clamour for lower prices, says hopeful of concluding auction by AprilLobby group COAI cautioned that operators would find it tough to raise funds for the auction

New Delhi: The Digital Communications Commission (DCC), the highest decision-making authority at the department of telecommunications (DoT), on Friday accepted the prices suggested by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, or Trai, for spectrum auctions in March-April, when the government will put on offer airwaves for 4G and 5G services.
The DoT plans to put 8,300 megahertz of spectrum at a reserve price of  ₹5.23 trillion under the hammer, telecom secretary Anshu Prakash said on Friday.
“The DCC has not reduced the prices from what was recommended by Trai...we expect good participation because the telecom operators do require spectrum, their services are expanding, their networks are expanding...there should be good competition in bidding. The Trai has given detailed reasons. So the DCC thought it fit to accept that,"" Prakash told reporters after the DCC meeting.
“We are hopeful that the auction should be conducted in March-April,"" he added.
The development could be a setback for telecom operators, who have been clamouring for far lower spectrum prices.
The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has cautioned that with spectrum reserve prices 4-6 times those of similar spectrum sold recently in several other countries, high levels of debt, and financial stress in the sector, telecom service providers will find it very difficult to raise funds to participate in the auctions.
“It will be prudent to let the sector regain some financial strength from the recent initiatives undertaken before scheduling the auction for 5G. The interim period can be used to design and test India-specific 5G use cases,"" Rajan Mathews, director general, COAI, said.
Email queries to Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea were unanswered till press time.
The panel has stuck to the prices suggested by the regulator despite telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad promising the industry of “reform in spectrum pricing"".
To be sure, the government did not auction any spectrum in FY18 and FY19.
In FY17, the Centre had raised  ₹65,789 crore through spectrum sale, a fraction of the  ₹5.63 trillion worth of spectrum, at base price, it had put up for sale. While the total spectrum put up for sale was 2,354.44MHz across seven bands, the government managed to sell just 965MHz.
Out of the 8,300MHz of airwaves that the government plans to offer, 6,050MHz are allocated for 5G services. The next generation of wireless technology is set to catapult data speeds and propel the Internet of Things, with the potential to bring radical changes in agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and education.
The DCC’s decision will need the approval of the Union cabinet. The bids for the request for proposal to appoint an auctioneer will be opened on 13 January.
India’s telecom sector has witnessed disruption after the entry of Jio, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd, in September 2016, bringing down data prices to rock bottom. Following this half-a-dozen companies either shut shop or were acquired by bigger players. The domestic telecom market is now largely a three-way play between Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Jio.
In August 2018, Trai had suggested that  ₹492 crore should be the base price for per megahertz of 3,300-3,600 MHz band, expected to be the primary band for 5G services. In South Korea, the same band was priced at around  ₹131 crore per megahertz in auctions held in June 2018. Bharti Airtel had said that 5G spectrum prices were exorbitant, while Jio had urged the Centre to take a “holistic look at promoting 5G technology with policy measures including optimal pricing of 5G spectrum"".
The base price of 700MHz band has been fixed at  ₹6,568 crore per megahertz—43% below the  ₹11,485 crore set in the 2016-17 auction. The high-value 700MHz spectrum is considered efficient for deploying 4G LTE networks and has greater structural penetration. For airwaves in the 800MHz and 900MHz band, prices have been lowered by 21% and 51%, respectively.
As per the policy, bidders have to pay 25-50% upfront, and the rest in 16 annual instalments after a two-year moratorium. Upfront payment is 25% for sub-1GHz band and 50% for spectrum of higher frequency bands, which are available with DoT and do not have to be vacated by other agencies.
However, the DoT has tweaked the amount to be paid upfront in case spectrum has to be vacated by existing users.
If the sub-1 GHz spectrum is not immediately available with DoT and the operator has bid for it, the operator will have to pay only 10% out of the 25% upfront payment. The balance can be paid a month before the spectrum is made available. For higher bands, bidder will have to pay 20% of the 50% upfront payment and the balance a month prior to when the spectrum is vacated by existing users.
“The government should focus on the rollout of services as much as the funds raised by sale of spectrum. Not reducing reserve prices is insensitive. After all, base price is only the starting bid, not the final price. This system is unwise since it protects government revenue at the cost of service rollout,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director of communications consultancy ComFirst India."

MUMBAI :
Anand Mahindra’s decision to be non-executive chairman of Mahindra and Mahindra, effective 1 April 2020, is also a culmination of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) regulations, which mandate that the chairperson of the top 500 companies need to be non-executive.
To comply with Sebi norms, such changes are imminent in over 214 companies, including banks, public sector enterprises and large corporates, including Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Bharti Airtel Ltd, Wipro Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd and Adani Ports Ltd.
The likes of Mukesh Ambani of RIL, Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Airtel, Sanjiv Mehta of Hindustan Unilever and Sanjiv Puri of ITC will have to either become a non-executive chairperson, or take the executive role of managing director and chief executive officer.
According to data compiled by nseinfobase.com (run by Prime Database) of the top 500 companies, 162 have the same person as the chairperson, MD and CEO. In another 52 companies, the chairperson and MD/CEO are related.
Sebi norms under the Listing Obligation and Disclosure Requirement (LODR) also mandate that chairperson cannot be related to the MD or CEO. Sebi relies on the definition of a relative as per the Companies Act, 2013.
“Promoter assuming a non-executive chairperson role is and would be rare. In my view, in most cases, you would find the promoter shall continue with the role of MD/CEO while appointing an existing independent director as the non-executive chairperson. There is still a long way to go. As with other regulations, especially relating to the composition of board, the true test will lie in its implementation -- would there be simple checkbox compliance as we have seen in the past or would the implementation be in spirit as well,"" said Pranav Haldea, managing director, Prime Database, a primary market tracker.
Most of India Inc. is currently consulting lawyers and family office specialists on restructuring their management and board chairmanship.
“Corporates do not want a situation where they are saddled with someone, either at the board level or management level, who does not understand the thinking of promoters. Many Indian companies for years have been promoter-driven with control over management and board. So, the restriction that MD/CEO and chairman cannot be related is another big concern. The succession planning is acutely being relooked at,"" said a senior lawyer, who is consulting with some of the Nifty 50 companies on navigating the new Sebi requirements.
But, there are also some corporates who are resisting the change and urging Sebi to revisit the norms. So far, Sebi has refused to consider representations from India Inc. on this issue.
According to a joint report published by International Finance Corp. (IFC), the BSE and Institutional Investor Advisory Services India (IiAS) on corporate governance practice in Indian boardrooms, there is a pushback on Sebi regulations seeking separation of chairperson and CEO roles.
“We find that 57 companies in the BSE 100 and 23 of the 50 IPO companies have separated the roles of the chairperson and CEO, with the chairperson being non-executive. However, some companies have a chairperson and CEO from the same promoter group,"" said the report."

Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) may have to disclose its assets before it can freeze plans to sell 20% stake in its refining and petrochemicals business to Saudi Aramco, reported The Times of India today.
According to the report, the Delhi High Court on Friday asked RIL and British Gas to disclose their assets after the Centre sought to restrain them from disposing of the same.
""In an application filed in September, the government had sought curbs citing the failure of the two companies to honour their payment under a $4.5 billion international arbitral award in the Panna-Mukta and Tapti production sharing contracts,"" The Times of India reported.
Calls to the RIL spokesperson went unanswered till the time of the story going to press.
RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani had on August 12 announced the company’s plans to sell 20% stake in its refining and petrochemicals business for $15 billion to Saudi Aramco. Saudi Aramco, the most profitable company in the world, controls the world’s second-largest proven crude reserves at more than 270 billion barrels, and the partnership will go a long way in insulating RIL from any future oil shocks and volatility in crude prices.
The deal, which values the oil-to-chemicals (O2C) business at $75 billion, is part of a plan to make RIL a zero-debt company in the next 18 months, Ambani had said in a speech at the annual meeting.
Ambani is aiming to slash RIL’s ballooning debt after spending as much as $50 billion to propel its telecom business to the top position in India within three years of starting operations, surpassing Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd.
According to the government, RIL and its partner are required to pay $4.5 billion with interest. In the Delhi High Court, the government said it was forced to file for the execution of the award as RIL and partner haven’t cleared their dues.
The government, since 2010, has been fighting an arbitration with RIL and its partner, alleging that the companies appropriated huge sums of money in violation of the production sharing contract in the PMT oil and gas fields."
17,2019-12-22,Airtel,"GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the governmentSources said dues being sought are more than three times the networth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned

New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has sought  ₹1.72 lakh crore in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's ruling on revenues that need to be taken into consideration for payment of government dues.
Sources with direct knowledge of the development said DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking  ₹1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence.
In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.
The firm told DoT that it had obtained ISP licence in 2002 for a period of 15 years, which expired in 2017. But GAIL never did any business under the licence and since no revenue was generated it cannot pay any amount.
On IP-1 and IP-2 licences, GAIL has told DoT that it generated  ₹35 crore of revenue since 2001-02 and not  ₹2,49,788 crore that has been considered for levying past dues, they said.
Sources said the dues being sought are more than three times the networth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned.
The Supreme Court had on October 24 ruled that non-telecom revenues earned by firms using spectrum or airwaves allocated by the government will be considered for calculating statutory dues.
While telcos such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea may have had non-telecom revenues generated from using the government licence and spectrum, firms such as GAIL had no such revenue.
DoT is seeking  ₹1.47 lakh crore from all telcos in past statutory dues.
Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking  ₹1.25 lakh crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence.
PowerGrid says it has an adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of  ₹3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to  ₹22,168 crore.
Infrastructure provider category- I (IP-I) are those infrastructure providers who provide assets such as dark fibre, right of way, duct space and towers to the licensees of telecom services.
GAIL has a vast network of gas pipelines and it laid optic fibre along it to provide bandwidth to third parties.
Issuance of IP-II licence was discontinued in December 2005.
Sources said DoT estimates that the telecom operators owe  ₹55,054.51 crore as spectrum usage charges (SUC) as on October 31, 2019, while the figure for licence fees stands at  ₹92,642 crore.

NEW DELHI :
The merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, pegged to create the world’s second largest tower company, hangs in balance with a key government approval pertaining to FDI enhancement not coming in time.
The board of Bharti Infratel will meet on Tuesday and is likely to take a decision on a second extension for the long stop date in order for the companies to secure this approval, to complete the merger that was announced back in April 2018.
“If the board feels more time is needed (to secure government approval) then it (long stop date) may be extended further or else various other options can be looked at,"" a person familiar with the matter told Mint.
To be sure, in October a special committee by Bharti Infratel had extended the long stop date to 24 December.
The merger is crucial as it will help loss-making telecom companies Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea sell stake to raise funds in the competitive telecom battleground, especially at a time when they have to pay huge dues to the department of telecommunications after an unfavourable court verdict in October.
Bharti Airtel has set aside  ₹34,260 crore and Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore in the September quarter after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of revenue based on which telecom companies pay levies.
“Since the merger (of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers) is contingent upon receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfilment of other conditions, there can be no assurance that the process can be completed within the extended time-frame,"" Bharti Infratel had informed the BSE in October.
“There are high chances that the deal could fall through and then all shareholders will have to monetise towers assets separately,"" another person aware of the matter said requesting anonymity.
Emails sent to DoT and Vodafone Idea were unanswered till press time. The spokesperson for Bharti Airtel declined to comment on the query.
Even if the two tower companies get a second extension of the long stop date, which is key to completing the merger, monetizing stake in tower assets is likely to be difficult at this stage even if the merger goes through, as there are clouds of uncertainty on Vodafone Idea’s future.
At the Hindustan Times Leadership earlier this month, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that the group’s telecom unit, Vodafone Idea, will have to “shut shop"" if there was no relief from the government following the Supreme Court ruling requiring it to pay statutory dues of  ₹40,000 crore to the DoT within three months.
“The valuation of tower assets is also directly dependent on its anchor tenants. Since Vodafone Idea will be an anchor tenant of the proposed merged entity, any potential investor will wait for clarity whether government will offer relief on the AGR case,"" an industry executive said requesting anonymity.
The two tower companies had in April last year agreed to merge their businesses. The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower. Airtel and Vodafone India will have equal rights in the merged entity.
The Economic Times on Monday reported that the merger was delayed due to the proposal being stuck at the Department of Revenue because of the concerns over the withholding tax case against Vodafone Group which are yet to be resolved.
“Under the tax withholding case, it is the shareholder’s (Vodafone Plc) liability and hence it doesn’t make sense for the government to hold up the Indus-Infratel merger, if it is a tax neutral merger, as the company involved here is Indus Towers and not the shareholder. Even if the merger goes through, because of the AGR verdict, it would make little sense for any investor to be keen at telecom assets currently given the huge dues payable by operators who are promoters of these tower companies,"" Sumit Mangal, Partner, L&L Partners, said."

The recent decision of major telecommunication players like Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio to up their tariff rates by nearly 40% will only have marginal impact on the business of video streaming services, an industry whose growth is directly proportional to the Internet data people consume.
“There is likely to be some impact on consumers on the fringes of the pre-paid segment. These are probably people who are constricted from an income perspective and recharge their data in small amounts,"" said Jehil Thakkar, partner at Deloitte India.
Thakkar said the fact that video streaming has achieved a kind of utility status in India and is viewed as an essential service, could be one major reason. There is a systematic change in video consumption and habit formation as far as viewing is concerned that has commenced over the past three years.
But there are other reasons too. The entry of Reliance Jio into the telecom industry in 2016 has meant the availability of cheap data packs provided by players across the spectrum, some of these extending to 5 GB of data per day.
“In a sense the consumer has had data in excess of his utilization,"" said Neeraj Roy, managing director and CEO of Hungama Digital Media that owns the Hungama video and music apps. “It’s really a Rs. 30-50 swing (per month), even if you’re talking about the lower income groups of society.""
As far as the telecom industry is concerned, India has always been a 97% pre-paid market, Roy added. The difference is that until three years ago, consumers could buy the pre-paid pack in small denominations—daily or weekly packs and switch to a different carrier (there were 10-14 players then) once they ran out of data.
“That certainly doesn’t happen so much now. Even though pre-paid users are over 95% of the market, they are on one service for at least a whole month, before being presented with three other alternative choices, post that. If you were buying into a plan for Rs. 149 and the same now comes for Rs. 199, you don’t have a choice, you can’t say you’ll buy only three weeks,"" Roy said.
Ali Hussein, chief executive officer at Eros Now says it would be simplistic to presume most of these pre-paid consumers belong to India’s small towns and specifically low-income groups. But as a group, they could be accessing the Internet in other ways. “A large part of the pre-paid universe knows how to access content in a smarter fashion. “They are accessing Wi-Fi zones in public places, and there is a lot of investment being done across the ecosystem for the same,"" Hussein said.
According to an earlier Mint story, video streaming services are now making their way to India’s small towns, with platforms claiming anything between 40-50% of their consumption coming from these areas.
“On a principal level, there is definitely a direct correlation (between tariff hike and video consumption) but I believe there will be work wherein telcos will introduce snackier packs, or have some kind of a daily structure where they would ensure viewers have access to the content or video offline so there isn’t a heavy drain on data consumption because they also want to ensure they don’t lose a bunch of users who migrate to other data services,"" Hussein added."

The merger is crucial as it will help loss-making telecom companies Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea sell stake to raise funds in the competitive telecom battleground, especially at a time when they have to pay huge dues to the department of telecommunications after an unfavourable court verdict in October.
Bharti Airtel has set aside  ₹34,260 crore and Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore in the September quarter after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of revenue based on which telecom companies pay levies."
12,2019-12-24,Airtel,"After recent tariff hikes, the annual recharge plans of Airtel and Reliance Jio also saw a revisionReliance Jio on Tuesday announced a new  ₹2020 annual recharge plan

Country's major telecom operators Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Reliance Jio recently announced tariff hikes for their prepaid customers. However, owing to the cut-throat competition and similar prepaid recharge plans, the telcos introduced new plans once again.

10,2019-12-25,Airtel,"Airtel and Vodafone-Idea reported record financial losses but Jio continued to surprise the markets with astonishing profits through the yearThe total dues for the industry ran into a whopping  ₹1.47 lakh crore

NEW DELHI :
From being the world's cheapest and fastest growing market, India's telecom sector is sputtering as it faces life-threatening liability running into billions of dollars, a crisis that may alter the character of an industry that has already seen a painful price war destroying profits and push several operators out of the market.
The Supreme Court order for including non-core revenue in telecom groups' gross adjusted revenue -- the figure on which the levies are charged -- revived the rivalry between the old operators and Mukesh Ambani's low-cost upstart Reliance Jio during 2019, but there are signs of a truce with the rival camps agreeing to raise tariffs and also favouring regulator's intervention in fixing floor or minimum tariffs.
""We have fundamentally gone from an all (mobile) voice (calling) network to a hybrid network (of voice and internet data), to soon an all data network,"" said Rajan Mathews, Director General of Cellular Operators' Association of India (COAI).
And to survive, a floor price is needed quickly, before March 2020, he told PTI.
With 1 gigabyte (GB) of mobile data costing just $0.26 compared to $12.37 in the US and $6.66 in the UK, India in 2019 emerged as the nation with the cheapest telecom tariff in the world. It was also the fastest-growing telecom market.
But below the surface, a price war since the 2016 launch of Jio had ringed the sector hallow. And when on October 24, the Supreme Court, on a petition moved by the government, ordered payment of past dues according to its new definition of AGR, the country's second-biggest carrier Vodafone-Idea Ltd warned of shut down if no relief is given.
The total dues for the industry ran into a whopping  ₹1.47 lakh crore.
For an industry that has come from 7-8 operators to just three private players and state-owned fourth operator, the warning by Vodafone-Idea sounded like a death knell.
The year saw resurfacing of a bitter war of words between the old and the new operator, and intense lobbying by telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal and billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla of Vodafone-Idea.
Mittal and Birla had faced the brunt of brute competition unleashed by Ambani, as Jio ate into their user base and quickly grew to become the nation's biggest operator in terms of subscribers.
Airtel and Voda-Idea reported record financial losses but Jio continued to surprise the markets with astonishing profits through the year.
The representations to the government, worked. The government announced a two-year deferment on spectrum payments for the stressed telecom companies as it worked to avoid the sector becoming a monopoly, soon after the three operators signalled the end of price war by raising tariffs.
Mittal lobbied for regulator prescribing for a floor tariff for industry viability - an idea Jio had initially opposed on grounds that it would tantamount of giving up industry right of forbearance, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) quickly moved in to float consultation paper to fixing minimum rates.
COAI - the association that represents Airtel and other operators - wants the regulator to bring floor prices for data at the earliest, before March, arguing that mature mobile market merits such safeguards for investors.
And shocking loss numbers only led the telecom industry to seek doing away with the ""obsolete mechanism"" of AGR, in the best-case scenario, and if not, certainly a redefinition.
The industry is also pinning its hopes on fixation of floor price by the regulator to put an end to the sustained hemorrhaging of players and has also urged the Finance Ministry to substantially cut levies to give the industry a fighting chance.
The industry body remains optimistic that a recent increase in tariffs won't take the sheen off data consumption; the hunger for data will increase as more and more Indians transact online, buy clothes and indulge in online shopping and simply binge-watch the latest shows on video-streaming platforms. Greater speeds, smarter phones would aid that process, it argues.
""Still, the floor price is certainly needed to bring certain discipline back into the marketplace. We have fundamentally gone from an all voice network to a hybrid network, to soon an all data network. In a voice network, the de facto floor was the interconnect charge, question is, in the new world of data what should it be,"" Mathews said.
Mittal whose company is in the midst of $3 billion dollar fund raising to help pay off AGR dues, has sought Trai's urgent intervention in the telecom sector saying, ""We are unnecessarily killing this industry in a manner and way that is not conducive...""
He underlined the need for a balance between protecting investments and consumer interest.
Airtel posted a staggering  ₹23,045 crore net loss for the second quarter ended September 30, due to provisioning of  ₹28,450 crore in the aftermath of the SC ruling on statutory dues.
Both Airtel and Vodafone Idea have petitioned the government for relief in waiver of interest and penalty, which will halve the dues, and also filed a review petition in the Supreme Court.
The year, however, brought cheer to state-owned telecom companies MTNL and BSNL. The government recently approved a plum  ₹69,000 crore revival package for the two telcos that were in news over delay in salary payment for the most part of the year.
The revival package includes merging the two loss-making firms, monetizing their assets and giving VRS to employees so that the combined entity turns profitable in two years.
Nearly 92,700 employees of BSNL and MTNL have opted for voluntary retirement, which is expected to save about  ₹8,800 crore annually in salary bills for the debt-laden telecom companies."
11,2019-12-26,Airtel,"Outcome of adjusted gross revenue issue and amount payable along with funding mix may set tone for the yearIn a heavy blow to telcos, the Supreme Court had upheld the government’s definition of revenue

NEW DELHI :
Telecom operators expect a turnaround in their fortunes in the coming year thanks to a slew of positive measures by the government and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and also a massive tariff hike by operators that is expected to improve earnings.
Analysts, however, believe that the outcome of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) issue and whether operators receive any relief from the government will be key.
“Green shoots of recovery are visible for the telecom sector, driven by one of the steepest tariff hikes announced by the telcos and deleveraging initiatives undertaken by them. Trai’s decision on IUC (interconnect usage charge) and the consultation of floor price are positive,"" said Ankit Jain, assistant vice-president of corporate ratings at Icra Ltd. IUC is levied by telecom operators on incoming calls from rival networks.
“The debt of the sector is also likely to come down with the deleveraging and the tapering of capex intensity. The revenue and Ebitda are likely to post healthy growth in FY21 driven by tariff hikes. However, the outcome of the AGR issue is important and the amounts payable along with timelines and funding mix will set the tone of the coming year,"" Jain said.
Bharti Airtel has set aside  ₹34,260 crore and Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore in the September quarter after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of revenue, based on which telecom companies pay levies. This dealt a heavy blow to the two operators.
At the Hindustan Times Leadership earlier this month, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that the group’s telecom unit, Vodafone Idea, will have to “shut shop"" if there was no relief from the government following the apex court ruling on AGR.
Clarity is, however, awaited on the payment timeline and amount as Airtel and Vodafone Idea have filed a review petition on the court ruling.
“The year 2019 was the bottom of the trough for the sector and next year is expected to be better as ARPUs (average revenues per user) will improve. There is a little more stability on the regulatory front with IUC to stay for a year,"" said Rajan S. Mathews, director general at Cellular Operators Association of India. “Given the broad implication of the Supreme Court ruling that has ensnared companies outside the telecom space, we hope the government will devise a suitable way out of the conundrum.""
Earlier this month, telecom companies raised tariffs by as much as 40% while the regulator deferred by a year a plan to scrap the IUC, offering relief to older telcos that generate a part of their revenue from it.
Trai this month also kick-started a consultation process to determine if regulatory intervention is required in fixing tariffs and the need for a floor price for mobile services, which has come as welcome relief for operators clamouring for tariff increase.
The industry’s ARPU will improve by 25% to  ₹145 in FY21 from  ₹116 in FY20 following the revision in tariffs, Crisil Ratings said in a note on 9 December.
“There is visible improvement in the health of the telecom sector. The slight growth in operators’ revenue is a good sign. However, the problems are far from over. Upgrading networks requires huge investments,"" said Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India.
“It remains to be seen if telecom companies are in a position that banks will lend to them. In this situation, in the short term, the operators will focus more on making services better for high ARPU consumers, which might not be ideal,"" Uppal said."
9,2019-12-26,Airtel,"Bharti Infratel extended the long stop gap date for its merger with Indus Towers, yet againGiven the delays in approvals some fear the company may call off the merger all together

Bharti Infratel Ltd’s decision to extend the long stop date of its proposed merger with Indus Towers Ltd again does not come as a surprise. The stock gained 0.4% against a 0.7% decline in the Nifty on Thursday.
In fact, the management commentary is leading to the belief that the merger may be called off eventually. Bharti Infratel has said the merger is contingent upon receipt of regulatory approvals and there can be no assurance that the merger can be completed in the extended time-frame.
“Considering it has been challenging to secure merger-related permissions over the past 18-20 months, we believe Bharti Infratel could call off the merger,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.
The impact will be felt by key shareholders of both companies—Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd. More so by Vodafone Idea, as the company is banking upon selling its stake in the combined entity to raise funds for its India mobile services business.
For Bharti Infratel, which also holds a stake in Indus Towers, the opportunity to enhance its financial returns through better management of taxes as a combined entity (however meagre these benefits maybe) will be lost.
Importantly, the merger would have created a large telecom tower firm, which would have made it easier to raise fresh funds or sell stakes to new investors, said an analyst at a domestic broking firm, requesting anonymity. Of course, given the state of the Indian telecom industry, investors are broadly shying away from the sector. The Bharti Infratel stock has been a laggard, losing about 30% of its value in the past two years.
The concerns are not unfounded. Exit of small telecom companies from the Indian market and consolidation of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular Ltd has significantly impacted Bharti Infratel’s tenancies. Total co-locations, or the total antennas deployed by telecom service providers, dropped 21% between September 2017 and September 2019. Agreed, the company’s recent quarterly results show signs of stabilization, but analysts do not expect an immediate revival.
Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, a large customer, is not in a situation to aggressively incur network investments. Of late, Vodafone Idea’s focus is optimizing investments in key revenue-generating regions, instead of blanket network upgrade.
The company is losing subscribers, and the continuous pressure on operating earnings make it tough for a substantial expansion in tenancies in the near-term.
“Even as the recent developments in the wireless sector increase the likelihood of a three-player market structure sustaining, Vodafone Idea getting back into a meaningful network expansion phase would need a lot more. Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have both indicated that they are past their peak 4G capex phase,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Research said in a note."
8,2019-12-26,Airtel,"Airtel Payments Bank customers will now be able to use the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) facility at any time of the dayThe facility will be available to customers on a 24x7 basis even on holidays

New Delhi: Airtel Payments Bank on Thursday said it has enabled 24x7 NEFT transfers in line with the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) guidelines.
Airtel Payments Bank customers will now be able to use the National Electronic Funds Transfer (NEFT) facility at any time of the day. The facility will be available to customers on a 24x7 basis even on holidays enabling then to receive or send funds to any bank from anywhere, anytime, the Bank said.
Airtel Payments Bank customers can transfer funds via NEFT using the banking section of the Airtel Thanks app or the website of Airtel Payments Bank. They need to select the 'Transfer Money' option followed by 'transfer to Bank'. A screen to register the beneficiary will appear. Once the beneficiary registration process is completed, the customer can easily transfer the money.
Airtel Payments Bank Chief Operating Officer Ganesh Ananthanarayanan said: ""We are committed to provide customers with an efficient and smooth banking experience. We welcome the RBI mandate as it will allow our customers to easily transfer the money to any bank account at any time using NEFT mode. This will add to the overall online banking experience for the customers.""
Launched in January 2017, Airtel Payments Bank has a physical presence in all 29 states of the country through its 500,000-plus banking points. Out of these, over 60,000 focus on insurance and pension products in an attempt to reach the underserved. India's first payments bank has a user base of over 40 million customers.
The RBI earlier this month said Airtel Bank customers will be able to transfer funds through NEFT around the clock on all days including weekends and holidays from December 16. After the usual banking hours, these transactions are set to be automated initiated using 'Straight Through Processing (STP)' modes by the banks.
According to the bank, the existing discipline for crediting the beneficiary's account or returning the transaction within 2 hours of settlement to the originating bank will also continue."
7,2019-12-29,Airtel,"Telco raises minimum monthly recharge amount for users to  ₹45 from  ₹35 earlierHike in minimum monthly recharge is more significant as it hits users at the bottom of the pyramid

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd has raised the minimum monthly recharge for prepaid users to  ₹45 with immediate effect from Sunday, more than a year after it set this tariff at  ₹35.
This means every Airtel prepaid user will have to pay a minimum of  ₹10 more every month to stay on its network. “It will be mandatory to recharge with a voucher of  ₹45 or above every 28 days to avail services,"" Airtel said in a notice on Sunday.
“In case of non-recharge with a voucher of  ₹45 or above at the end of the tariff validity period, Airtel reserves the right to provide the plan benefits in a curtailed manner at its own discretion during the grace period of 15 days. In case of non-recharge of a voucher with  ₹45 or above, all services will be suspended post the grace period,"" it said.
Prior to this  ₹45 plan, consumers could get an additional 28-day validity through a recharge of  ₹23 which included only incoming calls and messages.
Last month, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea had raised tariffs by as much as 40%. The regulator too earlier this month kick-started a consultation process to determine if regulatory intervention is required in fixing tariffs and the need for a floor price for mobile services, which has come as a welcome relief for operators clamouring for tariff increase after waging a three-year battle with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which brought data prices to rock-bottom. However, a hike in minimum prepaid monthly recharge is significant as it hits users at the bottom of the pyramid.
In November 2018, Bharti Airtel had announced that it had set the minimum tariff at  ₹35 and through this, the company would be able to reduce the number of inactive customers, rein in general selling and administrative expenses, and help focus attention on improving services for better-paying users.
The move to further hike the charge comes two months after it was hit by an unfavourable court verdict after a 14-year battle between telecom companies and the department of telecommunications on the definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in the sector.
Bharti Airtel has set aside  ₹34,260 crore and Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore in the September quarter after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of revenue, based on which telecom companies pay levies. As a result, Bharti Airtel posted a massive loss, its highest and second quarterly loss in 14 years, amid a brutal price war unleashed by Reliance Jio that has reshaped the telecom market. The New Delhi-based Bharti Airtel swung to a  ₹23,045 crore loss in the September quarter from a profit of  ₹118 crore a year ago as it set aside money to pay the dues. Vodafone Idea’s loss for the September quarter widened to  ₹50,922 crore from  ₹4,874 crore in the year earlier.
At the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit earlier this month, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that the group’s telecom unit, Vodafone Idea, will have to “shut shop"" if there was no relief from the government following the apex court ruling on AGR.
Clarity is, however, awaited on the payment timeline and amount as Airtel and Vodafone Idea have filed a review petition on the court ruling.
As of September end, Airtel’s revenue from mobile services in India was  ₹10,811 crore, up from  ₹10,724 crore in the June quarter. It has 279.43 million users as of September end.
“This is another step in the right direction. Slowly raising rates is a decent strategy given that tariffs have been low for last three years and revenue streams have been under pressure. Consistent periodic revision in tariffs is expected now,"" a Mumbai based analyst said requesting anonymity."

5,2019-12-30,Airtel,"India is a crucial market for Huawei, where it deployed 4G for Airtel, Voda Idea'We have taken a decision to give 5G spectrum for trials to all the players,' said telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad

New Delhi: The government has allowed all applicants, including China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, to participate in 5G trials, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Monday.
“The age of 5G is coming... we have taken a decision to give 5G spectrum for trials to all the players,"" said Prasad.
This comes as a welcome relief to Huawei, which has been facing global scrutiny over network security concerns. The US has claimed that Huwaei’s 5G equipment could be used by China to spy on other countries, an allegation the company has repeatedly denied.
The approval for conducting 5G trials does not, however, automatically imply that Huawei’s equipment will be cleared for a commercial rollout in the country.
The department of telecommunications (DoT) will meet all telecom equipment vendors on Tuesday to discuss the timeline and other procedures to start trials. DoT will allocate the trial spectrum to its licensees, which are telecom service providers such as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd that can then choose to partner with vendors such as Nokia, Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung.
Huwaei welcomed the government’s decision. “We have full confidence in the Indian government and industry to partner with the best technology for India’s own long-term benefit and also for cross-industry development. Huawei is always committed to India,"" said Jay Chen, chief executive of Huawei India.
Earlier this month, DoT approved prices for the next spectrum auction that will happen by April. Of the 8,300 MHz of airwaves the government plans to offer, 6,050 MHz have been allocated for 5G services.
India is a crucial market for Huawei, where it has deployed 4G networks for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. Huawei had in September said banning the company in India would delay the rollout of 5G services by two-three years.
India’s decision to let Huawei take part in 5G trials comes at a time when the company is battling intense pressure from the US. Australia and Japan have also barred Huawei, while Canada and New Zealand are likely to follow suit. Many countries in Europe are yet to take a decision, while Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have welcomed Huawei.
“Whether it is Huawei or Ericsson or any other company, India needs to build a system, which can detect any malware and not depend on the brand of a company or a country,"" said Vimal Wakhlu, a former chairman of Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd. “Any country is capable of snooping on us. The reason some people have been advocating a ban on Huawei is that if it is barred, the market for equipment becomes slightly less competitive and hence it can be sold at higher prices.""
In June, Huawei said it was willing to sign a “no back-door"" pact with the Indian government to assuage potential security concerns.
A “back door"" is a point of access in a network/equipment that guarantees entry into the network/equipment in exceptional circumstances."
4,2019-12-31,Airtel,"Tariff increases will bring the telecom industry’s revenues back on the growth pathThe firms will be better able to invest in 4G networks, and their ability to service debt will improve

The government’s bid to repair the telecom sector has brought much required reprieve for investors. Shares of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Reliance Industries Ltd, the parent of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, have gained 37-47% so far in 2019.
After years of declining revenue, the industry is set to grow this fiscal year. As tariff hikes take full effect, analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd expected revenue growth to accelerate to 25% in FY21. That is a remarkable change for an industry, wherein revenue was estimated to have fallen by about 11% in both FY19 and FY18.
Ratings agency Crisil said the industry’s average revenue per user (Arpu) may expand one-fourth from around  ₹116 in FY19 to  ₹145 next fiscal year. “With 25% growth in blended Arpu expected, Ebitda could double in fiscal 2021 to about  ₹60,570 crore from  ₹29,450 crore last fiscal,"" Crisil said in a note. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.
Undoubtedly, the incremental revenue will go a long way in easing the financial stress at Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd. The companies will be able to invest better in 4G networks and their ability to service debt will improve.
But everything is not as smooth as it seems.
Days after announcing price hikes earlier this month, telcos launched lower-priced monthly packs and reintroduced unlimited voice calls. This reflects that telcos are concerned about demand elasticity. Telcos continue to tweak the tariffs. On Sunday, Bharti Airtel raised the minimum monthly recharge for prepaid users.
Many expect the tariff hikes to trigger recalibration of customer spends on telecom services, through Sim card consolidation and shift to lower-priced packs. This can lower the revenue benefits from tariff hikes to some extent.
Further, industry leader Reliance Jio continues to price its services at a notable discount when compared to Airtel and Vodafone Idea. This indicates Jio’s unwavering focus on market share gains.
Airtel and Vodafone Idea also have an unenviable task of finding a way to clear the liabilities arising from the Supreme Court verdict on licence and spectrum fee due.
If Airtel has to borrow to clear its dues, then the company’s debt could rise by as much as 25%, calculations by Moody’s Investors Service showed.
The situation is precarious for Vodafone Idea, which is seeing operating losses and lagging behind in 4G network investments. Even after the cash flow relief from recent tariff hikes, analysts said, Vodafone Idea will have to infuse equity to remain solvent, especially if the government does not provide relief on the dues. With Airtel moving to raise fresh funds, all eyes will now be on Vodafone Idea."

1,2019-12-31,Airtel,"India’s decision to let Huawei take part in 5G trials comes at a time when the company is battling intense pressure from USDoT will allocate the trial spectrum to its licensees, which are telecom service providers

New Delhi: All major telecom operators and equipment vendors on Tuesday met top officials of Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to discuss roadmap for 5G trials in the country.
The meeting was chaired by telecom secretary Anshu Prakash and was attended by senior representatives of Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea, Reliance Jio and all equipment vendors, including Huawei.
“Broad roadmap for the trials was discussed. The DoT is expected to allot spectrum soon and trials are expected to start in January-March quarter,"" a person aware of the matter said requesting anonymity.
A Huawei representative who attended the meeting declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion.
This comes a day after the government said it has allowed all applicants, including China’s Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd, to participate in 5G trials, telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said on Monday.
“The age of 5G is coming... we have taken a decision to give 5G spectrum for trials to all the players,"" said Prasad on Monday.
This has come as a welcome relief to Huawei, which has been facing global scrutiny over network security concerns. The US has claimed that Huwaei’s 5G equipment could be used by China to spy on other countries, an allegation the company has repeatedly denied.
The approval for conducting 5G trials does not, however, automatically imply that Huawei’s equipment will be cleared for a commercial rollout in the country.
The DoT will allocate the trial spectrum to its licensees, which are telecom service providers such as Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd that can then choose to partner with vendors such as Nokia, Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung.
Huwaei has welcomed the government’s decision. “We have full confidence in the Indian government and industry to partner with the best technology for India’s own long-term benefit and also for cross-industry development. Huawei is always committed to India,"" said Jay Chen, chief executive of Huawei India.
Earlier this month, DoT approved prices for the next spectrum auction that will happen by April. Of the 8,300 MHz of airwaves the government plans to offer, 6,050 MHz have been allocated for 5G services.
India is a crucial market for Huawei, where it has deployed 4G networks for Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea. Huawei had in September said banning the company in India would delay the rollout of 5G services by two-three years.
India’s decision to let Huawei take part in 5G trials comes at a time when the company is battling intense pressure from the US. Australia and Japan have also barred Huawei, while Canada and New Zealand are likely to follow suit. Many countries in Europe are yet to take a decision, while Russia, Indonesia, Malaysia, South Korea, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have welcomed Huawei."
0,2019-12-31,Airtel,"After getting trial spectrum, telcos can choose their vendor partners like Nokia, Ericsson or HuaweiThis has come as relief for Huawei, which was under scrutiny for network security concerns

NEW DELHI :
The telecom department has initiated the process of rolling out 5G networks in the country, with telecom operators set to begin testing the technology later this month.
All major telecom operators and equipment vendors on Tuesday met top officials of the department of telecommunications (DoT) to discuss the roadmap for trials. The meeting, chaired by telecom secretary Anshu Prakash, was attended by senior representatives of Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Idea Ltd, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and all equipment vendors, including Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.
“The broad roadmap for the trials was discussed. DoT is expected to allot spectrum in a few days and trials will happen in January-March,"" said a person aware of the matter, seeking anonymity.
An email query sent to DoT was unanswered till press time. A Huawei representative who attended the meeting declined to comment on the specifics of the discussion.
The meeting with telecom companies happened a day after the government said it has allowed all applicants, including China’s Huawei, to participate in 5G trials.
The DoT will allocate the trial spectrum to its licencees, which are telecom service providers, who can then choose to partner with vendors such as Nokia, Huawei, Ericsson and Samsung.
This has come as relief for Huawei, which has been facing global scrutiny over network security concerns. The US has claimed that Huwaei’s 5G equipment could be used by China to spy on other countries, an allegation the company has denied.
The approval for conducting 5G trials does not, however, automatically imply that Huawei’s equipment will be cleared for a commercial rollout in India.
In June 2019, DoT approved a one-year 5G trial period and a one-time fee of  ₹5,000 for entities seeking experimental spectrum to conduct trials. The government also announced its intention to focus on three big social sectors for deployment of 5G—education, agriculture and healthcare. However, building use-cases in these sectors is still a work in progress. “So far, six proposals have been received, which includes those from China’s ZTE and Huawei. Any field trial in respect of 5G is to be carried out only through licensed telecom service providers in a restrictive, limited geographical area and for specific use case,"" telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told the Lok Sabha on 26 June.
Earlier this month, DoT approved prices for the next spectrum auction that will happen by April. Of the 8,300MHz of airwaves the government plans to offer, 6,050MHz have been allocated for 5G. The 3,300-3,600MHz band allocated for 5G has been priced at  ₹492 crore per megahertz.
5G is the next generation of wireless technology and will boost data speeds and propel the Internet of Things, with the potential to bring radical changes in agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare and education.
India’s 5G trials and commercial rollout are far behind global peers, which have even deployed commercial networks.
South Korea was the first to commercially start 5G services in April. China’s state-run telecom operators China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom rolled out 5G services in November to consumers in 50 Chinese cities, including Beijing and Shanghai.
US’s Verizon Communications Inc. kickstarted 5G services in October 2018 in Houston, Indianapolis, Los Angeles and Sacramento, using non-standard gear."
