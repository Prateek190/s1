49,2018-01-29,Cipla,"Cipla and Strides Shasun unit receive final approval from USFDA for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in adults

New Delhi: Cipla Ltd and a unit of Strides Shasun Ltd have received final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration Drug (USFDA) for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in adults. 
New Delhi: Cipla Ltd and a unit of Strides Shasun Ltd have received final approval from the US Food and Drug Administration Drug (USFDA) for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, used for the treatment of HIV-1 infections in adults.
The tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets, 300 mg, are generic equivalents of Gilead Sciences’ Viread Tablets, 300 mg, the companies said in their separate BSE filings.
Strides Shasun, which already had tentative approval for the product from the USFDA, said it will launch the product immediately. Citing IMS sales data, the company said the US market for tenofovir disoproxil fumarate tablets is approximately $750 million.
Cipla said the product is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment of HIV -1 infection in adults and paediatric patients 12 years of age and older.
At 11.56am, Cipla shares traded 0.19% down at Rs620.15 on BSE, while Strides Shasun shares rose 2.40% to Rs809.95. The BSE Sensex rose 0.93% to 36,386.12 points."

Bengaluru: Cipla Ltd, India’s fourth-largest drugmaker by revenue, said third-quarter net profit rose 7% on strong domestic sales, but fell short of analysts’ estimates. 
Bengaluru: Cipla Ltd, India’s fourth-largest drugmaker by revenue, said third-quarter net profit rose 7% on strong domestic sales, but fell short of analysts’ estimates.
Net profit attributable to shareholders climbed to Rs401 crore ($62.54 million) in the quarter ended on 31 December, from Rs375 crore a year earlier. 
That compared with an average estimate of Rs444 crore in profit drawn from 18 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
Including a one-off positive impact of Rs107 crore due to recalculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities on account of the tax reforms in the United States, profit rose about 25% from a year earlier, the company said.
Revenue from India, its biggest market, rose 15% to Rs1,601 crore. Domestic revenue accounted for more than a third of the total revenue, which rose 7% to Rs3,914 crore.
Revenue from North America fell 2% due to ongoing pricing pressures in the generics market because of increased competition.

46,2018-02-08,Cipla,"Cipla will use its research budget (expensed in the profit and loss account) for its generic products and use acquisitions to take forward its ambitions in the specialty product space

The US pharmaceutical market is proving to be a trying one for Indian generic pharmaceutical firms. While Cipla Ltd can’t say it was an exception, it is relatively better off than some of its peers. But the pricing pressure in the US market has led to Cipla adjusting its research spending pattern. It will use its research budget (expensed in the profit and loss account) for its generic products and use acquisitions to take forward its ambitions in the speciality product space. 
The US pharmaceutical market is proving to be a trying one for Indian generic pharmaceutical firms. While Cipla Ltd can’t say it was an exception, it is relatively better off than some of its peers. But the pricing pressure in the US market has led to Cipla adjusting its research spending pattern. It will use its research budget (expensed in the profit and loss account) for its generic products and use acquisitions to take forward its ambitions in the speciality product space.
That shift is a nod to the fact that a slower-than-expected US market sales growth could lead to research as a proportion of sales to increase faster. While this separation may help R&D as a percentage of sales to remain in check, the capital required (debt or equity) will put pressure on other parts of its profit and loss account, such as amortization or interest costs. But by focusing on late-stage candidates for acquisition, Cipla hopes to improve the odds of the product reaching market.
The company’s US market sales grew by 2% to $100 million over a year ago and rose by 5% sequentially. This was despite new launches in the quarter and price erosion in other products pulling down growth. If its new products continue to ramp-up and it succeeds in getting some more key approvals, growth could improve. In India, sales recovered as the market returned to normalcy post-GST (goods and services tax) roll-out. Sales growth in South Africa was healthy too.
Although Cipla’s overall sales grew by a relatively low 7.6%—10% adjusting for accounting effects of GST in India—it managed to do well on other fronts. Its gross profit margin (gross profit represents what is left over after deducting material costs from sales) improved, both over a year ago and sequentially. The company said a better product mix and favourable geographic share helped. It cautioned this could dip in the fourth quarter by a bit. It also kept employee costs and other expenses in check. As a result, its operating profit rose by 20.8% over a year ago.
While Cipla’s relatively low sales growth is a dampener, the good showing on other fronts should comfort investors. However, it had to write down part of its acquisition of InvaGen, which cut into its net profit, and it rose by a mere 4.8% over a year ago. The company’s US business remains the key factor to watch, with a number of products in the pipeline.
That Cipla does not have any regulatory issues at its plants is a significant differentiator, as there are no impediments to launching these products once it gets approval. Investors should watch for how its sales growth trend improves in the next few quarters, product approvals and acquisitions for its speciality pipeline."

40,2018-05-23,Cipla,"The US generics pain is unlikely to subside anytime soon despite optimistic commentary from Cipla due to the growing number of USFDA approvals

In line with its peers, Cipla Ltd’s shares have underperformed the benchmark indices over the last one year. From the looks of it, the March quarter (Q4 FY18) results provide no major reason to reverse this trend. Revenues expanded by a lacklustre 5% and gross margin narrowed both from a year ago and from the preceding quarter. 
In line with its peers, Cipla Ltd’s shares have underperformed the benchmark indices over the last one year. From the looks of it, the March quarter (Q4 FY18) results provide no major reason to reverse this trend. Revenues expanded by a lacklustre 5% and gross margin narrowed both from a year ago and from the preceding quarter.
Performance in the US business was not as strong as the management’s projections. Revenues from the US market stood at $105 million (up 8% year-on-year), not significantly higher than the $100 million revenue the company clocked in the December quarter. Product recall and supply issues impacted sales in the US (to the tune of $5 million). Also according to Purvi Shah, an analyst at Sharekhan Ltd, pricing pressure hurt performance. Revenues in the sub-Saharan Africa lagged and emerging markets remained flat.
On the positive side, the management guided for a double-digit growth in the India business in fiscal year 2019 (FY19). This business, which generates 39% of Cipla’s revenues, grew 6% in FY18. The drug maker expects the in-licensing deals with innovator companies, focus on certain therapeutic segments and sales force productivity optimization measures to aid growth in India.
Answering an analyst’s question, the management also alluded to double-digit revenue growth in the US in FY19, helped by the ramp-up of recent product launches. Further, the management guided for a strong product pipeline, indicating one new limited competition product launch every quarter.
The commentary should keep growth hopes alive. But more clarity on the quantum of the growth pickup and profitability level will be needed to gauge the earnings trajectory. As of now, this remains hazy.
Sales in the US will remain subdued in the current quarter also, as supply issues are expected to be resolved only by the end of this month. Also, price erosion in the US generics market remains an issue. 
“The US generics pain is unlikely to subside anytime soon despite optimistic commentary from the management due to the growing number of USFDA approvals,"" ICICI Securities Ltd said in an industry report, adding: “The approval momentum has gone up from ~500 (average of FY12-17) to ~780 for FY18. This will further erode base business growth of existing players."" USFDA stands for the US Food and Drug Administration.
Also, given the focus on new product launches and the development of the product pipeline, analysts are sceptical if Cipla will be able to contain costs and maintain profitability. The company’s management aims to cap research expenses as a percentage of sales at current levels. It expects incremental revenues to be sufficient to cover expenses.
Much depends on how the optimistic management commentary translates into revenues and earnings for Cipla. The coming two quarterly results will be a test."

36,2018-08-09,Cipla,"Cipla's success in getting new approvals does lend confidence to its view that US sales will ramp up

Cipla Ltd’s June quarter results show that its India business is on a sound footing. How an increase in costs plays out and the extent to which US sales growth improves are the uncertainties that will play a key role in determining how it does in the rest of FY19. 
Cipla Ltd’s June quarter results show that its India business is on a sound footing. How an increase in costs plays out and the extent to which US sales growth improves are the uncertainties that will play a key role in determining how it does in the rest of FY19.
The company’s India business saw sales grow by 21.6% from a year ago, partly due to a low base. Growth will taper a bit in the September quarter and should then stabilize at normal growth rates. However, its US business growth slowed down despite launches of products with good potential. It will take some time for sales from new products to ramp up. Meanwhile, discontinuation of some lower-margin products has affected sales growth. Supply constraints also affected sales. While these were expected, the transition to selling products directly and ramp-up of sales from new products may see these gaps continue for some time. Cipla’s success in getting new approvals does lend confidence to its view that US sales will ramp up.
When that happens, gross margins should also benefit. The June quarter saw sales grow by 12% but input costs rose by 21%. The company said higher costs of sourcing inputs from China, higher commodity costs (such as crude oil) and change in inventory contributed to this decline. While the inventory element is an accounting figure, the spike in costs could continue. Tiding over that depends on the product mix improving, so that sales of more profitable products absorb cost increases. A higher-margin product mix depends on the US market to a large extent.
In Africa, Cipla saw good growth during the quarter, and a launch of a biosimilar product is scheduled for the second quarter. Its acquisition of an over-the-counter should add to revenue growth.
While its input costs increased, Cipla’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin remained stable and increased by 10 basis points from a year ago. Its net profit for the quarter rose by 4.9% from a year ago.
What can we expect going ahead? The supply constraints in the US market have ended, so growth should recover to that extent. While a ramp-up of sales from new products will add to sales, rationalization may still hold back sales growth in FY19. However, as the contribution of new products increase, Cipla’s gross margin should benefit.
The company has also adopted a model of licensing products such as biosimilars, to sell in India and other markets. These should also begin to add to revenues and margins eventually. If input costs keep increasing, that’s a risk to watch for. Cipla’s shares are up by 7% in the past three months and were up by 0.8% on Wednesday, after its results were announced."
35,2018-11-05,Cipla,"Cipla's Q2 profit falls to ₹377 crore in the quarter ended September 30, lower than ₹423 crore a year ago, and analysts average expectation of ₹456 crore

Cipla Ltd, India’s second-largest drugmaker by market capitalisation, warned on Monday of “multiple headwinds"" in the second half of the financial year after its quarterly profit fell short of analysts’ estimates. Shares of the company declined as much as 7.7 percent, in their sharpest intraday drop since November 2017. The upcoming challenges include capacity balancing in certain categories at plants and sanctions, Cipla said in a post-earnings presentation without elaborating.

The upcoming challenges include capacity balancing in certain categories at plants and sanctions, Cipla said in a post-earnings presentation without elaborating.
Higher crude and commodity prices, and rising supplies sourced from China will also pose challenges in the next two quarters, the company added.
Indian pharmaceutical companies had been hit by weak sales in the United States as regulatory bans and warnings over quality control violations at production plants weighed on their profitability. Although pricing pressure remains in the United States, Cipla’s North America business grew 23 percent in the September quarter.
The company’s second-quarter profit fell nearly 11 percent from a year earlier to  ₹ 377 crore as sales slowed in markets such as India and parts of Africa.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of  ₹ 456 crore for the quarter ended Sept. 30, according to Refinitiv data.
Sales in India were flat, while those in South Africa fell about 3 percent, Cipla said. Total net sales declined 1 percent to  ₹ 3,948 crore."
34,2018-11-07,Cipla,"Cipla said it lost some revenues to supply-related issues, costing it revenues close to 100 crore in the quarter

Cipla Ltd’s investors were unprepared for its results. The pharmaceutical company reported a 16.1% decline in profit in the September quarter to  ₹ 366 crore from a year ago (18% decline sequentially). If that was not bad enough, the management said profits may remain at these levels in remaining two quarters of FY19. 
Cipla Ltd’s investors were unprepared for its results. The pharmaceutical company reported a 16.1% decline in profit in the September quarter to  ₹ 366 crore from a year ago (18% decline sequentially). If that was not bad enough, the management said profits may remain at these levels in remaining two quarters of FY19.
While that prepares investors for what lies ahead, the company’s shares took the inevitable beating, as the Street recalibrated earnings’ forecasts. Its shares have fallen by 12% this week after the results, compared to Friday’s close.
Cipla’s domestic sales declined by 1% from a year ago, partly due to a higher base, due to restocking after the goods and services tax roll-out in July 2017. This high base effect will be visible to some extent in the current quarter too. A late start to the season for anti-infectives also affected growth, with sales picking up only in September. That may mean December quarter sales could look better. India contributes two-fifths of revenue.
Now, North America contributes to a fifth of revenue but is crucial for growth and profitability, making it a focus area. The US did relatively well with sales rising by 12% from a year ago. It could have done better but its business-to-business segment (where it partners with a third party) did not do as well. Price erosion affected sales growth. But the direct business (where Cipla sells by itself) did well and aided growth. The direct business is expected to do well, with launches supporting growth.
The company’s Global Access segment saw a slump in its tender business across markets (supplies to global public health programmes) due to funding-related issues. This affected growth during the quarter.
Cipla said it also lost some revenues to supply-related issues, costing it revenues close to  ₹ 100 crore in the quarter. What’s worse, these were of products that were relatively high margin, meaning profitability took a worse hit than sales did. This too could take a quarter or two to resolve. While the company did not give details, it said the bottleneck was due to changes being made for better growth in future.
While overall revenue declined by 1%, mainly held up by the US business, the company’s cost of materials declined by 9% and gross margins improved as a result. Product mix was the main reason, as higher contribution from US sales and lesser from the low-margin tender business would be the main reasons. But employee costs rose and so did other expenses, as Cipla pushed ahead with costs related to marketing, and research and development.
The company also said that while rupee depreciation gave some benefit, it was not much and was offset by higher input and fuel costs. That’s why its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin declined by 2.2 percentage points over a year ago and by 93 basis points sequentially. The management added that adjusting for some items, margins rose sequentially.
While some of Cipla’s problems appear temporary such as the high base effect in India and the supply chain issue, others such as the lull in the tender business are uncertain. Even when temporary, resolution could take longer than expected. Meanwhile, fixed costs need to be serviced. A new worry could be the impact of US sanctions on countries where the company generates revenue. All these reasons are, perhaps, why the management may have guided for flat profits. Investors may think the warning came too late but at least next time they won’t be caught napping."

New Delhi: Mumbai-based food startup Drums Food International that sells the popular brand of Epigamia yogurts has raised  ₹ 182 crore in a Series C round of funding from Danone Manifesto Ventures, the investment arm of the French dairy major, and other existing investors, the company said in an announcement on Wednesday.
The investment was led by Drum’s existing investor—Belgium-based consumer investment firm Verlinvest along with Singapore-based fund DSG Consumer Partners, Temasek-backed InnoVen Capital, and Cipla’s Samina Vaziralli. The funding in Drums—that sells artisanal greek yogurt, mishti doi, and packaged smoothies in over 10,000 stores in India—marks a growing investor appetite in new-age startups that are capitalising on the consumer shift to on-the-go and fresh foods. 
The investment also marks the first such Asia-focused funding for Danone that exited its dairy business in India in January last year in a bid to build a bigger portfolio of nutritional products here. Epigamia’s products, said Laurent Marcel, director, Danone Manifesto Ventures, “appeal to the ever-growing number of Indian consumers looking for healthier options."" 
Meanwhile, Drums Food, will now use the money to fund its expansion.
Over the next two years, the company plans to ramp up distribution to 50,000 outlets in over 25 cities, Rohan Mirchandani, the company’s co-founder and chief executive officer told Mint. Mirchandani said the company is also exploring manufacturing tie-ups in southern India as it plans to expand beyond the top five cities that contribute to the bulk of its sales.
Going forward, however, Epigamia’s product portfolio could vary from the existing yogurt and smoothies it sells. Mirchandani indicated that the company could launch plant-based beverages in the future.
Drums Food was founded in 2008 by former Wharton alumni Rohan Mirchandani, chef Ganesh Krishnamurthy, Rahul Jain, and Uday Thakkar."

31,2019-02-06,Cipla,"Price erosion because of increased competition in US hastens firms’ push towards specialty medicinesSun Pharmaceuticals is of the view that specialty medicines will drive medicine spending in the coming years

NEW DELHI :
Indian drug makers are shifting focus from their once lucrative generics medicines to specialty drugs amid continued price erosion in its biggest market, the US.
The focus on specialty medicines has been accelerated by measures taken by the Food and Drug Administration of the US (US FDA) to increase competition in generic medicines to bring down prices, experts said. Specialty drugs are high value prescription medications used to treat complex, chronic conditions such as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and multiple sclerosis.
The price erosion, caused by increased competition and channel consolidation in the US, has put pressure on Indian generic drug companies over the past few years to look at newer avenues, the experts said.
“With increased competition, price erosion and decline of Para 4 opportunities (patent challenges by generic drug makers) in the US market, leading Indian generics (companies) have been trying to plot a specialty play for the past couple of years,"" said Sujay Shetty, pharma practice leader for India and Asia Pacific at PwC.
“The journey is difficult as the dollar spends and the capabilities from R&D to marketing are of a much higher magnitude than the conventional oral solid dosage (OSD) type products. For Indian companies this is a must-win battle as we look at 2020 and beyond.""
India’s largest drug maker Sun Pharmaceuticals Ltd is of the view that specialty medicines will drive medicine spending in the coming years.
“The share of specialty medicines in global spending in 2017 stood at 32%, up from 19% in 2007. In the US and EU5 markets(Germany, France, Italy, UK, and Spain), the contribution of specialty medicines to overall pharmaceutical spending has almost doubled over the preceding 10 years. This trend is likely to continue,"" a company spokesperson said.
Sun Pharma has a portfolio of around 10 specialty products, of which seven have already been commercialized. Indian firms have been working to create a pipeline of specialty drugs, innovative products and biosimilars by increasing investments in research and development through acquisitions.
“We have accelerated our innovation-led journey with key specialty investments in the US, where our aim is to satisfy unmet needs of patients and healthcare providers in the areas of movement disorders and the central nervous system (CNS), lung delivery of medicines (inhalation therapies), and respiratory illnesses besides hospital and institutionally administered products,"" said Umang Vohra, managing director and global chief executive officer, Cipla.
Several other institutional assets of Cipla are under late-stage evaluation as the company explores acquisition and in-licensing, said Vohra. “These moves are in keeping with our stated intention to build a specialty pipeline in the US market and reinforce Cipla’s innovation-led approach and commitment to caring for the life of patients,"" he said.
Glenmark also started building a pipeline of specialty products a few years ago.
A new drug application for the first specialty product from the company’s organic pipeline, Ryaltris, a treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, has been filed with the FDA and the product is likely to be launched in the first quarter of FY20.
Glenmark has signed pacts to commercialize Ryaltris in Australia and New Zealand with Seqirus and in South Korea with Yuhan Corp.
The pharma major has two other organically developed products in the pipeline, a biosimilar of Xolair (used to treat asthma) and a nebulised formulation of tiotropium (used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).
“The specialty products’ space is very exciting and offers significant opportunities. Respiratory and dermatology are Glenmark’s stronghold and we are leveraging the capabilities in these therapy areas to build our specialty business in the US. We expect to launch our first specialty product Ryaltris in the US in FY20. We continue to invest in enhancing our pipeline and expect the specialty business to start contributing meaningfully to our US revenue in the next 2-5 years,"" said Glenn Saldanha, chairman and managing director of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals."

Cipla Ltd, India's second-largest generic drugmaker by market capitalisation, reported on Wednesday a 17.1% drop in quarterly profit, dragged down by higher tax expenses and weak sales in domestic market.
Net profit came in at 3.32 billion rupees ($46.36 million), compared with a profit of 4.01 billion rupees last year.
Twenty analysts had expected the generic drugmaker to post a profit of 3.72 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Cipla, in its last quarterly earnings in November, had warned of headwinds in the second half of the financial year.
The upcoming challenges include capacity balancing in certain categories at plants, sanctions, higher crude and commodity prices, Cipla had stated earlier.
During the third quarter, the company reported a total tax expense of 1.26 billion rupees, against a tax credit of 642.3 million rupees last year.
India sales, which accounted for nearly 40% of the total, declined 1% to 15.85 billion rupees, Cipla said.
However, net sales rose 1.9%to 39.06 billion rupees, while North America sales surged 31% to 8.49 billion rupees.
Shares in Cipla closed 5.3%  firmer on Wednesday after the results were announced in a Mumbai market, which ended 1.17% higher.

29,2019-02-12,Cipla,"Cipla shares have gained thanks to guidance of a strengthening in the US business and a rebound in Indian revenueCipla expects the positive momentum to continue in the US, helped by ramp-up of new products

Cipla Ltd’s shares have gained 7% since it announced disappointing December quarter (Q3)results last week. What gives? The stock gained thanks to the firm’s guidance of a strengthening in the US business and a rebound in Indian revenue.
Last quarter, the drag from the India business and other non-US markets resulted in a mere 2% growth in revenue and a 12% drop in operating profit. Revenue in India, which contributes 40% of Cipla’s revenue, dropped 1%. Business in South Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, which generates a fifth of the revenue, decelerated (down 11%). The company had to take price cuts to clear inventories in certain markets. This impacted profitability.
A 31% growth in the North American business came as a pleasant surprise and helped offset some of this. Cipla expects the positive momentum to continue in the US, helped by ramp-up of new products. The management maintained its guidance of one limited-competition product launch per quarter in the US. Coupled with commentary of a rebound in the India business, the shares have traded higher.
The company’s shares now seem priced for perfection. “Cipla is now trading at a 19 times FY21 price-earnings ratio, leaving no room for error. Execution for the company has been mixed. While US sales have seen pickup, it has been below expectation and failed to drive margin improvement,"" analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note. “We expect the US ramp-up to be gradual and margin improvement to be below expectations.""
Further, the business in Africa is expected to continue to face pricing pressures. Price erosion in the tender business is weighing on realizations. As such, growth at the company level may as well be unexciting in the near term.
Revenue so far in FY19 is up just 4%. Operating profit and net profit are down 3-6%. As an analyst with a domestic broking firm points out, the performance leaves much to be desired, especially in the backdrop of premium valuations. The US business may be gaining momentum. But as the analyst cited above says, what it lacks is a major drug launch that can drive disproportionate growth in the near term.
Further, given the cost pressures and concerns about profitability, most analysts see limited scope for earnings acceleration at Cipla."

NEW DELHI :
Drug major Cipla Monday said it has inked a pact with Pulmatrix Inc to co-develop a formulation for the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with asthma.
Cipla Technologies LLC, a subsidiary of the company, and Pulmatrix Inc have inked definitive agreement for the co-development and commercialisation of Pulmazole, the Mumbai-based firm said in a regulatory filing.
Pulmazole an inhaled iSPERSE formulation of the antifungal drug itraconazole for the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) in patients with asthma, it added.
As per the pact, Cipla Technologies will make an upfront payment of $22 million to Pulmatrix in exchange for assignment of all rights for Pulmazole in relation to pulmonary indications.
Thereafter, both parties will equally share costs related to the future development and commercialisation of Pulmazole, and equally share worldwide free cash flow from future sales of Pulmazole, the statement said.

New Delhi: Drug major Dr Reddy's Laboratories is recalling 33,958 bottles of Divalproex Sodium Extended-Release tablets, used to treat seizure disorders, from the American market, as per a report by the US health regulator.
Besides, InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc, a subsidiary of Mumbai-based drug maker Cipla, is recalling over 7.8 lakh vials of Testosterone Cypionate injection, used to treat low testosterone levels in men.
Dr Reddy's Laboratories Inc, a subsidiary of the Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories, is voluntarily recalling the affected lot of bottles on account of certain deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations.
As per the latest enforcement report by the US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA), the firm is recalling the product as it has been exposed to above 50 per cent relative humidity levels during packaging operations.
The product was supplied to major distributors and retailers who may have further distributed the product throughout the US, the report added.
Meanwhile, InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc is recalling its product in various strengths due to the ""presence of particulate matter"", the report said.
The vials were manufactured by Cipla at its Verna facility in Goa for Cipla USA Inc.

25,2019-05-07,Cipla,"A higher market share coupled with cost-control measures should help Indian firms recoup some of the lost groundThe rise in market share coincides with the change in the competitive landscape in the US drug market

An analysis of pharmaceutical sales trends in the US by Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd shows Indian companies are gaining share in the world’s largest drug market.
The share of Indian companies in total generic prescriptions rose to 45% in the March quarter of this year, compared to 35% at the end of 2017, shows an analysis of the sales data from IQVIA by Nomura. IQVIA is an information and services provider in the healthcare sector.
The rise in market share coincides with the change in the competitive landscape in the US drug market. Consolidation of the market at the purchasers’ end and heightened competition have eroded prices. This crimped prices, impacting the earnings of the generic drugs providers. As a consequence, several market participants, including large drug makers, recalibrated the product portfolios and exited less profitable drugs.
This is yielding ground to Indian drug companies. “Over the years, Indian companies have been gaining market share in US generics. But the pace of gain has increased significantly starting early 2018 when Teva, the largest generic player, decided to exit certain non-profitable products,"" Nomura said in a note.
The churn is reducing pricing pressure, bringing stability to the generic drug business, added Nomura. The findings corroborate pharmaceutical firms’ commentaries that price erosion in the US generic drug market is reaching a tipping point. “The US generics scenario is slowly but surely improving as highlighted by the managements of most Indian companies in the recent conference calls,"" ICICI Securities Ltd said in a note last month.
But also note that much of the incremental growth in sales has come from new products for most companies. However, given recent challenges some firms have faced in the ramp-up of new products, sustainability remains a question mark. “The contribution of new launches (products launched over the past two years) to US revenue was the most for Lupin, Cadila and Cipla. However, these products’ specific opportunities may not be sustainable over the long-term, in our view,"" added Nomura.
Also the gains in the market share should percolate into earnings. Indian companies are gaining share in the low-price market. Besides, a rise in raw material costs and compliance costs have impacted profitability of Indian drug companies. Higher market share coupled with cost-control measures should help Indian companies recoup some of the lost ground. How well the companies deliver on this will determine earnings benefits and stock returns."
23,2019-05-22,Cipla,"The beat was driven by its US business, where revenues jumped 41% from a year ago, due to new product launchesWhat’s more, margins hit a multi-quarter high as limited competition drug launches in the US boosted profitability

Cipla Ltd has exited FY19 on a positive note, after hitting unexpected bumps in the earlier part of the year. Revenues in the March quarter grew 19%, ahead of the Street’s estimates. The beat was driven by its US business, where revenues jumped 41% from a year ago, as the company benefited from new product launches. Cipla derives only one-fifth of its revenues from the US. Overall growth was supported by a return to growth for the India business.
Revenues in India grew by a respectable 11%, after decelerating for two consecutive quarters. Around 38% of its revenues are derived from India. So even as business in South Africa and emerging markets lagged the strong performance in India and the US, Cipla comfortably beat analysts’ estimates.
What’s more, margins hit a multi-quarter high as limited competition drug launches in the US boosted profitability.
Despite the positive news, the Cipla stock ended about 1% lower on Wednesday. “The stock had already priced in a positive set of numbers,"" said an analyst. Year till date, it has risen 6.5%, compared to a 4% drop in the Nifty Pharma index. Note that Cipla’s results come on the back of a below-par performance by larger peers Lupin Ltd and Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd in the key markets of US and India. As such, the outperformance in the Cipla stock looks justified.
The company is fairly confident about sustaining the growth momentum in FY20. In India, it expects to grow faster than the 8-10% market growth. Scale-up of new products and a healthy product pipeline is expected to result in another year of double-digit revenue growth in the US. On the flip side, the company continues to face challenges in the tender and Middle East businesses.
Of course, for a stock trading at about 22 times one-year forward earnings, it will also be crucial to see how strong and profitable this growth is going to be. “For a company with a strong footing in the domestic market, just beating industry growth is not a big feat,"" said an analyst at a domestic broking firm.
The last two years have been difficult for Indian pharma due to changes in tax policy (goods and services tax) and weak demand. While inventories in the prescription drug business are showing signs of stabilization, the generic drug business continues to see destocking. Whether a sustainable growth rate emerges in FY20 remains to be seen.
Second, even though the company has a healthy product pipeline for the US, it is seeing competition from innovator and generic firms. Cipla has the cost advantage, but how well the competition reacts to its pricing will also determine earnings benefits."

NEW DELHI :
Global film celebrity Priyanka Chopra landed in a soup after her pictures of her smoking on a yacht in Miami went viral.Users on micro-blogging site Twitter trolled the 37-year old actor for picture especially as she had run awareness campaign for a cracker-free Diwali last year and revealed that she was asthmatic. She had paired up with Cipla for the video ad which shows her living a full life despite having asthma.
Social media experts believe celebrities have to deal with both the positive and negative effects of being active and open on social media platforms. Chopra has recently been featured in the Instagram Rich List 2019 along with cricketer Virat Kohli for making advertising money through posts on the photo-sharing app.
According to Sagar Patil, associate media director- digital, Carat India, a Dentsu Aegis Network owned media agency, people are heavily influenced by celebrities on social media as they feel they are part of their lives, hence reactions are strong whether positive or negative.
“It puts Priyanka in a bad spot for obvious reasons, she being associated with the UN, represents India on a global platform and endorses brand like Cipla. People will feel manipulated and would carry negative sentiment towards Priyanka and the brand as well.
This needs to tackle this immediately to ensure damage control,"" he said.
Apart from the picture of Priyanka smoking, fans dug out an old tweet from 2010 where Chopra had said, ""Smoking is awful!!! Yuck!!!"" and it took few minutes for that tweet to go viral as well.
“Repeating the same judgmental error makes the celeb a focal point for trolling and over time it could impact their brand value,"" noted advertising and tech industry old hand Ajit Narayan.
According to him, Chopra unfortunately has been caught talking opposites more than once and that too on the same issue. “On the brand value, it will erode if Cipla now acts on it and does something about it,"" said Narayan who runs advocacy marketing platform SOCXO as chief marketing officer and program head.
The actor also attracted criticism for putting out a tweet urging fans to support Assam Floods victims and not actively donating towards the cause despite being state tourism board’s ambassador.
“The beauty of social media is that every day there is a different topic that trends and people get hooked to it forgetting about what was the conversation yesterday,"" said Carat India’s Patil.
However, Narayan think celebrities have to handle social media goof-ups smartly and quickly either by remaining quiet or letting it pass or apologizing.
“There’s always this saying that public memory is short. But I feel it is not true anymore as the internet remembers everything. And it’s becoming important to be responsible for your actions as that’s what builds your personal brand,"" he added."

Amid stifling competition in its biggest market, the US, Indian drug makers are scouting for partners in China, the world’s second largest drug market. A report by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, released on Monday, estimates more Indian companies will enter the pharma industry in China through joint ventures.
Major pharmaceutical companies in India like Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, Cipla Ltd and Sun Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd are looking at China as a big opportunity, making the market one of the focus areas for future growth.
“Indian companies are seeking partners that can make tangible business contributions, safeguard IP, ensure operational control and manage talent,"" said the report. Five joint ventures are already in place in China.
Dr Reddy’s has identified 70 products from its US portfolio that meet requirements and can obtain approval from Chinese authorities in coming years. The company is building a new plant, upgrading teams and building a pipeline for China.
Aurobindo Pharma is next in line to construct a facility in China. The company expects commercialisation of its products in the next 2-2.5 years. There is also a joint venture for inhaler products which will start operating soon.
Early in July, Cipla said it was setting up a joint venture with a Chinese pharmaceutical company to manufacture and sell drugs. They are in the process of setting up a facility in China. “The company is looking at both routes--manufacturing in India and exporting to China as well as looking at potential facilities in China--for oncology,"" the report further says.
In May, Sun Pharmaceutical said it had entered into licensing agreements with China Medical System Holdings to develop and commercialise drugs to treat psoriasis and dry eye in Greater China. According to the company, there is a strong interest in China for products which it has global rights. Alembic Pharmaceutical has also announced its interest in China.
According to the report by analyst Girish Bakhru, the recent renewed interest in China has stemmed from healthcare reforms in the country that aim to reduce drug prices and increase competition and the quality of generics.
“Given high fragmentation, complex distribution, high hospital channel share, language and cultural barriers, most Indian firms are opting for joint ventures in China. Efforts are visible across the board as companies put China as one of the focus areas for future growth,"" added the report by Bakhru.
In an announcement on Monday Strides Pharma Science Limited (Strides) said that its step down subsidiary Strides Pharma Global Pte, Singapore (SPG) has entered into a joint venture (JV) with Sun Moral International (HK) Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd (Sihuan), one of China’s leading pharmaceutical companies.
According to the statement, the JV will fast track Strides’ entry into China. “The recent regulatory developments in China has enabled fast track approvals of differentiated high-quality generics approved in key regulated markets. Strides’ specialized basket of 140+ products qualifies for the program, and this JV will be able to leverage it in China,"" said the company.
The spending on medicines in China is expected to reach $140 billion to $170 billion by 2023, reckons research firm IQVIA."

""Our business fundamentals remain strong, and our overall base business profitability was maintained at healthy levels despite the volatility,"" Vohra said.
Cipla's growth drivers remain on track with sustained expansion of its basket of biosimilars in emerging markets, entry into new markets such as China to set up respiratory franchise, and further depth in the US specialty pipeline with Zemdri, he added.
The company received EIR for the Kurkumbh plant for the inspection by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) from March 11-20, 2019, Cipla said.

18,2019-08-08,Cipla,"The deceleration in India business came as a negative surpriseRevenues in India dropped 12% as the company re-aligned its distribution channel

Shares of pharmaceutical major Cipla Ltd lost about 3% leading the losses in the NSE Nifty stocks at Wednesday noon trade. The deceleration in India business came as a negative surprise. Revenues in India, the largest business market for Cipla, dropped 12% as the company re-aligned its distribution channel.
Data from pharmaceutical market research company AIOCD Pharmasofttech AWACS Pvt. Ltd did indicate a slowdown in Indian pharmaceutical market in April-June this year. But the slowdown is more pronounced at Cipla. “India business ex one-offs growth slowed to low single digit and was the key negative,"" Piyush Nahar, analyst at Jefferies India Pvt Ltd said in a note.
Revenues from other emerging markets dropped as well. The US business made-up for the loss of momentum in India and other emerging markets. Revenues in North America jumped 61% on scale-up on limited competition drugs.
Total revenues grew 1%. Better product mix and change in accounting norms helped the company report 25% rise in operating earnings.
Kedar Upadhye, chief financial officer of Cipla says the distribution realignment will have transitory impact and the business should return to the growth path from next quarter onwards.
But slowdown in India and challenges in global tender business, from which Cipla derives notable revenues, are making investors wary.
Further as the benefit from recently launched limited competition drugs fades in the US, growth in the country is expected moderate. “While current headwinds are expected to subside in coming quarters, a new headwind in the form of declining gSensipar sales will hit in Q2. We estimate gSensipar contributed ~$35million in Q4FY19 and Q1FY20. However, this is expected to decline significantly in Q2 due to increased competition and related price erosion. We estimate Q2FY20 revenue to reset to ~ $125million (US revenues stood at $161 million in Q1) due to absence of limited competition product launches in H1. The management expects further limited competition product launches only in H2,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
The revenue moderation in the US and challenges in emerging markets can soften Cipla’s profitability in near term, analysts fear. “Q1 will, in our view, mark the near-term peak in margins and EBITDA for Cipla. Going forward, lower gSensipar sales, higher R&D and continued impact on India and emerging markets will drive lower margins,"" Jefferies adds.
The concerns are crimping near term earnings expectations, even as the management expects the company to return to the growth path before the end of this calendar year on new products and India business stabilization."

15,2019-09-30,Cipla,"The Cipla stock has tumbled 36% in the past one yearThe US FDA made some further observations on Cipla’s Goa plant, further compounding the company’s woes

Investors in Cipla Ltd’s stock have been seeing its value erode to a 52-week low from its 52-week high levels, with the stock tumbling 36% in the past one year. News that the US Food and Drug Administration has made some further observations on Cipla’s Goa plant has further compounded the company’s woes. So far today, the stock has shed 4.1% in trade.
Much of the details of these observations are yet not known. But it must be noted that the US FDA has made 12 observations for the Goa unit. Details will emerge in due course after the receipt of the Form 483. Analysts note that the severity of the issue will only be known when this filed, which will also show whether these issues are minor or major in nature.
Cipla’s Goa plant accounts for over 20% of its total US sales, and hence any serious observation could impact sales to the US. Overall, the US business accounts for about 21% of its sales. Further, US sales have risen steadily from about $100 mln in Q1FY19 to about Q1FY20 due to new launches in the US.
Hence, if the recent observations by the US Fed are serious in nature, new drug launches in the US could get impacted or delayed.
In the past, though, Cipla has been successful in resolving US FDA’s queries in about 3-4 months. “If the US FDA’ observations are cleared quickly, then its pipeline of new launches into the US market should continue. If the clarifications get delayed or if there’s an import alert, which may not be the case, then the sale to the US could get impacted,"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity.
In fact, Cipla’s US business has delivered a growth of about 22% in FY19, and sales are expected to grow in high-double digits this year too due to additional new launches this year too.
As such, given that much of the details of the latest observations are not yet know, the overhang on the stock could continue to linger for some time."

Melbourne: The State Bank of India opened its Melbourne office on Monday, becoming the first Indian bank to have a branch in the Australian state of Victoria.
The Melbourne office will assist the growing trade and investment relations between Victoria and India and is the outcome of the state's 10-year India Strategy – our shared future, according to a press release.
Speaking at the inauguration here, Victoria's parliamentary secretary to the treasurer, Steve Dimopoulos, said, ""We are delighted to welcome the State Bank of India to Victoria – the first Indian bank to set up operations in our state.""
""This investment by India's largest commercial bank is a testament to our thriving financial services sector and our highly skilled workforce,"" he said.
According to official figures, the two-way merchandise trade between Victoria and India was to the tune of 1.76 billion Australian dollars in 2018.
SBI Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara said ""It is a great privilege to have our presence in the vibrant and business-friendly city of Melbourne. I am confident that our footprint in Melbourne will further strengthen the relationship between the two countries""
Victoria already has the presence of leading Indian businesses, including Cipla, Cyient, HCL, Infosys, Ramco, Samvardhana Motherson Group, TCS, Tech Mahindra, Ugam Solutions, Wipro, Zoonga and Zomato.

13,2019-09-30,Cipla,"The Goa plant accounts for 20% of Cipla’s US sales; hence, any serious observation by the FDA could slash sales thereOn the other hand, analysts have not been banking too much on its domestic business recently

Investors in Cipla Ltd’s stock has been on a downhill journey in the past year. The stock has tumbled from 52-week highs a year ago to 52-week lows at present. In the process, investors lost about 35%. Now, further compounding its woes is the news that the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has made further observations regarding its Goa plant. The stock saw additional selling on Monday, falling 3.6%.
While additional details of these observations are yet to be known, there were about 12 observations regarding the Goa plant. But whether there are serious discrepancies or the issues can be resolved quickly will be known only after US FDA provides a detailed Form 483. As such, these observations could delay new approvals in the US from this plant.
In the past though, Cipla has successfully resolved US FDA’s queries in about two-four months. “If the observations are cleared quickly, the pipeline of new approvals and launches in the US market should continue. If there are serious observations then there is a possibility of getting OAI (Official Action Indicated) where chances of getting warning letters are high. In that case new approvals could be impacted from the said facility. As per company, there were no data integrity related issues, hence no possibility of import alerts"" said an analyst on condition of anonymity.
The Goa plant accounts for about 20% of its US sales, hence, any serious observation could slash sales there. Overall, the US business accounts for about 21% of its sales, and they have been improving this past year due to the launches.
Besides, Cipla has a rich pipeline of launches slated for the US in the next 12-18 months. “US revenues were strong over the past two quarters due to the launch of generic Sensipar ($35mn-40mn a quarter). However, this will come down substantially as several others have launched it and intense competition would make it a normal product. Base US sales are currently US$125mn a quarter and we expect this to improve to US$140mn in FY21 on the launch of 10-15 products and of limited-competition products such as Albuterol, Truvada, Latuda, etc. over the next 12-18 months,"" analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd said in a recent note to clients.
On the other hand, analysts have not been banking too much on its domestic business recently. That’s because Cipla has been realigning the number of distributors in the trade generic segment. This resulted in its Q1 FY20 domestic revenues shrinking about 12% year-on-year. Analysts reckon that the domestic-market restructuring could continue for a couple of quarters.
As such, much depends on growth in the US markets for now. Only a quick resolution to US FDA’s issues would help stem the fall in the company’s stock price."
12,2019-10-06,Cipla,"Analysts are factoring in a y-o-y revenue growth of about 11.5% in the Sep quarter, the slowest in the past four quartersIn the first quarter (Q1), almost all domestic pharma companies registered negative growth rates in their US businesses

All is not well with pharma companies in the overseas markets, particularly the US. This is expected to reflect in lower sequential growth rates in the second quarter (Q2) of FY20.
In the first quarter (Q1), almost all domestic pharma companies registered negative growth rates in their US businesses. Competition in some of the base drugs launched earlier has been intensifying. As a result, sales volume growth has been slow.
Additionally, lack of new launches in the US market could further drag down revenue growth. “US business should be weak for almost all companies with a sharp dip in approvals in Q2, compliance issues, lack of meaningful launches and competition in base portfolios,"" said analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd in a recent report to clients.
Domestic markets, however, could lend a helping hand to overall growth rates. In Q1 FY20, most companies had reported domestic growth rates of more than 10%, barring Cipla Ltd and Cadila Healthcare Ltd, which posted single-digit growth.
Hence, domestic growth rate is expected to remain strong for most pharma companies, particularly those in the respiratory ailments segment that have an edge over others.
“With respect to domestic markets, the growth is likely to favour companies with a larger presence in acute therapy as a heavy monsoon together with flooding situation has led to a surge in occurrence of infectious diseases. Emerging markets (EM) growth has been affected by adverse pricing regulations and the impact should be seen in subsequent quarters, too,"" said a recent report by Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. Ltd.
Operating margin growth may also remain weak. A key contribution to margin growth was to come from speciality products. However, in Q2 FY20, the ramp-up in speciality product sales has been less than desired for most pharma companies. Besides, the research and development (R&D) expense is likely to increase this quarter, after companies cut back spending on R&D in Q1.
Hence, analysts expect Ebitda margin growth in Q2 to weaken. In fact, analysts are factoring in revenue growth of just about 11.5% year-on-year in the September quarter, which is the slowest in the last four quarters, while Ebitda growth is expected to be just 7.8% year-on-year. Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.
Select domestic pharma companies, such as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd, could buck the trend due to their strong domestic portfolios and an increase in new launches this season. But for most other pharma firms, investors may not have much to look forward to."

Mumbai: Shares of Indian pharmaceutical companies started the week on a subdued note, with most down on Monday. Multiple regulatory developments over the weekend marred sentiment for the stocks.
Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Cipla, Aurobindo Pharma Ltd, and Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd were all under pressure, with the Nifty Pharma index down more than 2% in early deals on Monday.
According to a Mint report, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is likely to tweak waste treatment rules for pharmaceuticals companies that would reduce the time taken to get environmental approvals for change in product mix. CPBC is examining a proposal to change effluent treatment norms after the Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association sought tweaks to existing regulations that act as hurdles to manufacturing.
This, however, has failed to revive sentiment so far today.
Shares of Glenmark Pharma fell over 9% in today’s session after the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) issued a warning letter to the company’s manufacturing facility in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh. The warning letter comes following adverse observations during an inspection in April. The company, however, does not expect a significant financial hit from the warning letter, as there are no major pending product approvals from the facility in the next 12 months.
Shares of Aurobindo Pharma traded more than 7% lower at 525.55 rupees, while those of Sun Pharma were down 2.5% at 377.15 rupees. Shares of Cipla, Lupin Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd were down 1.5-2.5%.
In another development, the US FDA issued an establishment inspection report to Dr Reddy’s bulk drug manufacturing plant 2 at Bollaram near Hyderabad, indicating closure of the audit done in July. The regulator, however, indicated that the observations did not require immediate redressal as they were made in a Form 483 as Voluntary Action Initiated. The stock was down a 0.5%."

The regulator said the drugmaker failed to clean, maintain and sanitize utensils and equipment at appropriate intervals, raising the risk of contamination and compromising the safety and quality of the products.
The regulator conducted a current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) inspection at Cipla’s Goa unit during 16-27 September and made 12 severe observations, none of which were related to data integrity, the company had said in an exchange filing.

During a facility walkthrough, layers of coloured drug products residue were observed on the inside surfaces of air outlet ducts,"" the US FDA said in a report, a copy of which has been reviewed by Mint.
The regulator also observed that the manufacturing facility did not provide equipment for adequate control of air pressure, micro-organisms and dust --necessary while manufacturing, processing, packing or holding of drugs.
The report led to a fall in Cipla’s shares as investors feared action against the manufacturing facility by the US FDA. Shares of the pharmaceutical company dived more than 5% in early trade on Friday. At 1pm, the stock had pared losses and traded 2% higher."

Mumbai-based Pharmaceutical company Cipla Ltd acquired a novel and patented anti-infective product, Elores, from Venus Remedies Ltd, the company said in an exchange filing.
Cipla did not give financial details of the acquisition.
""Elores underscores our commitment to anti-microbial stewardship and is a significant addition to our branded portfolio of anti-infectives in India. We recently acquired Zemdri, and with the acquisition of Elores, we have added to our offering of new generation antibiotics,"" Cipla Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Umang Vohra said as per the statement.
The drug was launched in India in 2013 after approval from the Drug Controller General of India.
Elores is indicated for treatment of life threatening infections caused by gram-negative bacteria, and the company said that the medicine is part of its strategy to fight anti-microbial resistance.
The novel medicine is a combination of ceftriaxone, sulbactam and Disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
Elores preserves the efficacy of the antibiotic using disodium EDTA, which is an antibiotic resistance breakers (ARB), Cipla said. An ARB is not an antibiotic itself but overcomes resistance barriers of the bacteria and in the process facilitates anti-microbial activity of the drug.
In the recently concluded Phase-3 clinical trial, Elores was proven to be non-inferior to meropenem for treatment of patients suffering from complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis, Cipla said.
""I'm positive that Cipla will expand the reach of Elores to many more patients in India while ensuring a similar commitment to anti-microbial stewardship,"" Venus Medicine Research Centre CEO Saransh Chaudhary said.

NEW DELHI :
Strong operational performance of Cipla’s two largest markets of US and India helped the company post a 25% jump year-on-year in its consolidated net profit for July-September quarter (Q2) to  ₹471 crores.
Cipla’s India sales, which make up over a third of the topline, grew 6% to Rs1,745 crores due to strong recovery in the generics business coupled by strong performance of its branded drug sales, the company said.
In the branded business, seasonal triggers helped sales of drugs for acute illnesses rises over 15% year on year growth in primary sales, the company said.
Mumbai-based Cipla’s consolidated net sales rose 10% on year to  ₹4,396 crores, with operating margin expanding to 20.7% from 18.8%.
The company’s revenue from the US market rose by a fourth to $135 million, aided by strong sales of cinacalcet, which is used to treat increased amounts of a parathyroid hormone in people with long-term kidney disease who are on dialysis. Launch of anticonvulsant drug pregabalin and antibiotic daptomycin also aided Cipla’s US sales.
In the US, Cipla said that it is progressing well on trials of respiratory drugs, and has completed patient randomization trials for Advair. The company plans to launch albuterol in April-September next year.
Cipla is also planning to submit the new drug application of intravenous tramadol later in the year via Avenue Therapeutics, the company said. Cipla had acquired 33.3% stake in Avenue Therapeutics through its subsidiary last year.
The company currently has 22 drugs tentatively approved and another 63 under approval process of the US Food and Drug Administration, as per the investor presentation of the company.

4,2019-11-07,Cipla,"In June quarter, the revenue growth at the company decelerated to 1.3%Revenues in India jumped 29% from June quarter

Cipla Ltd steered the India business to growth delivering better than expected performance for the September quarter. Revenues last quarter expanded 10% driven by 6% growth in India.
In June quarter when business in India was hit by realignment of distributors (domestic revenues dropped 12%) revenue growth at the company decelerated to 1.3%. The impact of the changes in distribution network is expected to linger on for some time. But the recovery has been rather rapid. Revenues in India jumped 29% from June quarter.
The recovery is expected to continue. “2Q saw a recovery in Gx (generics) business that will continue in 3Q. With branded business on a strong footing and performing in-line with Indian pharma market as per secondary data, Cipla seems to have come out unscathed,"" Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a note.
The trends will reassure investors. Unlike other pharmaceutical companies which derive a large part of their revenues from the US, Cipla’s dependence on India is high. Last fiscal 38% of the Cipla’s revenues came from domestic market. So overall growth are largely mimics the performance in India.
Importantly the recovery in India comes when competition for the company’s drugs are intensifying in the US. Revenues in the US jumped 25% from the year ago reflecting the contribution from new drugs. But from June quarter revenues dropped 16% implying pricing pressures.
With no new limited competition drug launches in the US in immediate future, the fear earlier was the sequential slowdown in North American market may weigh on Cipla’s earnings. But with the mainstay India business now on recovery path those concerns will be allayed to some extent. “While we acknowledge that competition to gVoltaren gel, gSensipar and gPulmicort is intensifying, domestic recovery should ensure there is no undue pressure in the next couple of quarters until material US launches re-start from 4Q,"" Antique Stock Broking adds."

NEW DELHI :
A low base coupled with an early festival season helped pharmaceutical sales rise 14.5% year-on-year to  ₹12,624 crore in November, with sales of most Indian drug manufacturers outpacing their foreign peers, data from market research firm AIOCD-AWACS showed.
The market research firm said the sales were “one of the best growths seen in more than 32 months"", and attributed it to the weak 7% sales growth seen in the corresponding month last year, as well as the entire festival season ending in October itself this year. Last year, Diwali was in November.
Among the top 10 drug manufacturers, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Cipla, Cadila Healthcare, Lupin, Mankind Pharmaceuticals, Alkem Laboratories and Torrent Pharmaceuticals posted sales growth in the range of 12.6-17.9% in November.
India’s largest firm Sun Pharmaceutical posted a 14.5% growth in sales for the month to  ₹1,035 crore, while the Abbott group, the largest multinational firm and India’s second-largest, posted 12% growth to  ₹779 crore.
While sales of drugs under national list of essential medicines, which come under price control, grew 15.2% to  ₹1,245 crores, that of medicines not under price control grew 14.6% to  ₹10,866 crores.
Among the major therapy segments, anti-infective and respiratory drug sales led the growth with 17.0% and 19.7% respectively in November.
Over the last few years, medicines in anti-diabetic and cardiac segments have led sales growth, reflecting their increasing cases among the Indian population. For the year ending November, these two segments were the only ones in the top-10 therapies that grew in double digits.
For the year ending November, sales in the Indian pharmaceutical market grew 9.8% at  ₹1.39 lakh crore, with Lupin, Mankind Pharma, Intas Pharmaceuticals and Alkem Laboratories leading the growth."
2,2019-12-09,Cipla,"Growth was driven by volumes, which increased 5.9%, followed by a 5.7% rise in prices, and new products that were up 3%Given the long monsoon season and the increase in pollution levels, sales of anti-infective and respiratory drug sales were among the highlights of this season

MUMBAI :
The surge in domestic pharmaceutical sales in November may have been encouraging, but sparked modest investor interest in pharma stocks, as was seen from the flat close of the Nifty Pharma index on Monday.
Sales rose 14% year-on-year (y-o-y) in the month, led by an increase in anti-infective and respiratory therapies, according to data from market research firm AIOCD Awacs.
It must be noted that November has been the best month in more than 32 months, shows the AIOCD Awacs data. In October, revenue growth had been soft at 5%, while volumes had declined.
The growth in November was driven by volumes, which increased 5.9%, followed by a 5.7% rise in prices, and new products that were up 3%. The growth is on the back of a lower base from a year ago, when sales grew by about 7%.
Analysts said the volume growth data was encouraging. “The pick up in volumes is the highlight after a negative volume growth of about 2.7% in October. Overall volume growth has been better this year. Additionally, Indian pharma companies outperformed multinational companies, which happened for the first time in the last six months. The domestic pharma market continues to remain strong,"" notes Kunal Dhamesha, pharma analyst at SBI Capital Markets Ltd.
While this year’s growth has been on the back of a lower base, a few firms managed to better market growth rates. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Ltd posted the highest y-o-y growth at 28%, while Lupin Ltd and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd each reported 15% growth.
Given the extended monsoon season, sales of anti-infective and respiratory drugs grew the fastest in November. Besides, analysts expect the domestic market to continue to do well as lifestyle diseases are on the rise.
A positive is that the growth was broad-based across categories. Respiratory and anti-infectives grew at about 20% and 17%, respectively, y-o-y. Gastrointestinals also clocked a growth rate of about 15% y-o-y.
However, risks to the domestic pharma market could come from a revision in the National List of Essential Medicines. This constitutes about 10% of the domestic pharma market. Another factor to watch for would be growth rates post the acute season. Sales growth could tend to slow down in the coming months.
The pharma market penetration is still considered low in India, even as the affordability of drugs has been rising. However, the game seems to be shifting in favour of firms that have a strong domestic formulations portfolio. In short, the action is likely to become more stock-centric."
