New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that all political parties should come together to support simultaneous elections in India as a lot of financial and human resources get used due to frequent elections. 
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that all political parties should come together to support simultaneous elections in India as a lot of financial and human resources get used due to frequent elections.
Modi said that simultaneous elections are possible if all political parties work together because no political party or government alone can be successful in holding simultaneous polls both at the national and state level.
“All political parties should come together on simultaneous polls, let there be a nationwide debate on simultaneous polls. I am confident that if there is discussion in the country, something good will come out. Apart from spending huge amount of financial and human resources in conducting elections, the security forces and police find it difficult to serve the people because they are busy in election duties,"" Modi said in an interview to Zee News.
Modi said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had helped 100 million people start their own business through the Mudra Yojana, under which a total amount of Rs4 trillion was given to people for the purpose.
Modi said that 7 million new EPF (Employees’ Provident Fund) accounts have been opened in the past one year. “The government is working in the right direction. Is it not job creation when 10 crore people get money to start their own business? Out of the 10 crore people, 3 crore people got money from the bank for the first time, is it not job creation?"" Modi asked.
During the course of the interview, when Modi was asked about the focus of the upcoming Union Budget, he said that development is the only message of the NDA and that the government would take all possible steps to ensure that the fruits of development reach everyone. “Development, development and development is the only message of the Union government. We are working with the motive of development for all,"" said Modi.
On the performance of the BJP-led government at the centre in the last three years, Modi said some of its biggest achievements were the Jan Dhan Yojana (opening bank accounts), toilets in schools, 33 million families getting cooking gas cylinders, electrification of 18,000 villages, people being provided insurance in 90 paise and distribution and installation of LED lights.
“The implementation of goods and services tax succeeded because of the federal structure of the country and NDA honours the spirit of federal structure. It is a huge transformation and some adjustments would take time. Government should work for the people, not to win elections,"" said Modi.

New Delhi: Television broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd on Wednesday launched a new video streaming platform Zee5 to establish a stronger presence in the digital market for the next phase of growth. 
New Delhi: Television broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd on Wednesday launched a new video streaming platform Zee5 to establish a stronger presence in the digital market for the next phase of growth.
Zee5, which will subsume Zee’s existing video streaming platforms Ozee (advertising-based) and Ditto TV (subscription-based), comes with 1 lakh hours of content including exclusive originals, Indian and international movies and TV shows, music, live television, health and lifestyle videos in 12 regional languages.
“A new platform was created because the digital growth story is happening now. Video streaming platforms have been targeting younger audiences between 18 and 35 years of age but Zee5 caters to 12 languages across the country. We are going down to tier-II and tier-III cities with strong language content and not just focusing on metros and mini-metros,"" said Amit Goenka, chief executive officer at Zee International and Z5 Global. 
Zee5 has adopted a free plus premium pricing model with both free and paid content and will compete with the global players Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, broadcaster-owned platforms Hotstar and Voot, and SonyLIV and independent video-on-demand service providers like YuppTV, Hooq and Spuul. 
The premium content of the platform will be available to consumers at a monthly charge of Rs150 (the launch offer price is Rs99) and the existing 10 million users of OZee and Ditto TV will be upgraded to Zee5. 
“So far, our digital platforms have been a very small part of our business. With 4G and data prices going down, the consumption of video is skyrocketed. Almost 57% of the overall data usage is video consumption. This is the right time to launch a platform with quality content,"" added Goenka, without disclosing the revenue targets from Zee5. 
“Talking about the numbers is not meaningful right now because Barc (Broadcast Audience Research Council, India) is yet to come out with the digital audience measurement system. Right now, the focus is on getting audiences and increasing consumption,"" he said. 
TV ratings viewership agency Barc India’s digital media measurement products are due for launch later this year in a phased manner and will help advertisers make decisions with independent audience measurement data, which hasn’t been available so far.
Zee’s move comes at a time when advertising on digital media is all set to command 18% of the overall advertising spends in 2018 (and will go up to 25% in three years), growing at a rate of 30%. Digital media advertising is expected to touch Rs12,337 crore in 2018, up from the estimated Rs9,490 crore in 2017, according to a report This Year Next Year (TYNY) released by WPP-owned media agency GroupM. 
Zee, with interests in broadcasting, movies, music, digital, live entertainment and theatre businesses, has a presence in more than 173 countries and a reach of more than 1.3 billion people around the world. “The launch of Zee5 further strengthens us as a media and entertainment powerhouse. A blend of unrivalled content offering and robust technology is the foundation of this all-new digital offering from our end,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer at Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, in a statement."

He also said the association will create high-value content and enrich the student experience by leveraging the strong experience of the academic teams of both companies.

New Delhi: Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) and Turner International ended a 16-year-old strategic collaboration on Monday and the mutually decided to work independently to drive subscription revenues. 
New Delhi: Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) and Turner International ended a 16-year-old strategic collaboration on Monday and the mutually decided to work independently to drive subscription revenues.
The two brands had joined hands in 2002 to manage distribution and trade marketing for a bouquet of channels in India.
Turner, an American entertainment and distribution brand, is known for creating and managing the sales, distribution and marketing of news and entertainment brands like CNN International, Cartoon Network, POGO, Toonami, HBO and WB across India and South Asia. Turner Asia Pacific is the parent company of Turner International India Pvt. Ltd. (Turner India), which operates 63 channels in 13 languages in 37 countries in the region. 
Subhash Chandra-led media and entertainment company ZEEL, meanwhile, is present across broadcasting, movies, music, digital, live entertainment and theatre businesses, both within India and overseas. Owned by the Essel Group, it is one of India’s oldest media organizations.
Both ZEEL and Turner declined to comment on the story.
Industry experts said the split doesn’t come as a surprise. The collaboration made sense earlier given Turner’s bouquet of cartoon and kids’ channels, which ZEE had no expertise in.
“You could bundle channels together and pricing happened at a bouquet level,"" said Girish Menon, co-head, media and entertainment, KPMG India. “Now with the change in Trai (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India) regulations, each channel has to be priced individually and doesn’t allow for bouquet-level bargaining or make for much economic benefit.""
Industry experts pointed to the other media and distribution partnerships that have dissolved over time—in 2014, Star India and ZEE called off the 50-50 distribution joint venture they had inked in 2010.
“The regulation can be a reason. That is how the market is evolving,"" said Abneesh Roy, an analyst with Edelweiss Securities."

New Delhi: Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), which operates channels such as Zee TV and Zee Cinema, reported an 84.8% decline in net profit for the March quarter, despite a 12.9% growth in operating revenue.
Net profit fell to Rs231 crore during January-March quarter from Rs1,515.2 crore in the year-ago period, as operating revenue rose to Rs1,725.3 crore from Rs1,528 crore. Overall expenditure rose 15.08% to Rs1,219.1 crore from Rs1,059.3 crore.
During the quarter, ZEE’s advertising revenue rose 23.9% to Rs1,049.6 crore from Rs846.9 crore. Adjusted for sports, domestic advertising grew by 24.9% to Rs983.4 crore. On a comparable basis (excluding sports, Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd and India Webportal Pvt Ltd), domestic advertising revenue grew by 21.5%. International advertising revenue for the quarter was Rs66.2 crore. Revenue from subscriptions declined by 2% to Rs546.5 crore. Adjusted for the sale of sports business, however, domestic subscription revenue grew by 18.1% to Rs452.1 crore. International subscription revenue dropped to Rs94.4 crore.
“We are delighted with the strong operating and financial performance during the quarter,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer, ZEEL, in a statement. “Domestic ad revenue growth of 24% is driven by broad based recovery in advertising spends. With high visibility of product campaigns, improving consumer demand and GST (goods and services tax) related benefits trickling down to ad spends, we are confident of continued traction in advertising spending. The full-year domestic subscription revenue growth of 12% is a tad lower than our initial expectations due to some unforeseen events. However, there is no change in our medium-term outlook for the same."" 
During the quarter, ZEE also launched its digital entertainment platform ZEE5.
“We are happy with the initial response (to ZEE5) and are confident that the sheer depth and breadth of our content offering will enable it to become the number one digital entertainment platform in India,"" Goenka said. “We have also focused on the peculiarities of the Indian market and designed technological features to improve the user experience. Unlike most of the existing apps which are either focused on the English-speaking segment or the youth audience, ZEE5’s vast content catalogue is designed with an objective to cater to all sections of video viewing audience."""

Essel Vision is known for its films, an area it ventured into in 2012 by distributing Mahesh Manjrekar-directed Kaksparsh. It soon turned to full-fledged production with teenage love story Timepass (2014). Besides making content for Zee and Zee Marathi TV channels, Essel Vision also made the Marathi blockbuster film Sairat for Rs3.5 crore which collected more than Rs100 crore at the box office.
Apart from Hindi films like Aishwarya Rai-starrer Jazbaa (2015), the company also has to its credit some of the highest grossing films in the Marathi language, according to previous Mint reports.

New Delhi: Telecommunications company Bharti Airtel has announced a strategic content partnership with media and entertainment firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) to “drive the over-the-top video streaming ecosystem in India"".
The deal will work in three parts. One, some of ZEEL’s curated content, including television shows, original web series and movies, will be available exclusively on Airtel’s digital property Airtel TV, in addition to ZEE5, the digital arm owned by ZEEL. Two, the ZEE5 app will be bundled into the Airtel TV app, allowing customers to get ZEE5 content for free. Three, the two companies will jointly create, market and distribute content, with specific focus on ZEE’s regional language-centric strategy.
“This is a win-win deal for both Airtel and us and a strategic partnership that we see extending into the long term, though the current alliance is only structured for three years,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer, ZEEL. He, however, declined to comment on the financial details of the partnership. “Apart from monetary benefit, we get access to their nearly 300 million subscribers, one-third of whom are on smart devices. We see much faster penetration of ZEE5 through this opportunity.""
Goenka added that Airtel does not have ready access to original content and partnership with ZEEL gives them an opportunity to expand and enrich their library.
“Our endeavour is to build a world-class content ecosystem by partnering with all players and enable a differentiated digital entertainment experience for our customers. We are extremely pleased to announce this exclusive partnership with ZEE and look forward to collaborating with them to unlock the potential of their vast content catalogue,"" said Gopal Vittal, managing director and chief executive officer (India and South Asia), Bharti Airtel, in a statement.
However, the Airtel-ZEE alliance is not entirely exclusive. Airtel offers a one-year subscription of Amazon Prime free of cost to its postpaid subscribers, which includes shopping and video benefits (with its OTT service Amazon Prime Video). Similarly, ZEE, too, will be free to partner with other telcos for content, except ones that are exclusively for Airtel TV.
Abneesh Roy, analyst with Edelweiss Securities, said the deal is extremely critical for both parties. On one hand, Airtel is competing with the likes of Reliance Jio that has brought in disruptive pricing with its super cheap data packs, besides acquiring stakes in production companies like Eros International, Balaji Telefilms and Roy Kapur Films. 
ZEE5, meanwhile, is vying for the same OTT space as players like Netflix that emphasize on original digital content, while services such as Amazon and VOOT (the digital service owned by Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd) are either curating a movie library or leveraging the content from their broadcast networks. 
“While Airtel has to differentiate itself through content tie-ups, ZEE5 will have to ensure visibility for the many shows it has in the pipeline. Plus, it needs the kind of payment from a telco partner that it gets from a DTH or cable partner,"" Roy added."

New Delhi:  Media and entertainment firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) announced the launch of its over-the-top (OTT) streaming service, ZEE5, in more than 190 countries across the world.

New Delhi:  Media and entertainment firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) announced the launch of its over-the-top (OTT) streaming service, ZEE5, in more than 190 countries across the world. Except markets like China and the United States, the digital platform will now be present abroad across the Android, iOS and web formats.
ZEE5’s revenue model will depend on the specific market. While countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh will have a combination of AVoD (advertising video-on-demand) and SVoD (subscription video-on-demand) with introductory offers for the latter ranging from $2 to $10, others like the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands will work entirely on the subscription model.
“Our strategies will differ depending on the market,"" said Amit Goenka, chief executive officer, ZEE International and Z5 Global. “If we expect a large user base, it’ll be a freemium offering, and if it’s a smaller base we’ll go with an SVoD offering.""

Goenka added that starting next April, there would be an effort to reach out to mainstream audiences in countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Russia with content specifically tailored to suit their tastes through dubbing. ZEEL might decide to produce local content in these countries much later. To strengthen distribution, ZEEL plans to partner local telecom companies and payments firms in each of these countries.
“Our strength lies in the depth and breadth of content we offer across Indian languages. That’s what we believe can be a huge differentiator, especially with the south Asian diaspora. Whether it’s Netflix or Amazon, while they have some Indian content, it’s not like ours,"" Goenka said. “We wanted to cater to all our audiences globally in one shot.

New Delhi: The final season of iconic American show House of Cards (HoC) will be out this weekend and television viewers in India will be able to watch all of the eight episodes over two days, just one day after it starts streaming on over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platform Netflix. Zee Café, the broadcaster of the show, is planning a binge-telecast of the political thriller where the first four episodes will be premiered back-to-back between 3 pm and 7 pm on 3 November and the other four at the same time on the 4th.
Zee that calls the five-year old show one of the most iconic properties, is driving curiosity around it with an extensive marketing campaign and a spate of brand sponsorship deals. “HoC has been able to crawl out of TV screens into dining-table discussions,"" said Shaurya Mehta, head, Premium Channels, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL). “At Zee Café, we strive to offer audiences the content that they are waiting for and that is also why we are bringing the series to India along with the rest of the world.""
Mehta added that the previous season had resulted in a 30% spike in Zee Café’s average viewership and this season has managed to attract advertisers. While pizza chain Domino’s is the powered by sponsor, automobile brand Renault is the driven by sponsor for the show. Streaming service Amazon Prime Video is a special partner for the show while telecommunication company Nokia, online furniture company Pepperfry, Honeywell Air Purifier and ICICI Bank are associate sponsors on the property. Media industry experts peg revenue from sponsorship deals at around  ₹ 2 crore, given the niche appeal of the channel and the show.
“With increasing awareness about indoor air pollution, air purifiers as a category is witnessing rapid growth in metro cities. The early buyers in the category are mid-aged people, largely 30 years or older. Data suggests that this audience segment has a high affinity towards English entertainment shows and major consumption happens over the weekends on television,"" said Ahraaz Khan, marketing leader, Connected Living Solutions, Honeywell Building Technologies, India. “We are partnering with impact platforms like HoC to amplify and establish a connect with this audience segment as part of the ongoing integrated marketing campaign on air purifiers and raising public awareness.""
Virat Khullar, head-marketing, Renault India added that HoC has a large male skew, with about 60% of the social media traction coming from Renault’s target group that includes aspirational Indians who look for disruptive products. Kashyap Vadapalli, chief marketing officer, Pepperfry, on the other hand pointed out that the upcoming season of HoC features Robin Wright as the 47th President of the United States who is a popular topic of discussion among HoC’s female audience, key decision-makers in the furniture purchase cycle and the company is looking forward to reaching out to them.
Zee has also planned a comprehensive campaign across media to maximize conversation around the show. This includes a print campaign with leading publications in Mumbai, Delhi and Bengaluru and cross promotions with the help of its network channels. On digital, it has used #HellHathNoFury to engage audiences and launched a special trade activation wherein industry leaders talk about the lessons they’ve learnt from HoC through a series of videos titled Power Trails.
“A lot of English entertainment shows are platform agnostic and get good traction on streaming services like Netflix and Amazon. However, a television premiere ensures even deeper penetration and wider appeal,"" explained Navin Khemka, chief executive officer, Mediacom South Asia. “While HoC may target a similar audience in terms of age group and demography on television and online, broadcast helps reach out to people with a different mindset, perhaps those not accustomed to spending on OTT in a big way. Further, since these OTT platforms are mostly ad-free, this is a good opportunity for brands to speak to an evolved TG."""
102,2018-11-13,Zee,"Essel Group sees divestment of 50% of its stake in Zee Entertainment as central to its plan to evolve into a global content technology company

 New Delhi: Media and entertainment conglomerate Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has decided to divest 50% of Essel Group’s shareholding in the company as it looks for a global strategic partner. The move would help it maximize long-term value and transform it into a global media-tech player with content offering for audiences in more than 170 countries.
Essel Group has decided to appoint Goldman Sachs Securities (India) Ltd as investment banker and Lion Tree as an international strategic adviser to manage the Zee divestment. It expects the outcome of the strategic review to be concluded by March or April 2019.
“While taking this decision, we were all already aware of our strong footing in the business. The company is doing exceptionally well as far as the broadcast network goes, and ZEE5 is also the second largest player in the market,"" said Zee Entertainment’s chief executive Punit Goenka.
“However, the only way to achieve our global ambitions is to partner with the right entity that can take us to the world and help us transform from a pure content company to a content technology company that can ensure we are able to compete in this rapidly evolving digital world.
“We also believe this move will serve the long-term interest of our minority stakeholders as our content and distribution capabilities only get enhanced in the time to come,"" he added.
The decision comes on the back of Zee’s strong bouquet of domestic and international channels that offer content in about 12 languages globally, its established revenue streams—both advertising and subscription—and the fact that its video-on-demand streaming platform ZEE5 will further enable the company to take advantage of changing video consumption trends.
Zee’s strong linear and digital distribution network already ensures its presence in the South Asian diaspora but the goal is global. In view of recent technological advances like artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, 3D printing, Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality, Zee recognizes that the lines between media, telecom, manufacturing and technology are blurring and that the company needs to evolve and stay ahead of the curve.
In July this year, Essel Corporate LLP acquired 15 million shares of Zee, its shareholding with respect to the total share capital of Zee going up from 1.49% to 3.05%.
Essel Group is a business conglomerate with presence across media and entertainment, packaging, real estate, infrastructure, education, finance, precious metals, technology and tourism. Its media interests include the Zee group of TV channels, and broadsheet Daily News and Analysis (DNA). Related businesses include direct-to-home television operator Dish TV, digital cable service provider Siti Cable and Zee Turner Ltd. The Subhash Chandra-led group continues to see India as a priority market and will invest in growth opportunities in the country.
The development comes at a time when Essel Group promoters are looking at selling their stake in other group businesses too.
In September, Mint reported that Essel Propack and was in stake sale talks with at least two foreign packaging companies, including Amcor Ltd and Huhtamaki Oyj. The promoter group, led by Chandra’s younger brother Ashok Goel, has mandated Morgan Stanley to manage the transaction.
In May, Mint reported that Tata Power Ltd and private equity firm Actis LLP were in separate talks to buy the solar power business of Essel Infraprojects Ltd. The company has 685 megawatts (MW) in solar power capacity."

The group will raise funds to refinance a part of the promoter debt which will mature over the next few quarters, they added. 
Mumbai: Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel Group is in talks with investors to raise as much as $400 million in a structured credit transaction, two people directly aware of the development said, requesting anonymity. The group will raise funds to refinance a part of the promoter debt which will mature over the next few quarters, they added.
“Discussions are currently underway with potential lenders, including AION Capital and KKR,"" said the first person. “The funds will be used to refinance debt of the group’s Mauritius holding company, which has investments across multiple businesses.""
Structured credit transactions typically offer flexible repayment terms compared with bank loans and are often tapped into by borrowers to tide over short-term cash flow issues, which do not allow them to service bank debt at periodic intervals.
In a similar transaction in November, India Resurgence Fund, a joint venture between Piramal Enterprises Ltd and Bain Capital Credit, had invested $156 million in the marine chemicals business of Chennai-based Archean Group. The money was used by the company to repay existing lenders, including banks and KKR.
“Essel has begun talks with the investors after an earlier plan to raise funds through overseas bonds did not take off due to difficult market conditions,"" the first person added.
KKR and AION declined to comment. Queries sent to Essel Group remained unanswered.
In July 2017, Mint reported that Essel promoters were looking to raise up to $1 billion in the group’s Mauritius entity, which had a debt of $800 million. The purpose of the fundraise then was to refinance the entire debt of the Mauritius entity.
Essel Group was founded in 1926 by Jagannath Goenka and has business interests in media, packaging and infrastructure. It has been looking to deleverage by selling stakes in various group businesses for a while.
Last November, the group had announced a 50% stake sale in its media business arm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd to a global strategic partner.

NEW DELHI :
Zee and Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra blamed unnamed “negative forces"" but also admitted to making bad investments and incorrect bids after nearly $2 billion was wiped off the Zee Group stocks on Friday following media reports of a government probe into alleged post-demonetization cash transactions involving entities related to Essel Group.
Chandra, however, said in an open letter that all operating companies, especially Zee Entertainment, are “performing exceptionally well and are under no stress whatsoever"".
“The debt burden is purely at the promoter level, which is reflecting negatively on the companies,"" he said.
In his two-page note, Chandra apologized to his bankers, non-banking financial companies and mutual funds, “since I believe that I have not lived up to their expectations, despite the best of my intentions"". Chandra said he is a rare promoter who plans to sell “the jewel of his crown"" to pay off the liabilities. “While the process is still ongoing, there are some forces that are not willing to see us succeed.""
Chandra said he had given his best to speed up the stake sale of Zee Entertainment and had returned from London on Thursday night after a series of “positive meetings"" with potential suitors. However, he held “negative forces"" responsible for the fall in stock prices. “Negative forces"", possibly after getting a hint of these positive meetings, attacked the share price to sabotage Zee Entertainment’s strategic sale process, he said.
Chandra’s statement came after shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd slumped more than 26%, its biggest single-day fall since listing in 1993, to close at  ₹319.35 a share. It lost nearly  ₹11,000 crore in market value. Ironically, on 15 January, Zee Entertainment reported strong December quarter earnings with revenue rising 18% to  ₹2,167 crore on account of a 22% year-on-year jump in advertising revenue. Net profit rose 50.6% to  ₹562.80 crore. The company’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin was up 300 basis points to 35%, from 32% a year ago. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point.
Other Zee group companies also came in for selling pressure. Zee Learn ended at  ₹27.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, down 18.5%, erasing  ₹200 crore of market value. Zee Media Corporation Ltd fell 9% to  ₹22.10 while its market capitalization fell by  ₹1,000 crore. Essel Propack Ltd dropped 16% to  ₹98.10 and eroded nearly  ₹600 crore of market capitalization. Dish TV India Ltd sank 33% to  ₹22.60, erasing nearly  ₹2,000 crore from its market value.
A media analyst, who declined to be named, said that after the controversy and the fall in stock prices, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) may face issues with international buyers interested in the company. “Foreign buyers like to keep away from controversies and Zee may find that its pool of potential buyers had shrunk, affecting the prospects for ZEEL.""
According to news website The Wire, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office or SFIO is probing Nityank Infrapower, formerly Dreamline Manpower Solutions, for allegedly making  ₹3,000 crore in deposits soon after the November 2016 decision by the Narendra Modi government to ban high-value currency notes.
Jawahar Goel, chairman of Dish TV India Ltd, clarified to ET Now television channel that the Essel Group has nothing to do with the investigative agency’s probe into alleged deposit of funds. The group has given details of funds deposited by distributors into its accounts to the income-tax department, Goel said.
“The company is unaware of the news item referred in your letter or its source or factual correctness of the information contained therein (Essel Group probe),"" Zee Entertainment clarified to exchanges.

What went wrong for Zee, in Subhash Chandra’s words
In an open letter, Zee and Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra listed six things that have gone wrong. Excerpts from the letter:
1 ESSEL INFRA: As most of the infra companies, even we have made some incorrect bids. In usual cases, infra companies have raised their hands and have left their lenders with non-performing assets, but in our case, my obsession of not walking away from the situation, has made me to bleed  ₹4,000 crore to  ₹5,000 crore. Despite the loss making projects, we continued to pay the interest and the principle, by borrowing funds against our shareholdings in listed companies.
2 ACQUISITION OF D2H: My recommendation made to my brother Jawahar Goel to buy D2H from Videocon was one more key error, which cost me and Jawahar both, a fortune.
3 When our family business separation was implemented, as the eldest member of the family, I had taken the entire burden of the debts. I believe, it was my mistake to have told myself that “Subhash you can earn and repay the creditors"". Most of my bets on the new businesses have not worked, which led to the increased debt, because of the added interest levels.
4 The situation at hand, became further unmanageable after the IL&FS issue, came to public light. Till then, we were managing our borrowings efficiently. The IL&FS meltdown stopped the roll overs, diminishing our ability to service our borrowings.
5 From May/June 2018 onwards a negative force was acting against our grip as promoters became strongly active. This was followed by some anonymous letters being sent to all bankers, NBFCs, mutual funds, and shareholders.
6 Whenever we have reported some really good results from the operating companies, the share prices were intentionally hammered by these negative forces, driving away the investors."

NEW DELHI :
Subhash Chandra-promoted two Essel group companies Zee Entertainment Enterprise and Dish TV on Sunday denied links with Nityank lnfrapower and Multiventures Ltd, a company being probed by the SFIO for suspicious demonetisation deposits, as claimed in a media report.
Zee Entertainment Enterprise Ltd (ZEEL), in a regulatory filing, said Nityank lnfrapower and Multiventures Ltd is an ""independent company and does not belong to Essel Group"".
It further said that involvement of Essel Group entities in the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) investigation against Nityank is being done only with ""malicious intent"" and ""legal action as advised"" is being initiated in this regard. ""At the outset, we wish to reiterate and confirm that Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has no connection whatsoever with any alleged transaction(s) contained in the article published by a website,"" said ZEEL.
Over allegations of involvement of other Essel Group entities in the media report, the filing said that all ""queries relating to demonetisation, if any, from SFIO were directed to Nityank"".
The Essel group entities have already provided other information sought by the SFIO and no further information is sought from them.
""In view of above, since all information sought by SFIO has been provided by Essel Group entities and no further information has been subsequently sought, the matter stands closed for Essel Group entities,"" said ZEEL.
While its DTH arm Dish TV has also denied any transaction with Nityank in its scheme of merger of Videocon D2h with the company.
""In response to communication received by the Company in July 2018 from SFIO, seeking information relating to Nityank Infra power and Multiventures Ltd (Nityank), while providing requisite information/replies including relating to Scheme of Arrangement for Amalgamation of Videocon D2h Limited with and into Dish TV India Ltd, the company had categorically denied having had any transaction with Nityank,"" it said.
On January 25, shares of ZEE group companies had come under massive selling pressure, plummeting up to 33%, and suffered a combined erosion of  ₹13,352 crore in market valuation.
Later, Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra apologised to lenders and said his company is in a financial mess and blamed the same for the aggressive bets on infra, which has gone out of control since the IL&FS crisis and also the acquisition of Videocon's D2H business.
Chandra also alleged that some negative forces are out to sabotage his efforts to raise money through a strategic sale in the flagship company Zee Entertainment Enterprises.

Here are 10 things to know about selecting new 2019 plans on Airtel DTH, Dish TV, Hathway and other cable operators.

New Delhi: Following implementation of new regulations imposed on DTH service providers and cable operators by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), you can now reduce your monthly TV bill by limiting your subscription to only those TV channels you watch. Consumers have been given time till the end of this month to make a choice for uninterrupted service after January. In the new regulations, any DTH provider like Airtel DTH TV, Tata Sky or Dish TV can charge a maximum of only   ₹ 130, excluding GST, for a set of 100 non-HD channels. 
New Delhi: Following implementation of new regulations imposed on DTH service providers and cable operators by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), you can now reduce your monthly TV bill by limiting your subscription to only those TV channels you watch. Consumers have been given time till the end of this month to make a choice for uninterrupted service after January. In the new regulations, any DTH provider like Airtel DTH TV, Tata Sky or Dish TV can charge a maximum of only   ₹ 130, excluding GST, for a set of 100 non-HD channels.
If you opt for any pay channel in that list of 100, you have to pay extra, according to the MRP of that individual channel. After a TRAI order, all broadcasters like Sony, Zee, Star, Discovery, Sun, Turner and, Viacom have declared which of their TV channels are free-to-air (FTA) and which ones are pay channels.
10 things to know about selecting new plans on Airtel DTH, Dish TV, Hathway, other cable operators and multi-system operators:
1. Besides a la carte rates, all major broadcasters have also declared various bouquets based on genre and language. The prices declared by individual broadcasters are the maximum retail price and your TV service provider can offer you a deal below the MRP. Even the price of the base packs can be lower than   ₹ 130.
2. On its website, Airtel DTH TV shows a base pack of   ₹ 99 with a host of SD (standard definition) channels. Tata Sky’s lowest base pack, too, begins from   ₹ 99. However, both the operators have a list of select SD TV channels as part of the pack. As the new TRAI rules come into force, these base packs will also undergo a change as you will have the liberty to put any SD channel of your choice in the base pack. Any pay channel you include in the list gets added to your bill.
3. In the new regulations, any subscriber wanting to watch more than 100 channels can choose additional channels in each slab of 25 channels with at a maximum price of   ₹ 20 per slab. According to TRAI, consumers opting for more than 100 channels are rare and form only 10-15% of the market. About 80% subscribers, according to the viewing pattern from BARC, do not even flip more than 40 channels.
4. “If a consumer carefully chooses channels of choice for the complete requirement of a family, the amount payable may be even less than the present payments being made per month,"" TRAI says on its website.
5. As reported to TRAI, there are as many as 330 pay TV channels, including HD and SD, from 40 broadcasters. The list of private FTA channels goes up to 535.
6. Among the 40 broadcasters, at least 17 have announced bouquets of several channels with discounted pricing. For example, a bouquet of 9 channels will cost   ₹ 63 if taken a la carte basis but if bought together, the price reduces by almost half to   ₹ 31.
7. FTA channels can’t be clubbed with pay channels in a bouquet. Further, HD channels can’t be clubbed with the SD version of the same channel, so that the consumer has complete clarity with respect to what is on offer.
8. You also have the freedom to buy a set-top box from the market and not from the service provider. However, that set-top box will have to be technically compliant with the system of the operator.
9. TRAI has instructed that there shall be no blackout of services till January 31 but after that, you may be pushed to the basic pack, which has no pay channels. To avoid disruption in services, you have to migrate to the new plan by the end of the month.
10. Every cable operator or DTH player has been asked to run a consumer information channel preferably on channel No. 999 wherein consumer-related information including the prices of channels shall be displayed."

NEW DELHI :
Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group on Sunday got a reprieve after managing to secure an assurance from its lenders that they wouldn’t rush to sell the shares of group companies pledged by the promoters, according to a report on business news channel BTVi. Essel is the controlling promoter of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, the group’s flagship company.
There was a danger of the lenders dumping, when the market opens Monday, the shares of Essel group companies pledged with them after they suffered a massive meltdown in Friday’s trade. The shares tumbled after a news report in The Wire linked firms belonging to Chandra, to large deposits made after demonetization.
A meeting between the group promoters and banks, mutual funds and non-banking finance companies which are invested directly in the company or have lent to it was held on Sunday.
The news report could throw a spanner in the works of the promoter family as it planned to sell up to 50% of their stake in Zee Entertainment. The promoters held 41.62% stake in the company as on 31 December, 2018.
The promoters are trying to sell the Zee Entertainment stake to pare the debt taken by the group’s infrastructure firms.
Zee Entertainment closed 27% lower and Dish TV ended 33% off on Friday. Zee Learn closed 19% down and Zee Media 9% lower from Thursday’s levels. The group has strongly denied being linked to any such large deposits and withdrawals being made around the time when demonetization was announced on November 8, 2016.
A copy of a company release, tweeted by BTVi, said the lenders would adopt a unified approach (while dealing with the company or its shares).
A news report in The Wire, published Thursday, said the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) was probing a company -- Nityank Infrapower (formerly Dreamline Manpower) -- for deposits of over  ₹3,000 crore made just after Prime Minister Narendra Modi banned the then prevailing  ₹500 and  ₹1,000 notes.
The Wire said its examination of publicly available documents showed Nityank and a group of shell firms carried out financial transactions that involved a few firms associated with the Essel Group of Subhash Chandra between 2015 and 2017.
Nityank also went onto play a crucial role in a large business deal between the Videocon and Essel Group in November 2016, The Wire news report alleged."

NEW DEHI :
Broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) has denied all allegations leveled against it by news website The Wire. This includes transactions with a company called Nityank Infrapower and Multiventures Ltd, which the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) is probing for deposits of over  ₹3,000 crore made after demonetization. Zee has also filed a lawsuit against The Wire, which said an examination of publicly available documents showed that Nityank and a group of shell companies carried out financial transactions involving a few firms associated with the Essel Group between 2015 and 2017.
Nityank reportedly also went on to play a crucial role in a large business deal between the Videocon and Essel groups in November 2016.
“We wish to reiterate and confirm that Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd has no connection whatsoever with any alleged transactions contained in the article published by a website. Essel Group had already confirmed that Nityank lnfrapower and Multiventures Ltd is an independent company and does not belong to Essel Group,"" ZEEL said in a letter to the National Stock Exchange.
The company also said that queries relating to demonetization from SFIO were directed to Nityank and documents sought by the investigating agency from certain Essel Group entities were provided in July and August. Since no further information has subsequently been sought, the matter stands closed for Essel Group entities. “Media reports alleging involvement of Essel Group entities in the SFIO investigation against Nityank are being done only with malicious intent and legal action, as advised or appropriate are being initiated in this regard,"" the letter to the NSE said.
Nearly $2 billion was wiped off Zee’s stocks last Friday after media reports suggested that controlling shareholder Essel Group’s name had emerged in a probe linked to large deposits made after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government banned high-value currency notes in November 2016. Zee and Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra, however, said in an open letter that all operating companies, especially Zee Entertainment, were “performing exceptionally well and are under no stress whatsoever"", while attributing the fall in share prices to “negative forces""."
89,2019-01-28,Zee,"Essel group reached an agreement with lenders that they would not sell the group companies’ shares pledged by the promoters.Essel group was also agreed to not classify the loans to the group as non-performing assets. 

Shares of the beleaguered Zee group companies moved in different directions after conflicting reports emerged on the outcome of Sunday’s meeting between the promoters and the lenders. Shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, the flagship company of the group, were up 12% in today’s trade so far as investors seemed to believe the promoters’ commentary that they were focused on repaying their debts and stayed committed to the business.
In a statement issued late Sunday evening, the Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel group, the controlling shareholder of Zee companies, said it had reached an agreement with lenders that they would not sell the group companies’ shares pledged by the promoters with them. It was also agreed to not classify the loans to the group as non-performing assets (NPAs).
Contradicting this was a news report that said not all lenders were on board with going soft on the group. A report in The Economic Times said the group had managed to secure a three-month reprieve.
More than half the promoter stake of Zee Enterprises is pledged. The promoters held 41.62% stake in the company as on December 31, 2018. Zee promoters will try their best to prevent any further run on the Zee Enterprises shares as they look for a buyer for half of their stake in the company. Continued erosion of the value could prompt the lenders to dump the shares pledged with them and thus also end up hurting the promoters’ attempt to sell the stake.
But the promoters’ assurances didn’t seem to have been able to persuade the investors in other group companies. Zee Learn and Zee Media Corporation fell 9% and 18%, respectively, their second consecutive day of mauling.
Zee Learn is the educational arm of the group which operates K-12 schools (Mount Litera Zee school and Kidzee) while Zee Media operates its news broadcast (Zee News) and newspaper (DNA) businesses. Dish TV was up a mere 2%.
Zee Entertainment had lost almost a third of its valuation Friday, finally closing 27% lower, whereas Dish TV did indeed end 33% down that day. Zee Learn had closed 19% down and Zee Media 9% lower from Thursday’s levels.
Friday’s run of the Zee group shares had come after a report Thursday in The Wire linked firms belonging to Chandra to large deposits made after demonetization. Zee has vehemently denied the allegations in The Wire story."
88,2019-01-28,Zee,"Lenders grant time till April to clear dues, which led to the rally in shares

Subhash Chandra, chairman of Zee and Essel Group, on Monday exhorted well-wishers to help prop up shares of group companies which took a beating on allegations of money laundering.
In a post on Twitter, Chandra said “many friends ask me how can they help to negate the negative forces.""
“They are negative you reply them with positivity by buying Zee & Dish shares,"" he said.
His comments came on a day when shares of most Zee Group companies rebounded from last week’s sharp sell-off, after the management met lenders to assuage their concerns.
The gainers comprised Dish TV (up 5.53%), Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (up 16.64%) and Essel Propack Ltd (up 9.43%). However, Zee Media Corp. Ltd and Zee Learn Ltd fell 19.68% and 7.80% respectively.
Nearly $2 billion was wiped off Zee Group’s stocks on Friday following media reports of a government probe into alleged post-demonetization cash transactions involving entities related to Essel Group.
An analyst said, on condition of anonymity, that most Zee companies recouped losses after lenders, including mutual funds, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) and banks extended loan repayments until April.
In a regulatory filing, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) said in view of the sensitive situation triggered by the steep fall in its share price as well as of Dish TV, a detailed meeting was held between Essel Group promoters and key entities comprising mutual funds, NBFCs and banks.
The promoters assured the lenders that there will not be any default due to the stock price crash.
“Lenders drew comfort from reiteration by the promoters for a speedy resolution through a strategic sale in a time-bound manner,"" ZEEL said in a statement.
Despite the sharp-sell off last week, analysts are still positive on Zee group stocks.
“Looking beyond this, we believe intrinsic value of the asset is intact, although chances of getting a significant premium in the strategic sale have diminished in our view, given promoter-level stress, despite increased probability of a change in control as against promoter’s initial intent to ‘sell up to 50%’ of their holding. Zee MD indicated the strategic sale may be concluded well before the March-April timeline provided initially,"" said JM Financial in a note on 28 January.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises is on track to deliver 17% and 13% compounded annual growth rate in advertising and subscription revenues over FY18-21 respectively, said Nomura.
Promoter Essel Group owned 41.6% of ZEEL as of end-December, and 59.4% (237million shares) of their stock was pledged.
About 6.5 million pledged shares were sold on Friday, thus reducing Essel Group’s stake to 40.9%.
Separately, in an open letter, Chandra said, while admitting mistakes (excessive infra bids, purchase of Videocon by Dish TV), blamed certain ‘negative forces’ for the share price collapse, but vowed to repay all group lenders, urging them not to panic."

87,2019-01-29,Zee,"According to estimates, Essel Group has a debt burden of  ₹17,000 crore across 87 operating firms as of March 31, 2017Subhash Chandra, who controls 41% of Zee Entertainment Enterprises, is putting half his shares on the block

The opportunity to own the largest broadcaster in a consumer market of 1.3 billion people doesn’t arrive all that often; even more rarely does it come after a single-day 26% rout in the stock.
The special situation has arisen because of Indian infrastructure financier-operator IL&FS Group’s sudden $12.8 billion bankruptcy. Analysts who believed the tremors would reach other shadow-banking entities like Dewan Housing Finance Ltd. were half right. Yes, Dewan’s loan disbursements fell 95% from a year earlier in the December quarter amid pressure on the mortgage lender to deleverage. But the shock waves have now spilled beyond finance to reach the glamorous world of television content.
Subhash Chandra, the founder who controls 41% of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., is putting half his shares on the block after making wrong-way leveraged bets in unrelated industries such as infrastructure, a mistake the tycoon acknowledged in an open letter on Friday evening. Although the stake-sale plan has been known for a while, the official explanation so far was that Zee wanted a partner to become a “global media-tech player."" It’s clear now that the real reason is the debt load of Chandra’s Essel Group. BloombergQuint estimates the burden at  ₹17,000 crore ($2.4 billion) across 87 operating companies as of March 31, 2017.
The collapse of IL&FS found a mention in Chandra’s mea culpa. The implosion of the highly rated lender raised financing costs for everyone who had borrowed short-term funds to invest in long-term assets such as roads, power stations, waste-management plants, or in the case of drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s billionaire founder Dilip Shanghvi, apartment complexes and windmills. The collateral for these forays in most instances was shares of their successful, publicly traded operating companies.
But as both Shanghvi and Chandra recently found out, collateral can wear thin very quickly. All it takes is a whistleblower complaint of financial irregularities or a news article insinuating links with a company allegedly dealing in unaccounted-for cash to make the stock price plunge. Strenuous denials or defamation lawsuits can’t quite set things right with creditors left edgy by IL&FS’s defaults, though a weekend meeting with lenders does seems to have bought Chandra time to conclude the sale of his crown jewel.
Zee, where I worked briefly in the 1990s, is a content powerhouse with a 20% share of India’s traditional television viewing market. The network also boasts 35% Ebitda margins despite heavy investment in Zee5, a fast-growing digital app. There’s no confirmed bidder yet, but according to a report in the 'Business Standard', Zee may be of interest to Amazon, Apple Inc., Tencent Holdings Ltd., AT&T Inc., Singapore Telecommunications Ltd., Comcast Corp. and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.
If that weren’t already a long list, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., a telecom operator controlled by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, is also likely to join the contest, the article said. If Ambani snags the asset, his triple play of carriage, content and commerce could deal a blow to Amazon boss Jeff Bezos’s multibillion-dollar plan to dominate e-tailing in India.
Demand for digital video in India is exploding as Ambani drives down data prices. With an enterprise value of $4.8 billion, and more cash than debt, Zee has a good chance to take on 21st Century Fox Inc.’s local-streaming platform, HotStar, as well as Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime.
But a quick deal is critical. Lenders have agreed to a standstill. While that helped the stock recover from Friday’s carnage, lenders’ patience will have a limit. General elections will be held soon; and the opposition Congress party, which has started fancying its chances in the polls, is no fan of Zee Media Corp.’s news operations. (Chandra became a member of parliament with the support of the ruling party in 2016.)
Media isn’t the only asset in play. The TV mogul has also put a chunk of his road portfolio on the block, though with the beleaguered IL&FS also looking to offload its transport investments, buyers are spoiled for choice. It’ll be easier to deleverage by selling Zee than by disposing of a bunch of highways. If the pressure to come up with liquidity forces Chandra to cede control of his TV empire, then the new owner will have the deadbeat infrastructure financier IL&FS to thank.

85,2019-01-30,Zee,"We need many such hardy souls, willing to prosecute for themselves as well as for the Indian business

From Satyendra Dubey to Arvind Gupta, a few brave men and women have over the years striven to expose the stinking caverns within Indian companies even as agencies and executives charged with that task failed to do their duty. Dubey was an Indian Engineering Services officer working as a project director for the National Highways Authority of India in which capacity he exposed serious financial irregularities by contractors of the project. For that brave deed he had to pay with his life, murdered in cold blood on the night of 27 November 2003.
His sacrifice though was not in vain as the uproar over his death led to the Public Interest Disclosure and Protection of Informers Resolution (PIDPIR) in 2004. Gupta, in the news now, blew the lid on the alleged loan fraud and the quid-pro-quo between Chanda Kochhar and her family and the Videocon group, a case which is now being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation.
Dubey and Gupta and a handful of others like them, given the honorific label of whistleblowers, are only now coming out of the shadows and serving as models for others to emulate. Figures show that the number of complaints Indian companies are receiving from whistleblowers is increasing at a rapid pace.
Whether it is in the infamous Satyam fraud in 2009 or in the more recent case of the Zee group, it has been a missive from a whistleblower that has precipitated the crisis.
In the first instance, according to a report filed by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), Byrraju Ramalinga Raju’s admission of embezzlement came after an anonymous email to a Satyam board member apparently was sent by a former senior executive of the company. In the Zee case, too, a whistleblower’s letter to the SFIO ultimately led to Subhash Chandra’s admission of the acute financial crisis within his group.
One difference is that complainants are no longer restricting themselves to sending letters to regulators and then sitting back and waiting for action to be taken. They are actively pursuing cases of deemed fraud, communicating with regulatory agencies in India and even abroad, as in the case of ICICI Bank where the whistleblower wrote to the US Securities and Exchange Commission.
Poor internal control mechanisms along with leadership teams that lack integrity and supported by pliant independent directors have led us to believe either that frauds are rare or that their detection is difficult. Neither is obviously true. The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners in its 2018 Report to the Nations on Occupational Fraud and Abuse estimated that a typical organization loses 5% of its annual revenues to fraud. The report concluded that collectively these caused more than $7 billion in actual damages and, significantly, that 50% of frauds are detected following tips.
In an interview with National Herald, Gupta makes the point that his detailed alert to regulators and the bank’s committees was based on an analysis of whatever was available in the public domain. Yet, until he sounded the alarm, no one thought it necessary to make even the most basic of enquiries about the suspicious nature of the transactions and even after the media had highlighted the case, the ICICI Bank board chose to give a clean chit to Kochhar.
Corporate filings reveal that whistle-blowing is much more common within companies, evidence that employees are beginning to feel more secure about pointing out misdemeanours they see around them.
The 2011 Whistleblowers Protection Act, which became a law in 2014, also gives them the safety net that was missing earlier so that men like Gupta now don’t need the cloak of anonymity.
The Companies Act, 2013, as well as Securities and Exchange Board of India regulations have made it mandatory for companies to pay heed to all such complaints. Despite that, there are very few cases where a whistleblower’s warnings have been taken up in earnest by companies.
Effective action taken early when an alarm is sounded can prevent catastrophic consequences later. One of the champions of whistleblowing is Sherron Watkins, vice-president at the notorious Enron Corp. It was Watkins who sounded the alarm on the company’s fraudulent accounting practices that ultimately led to its collapse. However, in August 2001, when she first alerted then- CEO Kenneth Lay of accounting irregularities, she was ignored. We know where that went.
The fear is that unless more cases in India are promptly investigated and brought to their logical conclusion, the efficacy of whistleblowers as instruments of change will continue to be debatable.
Whistleblowers International, a practice group of the Brian Krauss law firm, has a fascinating history lesson on its site: “The concept of whistleblowing on behalf of one’s government dates back to 7th century England. The term qui tam, which today usually refers to False Claims Act cases, is shortened from the Latin phrase qui tam pro domino rege quam pro se ipso in hac parte sequitur that translates to he who prosecutes for himself as well as for the King.""  
We need many such hardy souls, willing to prosecute for themselves as well as for the health of Indian business.

83,2019-01-31,Zee,"Essel’s founder Subhash Chandra said that it has increased debt levels and a diminished ability to service borrowingsDefaults at IL&FS have roiled the credit market and made it harder for other non-bank lenders to access funds

 India’s shadow lenders are facing a fresh threat, just as they were starting to recover from the fallout of landmark defaults last year by one of their own.
The lenders could come up against a new cash shortage, if concerns about debt at conglomerate Essel Group ricochet through India’s money markets, according to Citibank and Credit Suisse. There’s reason to think that may happen, the argument goes, after Essel’s billionaire founder Subhash Chandra said on Friday that it has increased debt levels and a diminished ability to service borrowings.
Here’s how things could get ugly: Mutual funds hold a lot of debt securities issued by Essel Group. Those funds also invest in commercial paper and other short-dated borrowings from the so-called non-bank financing companies. If the mutual funds face redemptions due to concerns about Essel, they might have to sell off NBFC debt also, which would effectively crimp an important financing channel for those shadow lenders.
Media tycoon Chandra said in an open letter that poor investments in the infrastructure sector combined with the meltdown of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd. have led to increased debt and losses. Defaults at IL&FS have roiled the credit market and made it harder for other non-bank lenders to access funds.
Concerns about Essel may lead to “a second wave of risk aversion in domestic debt funds and volatility in their flows,"" according to a January 28 investor note by Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt."
84,2019-01-31,Zee,"Stakeholders thought it wise to adopt the code before govt imposed censorship

Earlier this month, a clutch of over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platforms adopted a self-regulatory content code to avoid probable government censorship. Among the signatories are streaming platforms of big broadcasting companies such as Hotstar, Voot, Zee5 and SonyLIV as well as independent firms such as Arre, ALT Balaji, Netflix and Eros Now. In the self-regulatory Code of Best Practices signed under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), the streaming platforms have been referred to as Online Curated Content Providers.
The code is based on the premise that as the OCC industry grows, it will play an increasingly important role in the socio-economic landscape of the country. According to Uday Sodhi, business head, digital, at Sony Pictures Networks, which owns SonyLIV, as the OTT industry achieves scale, “it is time to lay down guidelines for ourselves. The consumer has expectation of maturity from us. We should start building the processes of protecting him."" OCC providers have changed the way content is created and consumed. It offers freedom from appointment viewing and allows flexibility in terms of time, place and the device it is consumed on. What prompted the code is easy to see. The stakeholders thought it wise to adopt best practices before a government department stepped in and imposed unnecessary censorship. The pressure mounted as public interest litigations (PILs) and complaints against the OTT platforms started emerging. An NGO filed a complaint in Delhi high court against sexually explicit and vulgar content on a streaming site. A few months ago, another lawyer filed a PIL before the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court complaining about gory content and sexually explicit scenes in some web series.
Sodhi says that mature industries like advertising and television follow self-regulation through the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) and Broadcasting Content Complaints Council (BCCC) for non-news channels respectively. “Even when BCCC was formed, naysayers predicted its failure but it has been widely accepted and the government has recognised its role,"" says a media executive declining to be named. Will the code impinge on the creative freedom of writers and directors of content? Sodhi doesn’t think so. “We are only classifying content. It is not like a cinema hall where a viewer walks in and watches a film. On OTT, he’s making a choice. We are giving him appropriate information to make that choice,"" he explains. Supporters of creative freedom of the streaming services expect their content to travel across the world. According to the code, “This effort brings together the key pillars of protecting interests of consumers in viewing content of their choice and defending creative freedom.""
The significance of the code should be seen against the backdrop of the projected growth in the streaming industry. The OTT video streaming market in India is set to touch $5 billion by 2023, according to a Boston Consulting Group (BCG) report titled Entertainment Goes Online. The online video base is expected to expand on the back of rising affluence and increase in data penetration in rural markets. According to the report, 82% of the users in the Indian market are engaged on advertising-led video-on-demand platforms (AVoD) versus 18% who pay for content on subscription-led (SVoD) services. The report estimates that by 2023, 40-50 million users will be paying subscribers of content while 600 million will be engaged on advertising-led platforms. Clearly, there will be a surge in viewers consuming entertainment online. Although most video-on-demand services launched with movie libraries, the focus has now shifted to creating original content. Star India’s video platform Hotstar has recently announced its foray into originals with an investment of   ₹120 crore and a tie-up with 15 filmmakers. As the Indian entertainment market is dominated by single TV households, affordable data is creating an alternative in the mobile as the second screen. This has allowed viewers to consume content at their own convenience. Besides, increasingly, consumers are more open to paying for this convenience.
By 2023, 650 million or 48% of India’s internet users are expected to be from rural areas, the BCG report said. Video-on-demand platforms are likely to tap into this rural boom with regional language content. The creators of the code have also made a provision for a complaints redressal mechanism for consumers. Not surprisingly, the guidelines are being touted as those balancing creative freedom and consumer interests.

82,2019-02-03,Zee,"It’s got tehzeeb, romance and nuance, drawing a growing number of urban Indians to itUrdu is in our lives even if we don’t realize it. But it is only recently that this love for the sound of Urdu has extended to its script

It’s on a Tuesday evening in January, under a canopy of incandescent bulbs, that I receive my first lesson in Urdu: the difference between alcohol and mirages.I am part of a small mehfil gathered in the courtyard of Prithvi Theatre in Mumbai. People greet each other with adaab, and the bonhomie that strangers share is palpable.
In this session of a monthly Urdu meet-up called Mehfil@Prithvi, we are listening to people read ghazals and nazms by the late Pakistani poet Fahmida Riaz. She lived in exile in India for almost seven years during Zia-ul-Haq’s rule, and died in November in Lahore. Riaz wrote heart-wrenching lines on female desire and communalism, such as:
Sarab hun mein
Teri pyaas kya bujhaungi
Urdu scholar Ilyas Shauqi, who delivers the lines at the mehfil, explains to me later that sarab means mirage, an illusion, and is often mistaken by non-Urdu speakers for sharab, or alcohol. “Urdu is like this—you have to pay attention to the pronunciation,"" he adds.
Such is my introduction to Urdu, a language that appears to conceal more than it reveals. Writer Annie Zaidi, who often leads the Mehfil@Prithvi sessions, says that while Urdu runs in her family, she learnt to write the Nasta‘līq script as recently as 2017. Annie’s motivation was access, both to the past and the present. “I always wanted to know more about Urdu literature, and there is only so much that you can understand through transliterations. Besides, my grandfather (Ali Jawad Zaidi) is an Urdu writer, and it was a shame that I couldn’t read his works in the original. Urdu should have been my mother tongue but, as things stand, I am more fluent in Hindi,"" she says.
Despite her familiarity with spoken Urdu, the experience of learning the script was nothing short of confounding. She says, “The ligature—the manner in which letters bond with each other in Urdu—was particularly tough. The letters change shape as they form a word and very few phonetic cues are used. I had a friend teach me that over WhatsApp.""
Urdu’s idiosyncrasies are both its charm and challenge, as a growing number of newly forged admirers among urban Indians will testify.
According to 2011 census data on mother tongues released last year, Urdu dropped from sixth to seventh position, showing a drop of 1.58%. The only other language to record a fall was Konkani. Yet Urdu has found new takers. Many of them are spurred on by an interest to read Urdu texts in the original, rather than translations or transliterations. Some want to learn the script for research, for design, or to write poetry. For others, like Annie, it is the chance to revisit their roots. In this mix are non-Muslims, non-Urdu-speaking Muslims, and Urdu-speaking Muslims who never learnt the language formally.
The country’s non-Urdu-speaking population has been nourished for a long time on a literary diet of some of the best prose, poetry and lyrics that the language offers. Bollywood songs, theatre, even the stray couplets that break the monotony of endless Twitter feed scrolls—Urdu is in our lives even if we don’t realize or acknowledge it. But it is only recently that this love for the sound of Urdu has extended to its script as well. Mumbai-based theatre practitioner Danish Husain, who curates the monthly Mehfil@Prithvi and is known for his dastangoi performances, says that while the interest in Urdu has always been there, what he has seen in the last couple of years is “the interest in the text"", whether it’s people reading works intently or dramatizing them.
The revival is linked to the proliferation of online portals and Urdu-themed events in urban centres, such as shayari clubs, Urdu readings and calligraphy classes. Prominent among them is the Noida-based Rekhta Foundation. Through its website Rekhta.org, it offers an Urdu word-of-the-day along with a dictionary (also delivered to users on WhatsApp); offline, it organizes one of the biggest Urdu festivals in the country, Jashn-e-Rekhta. The festival, which debuted in Delhi in 2015, saw over 15,000 visitors; in 2018, the numbers rose to 170,000 (figures from the Rekhta Foundation).
In 2017, following multiple requests from festival attendees and online users, the foundation started a beginner’s Urdu course, with calligraphy and poetry appreciation thrown in for good measure. Simultaneously, it also launched an online education portal, Aamozish.com, through which 35,000 people have studied Urdu so far.
Sarover Zaidi, an anthropologist based out of Mumbai and Delhi who works on religion, architecture and social spaces, believes this growing interest in Urdu is a natural progression of the impact of social media and online resources, which have provided people with more access to the script, something that wouldn’t have been easy even a decade ago. “A large number of people have always been interested in Urdu—even those who did not grow up in cultures where Urdu was accessible. But more people are now responding to it, whether it is their interest in the poetry, literature, or the culture it represents—they are interested in the poetics and politics of it. They want to make a statement,"" she says.
Writing or drawing?
To explore what’s driving urban Indians to the language, I attended an Urdu calligraphy workshop at Mumbai’s Tarq gallery in December. I realized that learning Urdu through the calligraphic Nasta‘līq script requires nothing less than absolute dedication.
The workshop was conducted by Zeenat Kulavoor, a 30-year-old graphic designer and typographer, who has created two murals in Urdu. Both were made in 2017, on the premises of a repurposed mill in Mumbai. One of them is “pehle aap"", evoking the Lakhnavi tehzeeb—the courteous mannerisms once associated with Lucknow. The other mural bears stirring verses that only the mind of poet Nida Fazli—a Padma Shri awardee and staunch critic of the Partition—could have conjured up. As a muralist, Kulavoor refers to the characteristics of not just Urdu but of the cultures that use this language. The reason people are learning Urdu is almost the reason why some of us study French in India—we also consume the culture the language represents.
Kulavoor started learning Urdu at the Sir JJ School of Art in 2008, when she was part of a class project on creating a calligraphy manual. “We had to choose a language from those printed on the Indian currency note. Creating the manual meant understanding the script, breaking it down and then showing users the steps to write the script,"" recalls Kulavoor. She arrived late for class, and the other languages were taken, leaving only Urdu. “That’s how Urdu found me,"" she says.
Kulavoor tried to find an Urdu mentor—but on the internet, the only available resource she could find at the time was a bunch of videos on Arabic calligraphy.
A decade later, she decided to organize workshops focusing not on linguistics but on the form and design elements of the Urdu alphabet. For most of the participants at her 6-hour, beginner-level workshops were looking for something specific—designing calligrams for their projects, for instance.
Entering the world of Urdu calligraphy, however, means unlearning. One of the participants had been meditatively painting a series of be—the second letter of the Urdu alphabet—but realized much later that instead of going from right to left, as Urdu demands, she had been writing instinctively left to right.
Keeping the language alive
Kulavoor’s calligraphy classes come at a time when the generation of veteran kaatibs (calligraphers), the ones who populated Old Delhi’s lanes and Mohammed Ali Road in Mumbai, is fading. On 30 January, one such noted figure, Shilp Guru Irshad Hussain Farooqi, a resident of Delhi, died.
Shipra Dutta, 45, got reacquainted with Urdu to save a family legacy. Dutta is a fourth-generation calligrapher—her great-grandfather served as an accountant in the court of Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. The story in her family is that he was chosen to maintain the accounts not because of his mathematical skills, but rather for his penmanship in mahajani (a mercantile script) and thuluth (an Islamic calligraphic script). When Dutta was offered the chance to calligraph a set of Urdu poems for a Kashmiri pashmina-weaver, she realized she also wished to learn what the words meant. “Urdu is led through the qalam (pen), and there is a visual pleasure in watching it move on paper. It is essentially a dance of hairline strokes and thick strokes, a jugalbandi,"" she says.
A similar interest drew Dhwani Shah, a 31-year-old designer for publisher Tara Books. She signed up in October for Inktober, an annual Instagram hashtag series in which users respond to a word prompt through visual interpretations. Shah drew Urdu translations of the English prompts. She picked up Urdu as a hobby while studying design at Bhasha Bhavan in Gujarat Vidyapeeth, Ahmedabad. Now based out of Chennai, she believes the only way she can keep her interest alive is to go old school—handwritten letters. She is a member of Quillpal.com, a site that helps people make pen pals in the age of blue ticks and DMs. Shah wanted to write her letters in Urdu, and Quillpal luckily matched her with a pen pal fluent in the language.
As with her writing, Shah also tries to infuse her everyday conversations with a dose of Urdu. “Urdu has several words that are poetic and beautiful, but I try to use ordinary words like mehez (merely), fizool (useless), zikr (mention). I can sneak them into conversations without sounding pompous,"" she says.
While calligraphy is one means of popularizing the script, its greatest presence is in the digital form. Urdu printing presses have been on the decline, and have been replaced by a number of apps and digital tools that enable people to type away in Urdu on devices. Nasheet Shadani, a 32-year-old Delhi-based advertising professional, has taken it a step further, harnessing the power of memes to convey some fun facts about Urdu. “People are still learning Urdu in a very 1970s method and I want to make it more contemporary,"" says Shadani.
In 2015, he started a social media project called Ishq Urdu, which mainly operates through Instagram and Facebook. Look it up and you will find some thought-provoking posts—what would Bollywood dialogues be without Urdu? Could “Mogambo prasann hua?"" ever have the same effect as “Mogambo khush hua?""
Shadani’s latest venture introduces the Urdu alphabet to his general audience through a unique series of posts. On a background of pop colours, he designs phrases such as “Hey, what’s up?"" or “Good afternoon"" where “hey"" and “noon"" are, in fact, Urdu alphabets. It’s a simple but smart mnemonic device that he prints on a limited edition series of badges and T-shirts.
Delhi-based historian and scholar Rana Safvi, whose eponymous blog is a great resource for all things Urdu, says: “Urdu uses the same grammar as Hindi. Not that of Farsi."" In her blogpost “My Name Is Urdu And I Am Not A Muslim"", Safvi traces the evolution of the language and recalls Australian linguist Peter Austin’s observation that “Urdu and Hindi have the same roots in the emerging Indo-Aryan language varieties spoken in an area centred on Delhi, and specially the variety called Khari Boli, which spread throughout India under the Muslim armies of the Delhi Sultanate (13th to 15th century).""
In present-day India, Safvi notes: “Associated as it is in people’s eyes with Muslims, it has become nothing but a trap for vote-bank politics, unkept promises and empty dreams. The only silver lining is that it still lives in the hearts of many across religious lines, in our Hindi films and TV serials, the crowds flocking to mushairas, and the number of sites which provide SMS lines on the internet. ""
Love it, hate it
So, what’s the culture that Urdu signifies? That of a genteel past or a polarized present?
The recent Twitter hashtag movement #MyNameinUrdudrew attention to a prevalent prejudice against the Urdu script. Using this hashtag, Twitter handles sported user names in Urdu—many among them non-Urdu speakers. It was a statement against communal hatred and incessant trolling, but there was a catch—the Google transliteration app didn’t always succeed accurately. Those familiar with Urdu came forward on Twitter to do the job instead.
In 2016, signboard painter Akhlaq Ahmad and French street artist Swen Simon were forced by a small group of people in Delhi to deface their mural of an Urdu couplet in praise of the city. Their lines read: Dilli tera ujadna, aur phir ujad ke basna. Woh dil hai toone paya, sani nahi hai jiska. It sounds like Hindi, except it was written in Urdu. The group reportedly questioned the artists’ Nasta’līq script and asked them to replace it with the words “Swachh Bharat Abhiyan"" and “Narendra Modi"", in Hindi. They labelled the artists “Lahoris"".
The Delhi government, however, has been attempting to promote Urdu. In November, it held Jashn-e-Virasat, a celebration of tehzeeb, with the support of the Urdu Academy. Previously held at Jama Masjid, Old Delhi, this edition took place at Central Park in Connaught Place, a location which brought the event, and the language, closer to a cosmopolitan crowd. But Asad Ashraf, the founder of a community project called Karvaan India, is attempting the reverse—getting people closer to the localities where Urdu is used.
Karvaan’s office, situated in Delhi’s Ghaffar Manzil, a Muslim-dominated area, houses a library and a workspace for creative professionals, writers and “fellow travellers"". In the past year, Karvaan has increased its programming, focusing on topics pertinent to its immediate community, such as the ghettoization of Muslims and talaq, while also opening its doors to a wider public.
It is with the same intent that Ashraf launched Urdu Hai Jiska Naam last year. The title of the weekend classes comes from a famous sher by Urdu poet Dagh Dehlvi. Last year, 35 participants enrolled in the class. This year, there were 300 applicants, but Karvaan has resources enough to register only 100, despite doubling batches. Of these, only eight are Muslims.
The class is conducted by entrepreneur Tanzil Rahman, an Indian Institute of Management Bangalore graduate. He recalls the time when he was first taught the Urdu alphabet in school. “We practised on a wooden plank which functioned as a slate called a takhti, as big as two MacBooks placed side-by-side. On this, we wrote the alphabet in ink. We did this before we switched to paper because kushkhat, or neat handwriting, is very important,"" he explains.
As an Urdu mentor, Rahman’s method is different. He prefers to keep the course functional and contemporary, and helps participants recognize Urdu in its popular usage, from film dialogue to signboards at railway stations. “Take Nizamuddin station, for example. Isn’t the iconic yellow signboard a great way to learn how Nizamuddin is written in Urdu?"" he says. He delves a little further into the intricacies of Urdu, the manner in which vowel sounds are dropped and how you understand words by contextualizing them.
He says Urdu is taught now only in some public schools but rarely in private schools. “So people have to make use of independent courses like these. The classes are useful also for Muslims whose mother tongue is Urdu because while many may speak the language, not all know how to write it,"" he adds.
Savio Pashana, 30, a designer and a spoken word performer, is part of a growing circle of spoken word poets in Thane who organize performances under the banner of Poetry Tuesday. Some of the members performed their Urdu pieces in January at the Spoken Fest in Mumbai. “The biggest disservice we have done to the language is to give it a homeland in Pakistan alone. But think about it—Bhagat Singh wrote letters to his family in Urdu,"" he says.
Urdu was once used extensively by Hindus as well as Muslims, and even the British, though it may be mainly Muslim communities that are keeping it alive on a daily basis today. By encouraging participants to come closer to minority communities that still use Urdu as their mother tongue, Karvaan is suggesting that the secularization of Urdu need not mean that it makes Muslims invisible.
Shaikh Aquil Ahmad, director of the National Council for the Promotion of Urdu Language (NCPUL) in Delhi, says, “People are not learning it for religious reasons alone. It’s because Urdu zubaan mein behad mithaas hai (it is a very sweet language).""
Beyond the politics
“A nukta can make a huge difference,"" says Mumbai resident Shirlyn Galbao, 44, referring to the wily dot that is the cornerstone of the Urdu alphabet. Galbao says she was already familiar with the lilt of Urdu, but the urge to master the language was driven by two sources—her job as a voice-over artist and a monthly baithak. Galbao wished to perfect her talafuz (pronunciation), particularly because several Hindi commercials, especially on radio, are sprinkled with Urdu words. Her search led her to Katha Kathan.
Katha Kathan, a series of dramatized readings of Urdu’s best literary names, was initiated by former ad-man Jameel Gulrays, after he felt the need to share Urdu’s literary wealth in a time when it is being offered in fewer schools across India as a second language—they would rather offer French, German, even Japanese. Gulrays has translated several short stories by Urdu writers.
He disliked the Nandita Das film Manto, finding it an inauthentic representation of the Urdu writer, and chooses to commemorate the writer across baithaks—celebrating Manto’s “Bambai"", his short stories and his Marathi translations. Gulrays’ readings are available on YouTube; he has made 1,200 videos so far.
Galbao started with these baithaks and eventually found a mentor in Gulrays, who teaches with a blackboard and a list of primary school textbooks, and recommends reading Urdu newspapers. Galbao has piles of Urdu newspapers, which never fail to catch the attention of her friends. “My Muslim friends don’t speak Urdu and often wonder if I will teach them Urdu when they see the newspapers,"" she laughs, adding that some acquaintances have asked her why a Catholic should wish to study an “Islamic"" language.
As Shadani says, a revival need not be literary or political. Sometimes, a college student may want to study Urdu simply to flaunt it, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. As Ahmad says, “Urdu is mohabbat ki zubaan—the language of love.""

Transaction value have been calculated based on weighted average price of the stock on the day of sale and the number of shares sold.
A query sent to the Essel group seeking reasons for the open market sale of shares did not elicit any response till the time of filing of this report.
On Sunday, the Essel group said it had sealed a formal agreement with its lenders, under which it gets time till September to deleverage or pare its debt.
The agreement was with those lenders who have taken pledged shares of the group flagship and listed entities, Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Dish TV India.
On January 25, 2019, Essel group companies had come under massive selling pressure, plummeting up to 33%, and suffered a combined erosion of  ₹13,352 crore in market valuation.
On January 26, Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra had said his company is in a financial mess and has blamed the same for the aggressive bets on infra, which has gone out of control since the IL&FS crisis and also the acquisition of Videocon's D2H business.
Apologising to lenders, Chandra also alleged that some negative forces are out to sabotage his efforts to raise money through a strategic sale in the flagship company Zee Entertainment Enterprises. 
This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text."
80,2019-02-06,Zee,"The move to sell some of its finance businesses is part of Essel Group’s broader efforts to deleverage itselfIn November, the group announced a 50% stake sale in Zee Entertainment Enterprises

Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group, under pressure from lenders to pare debt, is looking to sell parts of its financial services business, two people aware of the development said.
“They are looking at the lending business and the mutual fund business,"" said one of the two people cited above, requesting anonymity. “They have started reaching out to prospective buyers.""
The discussions are at an early stage and the exact contours of the stake that the group is willing to sell in these businesses will be determined based on how the talks progress, added the person.
The move to sell some of its finance businesses is part of Essel Group’s broader efforts to deleverage itself. The group has already initiated talks to sell stakes in broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd and road and solar power assets. The group’s current state, by chairman Chandra’s own admission, is because of misplaced bets in infrastructure projects and the purchase of a rival satellite TV business.
A spokesperson for Essel Group declined to comment on Mint’s queries regarding plans to monetize its financial services businesses, stating that the group does not respond to speculation.
The group’s financial services arm operates businesses including foreign exchange, lending to small and medium businesses, home finance, mutual funds, wealth management, private equity and investment banking.
In 2016, Essel Finance acquired Peerless Mutual Fund, which then had assets under management worth close to  ₹1,000 crore.
In November, the group announced a 50% stake sale in Zee Entertainment Enterprises. It said then the move would help maximize long-term value and transform it into a global media-tech player. It hired Goldman Sachs (India) Securities Pvt. Ltd as an investment banker and Lion Tree as an international strategic adviser to manage the stake sale.
The group is also in talks with private equity investor Actis LLP to sell Essel Infraprojects Ltd’s solar power projects for  ₹5,500-6,000 crore, Mint reported in November.
Last month Mint reported the group had placed six road projects on the block and was seeking a combined enterprise value of  ₹11,500 crore.
While the group has been engaged in talks over the last several months to sell various assets, the divestments have assumed more urgency after the group’s flagship media business saw a 26% drop in its stock price on 25 January.
Following the stock plunge, Chandra, in a statement to shareholders, said his group was facing headwinds due to bets gone wrong in infrastructure, the acquisition of DTH business of Videocon group and the liquidity crisis that plagued non-banks after defaults by IL&FS.
On Monday, the group said it had sealed a formal agreement with its lenders, which gives it till end-September to deleverage its balance sheet. The group entered into the agreement with lenders who hold pledged shares of its listed entities Zee Entertainment Enterprises and Dish TV India.
“As per the consent, the lenders have agreed that there will not be any event of default declared till 30 September 2019, due to the movement in the stock price of Essel Group’s mentioned listed corporate entities,"" the company said.

New Delhi: Bhushan Kumar-led film and music company T-Series has announced its foray into the digital world with the production of web series and shows. Vinod Bhanushali, currently president, media, marketing, publishing (TV) and music acquisitions at T-Series, will head the venture.
“This is the time to expand into the digital space with shows and films,"" Kumar said in a statement. “There exists a huge audience across the globe that you reach out to with this medium. Web shows and films have an audience for all kinds of genres of storytelling and different languages as well. Along with producing films, we want to create content for the digital space and give a platform to new directors and storytellers.""
Bhanushali and his team have started work on the script and pre-production of a few series and films and are looking to collaborate with digital platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar and Zee5.
“Digital viewership is growing at a rapid speed and this is a huge platform. Web shows and films have their own set of audiences and are a huge market as everyone — all ages, races, languages, communities across the world are hooked on to it,"" Bhanushali said in a statement.
There are some stories that are not meant for the 70 mm screen but need to be told, Bhanushali added.
“They are commercial yet strong content films. With this new space that has evolved, there is a huge demand for web shows and films. We have a lot of scripts coming to us every day and many of them are perfect fit for this medium. We want to give a chance to these storytellers to bring forth their stories,"" Bhanushali said.
Earlier this year, T-Series announced 11 feature film productions, including Ajay Devgn-starrer 'De De Pyaar De', 'Kabir Singh', a remake of Telugu blockbuster 'Arjun Reddy' starring Shahid Kapoor, Salman Khan’s 'Bharat', 'Batla House' starring John Abraham, 'Tanhaji' featuring Ajay Devgn and Varun Dhawan’s dance film 'Street Dancer 3', among others.
While the company’s last release 'Why Cheat India' failed to set the cash registers ringing with collections of only  ₹8.78 crore, T-Series had an impressive 2018 with hits like 'Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety' ( ₹100.80 crore), 'Raid' (Rs. 98.02 crore) and 'Satyameva Jayate' ( ₹79.61 crore)."
79,2019-02-18,Zee,"Sebi is said to have stepped in to nix a safety net stitched together by lenders to the Essel groupInvestments in debt securities of companies that are generating cash flow may not be at risk from this event

Capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is said to have stepped in to nix a safety net stitched together by lenders to the Essel group, including mutual funds and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), to throw a lifeline to the beleaguered group. The agreement, in effect, gave an assurance that mutual funds and others holding debt securities issued by the companies of the Essel group would not enforce their rights, including that of liquidating the shares of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), pledged as security, till September 2019. The promoters have this time to sell their stake in ZEEL and the proceeds are to be used for repaying the debt of these group companies.
The parties to the agreement claim that it is a win-win situation for all concerned. The share price does not come under pressure from sale by the lenders, the promoters get time to sell the stake without a compromise on the share price and honour their debt obligations and the investors, including mutual funds, avoid a default in their investment. But is the picture as rosy as it is painted out to be?
The root of the problem is not a default or credit rating downgrade in any of these bonds, some of which come up for redemption only in mid-2019 and most in 2020 and 2021. It started with a 33% fall in the price of Zee shares on 25 January 2019, triggered by a news report that a group company was being investigated for laundering money at the time when the demonetisation announcement was made. The fall in price significantly shaved off the security cushion that the lenders, including mutual funds, had to fall back on in the event of a default by the issuers. The bonds all held above investment grade rating. But apart from Essel Lucknow Raebareli Toll Roads Pvt. Ltd, Essel Propacks Ltd and a few others, the rating received depended upon the security of the pledged shares of the promoters and an erosion in the security cover would eventually lead to a downgrade."
77,2019-02-23,Zee,"The Indian American writer’s latest novel was one of Barack Obama’s favourite books of 2018Kumar’s upcoming book is a creative guide for writing well

""I finally felt I belonged,"" Amitava Kumar says when I ask him about his reaction to Barack Obama including his latest novel, Immigrant, Montana (published in India as The Lovers), in his year-end list of favourites of 2018.
On 28 December, following a personal tradition, the former US president posted on Facebook a list of books, movies and music he “found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved"" last year. Kumar’s novel, set largely in the US, finds a place in that line-up, helmed by Becoming, the best-selling memoir by the former first lady, Michelle Obama (“obviously my favorite!"" her husband quipped in parenthesis), followed by books by several others, such as V.S. Naipaul, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Zadie Smith and Ben Rhodes.
Kumar’s reaction, terse as it may sound, is telling, especially since he has been living in the US for over three decades and is now a US citizen. Born in Bihar, he went abroad for higher education before finally settling there, attaining the status of an immigrant, and eventually becoming an “immigrant writer"". Does it trouble him to be boxed off in that label, I ask, as we sit down in the author’s lounge of the Zee Jaipur Literature Festival 2019 last month for a quick interview. “I never felt bounded by the immigrant novel,"" Kumar says after a brief pause. We go on to parse the generic affinities of this creative entity.
In 2013, Pulitzer-winning writer Jhumpa Lahiri caused a mini-sensation in the literary world when she refused to admit, in an interview to The New York Times, that there was merit to labels like “immigrant fiction"". “What do we call the rest? Native fiction?"" was her riposte, when asked about the term. Kumar is in agreement with her sentiments. “I was as interested in telling stories set elsewhere, such as the one about my first cousin in the village, who was killed by her own father and brother after she had gone to burgle a house and had been held back and raped by the men who caught her,"" he says, recounting a chilling incident from The Lovers. “In that scene, I was presenting what I would call a ‘home product’."" The phrase, incidentally, lent the title to one of Kumar’s earlier books.
Breaking into chaste Hindi every few sentences, often peppered with rustic humour, Kumar is not a textbook immigrant writer. He doesn’t wear any obvious markers of deracination on his sleeves. Even when he switches to English, his speech remains unaffected by Americanisms. Kailash, the protagonist of The Lovers, shares his antecedents (including his initials, since he is nicknamed AK by his fellow students in the US), although Kumar denies any direct resemblance. “Fiction allows you to play with uncertainty,"" he says. “I wanted to foster the idea that AK is me, but that is not the case in reality.""
The novel traces AK’s life as a student, especially his interaction with the maverick scholar Ehsaan Ali (modelled on the real-life Pakistani-origin academic Eqbal Ahmad), and the profound influence he leaves on AK’s impressionable mind. Interspersed with this story of intellectual evolution are tales of AK’s erotic adventures. Moving in and out of the lives of various women, he carries within him a lingering instability, a feeling of being un-homed always—emotionally, physically, geographically. As an immigrant, his fate is not only to lose the home he has left behind in India, but also to gain none in his adopted country.
Perhaps for its allegiance to both worlds, AK’s original homeland as well as the one he adopts, The Lovers operates on a register that is hard to freeze. Juxtaposed with stories of the havoc wreaked by monkeys on AK’s village in Bihar are passages that closely scrutinize Western philosophy. In an earlier novel, Home Products (2007), Kumar had seamlessly put in references to Bhojpuri, politician Lalu Prasad’s legacy, the role of the railways in the South Asian imagination, and other such eclectic vignettes. More recently, the shifting tone and texture of his prose has been interrupted by images, after the style of German writer W.G. Sebald, in whose hand categories like fiction and non-fiction lost their distinctiveness—a loss that brought in its wake immense richness of thought. “In Sebald, the coexistence of images and text keep you questioning the thought behind each photograph, provoking an exercise of the senses,"" Kumar says. Even in his day job as professor of English at Vassar College in upstate New York, he encourages his students to introduce photographic imagery in their writing.
Kumar has also taken to painting and sketching in small notebooks almost as a daily habit. “Earlier, I used to tell my students to write every day and walk every day,"" he says. “Now I urge them to also draw every day."" The idea, he says, struck him during a visit to Michael Ondaatje’s home in Canada, when the latter asked him to read John Berger’s Bento’s Sketchbook, a 20th century classic, impelled by the question: How does the impulse to draw something begin?
Drawing makes one more observant, Kumar says. “And if you are a better observer, you become a better writer too."" On our way to the author’s lounge, he had, in fact, stopped to execute a couple of impromptu portraits with fluent strokes of pen on paper. These flash sketches, Kumar says, are “more purposeful than doodling"", though he plans to enrol himself in drawing classes once he is back in New York. His hands already move with abandon. The only way for him to get these compositions out is by such swift movements, Kumar says, mimicking the haste with which a photographer may take a candid shot.
The confluence of text and image brings us to the literary moment we are currently in. “For me, it is signified by the blurring of fiction and non-fiction, in the emergence of a style that seems to be reporting the world of facts but is actually fictional—it is fiction that makes us aware of the fictionality of the world,"" he says, mentioning the work of writers like Rachel Cusk and Olivia Laing’s novel Crudo. Kumar’s new book, titled Writing Badly Is Easy (Badly, in the title, is in strike through), to be published later this year in India, is also such a literary experiment. “It is a work in mixed form,"" he says, “bringing together self-help, interviews, essays, fiction"".
The book is his attempt to rescue graduate students in the US from “producing sawdust"", Kumar says, and those in this country from “writing bureaucratese"". Sounds like the sort of jolt we need at a time when publishing is being turned into a democratic right rather than an exercise in merit and election."
75,2019-03-14,Zee,"Subhash Chandra wants a 30% premium, seeks to retain 20% in the firmThe entire amount raised through the stake sale would be used to repay promoter debt 

Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony Corp. is in advanced talks to buy a stake in Subhash Chandra-controlled Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) and form a strategic partnership, three people aware of the discussions said.
Chandra is looking to sell 20-25% stake in the BSE-listed company that is struggling to raise funds and pay off debt, said the people cited above, requesting anonymity.
They said the entire amount raised through the stake sale would be used to repay promoter debt worth  ₹13,000 crore.
The talks have reached the valuation stage, wherein Chandra wants to sell the stake at a premium of about 30%, said the first of the three people cited above. The sticking point could be the quantum of stake Chandra wants to retain in Zee. Essel Group holds a 41.62% stake in Zee, of which more than half is pledged with lenders, according to latest available data.
“He (Chandra) wants to have at least a 20% stake in the company. He wants it. So, that depends on what price he is getting. Almost 940 million shares are there. At  ₹650 level, even if he sells 19%, he gets up to  ₹13,000 crore, which will take care of the situation,"" said one of the three people cited earlier, whose bank has exposure to Zee.
On Wednesday, shares of ZEEL fell 3.35% to close at  ₹448.10, widely underperforming a 0.58% rise in the benchmark Sensex.
A potential deal with Zee—which has as many as 66 television channels across 171 countries—will be a big boost to Sony, the Indian subsidiary of which operates 29 television channels.
Zee has also entered the over the top space with Zee5. Sony, on the other hand, runs the SonyLiv digital platform, which competes with Netflix, Amazon Prime and Fox’s Hotstar, among others. Sony is also active in local film production via its Sony Pictures banner.
Chandra has been in talks with potential buyers to sell the group’s assets, including infrastructure assets and parts of the financial services business. In January, Chandra, who has been under pressure from lenders to pay up, won a three-month reprieve to find a buyer for ZEEL to raise the money.
To be sure, clarity on a potential deal can be ascertained only in the next few weeks as the promoters approach the repayment deadline. Zee managing director Punit Goenka, however, previously claimed that the deadline had been extended beyond April 2019.
A second person aware of the matter said Sony wanted to pick up at least 25%, which would also allow it to have promoter rights. Reliance Industries Ltd had also engaged with Chandra, but the discussions didn’t progress, the person added.
“Moratorium deadline is approaching fast. He might just sell at some discount also,"" this person said.
A spokesperson for Sony said the company had “no comment at this time"". A Zee spokesperson said the company does not comment on speculation. “The stake sale process of ZEEL is in steady progress... Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements,"" the spokesperson said."

72,2019-04-05,Zee,"Bharti Airtel has started due diligence of Zee Entertainment and is expected to make a formal proposal soonAmbani’s Reliance Jio is also considering a bid. For both companies, deliberations are at a preliminary stage

Billionaires Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Bharti Mittal are considering competing bids for a stake in a troubled Indian television network, people with knowledge of the matter said, as their telecom carriers race for content in the world’s second-biggest mobile market.
Mittal’s Bharti Airtel Ltd. has started due diligence of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and is expected to make a formal proposal soon, one of the people said, asking not to be identified citing confidentiality. Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. is also considering a bid, the people said. Deliberations are preliminary and may not lead to a transaction, they said.
A representative for Zee said the company doesn’t comment on speculation though it is in “steady dialogue"" with potential partners. Reliance Jio Infocomm and Bharti did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment.
A successful deal would help the winning bidder add a slew of video services in the scramble for user revenue as the government prepares to auction 5G airwaves this year. Some of the world’s largest telecommunications companies including AT&T Inc., Vodafone Group Plc and KDDI Corp. have been buying film and television production and cable TV assets to bolster earnings as subscribers level off.
Bidding for such assets has accelerated as entertainment providers themselves gather content to offer programming via the Internet and compete with upstarts like Netflix Inc. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Prime service.
Zee, the heavily-indebted broadcaster controlled by former rice trader-turned-media mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking a strategic investor to help fend off competition from Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of local TV channels vying to tap India’s booming demand for content.
Zee, which boasts 1.3 billion viewers across 173 countries through its 78 channels and 4,800 movie titles, has previously attracted interest from Sony Corp. and Comcast Corp. but hasn’t found a buyer yet. The television network has offered to sell half of the controlling family’s shares, of which 59 percent is pledged as collateral to lenders.
Jio stormed the market in 2016 with free calls and cheap data and forced some rivals to retreat or merge. Bharti, once No. 1, has been relegated to second position after Vodafone’s local unit combined with billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Idea Cellular.
War Chest
While Bharti has been adding some digital services to its portfolio, such as apps for e-books and music, its scale hasn’t matched Jio, which already offers a bouquet of services including Saavn, a music app, television, news and movies.
In February, Bharti revealed plans to raise as much as 320 billion rupees ($4.6 billion) from a rights issue and bond sales to build a war chest as competition with Jio intensifies. Last year, Bharti entered into a content deal with Zee for exclusive videos on Airtel applications.
In a January interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos to Bloomberg Quint, Mittal said Airtel will have to provide subscribers content from the likes of Zee, Netflix and Amazon to get them to use more data and boost revenue.

NEW DELHI :
On-demand video streaming is no longer restricted to India’s top cities. Even relatively small towns are taking to video streaming in a big way as smartphones become cheaper, data becomes affordable and content is customized to suit the tastes of their residents.
Sadaf Mirza, a 26-year-old resident of Patna, spends all her day studying for the upcoming civil service examinations in June. But nearly an hour post dinner is devoted to her favourite shows on Netflix, Amazon and ZEE5. Mirza has watched Sacred Games, Love Per Square Foot, Lust Stories, Black Earth Rising and Selection Day on her Samsung mobile phone.
“It’s nice to be able to make your own entertainment choice at the end of the day when there’s no disturbance or distraction,"" Mirza said. “The episodes are short and I can watch them when I want.""
Considered a high-end, urban metro phenomenon for long, video streaming services are now making their way to India’s small towns, with platforms claiming anything between 40-50% of their consumption coming from these areas.
What helps is that foreign content is subtitled and dubbed into multiple Indian languages—even Netflix dubbed its adventure drama Mowgli into Tamil and Telugu, besides Hindi.
Akash Banerji, head of marketing, partnerships and licensing at Voot, said one of the things the company has been increasingly seeing on the Jio phone, which carries the Voot app, is that towns such as Jaipur, Raipur and Bhopal surface on the list of top 10 markets, which never happened earlier.
Voot is the digital arm of media and entertainment company Viacom18 Media Pvt. Ltd.
“These (homes in smaller towns) are predominantly single television households, which means that the mobile phone is one of the most liberating screens for an individual. With data charges having dropped by over 90% in the last two years and the amount of data available in a specific pack increased by 13-14 times, the biggest consumption has come from these places,"" said Neeraj Roy, managing director and CEO of Hungama Digital Media that runs the Hungama app.
According to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report 2019, mobile subscriber growth in India last year was led by rural areas, where figures went up from 499 million in 2017 to 526 million in 2018. Rural internet subscribers rose from 132 million to 197 million in the same period.
There isn’t much of a difference in the content consumed by their big and small town viewers, especially when it comes to shows in non-Hindi languages such as Tamil and Telugu, said Vishal Maheshwari, India head of Viu, a video streaming service run by Hong Kong-based PCCW Media. Its Telugu original Pelli Gola works across Andhra Pradesh—be it Hyderabad, Vizag or Amalapuram.
Sunil Lulla, group CEO of Balaji Telefilms, said thrillers Apharan and Ragini MMS and romance drama Dil Hi Toh Hai, are some of the most watched shows across Hindi-speaking markets on the ALTBalaji app, 35% of the consumption of which comes from outside the top 50 cities.
“When you’re creating content for a specific target group, the homogeneity of content consumption tends to be very secular. While there may be differences in terms of what the Hindi and Tamil markets would watch, within that geography they tend to watch the same stuff,"" Maheshwari said. “We are fundamentally trying to appeal to a mindset, not age or geographical set, that has an aspiration and hope everywhere. It doesn’t depend on whether you are in a metro or small town.""
Voot’s Banerji said that democratization of technology cannot be limited to just the top eight metros.
“The growth story is only going to come from the small towns. The profile of the first 100 million consumers will be very different from the next 100 million. They are very clearly new users coming in from small towns or rural areas, who add substantial volume to the pie,"" he said."
70,2019-04-09,Zee,"Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALT Balaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now, have adopted a self-regulatory Code of Best PracticesWhile streaming platforms have the right to acquire the uncensored version of a film, most players prefer the CBFC version

New Delhi: A couple of weeks ago, YouTube put an age restriction on filmmaker Anand Patwardhan’s acclaimed documentary 'Raam Ke Naam', opening the film with a disclaimer saying it may be ‘inappropriate for some users’. The 27-year-old film that explores the campaign waged by the Vishva Hindu Parishad to build a Ram temple at the site of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and the communal violence it triggered, had been passed by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) with a ‘U’ (acceptable for universal audiences) certificate during release, aired on Doordarshan and won the National Film Award for Best Investigative Documentary.
YouTube did not respond to Mint’s queries on its censorship policies but 'Raam Ke Naam' is not the only instance of a film losing out on some sections of an online audience, a space traditionally considered free and conducive to creative expression. Adult comedy 'Hunterrr', currently available on Netflix and Amazon Prime, has several sequences cut on the latter, besides being taken off services such as Hotstar and Viu after backlash on social media for its explicit content. Movies like 'The Dirty Picture' have also been censored massively on Amazon.
To be sure, nine video-streaming platforms, including Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALT Balaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now, have adopted a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI), prohibiting the showcasing of certain kinds of content online, classifying it into age-appropriate categories and providing a mechanism for grievance redressal. However, there is no specific mandate on films already certified for theatrical exhibition.
“At present, The Cinematograph Act doesn’t cover over the top (OTT) platforms, the censor certificate is only issued for (films meant for) theatrical exhibition. In the absence of any regulation or act, any platform will be framing and executing its own policies and guidelines. So the whole question of why an OTT platform alters content does not arise from a legal perspective,"" according to Girish Dwibhashyam, head, content, consumer engagement and business development at Indian video -treaming service Spuul.
Today even a platform such as Facebook employs 30,000 people to monitor user-generated content, Dwibhashyam added. Some other services use artificial intelligence and machine learning. So different methods are being used to streamline content, censorship only being one of them.
“And as of now, they have the right to do that,"" Dwibhashyam added.
Also responsible is the open and free nature of the web itself.
“Though the digital world is supposed to be democratic, the pressures are the same as when one is bringing a film to theatres,"" said 'Hunterrr' director Harshvardhan Kulkarni, referring to the backlash for his film after which it was taken off Hotstar and Viu.
“The kind of policing and mob mentality you witness is bizarre. And unlike the CBFC, it’s not just one board. Everyone is a critic online,"" Kulkarni said. The pressure for writers and directors to compromise and abide by the radicals whom the Internet has given a platform to, wasn’t prevalent earlier.
To be sure, while all streaming platforms have the right to acquire the uncensored version of a film, most players currently prefer the CBFC version.
“Principally, it can be done (taking the uncut version) because there is no norm or rule saying it can’t. But it’s a call that the streaming platform takes and these (self-regulation and censorship) principles work well from the point of view of catering to the lowest common denominator (among the audience),"" according to Ali Hussein, chief operating officer, Eros Now. Hussein was referring to the common tactic employed by streaming platforms — to play as safe as you possibly can with content according to the nature of your brand and target audience to reach out to bigger numbers. Not too much happened as far as (the censoring or lack of it) theatrical content on digital platforms was concerned, but there should be developments soon, he added.
“For every fan, there is a cynic. That has always been the case, but there was no social media earlier (to make it evident). But I do not think that will change as long as there are quality narratives, in fact audiences will have more responsibility for stories that are told (by being able to criticise freely) ,"" Hussein said."
69,2019-04-11,Zee,"Kotak Mahindra AMC, HDFC AMC among mutual funds forced to withhold or roll over FMPs with exposure to the Essel GroupMutual funds have  ₹7,000 crore exposure to Essel Group. The paper in question was backed by shares in Zee

Troubles in the debt market have finally reached the doorsteps of mutual fund investors, with Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co. Ltd withholding part of the redemptions from one of its fixed maturity plans (FMP).
The development has attracted the attention of the stock market regulator, which has asked all mutual funds to provide details of debt schemes backed by promoter shares.
Two Essel Group companies in which the FMP had invested had not repaid in full. That forced the asset manager to hold back part of the payments when the plan matured on 8 April.
The redemption clock began ticking in January when the Essel Group companies, to which mutual funds had lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against debt securities, neared a payment default. The funds agreed not to sell the pledged promoter shares until end-September. In the meantime, Kotak’s FMP—which too had lent to Essel—has come up for redemption, rendering the AMC unable to pay the entire redemption amount.
Lakshmi Iyer, head of fixed income at Kotak AMC, said except for one FMP, the fund had returned “100% of the principal amount"" to investors. “The impact is primarily on the returns. We have kept aside some units with their corresponding net asset value (NAV) and we expect to allow investors to realize these units once the Essel Group companies pay us back, latest by 30 September 2019. We refrained from selling the shares that were collateral for the papers concerned because this would have caused a market panic and wouldn’t have allowed us to realize their full value,"" Iyer said over the phone.
FMPs are close-ended funds with a fixed maturity period. They invest in debt instruments, with maturity matching the tenure of the scheme. In this case, the loan was given against pledged shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, the flagship company of Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group.
Nilesh Shah, managing director of Kotak Mahindra AMC, said that in return for forbearance on selling the collateral against the Essel Group companies’ debt, the AMC has secured additional concessions. “We have taken personal guarantee of Subhash Chandra, the promoter of Essel Group, over and above Zee Entertainment shares for better security. We have also secured upside sharing on a graded basis on stake sale in Zee over and above the coupon rate of the existing debentures,"" he said. The Essel Group has put 50% stake in Zee on the block to raise money and repay debt.
An Essel group statement said: “The lenders have unanimously extended support to the Group and the same has positively resulted in saving the loss of public money. The arrangement with the lenders has also given the Group, the required time to realise the right value from the stake sale of ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and has indeed stabilized the stock performance of the mentioned public listed entity.""
Separately, HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, India’s largest asset manager, on Wednesday extended the maturity of one of its FMPs maturing on 15 April 2019 to 29 April 2020.
“The purpose of rollover or extension is due to current interest rate scenario and portfolio positioning; the yields prevailing in the short-maturity bucket present an option for investors to lock in their investments at current prevailing yields,"" an HDFC AMC statement to investors said.
Typically, in a situation where assets are not realized, AMCs have three options—take a hit on their books, roll over the scheme or mark down the value of security to zero.
Altogether, nine AMCs have lent to Essel Group across 87 schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds. As a percentage of scheme assets, exposure to Essel Group ranges from a negligible amount to as much as 21.01% in Kotak FMP Series 187. Kotak AMC has exposure to Essel Group debt across six FMPs.
Other funds that have exposure to Essel Group debt are SBI Asset Management Co. Ltd, HDFC AMC, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management Ltd, Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd, Aditya Birla Sun Life AMC Ltd, UTI AMC Ltd, Baroda Asset Management India Ltd and ICICI Prudential AMC.
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) was watching the situation closely, said a person aware of the matter.
“Sebi will write to Kotak for an explanation on whether trustee approvals were taken. Sebi has so far not given any opinion on the agreement between the fund houses to not sell the Essel Group securities. But Sebi is concerned and has asked all fund houses to give details of debt schemes, which hold paper backed by promoter shares. The roles of trustees on giving approval to such debt schemes is being monitored very closely,"" said this person.
Kotak AMC’s action and the regulator’s response are likely to lay down a precedent for other mutual funds exposed to bad debt. In December 2018, Sebi had allowed so-called side pockets for mutual funds, to segregate bad debt without affecting the larger scheme.
“This is not a side pocket in the literal sense but more of holding back the securities that were not realized,"" said Kaustubh Belapurkar, manager- research at Morningstar.
Fair valuation norms require all schemes holding other bonds of the defaulting issuer taking a write-down on their holdings; this would impact NAV and returns of those funds, said Arvind Chari, head-fixed income and alternatives at Quantum Advisors Pvt. Ltd."
68,2019-04-11,Zee,"Chandra is looking to sell his stake in the group's flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises to repay lendersGroup chairman Chandra had late January assured that he would repay lenders in full

MUMBAI :
The Essel group on Thursday affirmed its commitment to repay each debtor, a day after two leading mutual funds delayed repayment commitments to investors on their exposure to the Subhash Chandra-led group.
Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company (AMC) and HDFC AMC had on Wednesday admitted to redemption pressures in their select fixed income schemes and sought more time for payouts. The fund houses have an exposure of around  ₹8,000 crore to various debt instruments of the group led by Birla Sun Life AMC and HDFC AMC.
While Kotak Mahindra AMC has reportedly informed the investors of its six schemes that it may not be able to redeem the entire amounts in multiple schemes, while HDFC AMC has ""rolled over"" one of its schemes by as many as 380 days.
""As per the arrangement with the lenders, a resolution for the repayment will be achieved by September 2019. The Essel group is confident to complete the repayment towards each and every lender,"" the group said in a statement late Thursday.
""We remain committed to achieve the resolution by the mentioned timeline, with a sole objective of saving the loss of public money and the repayment of each and every lender,"" the statement added.
It can be noted that while going public with his financial troubles, group chairman Chandra had late January assured that he would repay lenders in full.
Chandra is looking to sell his stake in the group's flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises to repay lenders after borrowings for diversification went awry by halving his stake to 22%.
Most lending by AMCs is against promoter-holdings in Zee, which had seen massive corrections since late January which led to a situation where the lenders should have asked for additional security or sold their holdings.
To prevent further value erosion, the lenders took the unprecedented, and also controversial, step of giving additional time till September for Zee to sell-off the stake and repay the over  ₹8,000 crore owed to them.
Media reports said many players like Reliance, Amazon and even Apple among others are reportedly interested in Zee as Chandra is ready to halve his holding to around 22% in the group.
Without naming any group, Chandra had alleged a particular entity is trying to sabotage his plans.

67,2019-04-12,Zee,"We’ll see a world where commerce, education, entertainment are intertwined on a single platformTelevision will retain pole position as the largest segment, but digital will overtake filmed entertainment in 2019 and print by 2021

The simulacrum is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none. The simulacrum is true.
French post-structuralist philosopher and cultural theorist Jean Baudrillard’s theory from his 1981 text Simulacra and Simulation, that meaning in modern life has been replaced by symbols and that all human existence merely simulates reality, has become the future of television. Baudrillard claims that society has “replaced all reality and meaning with symbols and signs, and that human experience is of a simulation of reality"".
Reality itself has begun to imitate the model, which now determines the real world. “It is a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real,"" Baudrillard says. He calls this hyperreal. Baudrillard’s suggestion is not merely that postmodern culture is artificial. His point, rather, is that we have lost all ability to make sense of the distinction between nature and artifice. He argues that there are three “orders of simulacra"" : 1. It is the reflection of a basic reality (TV). 2. It masks and perverts a basic reality (Reality TV). 3. It bears no relation to any reality whatever: it is its own pure simulacrum (hyperreality).
Hyperreality has different names—augmented reality, virtual reality or connected reality. The premise of this essentially is the lack of ability to distinguish between the reality and a simulation of something, which is at the heart of all conversations around future of television or entertainment. “In five years and beyond we really imagine a world where commerce, education, entertainment are sort of intertwined very easily in living room itself or in any content consumption experience,"" said Amit Goenka, chief executive officer, ZEE International and Z5 Global, ZEE Entertainment Enterprise Ltd.
“For example, I will be watching a movie and I see my protagonist eating pizza and I feel like having a pizza then I can choose to place an order from the screen itself, or maybe I am watching a movie and I like the jacket Shahrukh Khan is wearing, immediately I can switch on the camera on my smartphone and see myself trying on the jacket and see if I would want to buy it,"" said Goenka.
The manufactured simulations appearing more real to viewers than the reality they imitate. This deeper connection with the hyperreal is amplified by the use of disruptive technologies in a post-modern world. It is not limited to visual senses. It’s about recreating digital odours, too.
“In education you could provide a fully immersive experience where if you want to go and study and get to know more about that, so that will be available to you with one click. With the immersive experience you would actually get a 360 view with information and all sorts of add on content that we are already building. Then you could also build in digital scent into this. So it’s exciting stuff. It sounds very futuristic but I feel it would be there in the next four to five years,"" said Goenka.
On 22 October, the company said it had secured a US patent for a unique technology platform to satisfy all five senses of viewers. The platform is something that Zee has been discreetly working on for four-five years at its technology lab in Silicon Valley, US.
However, Goenka was quick to add that for these innovations to thrive, there is a need for strong bandwidth, which can be offered by technologies such as 5G and FTTH (fiber-to-the-home), to work seamlessly.
Such observations also find resonance from voices coming from the West. Social platforms, virtual reality and other technology trends are transforming the future of storytelling, according to 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch .
“We will be in a place where we have entertainments that are indistinguishable from reality at some point in the near future… Innovation and enterprise is being applied to creating this environment, which is going to be a very profound environment and a very profoundly impactful change when we have virtual reality and… it interacts with our natural reality in an environment where everyone is connected,"" Murdoch told James Waldron in a video-taped interview at Talks at Goldman Sachs.
Content will decide the winners of future
A digital revolution is putting more than half a trillion dollars into play. Television and filmed entertainment, especially traditional broadcast TV, is being transformed by the big and fast-growing inroads of internet and over-the-top (OTT) video platforms. Indian media and entertainment sector reached  ₹1.67 trillion ($23.9 billion), a growth of 13.4% in 2018 over 2017, according to the 2019 FICCI-EY report on media and entertainment titled A billion screens of opportunity. With its current trajectory, it is expected to hit  ₹2.35 trillion ($33.6 billion) by 2021.
Television will retain pole position as the largest segment, but digital will overtake filmed entertainment in 2019 and print by 2021. This means a race among media companies to deliver on three things: a huge library of quality content, access to an amazing watch experience on any device and a personalized feed of the most relevant content for each person.
“First, we have moved from broadcast to unicast. The customers want personalized content and personalized offerings, they want it in their own language, so it becomes highly local and visualized as we move forward. They don’t want it to be limited to what’s available in their own region, they want to know what is available to them globally, in their own language support, "" said Gaurav Gandhi, director and head, business, Amazon Prime Video, India.
Consequently, there has been an explosive growth in the production of original content. “We offer distinct things which we believe are our point of distinction for others. The fact of the matter is the story of the scale of Mirzapur or Made In Heaven have not been done before. In a big way what happened here is the same way the multiplexes came and changed the way single screen cinema was, streaming services like ourselves are doing to television and creating cinematic stories of that scale,"" added Gandhi. Platforms are also re-inventing themselves. “The younger audiences today are looking for something crisper, shorter more relevant to today’s time so that’s on the content side, so that is something we have started doing. We have a separate team that does this altogether which is away from our traditional team to make that difference,"" said Goenka.
The use of data and technology is helping them take informed decisions on discoverability, storing, cataloguing, copyrighting, and distributing digital content.
Monetization models will also have to evolve. “Every premise on which media has been built is being challenged. Gut-led calls are being changed to data-led decision making and months are collapsing to weeks in creation,"" said Karishma Bhalla, partner (technology, media and telecommunications practice), The Boston Consulting Group. Digital platforms are on a high growth path, according to the FICCI-EY media and entertainment report. Subscription growth has begun and advertising rates are already at levels much higher than those charged by traditional media. Programmatic advertising could further impact advertising revenue yield. The report, however, cautioned that success will depend on massive growth in reach and more paying subscribers.
Is Television irrelevant?
For Bhalla, both will continue to grow in the short to medium term. “India is content starved. We have a single screen per household in 95% plus households. The personal OTT screen will increase consumption overall. In the data we have seen connected sub consume 1.5X the media vs their unconnected counterparts,"" Bhalla said.
“TV viewing is part of communal viewing in India. It is in that sense a living room product where you consume and discuss content with your family. A digital platform is a bedroom product that is mobile for your own personal consumption,"" according to Ashish Pherwani, partner and head (advisory, media and entertainment) EY. He adds that, while formats can change, devices to consume content can change, the two basic tenets on which TV thrives—knowledge and escapism will continue to drive the future. Knowledge—well, jury is still out on that one, but escapism yes! Or as Baudrillard puts it, “The simulacrum is true."""
66,2019-04-15,Zee,"Funds need to redraw clear lines regarding the risks they are assuming, and investors should follow suitEssel Group companies, of which Zee Entertainment is the flagship firm, came into the mix after repayments were missed late last year

Mutual fund managers were jolted awake to one of the more underrated risks—credit risk. Investors’ goals have been punctured by a slew of defaults, and by what was thought to be safe, “AA"" and above, portfolios.
It started with IL&FS defaulting, which is now turning into a bigger and wider crisis. Mutual fund investors were in for an even bitter surprise six months later, when innovatively structured deals that ended up with equity exposure to companies began to bite. Essel Group companies, of which Zee Entertainment is the flagship firm, came into the mix after repayments were missed late last year.
“Now the time of reckoning has hit home,"" says investor and market veteran Ajay Bagga. He notes that fund houses have lent through structures where even banks would think twice. “With non-reporting of promoter pledges, lending to subsidiaries that would not qualify for bank lending on standalone financials and with post-default standstill arrangements, we now have the makings of a full-blown credit crisis,"" said Bagga.
Fund managers have misread credit risk in a huge way. “Fund managers have clearly not grasped the credit risk. Innovative structures, such as these make sense for alternative investment funds, not debt funds,"" said Prateek Pant, head of products and solutions, Sanctum Wealth Management.
Non-payment by Essel Group firms has led to two fund houses reneging on payments on maturity to investors in their fixed maturity plans (FMP). FMPs are fixed-tenure debt plans that need to invest in debt instruments matching the life of the scheme.
But, of course, fund managers on their part, say that they should not be blamed. They take all measures to protect investor money by ensuring that the underlying security doesn’t lose too much value. “If the collateral is invoked by everyone, there is an even larger loss. It is to protect investors’ money that the standstill agreement made sense. The fund house is not gaining anything,"" said a debt fund manager, requesting anonymity. The standstill agreement between lenders and Essel Group promoters in January entails giving promoters up to September to repay lenders.
But the moot question is, why are fund houses taking unnecessary credit risks? Credit risks don’t spring out of the blue. There are enough cues and advance warnings that, if spotted and acted on early, can avert disaster. Another lesson is to know that invoked pledges can keep the markets on the hook. It’s not easy to sell large amounts of shares. A few days ago, a small block deal in a large bank sent the Bank Nifty on a tailspin. These are the questions investors should ask the credit committees of these funds.
In Bagga’s words, there is no cost to the AMCs, the rating agencies or the wealth advisers who pushed such products. Fund houses cannot hide behind the caveat emptor given the information asymmetry between them and retail investors.
Risks in the credit market can have cascading effects. Funds need to redraw clear lines regarding the risks they are assuming, and mutual-fund investors should follow suit by taking the correct exposure. For its part, the regulator needs to lay out proper risk framework so that the implied risk in a debt fund is not anything other than it is supposed to be.

65,2019-04-17,Zee,"In another option, HDFC AMC will extend maturity date, thus extending time for repaymentInvestors who don’t consent to the rollover will get their money back at the prevailing NAV

Mumbai: HDFC Asset Management Co. Ltd, which has a series of Fixed Maturity Plans (FMPs) exposed to Essel Group, on Monday issued a note on how it will handle them at maturity.
HDFC AMC, India’s largest asset manager, said it will choose one of two options. In the first option, it will distribute proceeds of the FMP on due date of maturity after excluding the value of debt exposures to the Essel Group. 
The residual amount of the maturity proceeds would be paid on receipt of dues from Essel. The same approach was followed by Kotak Asset Management Co. with its Essel-exposed FMPs. 
In the second option, HDFC AMC will rollover the scheme (extend the maturity date) thereby extending the time for possible repayment. Investors must give their consent in writing to such a rollover. Investors who don’t consent to the rollover will get their money back at the prevailing NAV. 
If the Essel papers have been marked at a lower valuation by the AMC to account for the repayment uncertainty, this will be incorporated in the NAV. Also, investors who fail to consent to the rollover and exit at this stage will not benefit from future recoveries in the troubled paper. 
FMPs are close-ended funds with a fixed maturity period. 
They invest in debt instruments, with maturity matching the tenure of the scheme.
Nine AMCs have exposure to Essel Group firms across 87 schemes, including FMPs and open-ended debt funds. The mutual funds have lent a combined  ₹7,000 crore against debt securities.
HDFC AMC has already rolled over one of its FMPs before this note was released. HDFC Fixed Maturity Plan—1,168 days—February 2016 (1) - Regular Plan was due for maturity on 15 April 2019. It was rolled over to 29 April 2020.
The scheme had a roughly 20% exposure to Essel firms. The AMC has another eight FMPs up for maturity between Tuesday and 30 September 2019 with more than 10% exposure to Essel companies.
HDFC AMC’s note has added uncertainty to the woes of investors in debt mutual funds. This is because the AMC has not explained on what basis it will choose one of the two options. The divergent paths chosen by Kotak AMC also lays open the possibility of widely differing approaches of mutual funds hit by the crisis at Essel.
In case of a rollover, investors have to decide whether or not to consent to it. However, there is little information available to unit holders on how the troubled securities are being valued and how they would affect the prevailing NAV. Sebi rules dictate debt securities to be valued by two independent valuation agencies. However, what value has been assigned to the specific securities in question is not disclosed to investors on a day-to-day basis. “For investors who have liquidity requirements, there is no choice. They should take what is on offer now. For those without any liquidity requirements, the chance of the Essel promoter completing a strategic sale and being able to return the money within the next six months is relatively higher based on current news flow. Such investors should give their consent to a rollover,"" said Vishal Dhawan, founder and CEO, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors."
64,2019-04-18,Zee,"The other products which received this tag include Wayanad Robusta coffee from Kerala, Araku Valley Arabica from Andhra Pradesh, Sirisi Supari from KarnatakaThe tag helps growers of these products get premium price

New Delhi: Himachali Kala Jeera, Jeeraphool from Chhattisgarh and Kandhamal Haldi from Odisha are among the 14 products that have received Geographical Indication (GI) tag from the government so far this year.
According to the data with the department for promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT), the other products which received this tag include Coorg Arabica coffee from Karnataka, Wayanad Robusta coffee from Kerala, Araku Valley Arabica from Andhra Pradesh, Sirisi Supari from Karnataka and Himachali Chulli oil.
The tag helps growers of these products get premium price as no other producer can misuse the name to market similar goods.
A geographical indication tag is used for an agricultural, natural or a manufactured product (handicraft and industrial goods) originating from a definite geographical territory.
Typically, such a name conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness, which is essentially attributable to the place of its origin.
Darjeeling Tea, Tirupathi Laddu, Kangra Paintings, Nagpur Orange and Kashmir Pashmina are among the registered GIs in India.
According to experts, the tag gives protection to the producer of those genuine products which command premium pricing in domestic as well as international markets.
""Once the GI protection is granted, no other producer can misuse the name to market similar products. It also provides comfort to customers about the authenticity of that product,"" National Intellectual Property Organisation (NIPO) President T C James said.
Once a product gets this tag, no person or company can sell a similar item under that name. This tag is valid for a period of 10 years following which it can be renewed. GI is covered under a law of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).
Since January 2019, the government has awarded this tag to 14 products.
The first product to get a GI tag in India was the Darjeeling Tea in 2004. There are a total of 344 products from India that carry this indication.

63,2019-04-19,Zee,"The next big step for Zee Studios apart from feature films is its digital content arm Zee Studios OriginalsZee Entertainment has recorded five major hits across languages in last three months

Only one quarter into the calendar year 2019 and Zee Studios says it has reason to celebrate. The Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) owned movie production and distribution company has recorded five major hits across languages in these three months — Manikarnika -The Queen of Jhansi (Hindi) Kala Shah Kala (Punjabi), Anandi Gopal (Marathi), Kesari (Hindi) and Lucifer (Malayalam), together grossing Rs. 375 crore at the worldwide box office.
This is a fairly impressive box office run for a studio technically less than four years into the business. Having halted its film production after Gadar: Ek Prem Katha in 2001, the company returned to it in 2015 with Aishwarya Rai-starrer Jazbaa, and attributes the recent numbers to lessons learnt on the way.
“There is no specific guidance on budget but we are looking a little more at mid-sized, youth-centric films which don’t necessarily burden the project upfront with huge star or director fees,"" said Shariq Patel, chief executive officer, Zee Studios adding that budgets are allocated according to the filmmaker and lead cast in question and the budget for an A-lister will differ from the budget for a newcomer or an actor on the verge of breaking out.
“The same script can have a completely different budget (keeping these factors in mind). Of course there are certain films which need the big star cast but the way we are looking at it is if the story is exciting, we will cast it aptly and not wait for the big stars, and instead churn out productions at a faster clip and the right budgets,"" he said.
The other big focus has been on the people the company is choosing to work with.
“We’ve consciously been looking at selecting the right partners, which means finding the right production partners for anything we are co-producing as well as directors for anything that we are making ourselves,"" Patel said citing the example of Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions with whom Zee has delivered hits like Dhadak and Kesari and is now looking at another film Good News which will be backed by Dharma, lead actor Akshay Kumar and Viacom18 Motion Pictures, apart from Zee.
Patel said Zee is also looking at getting directors to make films exclusive to them. “We’re talking to directors and have signed four names because the other learning is to control the entire (film production) process ourselves, of which IP (intellectual property) ownership and smart exploitation of rights is an important part,"" he said.
Zee has roped in Parmanu: The Story of Pokhran director Abhishek Sharma, Bosco Martis from choreographer duo Bosco-Caesar, Housefull 3 co-director Sajid Samji and Toilet: Ek Prem Katha filmmaker Shree Narayan Singh for its upcoming projects.
“The idea is just to choose stories and filmmakers which excite us and who are willing to collaborate with us in the spirit of partnership,"" Patel said.
Starting with Marathi film Rampaat next month, Zee is looking forward to the release of Sunny Deol’s directorial venture Pal Pal Dil Ke Paas which introduces his son Karan, in July and then Good News will follow in September. Lead cast for the four directors’ films will be announced soon too.
Trade analysts point out that the good thing about Zee at the moment is that it is taking it slow. “It’s a case of slow and steady winning the race. They haven’t been aggressive so far and are only taking up as much as they can handle,"" said Atul Mohan, editor of trade magazine Complete Cinema adding that while Hindi audiences may be relatively unfamiliar with the Zee Studios banner, they are known for pathbreaking work in the Marathi circuit with films like Sairat, Natsamrat, Duniyadaari, Timepass and Lai Bhaari under the Essel Vision Productions Ltd banner.
The next big step for Zee Studios apart from feature films is its digital content arm Zee Studios Originals which will produce original content and create new IPs for all digital platforms globally. Patel said their first show, a fun take on Bollywood strugglers, has been locked in for ZEE5 while pitches with some other platforms should close within this quarter. When a specific platform commissions a show to Zee, the investment will be the former’s with Zee only putting in seed money of Rs. 20-30 lakh. But the studio is also looking to make its own shows and then pitch to services, where budgets could range from Rs. 1-3 crore per episode.
“Since I don’t check with (a satellite or digital platform like) Zee TV or Star TV or ZEE5 before I make the movies, if we have conviction in certain shows, we would like to make them ourselves and then license or sell them to the appropriate platform,"" Patel said."

Ltd, said in a note on 22 April.
According to Garude, apart from the deal value, the biggest monitorable for minority shareholders should be whether the current management is retained. “If yes, it augurs well,in our view, given the strong track record of execution. If not, then the acquirer’s game plan needs to be closely studied. With a deal announcement eminent, at 21 times FY20 PER, we think there is ample margin of safety,"" he added.
In a media interview, Subhash Chandra, chairman of Zee Entertainment, reaffirmed the stake sale timelines and shared more details on the suitors. According to Zee, it has five suitors from India, Japan, Europe and the US. Reversing its earlier stance of engaging only with strategic partners, Chandra mentioned that Zee is not averse to any financial investor. “Reasons for the suitors showing interest in Zee include direct access to 1.3 bn people, valuing Zee’s expertise in content creation at reasonable cost, and an opportunity to create a combination of content and e-commerce,"" Macquarie said.
Garude added that Zee is confident of being able to meet the 30 September deadline of repaying lenders. The promoters are focussed on trying to complete the infra projects and then sell these assets between July-September 2019. According to the promoters, other non-core businesses such as Essel Finance, mutual funds as well as some of their personal real estate assets will also be sold.

58,2019-05-20,Zee,"Trai cites threat to national security, data privacy concerns to make the case for a regulatory frameworkTrai said video streaming services may be brought under the purview at some point in the future

NEW DELHI :
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is looking at the possibility of bringing over-the-top (OTT) digital communication services that provide same or similar services as telecom service providers (TSPs) under the same licensing or regulatory norms that are applicable to the latter.
This comes against the background of critics continuing to bat for the freedom of the Internet and the unique nature of OTT services such as digital media, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Hike and others that perform the same functions of voice and messaging as telcos.
The most important argument, during an open house discussion held on Monday on the regulatory framework for OTT communication services, was the threat to national security and data privacy. Information, often false, sent on these social media platforms, especially during national or natural emergencies is a huge threat to the country and a prime example of the misuse and exploitation of these services.
“Communication services is a broad term and can include both real time and non-real time services such as email or Internet websites to govern which the IT Act is already there. We are, however, restricting our scope to those OTT services whose function is similar to those TSPs that have a licence,"" said Trai chairman R.S. Sharma. The regulatory imbalance between TSPs and OTT services formed the central question of the discussion and the regulatory body would come out with a set of regulations or recommendations within a month, said Sharma.
There is currently no pre-remedy to prevent the proliferation of such content in India or an official body to report grievances to, said Satyam Singh Rajput, founder of an NGO called Justice for Rights Foundation (JRF) that had filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking regulation of content on these platforms that is often explicit and offensive.
Trai said that video streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and Hotstar may be brought under the purview at some point in the future but were currently exempt from the discussion. Earlier this year, nine OTT video-on-demand services including Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALT Balaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now decided to adopt a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).
Further, telecom operators fully support the regulation of OTT services in view of their own interests.
“TSPs pay multiple levies including regulatory levies, duties and taxes while OTT communications service providers are not subject to any of these regulatory costs or taxes. This limits the way TSPs can do business and earn revenues while at the same time adding expenses in the form of compulsory compliances,"" said the Cellular Operators Association of India.
Of late, the data demand in the country has increased manifold because of the surge in popularity of video-content-based OTTs on mobile devices. The revenue earned by the operators needs to grow or the taxes and levies need to be reduced to meet the investments required for the country’s telecom networks, it said. One way of achieving a level-playing field for both is to review the existing licensing and regulatory provisions applicable on TSPs and subjecting OTT communications services to this.
Contesting these are the supporters of Internet freedom. Moreover, the government of India’s expert committee on data protection chaired by Justice Srikrishna has acknowledged that current legal provisions and practices on surveillance, including the absence of any judicial oversight, fail to adequately protect the fundamental right to privacy.
Even if a law on data protection comes into place, there is no active government proposal to either bring surveillance reform within its ambit or to regulate intelligence and policing agencies, the Internet Freedom Foundation pointed out.
“This is illustrative of the reductiveness of a debate that commences from dulling the feature richness and diversity of Internet applications and services into the straitjacket of OTT. The dangers of avoiding bright lines of regulation and the uncertainty in treatment may prevent free expression which forms the very basis for innovative thought and action. There are also concerns that overbearing and costly legal compliances and product decisions may harm India’s vibrant start-up ecosystem,"" it said."

Media and entertainment firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) that is in advanced stages of its stake sale process has said that there will be a formal announcement in place by July.
“We are progressing well and with political uncertainty behind us, we hope to sign a binary agreement by July,"" ZEEL managing director and chief executive officer Punit Goenka said over a conference call with analysts on Monday. Goenka who had previously claimed that the deadline for the sale had been pushed beyond April 2019, declined to share any other details.
Zee Entertainment Enterprises had announced in November last year that its promoters, led by Subhash Chandra, planned to sell up to 50% of their equity stake in the company to a strategic partner.
While earlier there were some reports suggesting that Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony Corp. is in advanced negotiations to buy a stake in the company, the talks were said to have derailed on differences over valuation.
Goenka also said the new tariff order brought in by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had affected the company’s advertising revenues but they foresee an upside as soon as things settle down.
“Our dealing with multi system operators (MSOs) has become much simpler and most of them are following Trai orders,"" Goenka said in response to the new regulation that allows for pricing of individual channels instead of placing them in pre-decided bouquets as was the case earlier.
Further, Goenka said the company was going to be focusing aggressively on its over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platform ZEE5 that had notched up 61.5 million monthly active users earlier this year.
“We want to scale up on our content, technology and partnerships as far as ZEE5 goes,"" Goenka said about the service that will see 72 original pieces of content, including feature films and web shows this year.
ZEEL reported a 26.83% increase in consolidated net profit at Rs. 292.53 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 2019. The company had posted a net profit of Rs. 230.64 crore in January-March quarter a year ago, ZEEL said in a BSE filing.
Total income during the quarter under review stood at Rs. 2,076.06 crore, up 14.48% from Rs. 1,813.43 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.
""We have delivered another quarter of strong operating performance which is commendable given the challenges the industry is facing in implementing the Trai tariff order,"" Goenka said.
ZEEL's total expenses during the quarter stood at Rs. 1,612.60 crore, up 23.77% from Rs. 1,302.84 crore in the year-ago period.
Revenue from advertisement rose 16%to Rs. 1,217.49 crore, as compared with Rs. 1,049.55 crore in the March quarter of 2017-18.
Revenue from subscription also rose 3.43 % to Rs. 565.27 crore as against Rs. 546.52 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

53,2019-06-05,Zee,"The sale is one of the many asset sales the group is working on as it looks to meet obligationsThe group is looking to sell other non-core businesses, including Essel Finance and Mutual Fund

MUMBAI :
The Subhash Chandra-led Essel group has sold the two transmission assets owned by Essel Infraprojects, Darbhanga-Motihari Transmission Ltd and NRSS XXXI (B) Transmission Ltd, to a fund managed by Edelweiss, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
The development could provide some respite to Essel and its lenders.
Essel had entered into an agreement to sell the two assets to Sekura Energy Ltd, a company owned by Edelweiss Infrastructure Yield Plus fund, in October 2018. The agreement also gave Edelweiss the right to purchase two other transmission assets owned by Essel—Warora-Kurnool Transmission Ltd and NRSS XXXVI Transmission Ltd, which are expected to be commissioned this financial year.
“Essel has closed the sale of the first two transmission assets, which are operational assets, a few days ago. It has received all regulatory approvals and got funds from Edelweiss,"" said one of the persons mentioned above. The deal took time to be completed because of various regulatory approvals, he said.
Mint could not ascertain the financial value of the transaction. The Economic Times, in an 18 October report, said the collective enterprise value of the four transmission assets could be as much as  ₹6,000 crore.
Email queries to Edelweiss and Essel Group did not elicit any response.
The the transmission assets sale are two of many asset sales the group is working on as it looks to meet its obligations.
In January, shares of Essel’s listed flagship company Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) plunged after the company decided to defer a scheduled interest payment.
The group reached an agreement with its lenders, who agreed not to sell pledged shares of listed entities of Essel Group, giving it time till end-September for various asset sales, including up to 50% of promoters’ stake in ZEEL.
The group also initiated the process to sell stake in its roads, renewable energy, and asset management businesses.
Last month, Mint had reported that Essel Infraprojects has agreed to sell three of its road projects to Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Canada’s second-largest fund manager. The sales of these assets are expected to fetch a combined enterprise value of  ₹3,300-3,500 crore. The three projects comprise toll roads in Madhya Pradesh (Lebad-Jaora state highway), Karnataka (Navayuga Devanahalli Tollway near Bengaluru airport, a national highway) and Telangana (Essel Dichpally Tollway, a state highway).
In an interview to The Economic Times in April, Chandra said that ZEEL has received interest from five suitors and that he expects them to submit non-binding bids soon. Infra asset sales would reduce the operating debt burden by at least  ₹15,000 crore and corporate debt by  ₹3,000, he said. The rest will be taken care of by the stake sale in ZEEL, Chandra had said in the interview. He said his group is also looking to sell other non-core businesses, including Essel Finance and Mutual Fund."

Mumbai: Debt-ridden Essel group is looking to sell a minority stake in broadcaster Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) to a financial investor by the end of July to meet immediate payment obligations, said two people directly aware of the matter.
This will be in addition to its ongoing efforts to find a strategic buyer, as well as sell some of the group’s infrastructure assets, the people said on condition of anonymity.
Subhash Chandra-led Essel group has been in talks with potential buyers, mainly strategic investors, to sell the promoters’ stake in ZEEL since it was announced in November. The sale of a minority stake in ZEEL to a financial investor will take care of the immediate debt owed to mutual funds and banks.
“Overall, Zee is looking to sell up to 50% in the business, which could be to a strategic or a financial investor or both,"" one of the two people cited earlier said. “The months of August and September will be devoted to getting regulatory clearances, so July is a sacrosanct deadline. The sale of non-media assets (primarily infrastructure) will be announced as early as this month.""
Essel group owes mutual funds (MFs) over  ₹7,000 crore. The MFs had invested in papers issued by Essel group firms, which were backed by shares pledged by the promoters. The fund houses had agreed to refrain from selling the pledged shares to recover dues till September-end. The total debt on the books of Essel as of December is  ₹16,237 crore, whereas the promoter debt is  ₹13,000 crore.
A ZEEL spokesperson said: “The process of ZEEL’s stake sale is at an advanced stage. The group has already received two non-binding term sheets. The stake sale process is well within the purview of the September 2019 deadline. Any additional details cannot be shared at this stage due to confidentiality agreements.""
In a related development, fund houses appointed P.J. Nayak, former chairman and CEO of Axis Bank, as a mediator for talks with Essel group.
Nayak’s appointment, the people cited earlier said, is an effort towards ensuring that there is seamless transmission of information from Essel group to its 11 lenders. “Nayak will oversee repayments to lenders on the basis of their claims as soon as the asset sale concludes,"" said the second of the two people cited earlier.
Essel group recently sold two transmission assets owned by Essel Infraprojects Ltd—Darbhanga-Motihari Transmission Co. Ltd and NRSS XXXI (B) Transmission Ltd—to a fund managed by Edelweiss.
It has also closed a deal with Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Canada’s second-largest fund manager, for Essel Infraprojects’ three road projects, Mint reported on 16 May.

Comcast-led consortium may bid for ZEE Entertainment
US cable major Comcast, along with private equity fund Blackstone and James Murdoch’s family office Lupa Systems may bid for Indian media firm, Zee Entertainment Enterprises , The Economic Times reported citing people in the know. The Comcast-led consortium went ahead with the due diligence of Zee Entertainment, even as social media giant Facebook approached its promoters for a potential deal. There are, however, issues over control, exact quantum of stake and valuation mismatch, that may prove to be deal breakers. But a deal is likely to happen before September 2019 as Essel Group comes closer to a default on  ₹7,000 crore it owes to mutual funds. While Comcast will be leading the consortium, Murdoch may act as the local partner on ground and take up a small stake. Lupa also cannot have more than 9-10% stake in ZEE, as part of a non-compete agreement with the Walt Disney Company after Rupert Murdoch sold 21st Century Fox (including Star India) to Disney.

47,2019-07-12,Zee,"Big-ticket events like Lok Sabha polls and Cricket World Cup have kept audience interest alive in television this yearGrowth in satellite, especially pay channels comes despite Trai’s roll-out of the new tariff order

NEW DELHI :
Despite the onslaught of digital streaming platforms, India doesn’t seem to be giving up on good old television. According to data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (Trai) Performance Indicator Report 2019, the direct-to-home (DTH) service sector has displayed significant growth in financial year 2019 with the addition of 4.91 million active subscribers between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019.
In contrast, the DTH sector had added 3.92 million subscribers in financial year 2018.
Further, DTH has attained net active subscriber base of around 72.44 million with five pay DTH service providers as on 31 March,2019 as compared to 70.49 million at the end of last quarter. This is in addition to the subscribers of the free DTH services of Doordarshan. The DTH market is dominated by Dish TV (40%) followed by Tata Sky (25%) and Airtel TV (22%).
The report further says that there are 328 pay channels in India which include 229 SD (standard definition) pay TV channels and 99 HD (high definition) pay TV channels. The number of satellite pay TV channels has gone up by 20 (from 308 to 328) over FY 2019 compared to 13 in FY 2018. The total number of satellite channels has risen from 875 to 902 over the same period.
The growth in satellite, especially pay channels comes despite Trai’s roll-out of the new tariff order (NTO) according to which consumers can choose the TV channels they want to watch and pay only for them at maximum retail prices (MRPs) set by broadcasters as opposed to the bouquets offered earlier.
“The Trai order has in fact, given DTH operators more benefit and consumers better value for money,"" said Sukhpreet Singh, corporate head, marketing, Dish TV India Ltd. He added that the growth in the DTH segment may seen as an overall rise in video consumption in India, of which streaming services are part of and not at the expense of DTH providers. Further, big-ticket events like the Lok Sabha elections and the Cricket World Cup have kept audience interest alive in television this year. Post the implementation of the new tariff regime, several broadcasters like Star India and Zee took their FTA (free-to-air) channels off DD Free Dish and converted them into pay channels. DTH services have further upped the game, Dish TV, for example, has an OTT (over-the-top) streaming app called Watcho.
“Despite both cable and DTH being digital platforms, it is DTH that offers total flexibility of instantly selecting a pack, separately for every room and change it as often as it is required. It is this customer convenience that is aiding the higher growth of DTH,"" said Harit Nagpal, CEO and managing director of Tata Sky."

44,2019-07-19,Zee,"The intense competition could derail Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’s goal of 100 million customers in IndiaThe world’s second-most populous country is a priority for the streaming service, which is effectively blocked in China

MUMBAI :
Netflix Inc., whose shares are taking a massive hit after it reported the worst drop in U.S. users since 2011, is looking for new subscriber growth in India, a rapidly expanding streaming market. Trouble is, so are a raft of ambitious local players with cut-rate programming packages.
Already wrestling with other global giants such as Walt Disney Co. and Amazon.com Inc., Netflix now also contends with broadcasters and Bollywood powerhouses allied with billionaire-backed wireless carriers, who are luring users with free offers or as low as 40 cents a month. That tactic has put them directly in the India growth path of the world’s largest paid online streaming service.
The intense competition could derail Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings’s goal of 100 million customers in India -- almost 25 times Netflix’s estimated subscriber base there this year. The world’s second-most populous country is a priority for the streaming service, which is effectively blocked in China. The second-quarter loss of 130,000 users in the US, reported Wednesday, makes winning in India all the more pressing.
Netflix shares fell as much as 12%, the most in a year, to $320.50 in New York trading Thursday. That knocked more than $15 billion off its market capitalization.
With a growing number of smartphones and a surge in the use of broadband, India has become a battleground for streaming services. Cisco Systems Inc. has estimated the country will have 829 million smartphone users by 2022, from a projected half a billion this year.
“We are seeing a nice, steady increase in engagement with Indian viewers that we think we can build on,"" Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said on a call with analysts Wednesday. “Growth in that country is a marathon. We’re in it for the long haul.""
India’s video-on-demand market could grow to $5 billion by 2023 from $500 million last year, estimates researcher Boston Consulting Group. Paying subscribers will probably rise to as many as 50 million, while users of advertising-supported video-on-demand will reach 600 million, BCG predicts.
Netflix has amassed more than 150 million subscribers worldwide, giving it the largest paid customer base. The U.S., Brazil and Canada are three of its largest markets, while Australia is the company’s biggest success story in the Asia-Pacific region. India differs from most of these markets, however, in its population’s sensitivity to price.
The Los Gatos, California-based firm has responded to competition in India by offering a mobile-only service at less than half the typical subscription price, and by raising spending on local content faster than in any other market.
While it’s still lagging behind Amazon Prime and Disney’s Hotstar, the price cuts are helping it outpace the growth of its biggest rivals, while raising questions about sustainability and margins. Hotstar built its base by streaming cricket matches that are wildly popular in the former British colony.
Netflix will probably almost triple subscribers in India this year to 4.1 million, within striking distance of Amazon Prime’s 4.4 million, according to estimates by researcher IHS Markit. That’s faster than Amazon or Hotstar Premium, two of Netflix’s biggest competitors. Some other estimates put Netflix’s base in India at between 1 million and 2 million. The company doesn’t provide data for individual markets.
“Netflix is in a land grab to capture as many subscribers as possible, whatever the price,"" said Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities Inc. “The less they charge, the more cash they are likely to burn.""
The company spooked investors Wednesday with a report that it lost subscribers in the U.S. and signed up only 2.8 million internationally in the three months ended June, roughly half its own prediction.
It also reported its 20th quarter of negative free cash flow as it spends on adding content and replacing series and films being pulled from its platforms by competitors like Disney.
While Netflix is speeding up its investment, Indian rivals including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. and Balaji Telefilms Ltd. are betting on bundling their content with mobile phone services. The TV network and Bollywood producer are allying with billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s Jio wireless service and Bharti Airtel Ltd., two of the country’s three biggest carriers, to offer decades of content to subscribers.
Free Access
Zee, parent of the country’s largest private broadcast network, offers movies, exclusive TV content and more than 90 live channels on its ZEE5 platform with content across 12 languages for as little as 70 cents a month. Partial access to the platform is free to subscribers of mobile phone carrier Bharti Airtel, controlled by billionaire Sunil Mittal. Users of Airtel’s plans priced at $7.25-a-month or more get full access to ZEE5 free.
Ambani’s Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd., which elbowed its way into the country’s mobile phone business three years ago with free calling and low-priced data services, has jumped into film and TV streaming, including a tie-up with Balaji Telefilms.
Sunil Lulla, chief executive officer of Balaji Telefilms, said the company’s service ALTBalaji is focused on producing exclusive content in Hindi, the country’s most-used language.
Still, pricing will be crucial for Netflix. After introducing a promotional offer of about $3.65 a month for mobile-only users, Netflix decided to make the lower price permanent as “an opportunity to broaden access to the service,"" Greg Peters, chief product officer, said Wednesday.
Torrent Downloads
“Pricing is going to be the biggest challenge,"" said Hanish Bhatia, senior analyst at Counterpoint. “Indian users have not accepted the idea of paying for content yet. Two to three years back, everybody relied on torrent,"" the free protocol that lets users share and download films and TV shows without paying for them, Bhatia said.
Netflix didn’t disclose how much it’s spending on local content in India. It did announce the addition of five series, two of which are being produced by superstars Shah Rukh Khan and Anushka Sharma.
“Netflix wants to have one big original, almost like a new Bollywood movie, coming out every month,"" said Mihir Shah, vice president (India) at Media Partners Asia, a consulting firm. “In India, people pay for Bollywood. Netflix is hoping that if people are willing to pay $10 to watch a movie together as a family, they will also subscribe."""
43,2019-07-22,Zee,"Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar, Vicky Kaushal, Rajkummar Rao and Kartik Aaryan are dabbling in horrorThe success of Stree and Golmaal Again has opened up opportunities for the horror genre in the country

NEW DELHI :
Indians should prepare to be serially jolted and chilled off their seats. Hindi filmmakers are about to dish out a season of the witch—or what looks increasingly like many seasons of the witch, the ghost, and every other creature of the horror film genre.
Even Bollywood actors Akshay Kumar, Vicky Kaushal, Rajkummar Rao and Kartik Aaryan—“heroes"" with large followings—have decided to dabble in horror.
Kumar will star in Laxmmi Bomb, the remake of Tamil hit Muni 2: Kanchana, while Kaushal has been engaged by filmmaker Karan Johar for a three-part horror franchise titled Bhoot. Rao will feature in a horror comedy called Roohi Afza along with Jahnvi Kapoor, while Aaryan is all set to do a remake of Kumar’s 2007 horror film Bhool Bhulaiyaa.
The chills will not just be restricted to the big screen. Netflix has come out with a thriller series called Typewriter directed by Sujoy Ghosh this Friday, while shows such as Parchhayee: Ghost Stories by Ruskin Bond (ZEE5), Booo Sabki Phategi (ALTBalaji) and Gehraiyaan (Viu) have already grabbed eyeballs. Once the domain of low-budget productions of the Ramsay brothers in the 1980s and the occasional Ram Gopal Varma movie, horror hasn’t been India’s favourite entertainment genre. Unlike romance or drama, the attempts have been few and far between, given that it often alienates women and children and has limited potential on satellite television. However, that seems to be changing.
“The entire (content) ecosystem has woken up and the overall pie has grown,"" said Deepak Dhar, founder and chief executive officer of Banijay Asia, producer of Parchhayee, adding that horror as a genre has benefited from rise in the amount of content available especially on streaming platforms. “Horror is one of the most sought after genres after crime and investigation. It stays in your mind much after the show is consumed unlike comedy or other genres that don’t stick with you.""
Streaming shows definitely enhance the appeal of horror, Dhar said.
“The streaming space is largely catering to the youth, which is constantly looking for something disruptive and differentiated and some kind of a surprise element. So from the perspective of targeting the right audience, this is the genre everybody would want to push,"" Dhar said. As human beings, we are uniquely imaginative and horror helps us create, escape to and be a part of a virtual world that is full of danger, thrill and excitement, said Srishti Arya, director, international original film, Netflix India.
“We want to create authentically frightening stories that leave audiences on the edge of their seats, but unable to look away,"" Arya said. Ghoul, Netflix’s first original horror series from India, is among its most popular titles, she said. After Typewriter, Netflix has three original horror films lined up, Ghost Stories, Bulbul and Kaali Khuhi. Global horror titles popular in India available on Netflix include the series The Haunting of the Hill House and Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, as well as films such as Veronica, Oculus, and Stree.
The recent success of movies such as Stree and Golmaal Again, which crossed the  ₹100 crore and  ₹200 crore mark respectively, has thrown open opportunities for horror, especially when mixed with comedy or a social message. Hollywood franchises such as The Conjuring universe, have helped too.
“As a collective (in India), we have never been fans of jolting horror. Personally, even I don’t know if I want to put myself through an intense experience, where your heartbeat is racing and you’re jumping out of your seat every second. After a certain point, I don’t even know if it’s pleasurable. So, for me it’s more fun if the horror film has a point that I’m excited about rather than just scaring the hell out of the viewer every second,"" said Stree co-writer Raj Nidimoru.
It’s quite natural, Nidimoru said, for filmmakers to want to tap into a specific genre when certain movies have worked. However, the exciting challenge would be to infuse horror with other elements to appeal to mass audiences given that the genre itself has enough going for it."

With this, customers will get access to plays across genres such as thriller, supernatural, crime, family drama, comedy and periodic drama, on Vodafone Play app and Idea Movies & TV app.

Some of these offerings include Doll’s House based on Norwegian playwright, poet and theatre director Henrik Johan Ibsen's A Doll's House; Double Game, a suspense drama starring popular theatre and television actor Kiran Karmarkar; Vaastav, based on the blockbuster crime flick of the same name.
Given that India has seen mobile data consumption explode after Jio’s entry made data affordable, Vodafone Idea and Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd had earlier announced a strategic partnership for offering content to subscribers.
The content strategy of telecom companies has become important as cheap data prices have failed to provide a meaningful competitive edge. While Reliance Jio is focusing on developing in-house content, rival Airtel is relying on partnerships with partners such as Amazon Prime Video and Netflix to boost data consumption on its mobile network."

NEW DELHI :
Media and entertainment firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) that is in advanced stages of its stake sale process has said that it will decide between two binding offers in the coming days.
“We already have one binding offer on table at the moment and there is another one coming up. The family will evaluate and see how the transaction will impact our strengths to take a call soon,"" ZEEL managing director and chief executive officer Punit Goenka said over a conference call with analysts on Tuesday. Goenka had previously said there will be a final announcement on the stake sale in place by the end of July.
ZEEL had announced in November last year that its promoters, led by Subhash Chandra, planned to sell up to 50% of their equity stake in the company to a strategic partner. According to media reports, US cable major Comcast, is looking to team up with PE fund Blackstone and James Murdoch’s family office Lupa Systems to bid for ZEEL.
For the first quarter of FY20, ZEEL reported consolidated revenue of Rs20,081 million. Advertising revenue for the quarter was Rs11,867 million, a growth of 3.6% year-on-year. Domestic advertising revenue grew by 4.2% year-on-year to Rs11,322 million. International advertising revenue for the quarter was Rs545 million.

Monthly active users and daily active users for ZEE5, the streaming service owned by ZEEL, globally stood at 76.4 million and 6.6 million, respectively, in the month of June. ZEE5 users spent an average of 33 minutes per day on the platform, the company said."
39,2019-07-24,Zee,"Indians spend 30% of their time on mobile phones on entertainment, their data usage in this respect being over 70%With the cheaper subscription plan, Netflix expects to reach new users in India, who mostly watch videos on their mobile phones

New Delhi: Netflix has introduced a mobile-only subscription plan in India at  ₹199 a month, as the world’s largest video streaming service looks to add users in the country where video content consumption has surged, with data prices plunging to among the lowest in the world.
This is Netflix’s first mobile-specific option anywhere in the world and its fourth India plan in addition to the existing basic ( ₹499), standard ( ₹649) and premium ( ₹799) plans.
With the cheaper subscription plan, Netflix expects to reach new users in India, who typically watch videos on their mobile phones. Still, Netflix will have to grapple with several local and overseas rivals such as Disney-owned streaming service Hotstar and Amazon Prime Video, which are luring users with free or low-priced offerings.
“The pricing move is interesting given that users in India were finding Netflix to be an expensive service. It should help them increase their overall pie of paid subscribers, though rival platforms like Amazon Prime and ZEE5, with more content and even lower prices, will still prove to be a challenge,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president (research) at Edelweiss Securities.
Offering content in standard definition quality and downloads for one mobile phone or tablet at a time, the formal announcement of Netflix’s mobile-only plan comes four months after the company started testing a mobile subscription in the country that cost  ₹250 a month, the response to which it said was overwhelmingly positive.
“The one motive (behind the mobile subscription) is to broaden access. As we acknowledge the learning that India is so mobile-centric, this felt like a great next step to make Netflix available to more consumers,"" said Ajay Arora, director (product innovation) at Netflix.
According to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report for 2019, smartphone penetration in India grew to 36% of total phones in 2018. Indians spend 30% of their time on mobile phones on entertainment, second only to social media. However, in terms of data, they use over 70% on entertainment.
Arora said the idea is not to focus on competition—rivals Amazon Prime Video and Hotstar are priced much lower at  ₹129 a month and  ₹299 a month, respectively—but to constantly dish out good content. While Netflix’s payment methods allow credit and debit cards, besides partnerships with telecommunication and cable firms including Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone Idea Ltd and Hathway Broadband, the plan is to bring more prepaid, low-paying customers into the fold at some point in what he said was an ongoing journey.
Apart from the subscription plan, Netflix is looking to launch other mobile-specific features for India, where more people sign up for the service on mobiles and watch content on the go than anywhere in the world, according to its findings. Recognizing India’s data and bandwidth limitations, Netflix’s content can now be streamed at 250kbps instead of 640-1,000kbps earlier. This means picture quality will adjust itself depending on the user’s mobile network. There are also specific sign-up options designed for mobile customers, along with smaller images and a different user interface meant for entry-level smartphones.
Globally, too, Netflix is coming up with innovations to enhance user experience, said Nigel Baptiste, director (partner engagement). Settings will soon allow users to move to a Netflix-calibrated mode, where video and audio quality will be similar to how the content was shot in the studio. The streaming service is investing in better content recommendations, mobile previews (where trailers play automatically and one tap adds the show or film to the viewer’s watch list) and smart downloads. The firm said Netflix members in India are among the highest downloaders of content globally and almost half its members in the country downloaded at least one film or episode in a series in June.
Netflix believes the combination of right product features, an appropriate price point and nuanced content will help it go beyond India’s metros. Long seen as the most elite streaming service in the country, it has recently announced a slew of narratives set in small towns and content in vernacular languages."

To increase the subscription video-on-demand (SVoD) business in India, ZEE5 and ALTBalaji have announced an alliance, with both looking to leverage each other’s strength in the OTT domain and will collaborate to co-create original content which will only be available on their platforms.
ZEE5 is the OTT service owned by Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, while ALTBalaji is managed by Ekta Kapoor’s Balaji Telefilms Ltd.
The content sharing arrangement includes co-creation of more than 60 original content series, in Hindi, which will be available exclusively to SVoD subscribers of both the platforms. This association is a collaborative process of understanding consumer insights and marketing to serve the viewer better and resulting in improved monetisation for both, the two companies said in a statement.
“I truly cherish the bond between Balaji and ZEE, which has been nurtured and built over the last two decades.

A bunch of content creators have found the liberty to work on controversial subjects such as religion and militancy for video-streaming platforms, which traditional media such as film and television have shunned.
While Netflix originals such as Leila and Ghoul are set in dystopian worlds of the future where opposing religious views and inter-faith marriages are condemned and their proponents imprisoned, a ZEE5 show called Kaafir, featuring actor Dia Mirza, is set in militancy-affected Kashmir. Programming industry experts said these are bold political themes to take up, and they have emerged precisely because of the free nature of the medium.
“The youth comprises about 50% of the population of India. That generation was possibly not watching television in the last three to four years, and there were very limited avenues for them to get their kind of content. That audience wants something real and relatable. Now, streaming services have opened up an entire Pandora’s box and things are moving like wildfire,"" said Deepak Dhar, founder and chief executive officer of content studio Banijay Asia.
Sameer Nair, television industry veteran and chief executive of content studio Applause Entertainment, said it may also be a case of how the TV medium per se has grown over the past 20 years, and become a platform for mass audience entertainment. “Some of these themes, stories and subjects may not rate well on TV and, hence, are not done on TV,"" Nair said, citing experimental TV shows such as political thriller, Prisoner of War, and action drama 24, which did not find much acceptance in India. Nair is now working on a show called Avrodh based on the 2016 Uri attacks, from a political and journalistic perspective.
“The economics of the OTT (over-the-top) medium allow you to tell different stories. Some of the stories tend to either play out as dystopian futures, or address what would be defined as more uncomfortable issues. It is based on more individualistic viewership, it’s not a one-size-fits-all family television slot, and it’s not rating-dependent,"" Nair added.
Kaafir writer Bhavani Iyer said the absence of censorship on the web allows a creator to tell the story in the most truthful manner possible. The Dia Mirza-starrer was originally written as a film 13 years ago, but the subject was considered too sensitive.
“It does make a lot of difference because you don’t have to factor in these things at all. Plus, our show has reached out to all kinds of people, not just the urban multiplex kind of viewers. There is no patronizing of the audience. There is no ‘they may not like this’ thought. Everybody has access to what is available and it’s up to the viewer to choose what they want to,"" Iyer said."

Online grocer BigBasket received debt funding worth  ₹100 crore from venture debt provider Trifecta Capital, Mint reported citing a statement from SuperMarket Grocery Supplies Pvt. Ltd, which owns and operates BigBasket. The money will go into working capital and capital expenditure requirements, which includes setting up of new warehouses, strengthening the cold chain, building facilities for reprocessing fruits and vegetables and scaling up its supply chain for the recently launched milk subscription business BB Daily and its speciality vending machine business BB Instant.

The company was valued just over $1 billion at that time. The latest investment into Bigbasket is one of the largest debt deals in India’s consumer internet industry this year, according to multiple investment analysts that Mint spoke to.
Pfizer to merge generics unit with Mylan
Drugmaker Pfizer Inc has agreed to spin off its generic drugs business and combine it with Mylan, a move that leaves Pfizer with more profitable innovative drugs, including cancer drug Ibrance and pneumonia vaccine Prevnar, Mint filed from a Reuters feed. The new company, to be based in the United States and incorporated in Delaware, will be led by Michael Goettler, president of Pfizer's generics unit, Upjohn. The move is part of a years-long effort by Pfizer to split into three parts - innovative medicines, lower margin generic drugs business and consumer healthcare. While the merger brings blockbuster treatments Viagra, EpiPen and Lipitor under one umbrella, Pfizer has also been beefing up its cancer treatment pipeline as some of its older treatments face competition. Besides, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline Plc had said in December they would combine their consumer health businesses.
Comcast-led group makes offer to buy out Zee promoters
A consortium led by US cable major Comcast, which also includes Atairos, Blackstone and James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems submitted a binding offer late Monday to buy out Subhash Chandra from Zee Entertainment, The Economic Times reported citing people aware of the development. Sources close to Zee, however, said they had not received any bid till late Monday evening. Zee’s promoters own 35.79% of the company, of which 63.98% has been pledged with mutual funds and other financial institutions. At current market price, the promoters’ stake is worth  ₹13,315 crore (around $1.92 billion), which may be sold at a 15-20% control premium over the market value. The transaction, if accepted, will also likely trigger an open offer for an additional 26% stake and would need board’s approval before a deal is finalised. The deal will give a breather to Chandra, whose Essel Group is facing a severe debt crisis. Chandra had last year announced plans to sell half the promoters’ stake, then 41%, in the company.
Scooter sharing app Bounce looks to raise $30 million

Existing investors including Accel Partners, Sequoia Capital, Chiratae Ventures and others are likely to lead the first funding round.

Bounce, which is running a pilot with nearly 30 kirana owners in the city, plans to connect them with banks and other lenders to finance charging units and EV batteries. The cost per station works out to  ₹100,000, according to Vivekananda Hallekere, CEO and co-founder, Bounce.

35,2019-07-30,Zee,"The group plans to snap up a 51% stake, which has a market value of about  ₹190 billionA deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday and there could be more investors

A consortium that includes U.S. cable giant Comcast Corp., James Murdoch’s Lupa Systems and Blackstone Group Inc. has made an offer for a stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd., India’s largest private broadcaster, people familiar with the matter said.
The group plans to snap up a 51% stake, which has a market value of about 190 billion rupees ($2.77 billion), said one of the people, asking not to be identified as the discussions are private. The bid is non-binding, the people said.
A deal could be announced as soon as Wednesday and there could be more investors, another person said. Deliberations are ongoing and might not result in a deal, the people said. Representatives for Comcast and Blackstone declined to comment, while a representative for Zee had no immediate comment.
Zee, the Mumbai-based broadcaster controlled by former rice trader-turned-media mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking a strategic investor to help pay off debts of its parent group as well as fend off competition from Netflix, Amazon and hundreds of local TV channels vying to tap India’s booming demand for content.
A deal would give Comcast, Lupa and Blackstone control of Zee’s deep library of content and its ZEE5 platform offering Bollywood films and more than 90 television channels in 12 languages on-demand via Internet. Some of the world’s largest telecommunications companies including AT&T Inc., Vodafone Group Plc and KDDI Corp. have been buying film and television production and cable TV assets to bolster earnings as subscribers level off.
Shares of Zee slipped 0.2% in Mumbai on Tuesday afternoon, while the S&P BSE 100 Index was little changed.

31,2019-07-31,Zee,"Adjusted for inflation, today, the family drama would have grossed around  ₹973 croreEven now, the film is much loved on television, and has most recently found acceptance on video streaming platforms

Despite being dismissed as a glossy marriage video masquerading as cinema, India’s favourite family film, Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!, which celebrates 25 years of its release this week, continues to make money. When it was released in August 1994, the Sooraj Barjatya-directed musical, romantic comedy starring Madhuri Dixit and Salman Khan had grossed  ₹72.46 crore at the box office, running for nearly two-and-a-half years in some theatres, while celebrating either a golden or silver jubilee in most others.
Adjusted for inflation, today, the family drama would have grossed around  ₹973 crore, to emerge as the highest grossing film in the history of Indian cinema, considering that the Hindi version of Baahubali 2: The Conclusion had raked in  ₹708.99 crore.
Even now, the film is much loved on television, and has most recently found acceptance on video streaming platforms. Industry experts said Rajshri Productions should be making anywhere between  ₹3-5 crore per year from the sale of these various ancillary rights that are not purchased for perpetuity, but renegotiated every few years.
“Hum Aapke Hain Koun...! has been the most successful Hindi movie on Indian television ever with its viewership surpassing the likes of Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Sholay and even recent hits like 3 Idiots and PK,"" said Ruchir Tiwari, business head, Hindi movies cluster, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. The Zee network owns satellite rights to the film.
“Airing consistently for 25 years, it has managed to grasp the attention and interest of the viewers every time due to its strong storyline, simple plot and relatable characters that resonate highly with audiences across age groups. It is a movie about family, sacrifice, duty and, most of all, love—all the elements that make for perfect family viewing,"" Tiwari added.
The other big platform where it has been a clear winner is the mobile ringtone and caller tune segment, especially in the Hindi heartland, where the melodies of the 1990s still reign. “Broadly about 40% of our consumption is in Hindi, around 7-8% of which comes from 90s’ music,"" said Sameer Batra, chief executive officer, content and apps, Bharti Airtel Ltd, which owns music streaming app Wynk. While the north and west are obvious markets for this genre, the east and south, including Bihar, West Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, are surprisingly big on the 1990s’ music too, he added.
As far as hello tunes go, a double-digit user percentage goes for the music of the 1990s across big and small towns. Top 1990s albums include hits such as Hum Aapke Hain Koun...!, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, Jo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar, Saajan, 1942: A Love Story, Dil Se.., Dil Toh Pagal Hai and Mohra, while Udit Narayan, Alka Yagnik and Kumar Sanu are the top artistes.
“As an album, Hum Aapke Hai Koun...! continues to have about 25,000-30,000 daily users and the top four songs are Pehla Pehla Pyaar, Mujhse Juda Hokar, the title track and Didi Tera Dewar Deewana,"" Batra added. “For the 35-40 age group that was young in the 1990s, these hold a lot of nostalgic appeal.""
Released on 5 August 1994, the film, which was indeed a remake of Rajshri’s own 1982 production Nadiya Ke Paar, ranks No.1 in the list of all-time Hindi blockbusters. It was essentially a love story centered on strong family ethics. The Barjatyas had taken it slow, releasing in only 26 cinemas across the country to begin with. By the 21st week, however, it was being screened across 522 cinemas, only to peak with 730 screens by the 25th week.
“We were very confident of the project and had gone for very limited release,"" said Ramanathan P.S., head of sales, Rajshri Productions, adding that it was recorded in the optical stereo sound system, which not too many theatres had the infrastructure to play in those days.
Rajshri sold the film only to cinema halls that had the sound system and even went to the extent of installing the system at their own cost in a few theatres, one in Jaipur and the other in Hyderabad.
Initially playing for 3 hours 35 minutes, the makers chopped a couple of the 14 songs to bring the running time to 3 hours 13 minutes.
“The film was going very steady. In the beginning, every show was houseful. But we didn’t want to increase the number of theatres. By the eighth or ninth week, we started giving it to other good theatres. Our condition was that theatre should be well-maintained. And No.2, we wanted the film to have a long run. In Mumbai’s Liberty Cinemas, for example, it ran for two-and-a-half years."" Ramanathan recalled.
There were other big challenges, too. In the 1980s, people from respectable families had stopped visiting cinema halls because most were dilapidated and shoddily maintained. The boom in the use of video cassette recorders (VCRs) also let families watch movies from within the comforts of their homes. There was huge entertainment tax levied and theatres were shutting down left, right and centre. “But films like Hum Aapke Hain Koun ...! and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge helped the exhibition business to bounce back. The trend (of going to theatres) started again,"" Ramanathan said."

Indian stock markets may remain under pressure on Wednesday following weak global cues.
Asian equities were subdued in early trade on Wednesday, rattled by fresh trade war concern following President Donald Trump’s threats to Beijing, while increasing worries about a no-deal Brexit kept the sterling pound under pressure.
Later in the day, the US Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates for the first time since the financial crisis more than a decade ago. The expected easing has supported sentiment for riskier assets worldwide.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.04%, while Japan's Nikkei slid 0.84%. Major Wall Street stock averages ended slightly lower on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 losing 0.26%, after Trump warned China against waiting out his current presidential term before finalizing a trade deal.
As a new round of US-China trade negotiations started in Shanghai, Trump tweeted that if he wins the re-election in November 2020, the outcome could be no agreement or a harsher one.
The S&P 500 index has risen 2.4% so far this month, bolstered by expectation of a Fed easing.
Fed funds rate futures are now fully pricing in a 25 basis point rate cut on Wednesday and another 25 basis point reduction by September. US consumer spending and prices rose moderately in June, pointing to slower economic growth and benign inflation that cemented expectation of a rate cut by the Fed.
Back home, companies including like Eicher Motors, Indian Oil Corporation, UPL, Ashok Leyland, Apollo Tyres, Zee Media Corporation, Allahabad Bank, and Tata Global Beverages, among others, will declare June quarter results today.
Back stocks will likely remain in focus as Coffee Day Enterprises incident may deepen the liquidity crisis.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Tuesday relaxed norms for end-use of money raised through external commercial borrowings (ECBs). The central bank said ECBs with a minimum average maturity period of seven years can be availed for repayment of rupee loans availed domestically for capital expenditure as also by non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) for on-lending for the same purpose.
In the currency market, the British pound remained near a 28-month low hit the previous day on growing concern about a disorderly Brexit.
The pound sterling traded at $1.216, up 0.13% so far today, but not far from $1.2120 marked on Tuesday. It has fallen 4.2% so far this month, on course to log its worst monthly performance since October 2016.
Other major currencies were less volatile with the yen flat at 108.58 yen to the dollar. The euro stood little changed at $1.1158.
Oil prices held firm near two-week high after 2% gains on Tuesday.

New Delhi: US-based Invesco-Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund has agreed to pick up 11% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), the flagship media company of Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group. The stake sale will be for a total consideration value of up to  ₹4,224 crore, the company said in a press statement.
The proceeds from the stake sale will go towards paying off loans worth  ₹13,000 crore that the Essel group has across various group companies, particularly in infrastructure, and will also help avert a looming default of  ₹7,000 crore of payments to mutual fund investors in September.
The “Essel Group had initiated the process of divesting its key assets, with an aim to repay all the lenders by September 2019,"" the statement said.
Punit Goenka, MD and CEO, ZEE Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, said, “I’m extremely glad to share that the Invesco-Oppenheimer Fund as a Financial Investor has further reposed its faith in ZEEL. It also gives me immense pleasure to note their strong belief and trust in the intrinsic value of our precious asset. It is the valuable belief and support of our esteemed financial investors that enables us to consistently generate great value, year after year.""
The fund has been a financial investor in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd since 2002. The promoters led by Subhas Chandra own 35.79% of ZEEL, of which 64% is pledged with financial institutions.
In June, Mint reported that the debt-ridden Essel group was looking to sell a minority stake in broadcaster ZEEL to a financial investor by the end of July to meet immediate payment obligations. This was in addition to its ongoing efforts to find a strategic buyer, as well as sell some of the group’s infrastructure assets. Subhash Chandra has placed up to 51% of the ownership of ZEEL on the block to stave off creditors and shore up the group’s finances."

Mumbai/New Delhi: Subhash Chandra’s Essel group has agreed to sell an 11% stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) for  ₹4,224 crore to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, as the controlling shareholders of the broadcaster attempt to pay off debts before a September deadline.
Invesco agreed to pay  ₹400 a share for Zee, representing a 10.7% premium to ZEEL’s Wednesday closing price of  ₹361.45 on BSE, the company said in a statement.
Media mogul Chandra may, however, need to find a second investor willing to bet on ZEEL with the debt deadline looming. Essel group needs to pay lenders a total of  ₹7,500 crore by 30 September.
The group is trying to close sales of non-media assets but failing that, it will have to bring another financial investor on board to meet the debt payment deadline, Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive of ZEEL, said in an interview.
Despite Wednesday’s fundraising, there is still a large gap to bridge.
“We are looking at sales of non-media assets that will close in this timeline,"" Goenka said. “If there is any shortfall, we will be required to sell some more stake in Zee.""
We have received non-binding offers on some infrastructure assets and we are negotiating them. Whatever is the shortfall, if any, will be covered from another stake sale in Zee. A strategic investor is not likely at this point; so it will have to be a financial investor.""
Before this transaction, Invesco Oppenheimer held 7.74% in ZEEL. After Wednesday’s transaction closes, their stake in ZEEL will rise to 18.74%, while the promoter group’s shareholding will fall proportionally from the current 35.79%. Nearly 64% of the promoter shares have been pledged as collateral against debt raised by Essel’s infrastructure operating firms.
Mint has reported over the past six months on Essel group’s attempts to sell part of its infrastructure portfolio in roads and solar energy projects. The group has an agreement to sell part of its solar portfolio to Adani Green Energy, while it is in talks to sell three road projects to a consortium led by the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund and Roadis, after an earlier bid to sell to a Canadian pension fund fell through.
Mutual funds that have bought papers of Essel’s operating infrastructure companies have taken the lead in pursuing a stake sale in ZEEL to make sure their dues are paid. Of the  ₹7,500 crore debt that ZEEL promoters owe lenders, mutual funds account for roughly  ₹5,500 crore. In January, lenders to Essel promoters, primarily mutual funds, agreed to refrain from selling collateral till 30 September, to give the promoter time to raise money.
“With this deal, the promoter will be able to pay 50% of the debt against Zee shares due to lenders in the standstill agreement including mutual funds. The promoter is confident of raising the balance 50% by 30th September and paying off the roughly  ₹7,500 crore debt covered by the standstill agreement. It is hugely positive for the mutual funds, which have lent money to the Essel promoter,"" said A. Balasubramanian, chief executive of Aditya Birla Sun Life Asset Management Co.
A member of this consortium of lenders to ZEEL said on condition of anonymity that Essel group has not formally communicated the closure of the Invesco Oppenheimer deal to lenders and there is no clarity on whether the payments will begin immediately or at the end of September. “There is some uncertainty on how the pledged shares will be sold and what the resulting tax implication will be and how the pledges will be released. This is a step in the right direction and gives the promoters some breathing space. However, the stock might react negatively on Thursday morning because of the continued debt overhang.""
Speaking of the investment, in a press statement, Goenka said: “It gives me immense pleasure to note their strong belief and trust in the intrinsic value of our precious asset. It is the valuable belief and support of our esteemed financial investors that enables us to consistently generate great value, year after year.""
Justin Leverenz, portfolio manager of the Invesco Fund, said: “The fund in its usual business practice has been investing in the Indian markets for many years and has been a financial investor in ZEEL for 17 years. This additional financial investment underscores our continued confidence in management’s ability to deliver long-term growth and financial returns. The sound fundamentals of Zee make this a highly compelling transaction for investors in the fund.""
ZEEL reported revenue of  ₹7,933.9 crore in FY19, growing at 12.4% annually over the past five years. Over the same period, ZEEL’s net worth rose 18%. The network owns 41 channels across 10 languages and commands an all-India TV viewership share of 19.7%. ZEE5, the video-on-demand streaming platform owned by ZEEL, reported a monthly active user base of 61.5 million in the fourth quarter of FY19, while its movie business revenue grew 81% to  ₹2,99.7 crore."

Mumbai: Indian tycoon Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group is in advanced talks to sell some toll road projects to an arm of the country’s sovereign wealth fund for about $350 million, according to people familiar with the matter.
The assets that National Investment & Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) is planning to buy are four toll roads that are in operations and two in construction, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. The parties expect to reach an agreement as soon as September, the people said.
Deliberations are ongoing and may not result in a deal, the people said. Essel Group confirmed that the sale plan has reached a 'very advanced stage' without revealing the buyer, its representative said in response to a Bloomberg query. NIIF doesn’t comment on market speculation, its spokeswoman said.
Canada’s Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec dropped its plans to buy three road projects from Essel, Mint reported in July, citing unidentified people.
Chandra and his Essel Group have been selling assets to pare debt of about  ₹11,000 crore ($1.6 billion). Last week, the tycoon sold 11% stake in his flaghip Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd, India’s largest publicly-traded television network, to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for  ₹4,200 crore. That would still leave Essel short of  ₹6,800 crore as it races to meet its goal of repaying all lenders by September.
NIIF, which manages more than $3 billion of assets, counts Temasek Holdings Pte, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority and Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan among its investors, according to its website.

Private equity fund Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, which has agreed to pick up an 11% stake in Subhash Chandra’s Zee Entertainment Enterprises, reiterated its commitment to the deal in a statement on Tuesday.
Justin Leverenz, Portfolio Manager of the Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund, said: “The Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund (the Fund), under the guidance of Portfolio Manager Justin Leverenz, has been an investor in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd.

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s appearance on survival television series Man vs Wild has pushed broadcasting channel Discovery up the ratings chart, data from broadcasting agency BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) shows. Discovery channel has notched up the third spot in the 9 pm-10 pm viewing slot when the show aired on 12 August, with 3.05 million impressions. It was the third highest viewership in the slot after Hindi GEC (general entertainment channel) leaders Star Plus (3.67 million) and Zee TV (3.3 million).
Impressions refer to the number of individuals in thousands of a target audience who viewed an event, averaged across minutes. BARC India is the country’s TV viewership monitoring agency.
The premiere on the Discovery network (across 12 Discovery channels) notched up the highest viewership also in the 9m-10 pm slot, across channels active at that time, with 3.69 million impressions.
In a statement, the Discovery network said that the premiere delivered the highest ever reach for the infotainment genre in the 9 pm-10 pm slot with 6.1 million tune-ins on Discovery channel, which was 15 times more as compared to the last four weeks average of the same slot. The premiere slot performance of the show gave Discovery 93% channel share in the infotainment genre.
Delivering an average time spent per viewer of 29.2 minutes, the premiere notched up the highest ever sampling in the infotainment genre with 15.6 million tune-ins across the network.
The cumulative reach for the show across the Discovery network, premiere and repeat included, and on DD National was around 42.7 million over the week, Discovery said. The special edition of Man Vs Wild with Bear Grylls & Prime Minister Modi is also being showcased on Discovery network of channels in 179 countries.
“The historic edition of Man Vs Wild made a larger point about the importance of wildlife conservation and sensitized people about environmental change. In that sense, it was much more than a TV show,"" Megha Tata, managing director, South Asia, Discovery, said in a statement.
To build on the show’s legacy, Discovery India has decided to support the PM’s message of committing to wildlife conservation in India. As part of its global Project C.A.T – Conserving Acres for Tigers, Discovery has partnered with World Wildlife Fund to ensure healthy habitats for future generations of tigers by helping conserve nearly 6 million acres of biodiversity rich areas across four countries. With this contribution, Discovery India will extend support to the tiger conservation program at Corbett Landscape and Sundarbans Biosphere Reserve in partnership with WWF India.

23,2019-08-25,Zee,"In order to cater to a wider user base in India, some players are also experimenting with cash paymentsIndian language internet users are expected to grow to 536 million by 2021 from 234 million in 2016

New Delhi: The Indian entertainment scene is witnessing a seismic change with 30 over-the-top (OTT) platforms vying for space as players look to differentiate themselves, says a new report, adding that players like Netflix and Amazon Prime now need to create more desi content to bring more users to their platforms.
Massive capital commitments have been made by platforms for building libraries of diverse original content over the last couple of years for the Indian audience.
According to the KPMG report titled ""India's Digital Future: Mass of niches"", OTT services attract a more individualistic audience compared to the family viewers in a country dominated by single TV households.
""Hence, the content on these platforms needs to appeal to different consumer sensibilities and have an element of freshness. While OTT players can attract their chosen target audience for sampling content with a few originals that appeal to them, depth in such digital-native original content becomes vital to ensure consumer stickiness in the long run,"" the findings showed.
Indian language internet users are expected to grow to 536 million by 2021 from 234 million in 2016.
As nine out of 10 new Internet users in India are likely to be Indian language users, it is vital for OTT players to cater to this audience in their native language.
The OTT platforms have started to focus on building a library of regional content that includes movies and originals over the past 12-18 months.
Most of the video-on-demand (VOD) platforms have content offerings in regional languages. But such content has been restricted to select movies along with a handful of original shows, if any.
""However, dubbing has emerged as an effective tool for players to quickly expand the breadth of original and movie content available across multiple regional languages like Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada, Malayalam, and Marathi,"" the report noted.
For example, Prime Video has dubbed popular Hindi originals like ""Inside Edge"" and ""Breathe"" to Tamil and Telugu.
In addition to originals, Prime Video has also tried to increase depth in their regional library by dubbing English movies like ""Alpa"", ""Rampage"", etc. to Tamil and Telugu.
Similarly, Hotstar has used dubbing to launch the Hindi web-series ""Criminal Justice"" in six regional languages - Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Bangla, Malayalam and Marathi.
""OTT players like Netflix and Amazon prime have started hiring writers to add contextual flavour to dialogues in English in addition to launching regional web series,"" said the report.
Much of the video viewing in India is happening in a local language and YouTube, which has 265 million unique, active users has reported that over 95% of its users watched videos in a regional language.
Many OTT players are also investing in building their regional content libraries to match the demand from these audiences, the report mentioned.
Telco partnerships have also emerged as an important source of subscription/syndication revenue for the OTT platforms, with a significant 30-35% contribution to the overall subscription revenues in FY19.
Platforms like ALT Balaji, Eros Now etc. are examples of players who have substantial revenue contribution coming from telco distribution.
Some players have also forged partnership among themselves to mutually benefit each other and also with social media platforms (such as Facebook) to broadcast their content. For example, 'Arre' has partnered with 'Sony Liv', 'Yupp TV' and 'Facebook' for content
""While majority of the players have started to offer shorter duration packs (weekly and monthly), some players are also bundling regional / international content separately to cater to different viewer segments.
In order to cater to a wider user base in India, some players are also experimenting with cash payments, the report noted.
Long-form content has grown with players like Netflix, Prime Video, Zee5 and Alt Balaji focusing on creating originals with episodes ranging from 20 to 60 minutes.
Short form content is highly popular on social media platforms like Facebook, YouTube, Snapchat, etc.
""Short form is also receiving due attention from OTT platforms like Eros Now and Hoichoi who are building their short form content libraries with short stories, comedies, interviews, etc,"" said the KPMG report.
On the other hand, OTT players have been reducing the cost of their subscription through introduction of basic, affordable packs.
For example, Hotstar launched its low-cost subscription pack in the form of 'Hotstar VIP', whereas Netflix introduced 'mobile only' plans which are 50% cheaper than its basic plan.
These cost-reduction initiatives by the OTT players has resulted in some parity being achieved when it comes to TV pack vs. OTT pricing.

22,2019-08-28,Zee,"This essentially means, for example that video streaming services like VOOT or ZEE5 may now be listed as separate companies and raise their own investmentIndustry experts point out that there was no explicit policy on digital media previously

NEW DELHI :
In what may be seen as the latest extension to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Digital India campaign, the Union Cabinet has approved 26% FDI (foreign direct investment) to digital media platforms. This was previously only applicable to print media in the country.
“Even as foreign direct investment slows down across the globe, we are looking to liberalise norms in the country. We hope India can maintain its position as an attractive investment destination and grow in the coming months,"" Union Minister of Finance Piyush Goyal said while addressing members of the media on Wednesday.
Industry experts point out that there was no explicit policy on digital media previously.
“All digital media was simply subsumed under the broader legal entity it was part of, broadcasting or otherwise,"" explained Jehil Thakkar, partner at Deloitte India. “This will now allow digital platforms to be unlocked from the bigger companies and seek separate valuation.""
This essentially means, for example that video streaming services like VOOT or ZEE5 that are run by broadcast networks like Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd or Viacom18 Media Pvt Ltd may now be listed as separate companies and raise their own investment.
Industry experts say the Modi government has been exceptional and at the forefront of creating digital infrastructure as public good. While one is not sure why there was this wait for FDI in digital media when the print media and broadcast allow for 26% and 49% FDI respectively through government approval route.""
Unlike traditional media, digital impacts 1.2 billion people across social stratas in cities and villages. In fact, the figure should be raised even higher to 49%. This money will help unlock lot of value which today is captured in listed entities. It will help create consumption and employment across digital payments, entertainment, education and healthcare.
However, there are two sides to the coin given that there were no specifications at all earlier.
“Earlier there was no FDI restriction in digital media, so the current imposition of 26% is restrictive, and so bad news for the sector,"" said Manav Sethi, group chief marketing officer at over-the-top streaming service Eros Now."
21,2019-08-29,Zee,"The boom in online streaming is freeing content creators from box-office pressures and creating a new actor

New Delhi: Actor Ranvir Shorey has never had a schedule so chock-a-block. While his thriller Web show Sacred Games launched its second season earlier this month, Shorey is also prepping for a feature film called Loot where he stars alongside Kunal Khemu and Rasika Dugal, which is slated for an October release. In the last eight months alone, he has seen the release of three other Web shows—crime thriller Rangbaaz and sports drama Bombers on ZEE5, and family drama Metro Park on Eros Now.
“I’m very happy with the addition of Web series to my calendar because I used to sit without work for long periods of time earlier,"" said the actor known for critically acclaimed performances in films like Titli, Sonchiriya and A Death In The Gunj. “As far as the casting in films go, there is a lot of politics, backbiting and marketing involved, which I’m not great at,"" he added, laughingly.
“This gives me another avenue to work on,"" Shorey said, echoing the sentiment of a roster of creative talent across India—actors, writers, and directors who have turned to 30 odd video streaming platforms to either escape the grinding battle inside a box office-driven movie industry that doesn’t always recognize merit or in order to add to their own repertoire, by taking to the Web to tell the kind of offbeat stories that compelled them to get into the movie industry to begin with. The resurgence in their careers and fortunes is evident. For the likes of Emraan Hashmi and Dia Mirza to Shorey and directors like Zoya Akhtar, online streaming has become the most exciting thing in town.
In many ways, the streaming business has truly come of age. According to Asia on Demand, a report by economic and strategy advisory AlphaBeta Advisors, globally, video-on-demand operators spent around $21 billion in 2017 and this could more than double by 2022. While Asia accounted for only around $2.7 billion in content spending in 2017, this could rise to $10.1 billion by 2022.
Watch video: Web streaming and the new careers for Bollywood stars
Box office mania
Beyond the influx of money, however, the single biggest reason for talent going digital is an inherent disillusionment with the existing economic logic of the movie industry.
“Films are more calculated risks. It starts with the investment and then turns into box office numbers,"" said Divyenndu, who started with hits like Pyaar Ka Punchnama and Chashme Buddoor and was most recently seen in Mirzapur on Amazon Prime Video and Badnaam Gali, a ZEE5 original film. “It’s all about the opening day and the opening weekend. What that does in the process is you start to compromise on the creative aspects, be it casting, the kind of subject you’re working on, or even a small thing like the kind of language you’re using because you need a U/A censor certificate.""
Dealing with the cluttered Indian movie market that makes over 1,000 films in at least 27 languages for 9,601 screens, producers have learnt the hard way that the first three days can make or break the fortunes of a film. The cast, marketing, release strategies, and spends are all geared towards making the best of that narrow window. What that often results in is not enough leaps of faith.
When producer Ashi Dua was ready with her anthology Lust Stories, she realized that the audience for a film like hers would not be found in a theatre. “So, instead of spreading my wings to places in India where people may or may not appreciate content like this, we decided to go ahead with a platform that is tailor-made for it. And I’m thrilled with the response we got from across the world, which I’m not sure we would have gotten theatrically,"" Dua said.
What over-the-top (OTT) platforms like Netflix have done is they have given content creators a voice without the unnecessary, accompanying fear of a slew of other factors that come in the way while making a film in India. The country is so huge that marketing a movie far and wide can get difficult and expensive. Most filmmakers also never know if they’re reaching out to a preferred target audience. A streaming platform, on the other hand, comes directly to people’s homes.
“There is no politics in the distribution of this product. There will be no bitching or elbowing people out for theatre space. Your networks and contacts which are normally used to get prime shows, all of that is not here,"" said Shorey, recalling how many of his smaller films didn’t manage to get attention or box office numbers simply because of the available show timings, after being edged out by bigger films.
Merit speaks
While Web streaming may be the new Wild West in the world of Indian entertainment, new forays often come with their own set of challenges. Nobody has figured out a viable and sustainable way to make money on the Web yet. And producing a good movie or mini-series costs money.
Netflix India reported a marginal profit of  ₹20.2 lakh in 2017-18, according to filings with the Registrar of Companies. Given the fact that the market is at a nascent stage and competition is intense, most players, including foreign entities with deep pockets like Netflix and Amazon, are not even looking at returns. The attempt is to just keep head above water, for now.
And it is precisely this lack of expectation, at least for the time being, that is encouraging a lot of B-town aspirants to make a beeline for the world of streaming.
“Bollywood has shot itself in the foot a little bit,"" said Arjun Mathur, known for films like Luck by Chance and Angry Indian Goddesses and who played the lead in Amazon’s Made In Heaven created by Zoya Akhtar and Reema Kagti last year. “The norms it has been running on have not allowed a lot of talent to emerge. That is not a system we can shake and we don’t care to either. All the actors that were waiting in the wings are getting opportunities. Their work is being appreciated way more than many mainstream actors and the content is doing better than a lot of the A-list films.""
Divyenndu also admitted that casting for the Web is much more democratic and merit-based... precisely because it’s not just about numbers or contacts anymore. The good thing is the Web doesn’t throw up box office numbers, Mathur said, so there is no stress to meet those pressures.
“It helps that film-makers like Zoya Akhtar actually go ahead with a cast that she believes will bring nothing but performance to her series. She would have never been able to do the same for a feature film without A-list stars,"" Mathur said.
Conventional television, on the other hand, is still driven by the need for ratings and continues to be a medium catering to the most common denominator. Siddharth P. Malhotra, who conceptualized and produced Kaafir and has also directed Rani Mukerji-starrer Hichki, apart from doing a lot of television work, said that on TV, you have to take approvals for every small thing—from dialogues to themes and the rough cuts after editing. Kaafir, on the other hand, he said was his vision, put together by him piece-by-piece.
“Around 1998-99, the television scenario changed entirely and there weren’t that many roles for actors like us,"" said actor Rajesh Tailang referring to the saas-bahu sagas that took India by storm. Tailang was seen in Netflix’s Delhi Crime and Selection Day and Amazon’s Mirzapur. He, however, started his career with television shows like Shanti.
“I kept doing films though (Phantom, Haseena Parkar). Things in cinema have changed only recently. It’s not like there is no space for good actors or that they don’t want them, but earlier people either didn’t want to experiment with new actors or the writing was such that it only revolved around the protagonist. So, there was no focus on sub-plots or supporting actors,"" Tailang said.
Television offered actors like Tailang length, but no depth, while films didn’t guarantee either. The world of Web streaming seems to have both. Given that a show has at least six episodes, actors have much more time to flesh out their characters, giving them a story arc, regardless of where they stand in the plot.
“Even if you aren’t playing the protagonist, you have scope to perform. The Web is a great space for actors like me, not as an alternative (to films or television) or a back-up but as an entirely new space to explore,"" Tailang said.
Busting stereotypes
A lot of people are also looking for a change of image, a feat impossible to achieve when typecast in cinema. Divyenndu, for example, was saddled with the fun, boy-next-door, comic image after Pyaar Ka Punchnama. In Mirzapur, he plays a power-hungry, sexually aggressive, small-town lout.
“In the film industry, things change very slowly. Every once in a while, there would be something new that comes out and that would work, but at the end of the day, 80-90% of the producers and actors are still stuck in that old rut,"" said director Ken Ghosh, known for hits like Ishq Vishk. He is now helming ZEE5’s crime thriller Abhay.
As a filmmaker, Ghosh said he always wanted to do something new but the success of Ishq Vishk ensured his producers only asked him to come up with campus romances, even though he attempted a thriller (Fida) and a children’s film (Chain Kulii Ki Main Kulii) later.
“With the Web, if there’s anything even halfway clichéd, they will reject you. They’re looking for something new constantly and that is very exciting,"" Ghosh said. “Having said that, once you get to making what you’re making, the old rules still apply—you still have to tell the story, you still have to tell it well, and you have to connect with the audience.""
Perhaps, the pitfall of the stereotype is strongest for female actors. Dia Mirza, who played the lead in ZEE5’s Kaafir, said the digital platform has really given women the opportunity to shine within narratives.
“We’re not reduced to mantle pieces. Stories are now being driven by and for very strong women. That, for me, has been, the most liberating aspect of the digital medium,"" said Mirza, who plays a Kashmiri woman accused of militancy in Kaafir. She cited the example of two other shows that stand out in terms of how their female protagonists have been conceived —Leila, where Huma Qureshi plays a woman dealing with a dystopian, intolerant world, and Delhi Crime, where Shefali Shah leads a racy investigation in a high-profile case of sexual assault, both on Netflix.
“Many more examples will continue to emerge in the coming years. Stereotypes of ageism and sexism that the box office and industry was limiting us (women) to have all been unshackled,"" Mirza said.
Guidelines and restrictions
Apart from the absence of any need to cater to a theatre-going audience, there is no attempt to appease the censor board either on the Web. Earlier this year, nine OTT video-on-demand services including Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALTBalaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now decided to adopt a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai)is looking at the possibility of bringing OTT digital communication services that provide same or similar services as telecom service providers (TSPs) under the similar licensing or regulatory norms. But things are fluid at the moment, offering far greater leeway for experimentation in a fickle social milieu where protests outside cinema halls have become far too common.
Bhavani Iyer who had written the script of Kaafir 13 years ago, intending it originally to be made into a movie, said the fact that one doesn’t have to worry about pushing a particular scene to the limit is unprecedented for a writer.
“OTT platforms are a thriving place to be in today, principally because it is a free zone. Your ideas can be unusual. You’re not limited by language or genre and pure good content rules,"" said Rangita Nandy, executive director and creative director at Pritish Nandy Communications (PNC) Ltd that produced Amazon Prime’s Four More Shots, Please! In 2005, the company had released Hazaaron Khwaishein Aisi that was held up at the censors for ages and then couldn’t find distribution because it was an unusual film for its time. Their musical comedy, Jhankaar Beats, couldn’t find casting for the longest time because of its unconventional script.
“PNC has taken so many risks but yet there were times when we had no option but to look away from a script because it was box-office-risky, censor-board-impossible, or just plain too-ahead-of-its-times. Now, we don’t need to,"" Nandy said."
20,2019-08-31,Zee,"The Zee network that owns satellite rights to the Aanand L.Rai directed filmApart from Zero, kids’ film Junglee, action thriller Genius and romantic drama Loveyatri are some recent box office failures that have found acceptance on television

Panned by critics for poor storytelling and listed as one of 2018’s biggest box office failures, Shah Rukh Khan’s Zero was barely anything to write home about till its television premiere earlier this year. Data from BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) shows that the film debuted with 9.2 million impressions in July, pushing broadcaster Zee Cinema to the top rank in the Hindi movie category that week. It was also the second highest watched film in the Hindi movie genre on a paid platform for a subsequent airing in the first week of August with 3.9 million impressions.
Impressions refer to the number of individuals in thousands of a target audience who viewed an event, averaged across minutes. BARC is the country’s TV monitoring agency.
The Zee network that owns satellite rights to the Aanand L.Rai directed film, said it has done better than hits like Padmaavat, Sanju, Baaghi 2, Stree, Raid, Sonu Ki Titu Ki Sweety and Badhaai Ho on television, and with good reason.
“The Red Chillies team had a different cut for us, a shortened and more sharply edited version which helped the film,"" said Ruchir Tiwari, business head, Hindi movies cluster, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. Tiwari added that the network made a conscious effort to market the film differently from theatrical release pegging it on the journey of the protagonist, played by Khan, from Meerut to Mars.
“When it released in theatres, the Mars mission angle in the film was a suspense for audiences, but here we totally played it up during marketing. Satellite television always has that leeway where we can open up the story more during promotions than during theatrical marketing, it’s the nature of the game,"" Tiwari said. He also credited the success of the film to the inherent nature of the TV-viewing audience in India.
“ Theatres are frequented more by the youth and urban dwellers. There are large masses in the country which don’t go to the theatre by habit, understandably so, because of the effort involved and TV is their first platform for viewing content,"" Tiwari said.
The problem with large-scale films like Zero also is that a lot of people trust the negative word-of-mouth, especially on social media during theatrical release, which further translates into box office collections. A lot of these people may watch these movies later and realize they weren’t as bad as they were made out to be. Navin Khemka, CEO, MediaCom, South Asia, called it a basic case of wanting to watch unique content at home for free and re-watching it if it resonates with you.
“The film spoke to the entire country in its own language and when people saw the promotions, it didn’t seem like a complicated film but a straight-from-the-heart, emotional story. It was anyway unique to see him here visually (he plays a vertically challenged man) but who doesn’t want to watch a Shah Rukh Khan film that comes once a year?"" Tiwari said.
Rohan Lavsi, business head, Colors Cineplex (the film channel of Viacom18) said television has always had a slightly different audience set versus movie theatres and that difference has only been widened over the last few years with the growth of multiplexes. Theatre-goers have started experimenting with and liking more differentiated storytelling while TV audiences still prefer traditional content, more massy and family entertainers over serious narratives.
Apart from Zero, kids’ film Junglee, action thriller Genius and romantic drama Loveyatri are some recent box office failures that have found acceptance on television. On the other hand, hits like Gully Boy, Andhadhun, Gold, Pink and Uri: The Surgical Strike have not replicated their box office charm on the small screen.
“The upper end of the viewer spectrum is not watching TV today, some of them have cut the cord or are hooked on to other mediums. While a lot of film content is now available on streaming platforms, that base is very small and there is no impact on TV ratings. But more than ratings, what is important is sustenance—you don’t spend that kind of money just to get the first premiere rating. The larger test of a title is in its ability to generate numbers on repeat viewing,"" said Neeraj Vyas, senior vice-president and business head, Sony Max cluster, Sony Pictures Network."

New Delhi: The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has invited suggestions for the certification of online content, minister Prakash Javadekar announced at an interaction between the film industry and members of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), organized by the latter in Mumbai on Saturday.
Javadekar, however, provided no other details.
As of now, there are no rules to certify or censor online content. Earlier this year, nine OTT video-on-demand services including Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, ALTBalaji, Reliance Jio, Netflix and Eros Now decided to adopt a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).

At the event, Javadekar unveiled a logo and certificate design for the CBFC. He said the introduction of QR code in the new certificate design is in sync with the changed digital world. It will bring in greater transparency and provide richer information to filmmakers.

18,2019-09-05,Zee,"For 30% of consumers, full-length feature films are the most popular category on OTT platformsAnother 20% opted for movie-related content such as music videos

New Delhi: Even as all over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platforms invest heavily in creating original content, it is library content, including movies and music, which most viewers in India watch on these services. A new report by global auditing firm KPMG along with video streaming service Eros Now titled Unraveling the Digital Video Consumer states that for 30% of consumers, full-length feature films are the most popular category on OTT platforms; another 20% opted for movie-related content such as music videos. Catch up TV and sports content follow suit with 22% and 16%, respectively. Originals, on the other hand, were lapped up only by 10% of consumers.
The findings have emerged as part of a survey undertaken by 1,458 OTT users across 16 cities of India.
Further, more than half (58%) of the respondents who prefer watching movies (among the top three content categories) watched it over more than one session. This percentage was significantly higher in the metros (85%), against tier-I or tier-II towns, highlighting the relatively lower disposable time on hand in the metros.
The preference for movies could potentially be due to the limited supply of originals (less than 1% of the overall content available on most broadcaster-driven and global platforms) in contrast to library content, which forms a bulk of the content available on online video platforms, according to the report. For example, Eros Now currently has 12,000 movie titles, while ZEE5 has more than 50,000 hours of TV content.
“Movies are meant to cut across demographics and cater to the least common denominator. So it isn’t surprising that they make up nearly 50% of the overall content consumption,"" said Ali Hussein, chief operating officer, Eros Now.
There are further insights on preference for long and short-form content. While nearly 40-45% of the respondents preferred 20-45 minute session, the less than 20 minute (short form) and above 45 minute (long form) sessions were also significant. About 41% in the 15-24 age group, for example, prefers 20-45 minute videos, while 31% of the 25-36 age group watches content longer than 45 minutes.
Comedy remains the most watched genre (84%), followed by drama (62%), action (51%), thriller (44%) and horror (32%).
Online video platforms in India are truly catering to the masses as far as the frequency and duration of consumption are concerned. Audiences across the country are taking to the streaming space, while people in metros spend 9.8 hours per week on these platforms on an average, the figure is 7.5 and 7.9 for tier-I and tier-II towns.
The average time spent on a streaming platform by an user is 70 minutes per day, with a single session clocking in an average of 40 minutes. About 87% of the respondents admitted to consuming content on their mobile phones, with three out of 10 respondents consuming it through telco platforms, outlining the importance of the distribution medium. Although small, an interesting 5% of the respondents consumed content on their Internet-enabled smart TVs, which could be an important growth avenue in the future, according to the report. About 29% of respondents watched online video even during office hours, outlining the ‘Anytime, Anywhere’ nature of online video.
While Hindi dominated the online video consumption language preference with 64% of the respondents alluding to the same, nearly 30% of the overall respondents preferred consuming online video content in vernacular or regional languages. A significant 20% of the preference was for south India-based languages, while the preference for English was at 6%, lower than the English speaking population in India.
Content played the most crucial role when it came to respondents actually subscribing to a paid online video platform. A relatively small, but not insignificant 14% of the respondents considered subscription to online video platforms as an alternative to TV subscription, according to the report.
“Cord cutting is a genuine reality in India,"" Hussein said, referring to recent developments such as the Eros Now partnership with technology brand OnePlus to launch the OnePlus TV in India or Airtel’s launch of its TV and streaming converged platform Xstream, which bring benefit to subscription-based video platforms."

Mumbai: Subhash Chandra-led Essel group has received the first instalment of money from its stake sale in flagship firm Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL), as it races to meet a month-end payment deadline.
In July, Essel group announced the sale of 11% stake in ZEEL to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund for  ₹4,224 crore. Of this, the sale of 8.7% stake has now been successfully concluded, the group said in a statement. The exact amount received was not disclosed.
“The group is confident of completing the balance sale of 2.3% stake over the next few days. The group is working towards timely completion of operational formalities in order to conclude the entire transaction at the earliest. This development reaffirms the group’s positive progress on its overall asset divestment approach undertaken to generate adequate liquidity for the repayment process. The group is also working actively on further divestments including its non-media assets and remains confident to complete the same,"" the statement said.
Facing a payment crisis in February, Essel group entered into a standstill agreement with mutual funds holding its debt securities, under which the funds agreed to refrain from selling ZEEL shares they held as collateral till 30 September, giving Essel time to sell assets to repay them.
Over the last few days, the group has repaid  ₹3,356 crore to mutual funds from the money received from the stake sale, a person aware of the development said, adding that Essel owes a total of  ₹7,500 crore to creditors.
Still, there is a large gap to fill. Sales of its non-media assets—particularly Essel Infrastructure—are hanging fire. On 30 August, Essel group said it would sell 205MW of its operational solar energy assets to Adani Green Energy Ltd at an enterprise value of  ₹1,300 crore. Bloomberg has reported that the group was in talks with the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund to sell six of its road projects, while The Economic Times has reported that Sachin Bansal, co-founder of Flipkart, is keen on buying its mutual fund and finance businesses. For infrastructure assets, the group will have to first settle project-specific debt.

Mumbai: Mint brings you your dose of the top deals news, reported from newsrooms across the country.
With stake sales, Yes Bank is now poised for a makeover
Yes Bank’s shareholding structure may witness a major churn by the year-end as founder Rana Kapoor has initiated talks to sell a part of his holding to One97 Communications Ltd, the parent of Paytm and Paytm Payments Bank, Mint reported. Independently, a Reuters story on Tuesday cited Yes Bank CEO Ravneet Gill as saying that the bank is close to selling a minority stake to a global tech company as part of its capital-raising exercise. Although the bank subsequently denied these reports, Mint independently verified that such talks might have indeed progressed somewhat. The tech firm’s association is expected to help further the bank’s digital ambitions. The bank has already been talking to large private equity firms for capital infusion. On 30 August, Yes Bank’s board proposed to increase the bank’s authorized share capital from  ₹800 crore to  ₹1,100 crore to enable an expansion in the paid-up capital. If Rana Kapoor does manage to sell his stake to One97 Communications, or any other shareholder, it will not make any difference to the bank’s capital structure. Fresh equity issuance, on the other hand, will lead to dilution in promoter shareholding.
Steadview in talks to lead fresh funding round in 2-wheeler rental startup Vogo
Hedge fund Steadview Capital is in talks to lead a $50 million funding round in two-wheeler rental startup Vogo, Mint reported citing two people aware of the matter. Existing investors such as venture capital firms Matrix Partners, Stellaris Venture Partners and Kalaari Capital are also expected to participate in the round. Founded by Anand Ayyadurai, Sanchit Mittal and Padmanabhan Balakrishnan in 2017, Vogo provides scooters and motorcycles on rent through its mobile application wherein users can pick up and drop the vehicles at dedicated places within a city. The service is currently available in Hyderabad and Bengaluru. Vogo is also backed by ride-hailing firm Ola, one of India’s most valuable startups, due to their common investor Matrix Partners. Ola currently provides a credit line, through which Vogo uses debt to purchase scooters. This allows Vogo to seek lesser equity funding than rival Bounce, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners.
Saudi Aramco CEO signals local listing coming 'very soon'
Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil firm that is seen as the kingdom's crown jewel, is ready for a local listing on the kingdom's stock exchange and that it will happen ""very soon,"" Associated Press reported citing Amin Nasser, chief executive of the company. He, however, declined to say how much of the state-owned oil giant would be listed on the Tadawul exchange. Reports have emerged that 1% of the company could be sold locally later this year before more is sold on an international market.Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first announced plans for an initial public offering of the company in 2016, saying up to 5% of the company would be sold publicly. The government has since delayed the timing of the IPO , most recently to finalize a deal that saw Aramco acquire a nearly $70 billion stake in Saudi petrochemicals firm SABIC. The crown prince has valued Aramco at $2 trillion, but analysts estimate it could be worth closer to $1.5 trillion. Even at that lower end, a partial listing of Aramco would potentially be the world's biggest IPO ever.

Blackstone Set to Buy Rest of Indiabulls’ Commercial Assets
Blackstone Group has signed a term sheet to acquire the remaining 50% stake in Indiabulls Real Estate’s commercial properties for over  ₹4,420 crore, The Economic Times reported citing persons with direct knowledge of the development. Blackstone had concluded a similar deal for 50% of the portfolio for nearly  ₹4,750 crore in March 2018, marking one of the country’s largest such transactions in real estate. Indiabulls confirmed signing the term sheet with Blackstone for the commercial portfolio, without ascribing a value to the deal. It includes rights to assets at BLU in Mumbai’s Worli area and Sectors 104 and 106 in Gurgaon, Indiabulls said.

CVC Capital and Carlyle could make the shortlist for the 30% Shriram Capital stake that Piramal Enterprises and private equity fund TPG are selling, The Economic Times reported citing multiple people aware of the bids. Five PE funds, including Advent, Blackstone and Brookfield, had submitted initial offers. Advent International has invested  ₹1,000 crore via its affiliate Jomei Investment in Aditya Birla capital last week. Existing investors in TPG Capital and Piramal Enterprises are looking to exit the financial services firm. The transaction is likely to value the unlisted Shriram Capital at around  ₹18,000-20,000 crore, pegging the combined holding of TPG and Piramal group at around  ₹6,000-7,000 crore. The new investments will depend on the management width that Shriram Capital will be able to offer. Over the last six years, Piramal has not been able to take full management control despite his initial investment of  ₹4,600 crore in the Chennai-based Shriram group."
14,2019-09-12,Zee,"The Apple TV+ library does not have a lot to offer the mass Indian consumer at the momentApple accounts for only 1.6% of the smartphone market in India, where smart TVs comprise 30% of all television sales

New Delhi: Apple’s foray into the global content business may be easier visualized than done, at least as far as the Indian market is concerned. The California-based company that announced its new streaming service Apple TV+ on Tuesday, scheduled to hit screens on 1 November, is a late entrant to the already crowded OTT (over-the-top, as it is called in India) video market. India is currently home to more than 30 platforms, including US services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, and a range of home-grown services such as Hotstar, ZEE5, ALTBalaji and Voot.
One problem is that access to the service is likely to be extremely limited. Apple TV+ will be available on the Apple TV app, along with a seven-day free trial on Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, Apple TV 4K, Apple TV HD, Apple TV (3rd generation), iPod Touch and Mac, besides select 2018, 2019 and newer Samsung smart TVs, and on Amazon Fire TV, LG, Roku, Sony and Vizio platforms. Apple, however, accounts for only 1.6% of the smartphone market in India, where smart TVs comprise 30% of all television sales.
“Apple TV+ will work only on iOS devices. India is predominantly an Android market. With such low penetration of Apple devices in India, the impact will be minimal,"" said Abneesh Roy, senior vice president (research) of Edelweiss Securities.
Secondly, the Apple TV+ library doesn’t have a lot to offer the mass Indian consumer at the moment. The service, which at launch will include eight original shows such as The Morning Show featuring Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon and See, a sci-fi drama featuring Jason Momoa, has no Indian originals in the works. All streaming players in India, including Netflix and Amazon, have made a conscious effort to dish out original content in multiple local languages, including films and serials set in small towns featuring popular local faces. As recently as Wednesday, Netflix announced a partnership with Dharmatic Entertainment, the digital content arm of Bollywood filmmaker Karan Johar’s company Dharma Productions for a range of original films and shows. It already has deals with Shah Rukh Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainment to create content and with Aamir Khan to acquire the actor’s movies. Arch-rival Amazon Prime Video, on the other hand, has long-term deals for feature films produced by Johar and actor Salman Khan. Further, when Hotstar starts to route Disney+ content to India in the months ahead, it will be localized by dubbing or by adding subtitles in Indian languages, including Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Together, OTT services are slated to invest about  ₹2,500 crore in original content in India this year, according to an earlier Mint report.
“Premium audiences may lap up the Hollywood content, but the service will find few takers without originals,"" Roy said.
The existing services perhaps see no reason to fear Apple TV+.
“We sometimes look at everything as competition, when what it’s actually doing is creating a culture of high-quality storytelling. With all these services coming in, there are more opportunities for creators and we must celebrate that. We are a country of 1.3 billion people and I think everybody has room to play,"" said Monika Shergill, head of international original series at Netflix India. “At Netflix, we’ve always believed our primary goal is to bring very high-quality stories and if the market matures, it can only be an advantage to everybody.""
To be sure, for Apple, the focus on new gaming and content streaming at aggressive monthly tariffs may stem from more than a desire to diversify. The streaming move comes on the back of the company looking to create new revenue streams amid falling phone sales globally.
Overall, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $53.8 billion in the June quarter, an increase of 1% from the year earlier. Sales of iPhones generated $26 billion in revenue, down 12% from the June quarter last year.
However, the focus on subscription-driven revenue may be a happier hunting ground for the company: services generated a record $11.5 billion in revenue for the company in the June quarter, with revenue excluding iPhone sales increasing 17% from last year.
“Services is a big bet for the company. They have realized they have to keep users hooked in the iOS ecosystem. No other brand has this kind of control on its end-to-end ecosystem,"" Tarun Pathak, associate director of Counterpoint Research, said. “The content subscription is at an aggressive tariff as Apple does not want price to be a deterrent at an early stage. It may even look at acquisitions in the content space going forward.""
Apple, the world’s third largest smartphone seller after Samsung and Huawei, has a minuscule share in the price-sensitive Indian market, where Chinese budget brands such as Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo and South Korea’s Samsung are top sellers. Budget smartphone sellers dominate, with a 95% share of the smartphone market.
However, the brand, which opted for a strategic shift in pricing strategy in April with discounts on its flagship iPhone XR, has realized the importance of reducing price entry barriers for the iOS ecosystem. In April, the phone maker decided to opt for price cuts in India and brought down the price of the 64GB iPhone XR from  ₹76,900 to roughly  ₹59,000. Similar discounts were introduced for other variants of the same model as well. Indian consumers lapped up this scheme.
“Apple is realizing that with the saturation in China, they have to look at the next set of emerging markets and their pricing of the iPad, Apple Watch series 3 and iPhone 11 reflects that,"" Pathak said."

Netflix plans to come out with four web series in 2019 and 15 original Indian feature films by 2020. This year alone, Netflix is expected to spend $15 billion (over  ₹100 billion) on content. Clearly, India is big on their radar.
When it comes to Amazon Prime Video, the global platform is working on doubling its original content offering for India this year, with ""The Family Man"", ""Bandish Bandits"", an untitled drama thriller series created by Sudip Sharma highlighting Indian politics, Asif Kapadia's crime thriller ""The Last Hour"", and second seasons of ""Breathe"" and ""Mirzapur"" in the pipeline.
The grand plans by each of these OTT platforms for India is in sync with the burgeoning global presence of the medium in world of entertainment. According to a source to ""hollywoodreporter.com"", the budget of Amazon Studios' ""Lord Of The Rings"" series could hit $1 billion, which includes the production costs, visual effects and the cast and creative teams. Amazon bought the global rights to the property by paying around $250 million.
The streaming giant also spent big on superhero satire ""The Boys"", dark fantasy thriller ""Carnival Row"" and on the making of the new season of ""Jack Ryan"" with actor John Krasinski leading the show. The period drama ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" also comes alive with big budget.
Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke says ""the biggest strategy is to build home for talent"".
""It is not about volume play. It is more about relationship driven play with some best creators in the industry,"" Salke told IANS.
""There is no end to the ambition which Amazon has... There is no mandate. It is born out of love of the content and that forms the strategy...There are no numbers which we have to hit in the streaming service. There is endless aptitude for what we can bring to the service, the bar is very high and we want to maintain the situation for streaming costumer,"" Salke added while explaining the strategy plan of the streaming giant.
There's no denying that there's big idea behind the big spending.

In fact, upcoming Disney is also widening the content slate, with ambitious projects -- which will come with big budgets.

12,2019-09-19,Zee,"A February deal to extend the repayment deadline had been criticized by Sebi and investorsThe Essel group has embarked on sales of non-media assets, particularly those housed under Essel Infra

Mumbai: Essel Group chairman Subhash Chandra has secured a six-month extension from lenders to repay debt given its inability to pay back more than half of its dues by 30 September as agreed earlier, a mutual fund executive familiar with the details said.
A standstill agreement with mutual funds and non-bank lenders that was inked in February has now been extended to 31 March, the person said on condition of anonymity.
As part of the initial agreement, Essel group had agreed to sell assets to repay all dues to lenders by the September deadline.
In return, the lenders agreed not to sell pledged shares of the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL). Essel owed a total of  ₹7,500 crore to the lenders but has since repaid  ₹3,356 crore to them.
The agreement to extend the repayment deadline in February had faced criticism from investors and the markets regulator. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman Ajay Tyagi on 28 June said the regulator “does not recognize"" standstill agreements.
Sebi has initiated adjudication proceedings against two fund houses—HDFC Asset Management and Kotak which had fixed maturity plans (FMPs)—that held Essel papers.
HDFC Mutual Fund had rolled over its FMP and Kotak Mutual Fund had held back some units in lieu of the Essel exposure.
Subsequently, HDFC AMC transferred the Essel debt in the affected FMPs which were maturing before 30 September to its own books.
“It is unclear whether the funds will recover the principal and interest even after six months. Sebi has so far taken only limited action in addressing bad debt with the side pocketing rules. I think the regulator needs to be more proactive in resolving this matter,"" said Shriram Subramanian, managing director, InGovern Research Services, a corporate governance advisory firm.
An official spokesperson for Essel group said: “The Essel Group is in constant dialogue with the consortium of lenders. The overall asset divestment approach is in steady progress and the group remains focused on the repayment process. All decisions taken in this process so far have been in the interest of the lenders and have only been implemented after their consent.""
In July, the Essel group agreed to sell an 11% stake in ZEEL for  ₹4,224 crore to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund. Earlier this month, the sale of 8.7% stake was concluded, and the group repaid  ₹3,356 crore to mutual funds from the proceeds. The group said at the time that it is confident of completing the balance sale of 2.3% stake soon.
Executives at Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, Kotak Mutual Fund and ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, who are all lenders to Essel and are part of the standstill agreement, did not respond to calls and texts from Mint about this matter.
“Investors in schemes with more than 1-2% exposure to troubled groups like Essel should exit. We have followed this rule for our clients. However, investors should take exit load and tax implications into account while redeeming their investments,"" said Suresh Sadagopan, founder of Ladder7 Financial Advisories.
The Essel group has also embarked on sales of its non-media assets, particularly those housed under Essel Infrastructure.
On 30 August, Essel group said it would sell 205MW of its operational solar energy assets to Adani Green Energy Ltd at an enterprise value of  ₹1,300 crore. The company is also in talks with buyers to sell the rest of its renewable energy portfolio, a part of its highways portfolio and its mutual fund and finance businesses. However, none of these deals have so far been finalized.
On Thursday, The Economic Times reported that an arbitrator appointed by the Delhi high court has asked Subhash Chandra not to sell his unpledged stake in ZEEL till 16 October as part of arbitration proceedings between Chandra and Indiabulls Housing Finance.
In response to Mint’s query on whether this would hinder the Zee stake sale, the Essel spokesperson said: “The group wishes to confirm that the arbitration proceedings between Essel Group and Indiabulls Housing Finance do not have any bearing on the ongoing stake sale of ZEEL as shares being divested are pledged with the mutual funds / NBFCs / banks."""

10,2019-09-23,Zee,"The certification may not be extended to international content, and may only apply to Indian originalsSelf-regulation classifies content into separate and distinct categories such as meant for general or universal viewing

NEW DELHI :
The ministry of information and broadcasting (I&B) is looking to finalize a model for the certification of online video streaming content soon after Diwali, people familiar with the development said. While nine video streaming sites in India had decided to adopt a self-regulatory Code of Best Practices under the aegis of the Internet and Mobile Association of India (Iamai) earlier this year, a couple of new shows have raised concerns in the corridors of power, they said.
These include Leila on Netflix that hints directly at the repercussions of right-wing Hindu fundamentalism and the kind of dystopian society it could create, and Gandii Baat on ALTBalaji that features erotic-themed stories from rural India. To be sure, both Netflix and ALTBalaji were among those, along with Hotstar, Voot, ZEE5, Arre, SonyLIV, Reliance Jio and Eros Now, that had agreed to self-regulation. The self-regulatory code by streaming platforms banned content which is anyway prohibited, including child pornography, content encouraging acts of terrorism and disrespect to national symbols or outraging religious sentiments, among others.
Further, self-regulation classifies content into separate and distinct categories, such as meant for general or universal viewing; content that requires parental guidance and/or content that is solely meant for age-appropriate audiences (such age-appropriate audience may be further sub-categorized into different age groups). Platforms are also required to display a content descriptor or guidance message that indicates and informs the viewer about the nature of the content, particularly around age-inappropriate content for minors.
Lastly, the signatories to the code agreed to a grievance redressal mechanism whereby they would appoint or institute, as part of their operational systems, a dedicated person, team or department, to receive and address any consumer-related concerns and complaints in relation to the content they are showcasing.
The I&B ministry did not respond to Mint’s queries on its plans for a certification provision. “Our pitch to the government for the past few months has been multi-fold,"" said a senior executive from a leading over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platform, on condition of anonymity.
“The video streaming industry in India is barely five years old. Its basic tenet always was democratization and the government cannot tell us how to run it on the basis of what it thinks is right or wrong, without regulating the broader social media and internet space in the country, where all kinds of objectionable content is readily available, be it Facebook or apps like Tik Tok,"" the person added.
Besides, most OTT services, such as Hotstar, ZEE5 and VOOT, in India are owned and operated by television broadcast networks, which already know how to adhere to multiple regulations when it comes to the small screen. “They will not be stupid enough to disturb the harmony of a space that is working towards digital inclusion, or bringing all of India under the ambit of digital education and content consumption,"" the senior executive said, adding: “This just shows an inherent lack of trust in us.""
To be sure, the certification will not be extended to international content available on these platforms, but will only apply to Indian originals, the first person cited above said.
Yet, other OTT platforms are optimistic about the new move. They are certain that it will not lead to censorship. Most say, in its conversations, the government has hinted at mostly wanting a mechanism for taking a platform to task for objectionable content, not actually filtering everything that goes out.
“I don’t think they will come down too hard on the industry. The idea is to come across as fair and transparent because there is some kind of clamp on the movie and TV industries,"" said a second streaming platform executive. “The goal is to get OTT players to become reliable and responsible as the whole ecosystem grows and cord-cutting becomes a reality in India.""
According to the Ficci-EY media and entertainment industry report 2019, paid video subscribers grew from around 7 million in 2017 to 12-15 million in 2018, while video subscription revenues grew almost four times in 2018 to  ₹13.4 billion. Countries, such as the US and the UK, do not look at certification or censorship norms for online video, if content is deemed offensive in terms of, say, hate speech or child pornography, it is seen as a criminal offence."

If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans

Indian media giant Essel Group, run by industry mogul Subhash Chandra, is seeking an extension to repay debt in order to avoid creditors liquidating its shares.
The company faces a month-end debt repayment deadline. If that’s not met, creditors can sell shares in the group’s flagship Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. kept as collateral against loans. The case highlights broader risks that borrowings backed by stock pose to the equity market. There’s a lot at stake with share-backed loans currently at about 1.9 trillion rupees ($26.5 billion).
Essel Group’s Chandra is seeking to sell assets ranging from a stake in the nation’s most valuable publicly traded TV network to roads. Shares of his Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. have plummeted to the lowest level in five years.
“We have certainly discussed the point pertaining to the extension as well, purely in the interest of deriving the right value for the precious assets,"" said Punit Goenka, managing director and chief executive officer at Zee Enterprises in an emailed response, “The lenders have noted our view and have been extremely supportive.""
The media tycoon’s challenge is the first of what could be a string of tests this year for beleaguered business titans. They have raised funds to expand their empires by pledging equity stakes in their firms and the clock is ticking as repayment dates loom.
Risks Mount
“Not everybody is going to come out of this alive,"" said Jayanth R Varma, a professor at the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad, referring to the founder’s funding predicament. “I can’t imagine that all the groups that are in trouble today will be able to sort out their mess.""
Chandra has already sold $614 million of its Zee Entertainment Stake to Invesco Oppenheimer Developing Markets Fund and has agreed to sell his solar power projects for $182 million to Adani Green Energy Ltd. The Essel Group has begun paying back creditors, including about half of the 3.95 billion rupees ($55.7 million) it owes Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Co., Harsha Upadhyay, chief investment officer for the asset management firm said in an interview.
Still, some lenders didn’t agree to extend Essel Group’s repayment deadline beyond September end and has sold the shares of Zee Entertainment kept as loan collateral, a representative for the company said in an email statement on Tuesday. Others have “in-principally agreed to grant more time to"" repay debt, the representative said.
Broader Concerns
Shares of publicly traded firms with a large portion of equity pledged as collateral risk abrupt declines should lenders move to recover their dues. For instance, Chandra’s Zee Entertainment lost $1.6 billion in market capitalization in a single day on fears that creditors would offload shares.
A spokesman for Emami Ltd. declined to comment.
Should Essel group clear its debt hurdles, equity investors will still need to keep a close eye on the progress other conglomerates make in slashing debt, as companies’ credit quality endures the longest streak of deterioration since 2014.
“Stocks are getting decimated on their market capitalization, some company founders have realized their error and are liquidating assets,"" said Sanjiv Bhasin, executive vice-president at IIFL Securities Ltd. in Mumbai. “Prudent risk management is the order of the day.""

MUMBAI :
Cash-strapped Essel Group on Wednesday said that its lenders have agreed to extend the timeline for loan repayment by the company.
In a statement here, the Essel Group said that its lenders have extended ""complete support"" to the group and its promoters.
""Essel Group today (Wednesday) announced and confirmed that its lenders have unanimously agreed to extend the timeline, enabling the group to optimize the value output from the sale of the assets,"" it said.
The group further said that the mentioned extension of the timeline was requested purely in the interest of deriving the right value of the precious assets of the group.
""The lenders have extended complete support to the group and its promoters, recognizing the intrinsic value of the assets and the overall asset divestment process undertaken. The group remains confident on further divestment, including its non-media assets,"" it added.
On September 20, the group had said it was in a steady and progressive dialogue with all lenders. It had also sought an extension of its September 30 deadline for repayment of debt of around  ₹7,500 crore owed to few mutual funds and non-banking institutions.
Essel Group's announcement comes in the backdrop of few of the lenders having sold 72.5 lakh shares of Zee Entertainment Enterprises (ZEE) that were pledged by its promoters.
The promoters held over 35 per cent stake in the company as of June 30, of which around 2.1 crore shares were pledged.
Of late, the company has been in talks with several companies to sell its stake in Zee Entertainment Enterprises but without any concrete development. This very extension would give it time for its divestment plans.

4,2019-09-27,Zee,"'There cannot be a standstill agreement between mutual funds and their borrowers does not exist'All entities need to follow the mutual fund regulations, says Sebi chief Ajay Tyagi

Mumbai: Ajay Tyagi, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), on Thursday said India’s asset management companies (AMCs) cannot resort to any kind of standstill agreement with borrowers.
“There cannot be any standstill agreement between mutual funds and their borrowers. All entities need to follow the (mutual fund) regulations,"" Tyagi said on the sidelines of an annual capital market summit organized by industry body, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).
A standstill agreement is an understanding between a lender and a borrower, wherein the lender stops demanding a scheduled payment of interest or principal on a loan so that the borrower gets time to restructure its liabilities.
On Wednesday, Subhash Chandra’s Essel Group-owned Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) said its lenders, including mutual funds, had extended the loan repayment deadlines.
Mutual funds have lent around  ₹4,000 crore to ZEEL through non-convertible debentures (NCDs). Fund managers of fixed income schemes, such as fixed maturity plans (FMPs), had bought the ZEEL NCDs.
While open-ended mutual fund schemes typically have a flexible redemption deadline, closed-end schemes have strict fund closure deadlines linked to the maturity dates of the NCDs or other debt papers, in which the scheme has invested in. When an AMC agrees to a standstill agreement—primarily to facilitate a borrower who is unable to service debt on the due date—it essentially short-changes investors by disregarding the committed FMP maturity date.
AMCs have been facing rising risk exposure, because of potential defaults by a number of firms (in which mutual funds have invested), which eventually led to rating downgrades. Tyagi said mutual funds should not rely completely on credit rating agencies (CRAs) and should have their own way of assessing risks.
On Tuesday, Sebi had said in a circular that mutual funds should adopt a “waterfall"" approach for valuation of money market and debt securities in their portfolios. AMCs must ensure all traded securities are valued on the basis of traded yields, subject to identification of outlier trades by the valuation agencies, Sebi added.
Sebi altered the definition of “below-investment-grade"" and “default"" in mutual fund norms, stating that a money market or debt security shall be classified as “below investment grade"" if the long-term rating of the security is below BBB- or if the short-term rating of the security is below A3.
A money market or debt security shall be classified as “default"" if the interest and/or principal amount has not been received, on the day such amount was due, or when such security was downgraded to “default"" grade by a CRA.
Sebi mentioned that any extension in the maturity of a money market or debt security shall result in the security being treated as “default"". If a security is in default beyond its maturity date, the AMC must disclose the details and the value of the security and the total amount due (including principal and interest).
It said the disclosure will continue till the value of the security recognized in the net asset value is received, or for a period of three years from the date of maturity of the security. Sebi said all debt securities with residual maturity of over 30 days have to be valued at the average of security level prices obtained from valuation agencies to be appointed by Association of Mutual Funds of India.
On 27 June, Sebi had disapproved standstill agreements and said it will initiate action against mutual funds if there were defaults in cases involving loans against shares to company promoters."
3,2019-09-27,Zee,"Author Sujata Assomull and illustrator Aparna Ram showcase a 100 film costumes which left a mark on the country’s silver screen and its audiencesThe book is also telling of how these costumes inspired fashion trends from the reel into the real world

When one thinks of some of the most memorable costumes from Hindi films, Madhuri Dixit Nene’s royal purple sari from Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! instantly springs to mind. Such was its appeal that not only did it become a staple costume for young girls at family functions but Mattel also decided to launch a Barbie doll dressed similarly. From a more recent crop of films, the one costume that has caught public imagination like no other is Kareena Kapoor Khan’s combo of a long T-shirt worn over Patiala salwars in Jab We Met. For several years now, it has been the attire of choice for college girls.
Several such styles are part of 100 Iconic Bollywood Costumes (Roli Books), in which author Sujata Assomull and illustrator Aparna Ram trace the relationship between fashion and Hindi films between 1950-2018. The idea is to showcase reel moments that have had an impact on real fashion. For instance, it elaborates on the costumes in the 2010 movie Aisha, which influenced the way girls dress in plush pockets of urban India—straddling a traditional Anamika Khanna and a Dior dress with equal ease.
The book features a foreword by fashion designer Manish Malhotra, who has created designs for some landmark films, such as Rangeela and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna. He writes: “I generally believe that films have always influenced fashion in India…. People have always looked to movies for style inspiration.""
Many of the featured outfits are set against songs that linger in memory even today, like Pyar Kiya Toh Darna Kya from Mughal-e-Azam and Chaiyya Chaiyya from Dil Se. “From the days of Chhaya Geet to MTV India, it is the songs that have received maximum attention, often featuring some of the most iconic moments from a film. It is no wonder then that costumes from these tend to have the highest recall,"" explains Assomull.
The idea of working on a book on Bollywood fashion occurred to Ram when she came across a similar book chronicling 100 iconic dresses.
She wanted to create a platform for Indian fashion sensibilities for a global audience. So, Ram started putting together illustrations of some of the most loved costumes from Hindi cinema in a notebook—and bit by bit, the book started taking shape.
A similar idea, of doing a coffee-table book on the evolution of Indian fashion, had been on Assomull’s mind—and she had talked about it to Priya Kapoor of Roli Books several times. Little did she know that it would transform into a comprehensive tome one day.
The book’s journey started with a call from Kapoor during which she mentioned Ram’s drawings of key fashion moments in Hindi cinema. “Priya asked me if I would like to write the text and I readily agreed,"" she says. There were logistical challenges in putting together the book, with Ram based in London, Assomull in Dubai and Roli Books in Delhi.
The book was 18 months in the making, from research to interviews with film directors, costume and fashion designers, and film critics. One of the key challenges for Ram was to reproduce illustrations as close to the original as possible so that readers would immediately recognize the scene from the film. “Some of the most challenging illustrations were the ones with a lot of detailing, such as those worn by Madhuri and Aishwarya (Rai Bachchan) in Devdas or by Raveena (Tandon) in Bombay Velvet,"" says Ram.
100 Iconic Bollywood Costumes doesn’t just chronicle significant style changes in cinema and mass fashion over the years but also sheds light on how costumes have served as visual markers for the sociocultural ethos of the time. For instance, Zeenat Aman’s kurta and skirt in the song Dum Maro Dum instantly evoke the hippie culture of the 1970s.
The featured costumes don’t just stand out for their aesthetic value but also as critical contributors to the storyline and the character profile. “For example, in Seeta Aur Geeta, if you look at the scene in which Seeta is meeting a prospective groom, she wears this very short pink dress—and is obviously uncomfortable. To me, this speaks of how many Indian girls of the time were not comfortable in Western clothes but wore them to seem ‘cool’ and ‘modern’,"" says Assomull.
The book also touches on how film costumes have helped revive an interest in traditional fabrics and techniques—whether it is the resham-embroidered mulmul cottons in Jodhaa Akbar or the Phulkari work in Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi, to name a few.
Though Hindi films have always remained a point of reference for style, there was also a period, in the 1980s for instance, when “filmy fashion"" wasn’t always considered up to par. “But a lot has changed since then,"" says Assomull.
One factor that ushered in change was the arrival of multiplexes in the late 1990s. This gave a platform to independent film-makers to portray films and characters that resonated with middle-class audiences.
Perhaps the biggest endorsement of the importance of fashion in films is the allocation of a budget and dedicated departments for costumes. Indian and international designers have realized that with the right project, films are an effective way of reaching a wider audience.

2,2019-10-02,Zee,"India’s OTT video streaming market is set to touch $5 billion by 2023, as per a BCG report

A fortnight ago, Mint reported that the government is mulling a new certification model for video streaming sites after Diwali. The certification will be aimed specifically at Indian originals. The buzz has created another round of panic among over-the-top (OTT) video streaming platforms. At present, India boasts of around 35 OTT platforms, both home-grown and foreign players, such as Zee5, SonyLiv, Hotstar, Netflix and Amazon Prime.
The government is believed to have been irked by Leila, a series on Netflix, which showcases a dystopian society that Hindu fundamentalism could create. “What the government needs to understand is that this is a fiction show. It’s entertainment, not news,"" said the head of a broadcaster-owned video-on-demand (VoD) platform, requesting anonymity.
Executives working for VoD platforms added any kind of government intervention could kill the barely five-year-old OTT industry. “Although the government is likely to consult stakeholders before finalizing anything, right now everyone is making their own assumptions. But it is for sure that something or the other will be put in place soon to regulate online content,"" said one person aware of the development, also requesting anonymity. “In my view, it is a bad idea if the government comes out with a guideline or a code. Media and civil society should see the danger of succumbing to the political and bureaucratic pressures, as this will take away the creative freedom,"" the person cited above added.
He said OTT platforms must actively self-regulate to avoid government interference.
Earlier this year, several OTT players joined hands to set up a self-regulatory content code under the aegis of Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI).
The stakeholders probably thought that it was wise to adopt the code before government censorship. Among the signatories to the code were streaming platforms such as Hotstar, Voot, Zee5 and SonyLiv, as well as independent firms such as Arre, ALTBalaji, Netflix and Eros Now.
Speaking to Mint earlier, Uday Sodhi, business head, digital, Sony Pictures Networks, had said that with the OTT industry achieving scale, “it is time to lay down guidelines for ourselves. The consumers have expectation of maturity from us. We should start building the processes of protecting them"".
OTT platform owners say signatories to the code are already displaying information on strong language, or defining appropriate age for all content. Yet, they argue that the government needs to understand the difference between push and pull content. OTT video streaming is unlike a cinema hall, and is more about a personal choice, probably on a personal device. Besides, executives at some OTT firms argued that being part of big broadcasting companies, they are not foolish to put out random pieces of content. “We are not irrational. Because what we do on our OTT platforms will have ramification for our TV business,"" said a senior executive, requesting anonymity.
Rajiv Bakshi, CEO, Reliance Entertainment’s Big Synergy, agreed: “To be fair, there has been no shortage of self-regulation in the industry, be it broadcasting or video streaming. Media companies have their own standards and protocols that they follow in accordance with their brand proposition. Industry has done remarkable work in this regard. They have observed the market and kept changing and adapting to that. After all they want their media to be consumed.""
He added that in case there’s talk of regulation for OTT, its purpose has to be clear—“whether you are regulating to create a level playing field, for protection of intellectual property or for security and safety"". However, the discussion around OTT content gains importance as video is seen as a big change agent, influencing behaviour. An earlier Boston Consulting Group report titled, Entertainment Goes Online, said India’s OTT video streaming market is set to touch $5 billion by 2023. 82% of the users in the Indian market are engaged on advertising-led video-on-demand platforms versus 18% who pay for content on subscription-led services. The report added that by 2023, 40-50 million users will be paying subscribers, while 600 million will be engaged on advertising-led platforms.
Self-regulation advocates argued that the government should focus on the bigger problems, such as fake news and data privacy, rather than worrying about OTT content which is curated.

1,2019-12-18,Zee,"Technology will be key in creating a personalized experience, as consumption shifts to digital

When Shailesh Prakash, chief information officer and executive vice-president of digital product development at The Washington Post, spoke to Mint on the sidelines of a newspaper conference in New Delhi last month, he underlined the importance of technology in content platforms quite forcefully. Counted among the people responsible for the American paper’s growing online audiences, he said while journalism at The Post has been excellent, there has been a huge focus on technology. The transition of a loss-making product into a profitable one could not have been possible without superlative design and technology. For their online products, publishers need to have the speed of Google, the beauty of Apple, and the convenience of Amazon, he said. Else, despite good journalism, consumers will switch to another site.
The same argument holds true for the more than 30 over-the-top (OTT) video streaming sites that are currently operational in India. They not only have to fight the content war, but also need to back it up with matchless technology. In a recent interview, Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings said that both content and technology are critical to the success of a platform. “We need great technology to be able to stream in any situation, to be able to download and then to have great stories,"" he said.
Given the significance of technology, Zee5 CEO Tarun Katial plans to revamp and re-launch the Zee5 app. He feels that the user interface and experience need to change. The new user interface will improve navigation, leading to better content discovery. Besides, it will be a lighter and faster app. Several studies show that when a consumer gets hooked to a user interface, he finds it difficult to shift to another brand.
Technology requires investment in three areas. First is the back end that comprises the servers, content ingestion, and encoding. The front end includes user interface. “Then, there is artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) which comprises recommendation engine, auto preview engine, and an optimization engine, which helps us hyper-personalize an app for each and every individual,"" says Katial.
“You cannot hyper-personalize the app manually at scale for about 80 million people (Zee5’s monthly active users),"" he says. AI and data mining platforms need to understand every user, Katial says. “We measure hundreds of events…when you launched the app, when you touched the thumbnail or started a video and shut it. We are measuring you every nano second. Then we recommend packs or shows to you.""
Clearly, there’s a fair amount of ongoing investment in technology which streaming platforms make. At Zee5, the ratio of investment in content versus technology is 60:40. The video, vernacular and voice trends in OTT that Katial likes to talk about are backed by technology. The video story is an interesting one as the device ecosystem has undergone a big change. “There is the Jio smartphone at the bottom end with 40 million users, a  ₹8,000 TV at the other end, and all the Chinese phones in between,"" says Katial. Every phone has different memory and every consumer could be in a different network such as 3G or 4G. “So streaming has to serve you the video on an ongoing basis whether you are in a slow or fast network. The viewing has to be seamless. That is a big trend,"" says Katial. He says that people are watching video even on their feature phones.
What they are watching on such phones is vernacular content. Vernacular is very big, according to Katial, and the Zee5 app offers user interface in 12 languages. It also serves up content in all these languages. “This is the reality. India is not a homogenous country.""
Lastly, voice search is growing big with both the young and old going for it. It is also popular with the lower-income strata. Zee5 offers voice search in 11 languages.
Karan Bedi, CEO at video streaming platform MX Player, believes in four main pillars of OTT—distribution, content, technology, and monetization. “The perfect mix of these creates a scalable and successful business. Content and technology are equally important in this equation and we invest heavily in both,"" he says.

The regulatory body has come up with a set of rules which changes plans, packages and pricing of TV channels by all operators like Airtel DTH, Tata Sky, Dish TV, Hathway Cable, Siti Cable, Sun DTH, etc. The new tariff order by TRAI, in most likelihood, will reduce the price you pay for watching television if you make a judicious choice of channels. After the TRAI order, not only have all broadcasters like Sony, Star, Zee, Discovery, Disney, National Geographic and Sun TV announced individual pricing of all their TV channels but they have also come up with bouquets of several channels at discounted packages.
