95,2018-01-10,UltraTech,"Supreme Court stays the invocation of Rs1.65 crore bank guarantee given by Ultratech Cement in a 2008 allocation of the Bhaskarpapa coal block in Chhattisgarh

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the invocation of a bank guarantee of Rs1.65 crore given by Ultratech Cement Ltd in a 2008 contract for the allocation of the Bhaskarpapa coal block in Chhattisgarh.  
New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the invocation of a bank guarantee of Rs1.65 crore given by Ultratech Cement Ltd in a 2008 contract for the allocation of the Bhaskarpapa coal block in Chhattisgarh. 
The coal block was allocated to Ultratech in 2008 to meet its coal requirement for its end use plant at Chittorgarh in Rajasthan.
A bench headed by Justice J. Chelameswar issued notice to the Centre and sought its response on the issue.
Ultratech had moved the Chhattisgarh high court challenging the coal ministry’s November order of 2012 de-allocating the Bhaskarpara coal block, jointly allocated to it and Electrotherm (India) Ltd, on the ground that no substantial progress in the development of the coal block was made.
The ministry had decided to invoke the bank guarantee to the tune of Rs1.65 crore as per the terms and conditions of the allotment letter. 
While its plea was pending in the Chhattisgarh high court, the Supreme Court, in September 2014, the Supreme Court cancelled allotment of 204 coal blocks, including 42 operational mines, and another 32 ready-to-start blocks.
On 15 November, 2017, the Chhattisgarh high court held Ultratech’s petition to be infructuous. In doing so, it did not address the question of invocation of bank guarantee.
Ultratech challenged the high court order in the apex court saying it had committed an error of law by ignoring the principles governing exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. 
The cement manufacturer said the bank guarantee encashment could not be enforced as the same was an obligation under the contract that was declared “arbitrary and illegal"".
It further contended that the high court had erred in not examining whether the order invoking the bank guarantee was legal or not. The high court has not appreciated that since the allocation in itself was declared void, any contract entered into by parties which is contrary to the statutory scheme governing such a contact, would be equally void, the petition said."

92,2018-01-19,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement's operating performance took a hit due to ban on pet coke, and hike in import duty on it after the ban was lifted, which increased energy costs

The 3% drop in UltraTech Cement Ltd’s stock price on a day when the domestic equity markets were soaring showed that investors were disappointed by the company’s December quarter (Q3) results. A like-to-like comparison of the quarter’s performance with a year back is not meaningful, due to the recent acquisition of cement units from the Jaypee Group. But operating profit missed forecasts significantly in spite of a ramp-up in cement sales because of weak realizations and unanticipated cost hikes. 
The 3% drop in UltraTech Cement Ltd’s stock price on a day when the domestic equity markets were soaring showed that investors were disappointed by the company’s December quarter (Q3) results. A like-to-like comparison of the quarter’s performance with a year back is not meaningful, due to the recent acquisition of cement units from the Jaypee Group. But operating profit missed forecasts significantly in spite of a ramp-up in cement sales because of weak realizations and unanticipated cost hikes.
The Aditya Birla Group cement conglomerate’s stand-alone net sales catapulted by an impressive 33% to Rs7,471 crore. But this was driven by a 37% jump in volumes, thanks to the incremental capacity from its acquired units too. However, sales realization per unit of cement sold was not up to expectations. It was even lower than the September quarter by about 5% and flat on a year-on-year basis. This explains the weakness in cement prices. Besides, analysts say that the pan-India cement producer’s non-trade (large institutional) sales were substantially higher during the quarter, where prices are much lower than in the trade segment.
Further, it was a quarter of unanticipated cost hikes. The ban on use of petroleum coke by cement firms and the hike in import duty on it, after the ban was subsequently lifted, increased energy costs by 21% year-on-year. That apart, rise in diesel costs resulted in higher logistics expenses. These two components account for about two-thirds of the total operating costs, therefore taking a toll on operating performance.
The quarter’s operating margin (excluding other operating income) at 15.5% missed Bloomberg’s estimate by a huge 350 basis points. According to Binod Kumar Modi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd, the per tonne Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) at Rs717 was poor compared to Rs949 and Rs957, respectively, in the year-ago period and the September quarter.
This is not to say that there is gloom ahead. Clouds appear to be clearing up and the management, in the analysts’ conference call, painted an improving demand environment for cement. The infrastructure and low-cost housing push should augur well for the industry and for UltraTech, the country’s largest cement producer.
Although costs continue to rise, analysts reckon that the company has deftly steered through challenging times. Also, costs during the quarter could have been higher due to incremental maintenance cost of the newly acquired units, which will normalize as capacity utilization improves from the current 70% levels. Dealers say that the pan-India company has been pushing sales aggressively in new regions to gain market share.
The key to higher profits in the coming quarters therefore rests on cement prices that should support realizations along with higher sales volumes. Otherwise, the story of rising revenue and declining profits may continue as was the case in the December quarter, when the reported net profit at Rs422 crore was 25% lower year-on-year.
A ramp-up in utilization of capacities of its acquired units, along with improved realization, is important to support the stock price."

Mumbai: Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla and an investor group led by Dalmia Bharat Ltd are emerging as the lead bidders for India’s Binani Cement Ltd, which is being sold under the country’s insolvency process, people with knowledge of the matter said.
Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd and the Dalmia Bharat consortium have each made cash offers of around Rs6,000 crore ($936 million), the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. As part of that, they have agreed to pay back secured lenders who are owed about Rs4,000 crore, according to the people. UltraTech and the Dalmia Bharat consortium are among six suitors that submitted final offers, the people said.
Shares of Binani Industries Ltd, the parent company of Binani Cement, were up 5.8% to Rs113.55 at 12:05pm in Mumbai Wednesday, the most since 28 December.
The bids from UltraTech and Dalmia Bharat varied in the way they would address the Rs2,500 crore owed to unsecured creditors, said the people. They also differed in the size of equity stake they offered creditors, one of the people said.
A new Indian bankruptcy law designed to clear out distressed assets has set off a contest for more than Rs4 trillion ($63 billion) of deals and has spurred interest from both foreign and domestic companies and funds. JSW Group, HeidelbergCement AG and a consortium including local private equity firm True North and Ramco Cements Ltd also submitted final offers for Binani Cement, the people said.
Billionaires Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakishan Damani together also made an offer for Binani Cement, according to the people. Dalmia Bharat is bidding with India Resurgence Fund, which is backed by Bain Capital Credit and local conglomerate Piramal Enterprises Ltd, the people said. JSW has also put in an aggressive bid, one of the people said.
Representatives for Ramco, True North and UltraTech declined to comment. Representatives for Binani, Dalmia Bharat, Jhunjhunwala, JSW, India Resurgence Fund and Heidelberg didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: The race for Binani Cement Ltd is headed for a photo finish with top two contenders—Dalmia Bharat Cement Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd—submitting nearly identical bids. 
Mumbai: The race for Binani Cement Ltd is headed for a photo finish with top two contenders—Dalmia Bharat Cement Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd—submitting nearly identical bids.
The two finalists have submitted bids of roughly around  ₹ 6,000 crore each, two people close to the bidding process said, adding that the amount includes upfront cash payments, as well as an offer of close to 20% stake in Binani to lenders.
According to the people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, lenders will decide on the winning bid in the coming week. Bloomberg was the first to report on 17 February that the race for Binani has narrowed down to Dalmia Bharat Cement, backed by Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund, and Aditya Birla Group company UltraTech.
“Both bidders have been asked to furnish additional details pertaining to their bids, following which the creditors will take a final decision,"" said the first of the two people cited above. According to this person, UltraTech has been specifically asked to provide information on a Competition Commission of India (CCI) penalty, which is a contingent liability on the company. 
In 2016, CCI had imposed a penalty of Rs1,175.49 crore on UltraTech. This was part of an overall penalty of Rs6,700 crore on 11 cement companies, including UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja Cements Ltd, Ramco Cements Ltd and JK Cement Ltd, as well as industry body Cement Manufacturers Association for indulging in cartelisation. UltraTech approached the Competition Appellate Tribunal against the order, which stayed it.
Binani Cement is part of the Braj Binani Group and is a subsidiary of Binani Industries Ltd (BIL). BIL is the holding company of the group, and has presence in five key businesses areas including cement, fibreglass, infrastructure and energy. Mint had reported in January that at least two lenders of Binani Cement, currently undergoing insolvency proceedings, have moved the appellate bankruptcy tribunal after the insolvency resolution professional (IRP) rejected their claims on corporate guarantees worth Rs2,000 crore issued by the company to some subsidiaries in the Binani group. Accordingly, resolution professional from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Llp partner Vijay Kumar Iyer set a new deadline of 12 February, factoring in the additional liability of around Rs1,600 crore.
Emails sent to UltraTech Cement, Dalmia Bharat Cement and Deloitte remained unanswered till press time. 
The cement sector in India has witnessed several large deals in the past two years, signalling consolidation in the space. In July 2016, Gujarat-based soap and detergent maker Nirma Ltd announced the acquisition of Lafarge India’s cement assets for $1.4 billion. In August 2016, Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure Ltd sold its cement business to Kolkata-based Birla Corp. Ltd, the flagship company of the MP Birla Group for Rs4,800 crore. Last year, Aditya Birla group company UltraTech Cement paid Rs16,189 crore to acquire the cement business of Jaiprakash Associates. The transaction increased UltraTech’s cement capacity by almost a third to 90.7 million tonnes per annum and gave the company access to the markets of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh East, Himachal Pradesh and coastal Andhra Pradesh, where it did not have a presence.
Mint reported in November that Puneet Dalmia-controlled Dalmia Bharat group had submitted a binding offer to acquire Nagpur-based Murli Industries Ltd, which is currently facing bankruptcy proceedings in the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). The total haircut sought by Dalmia was close to 80% of the outstanding loans of Murli Industries, which has presence in cement, paper industries and solvent extraction."

Mumbai: Dalmia Bharat Cement Ltd on Tuesday emerged the winner for troubled Binani Cement Ltd, beating India’s largest cement maker UltraTech Cement Ltd which had put in a nearly identical bid.
The creditors’ panel supervising the insolvency proceedings of Binani Cement on Tuesday approved the resolution plan submitted by Dalmia, backed by Bain Piramal Resurgence Fund. Mint had reported on 19 February that Dalmia Bharat and UltraTech had submitted nearly identical bids. 
The Dalmia consortium has agreed to invest around Rs6,700 crore in the stressed cement firm over a period of time, two people aware of the development said. Binani Cement, which was admitted by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) in July 2017 for resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code, owes around Rs6,500 crore to its lenders. 
According to the two people cited earlier, UltraTech’s bid was edged out because of some concerns around Competition Commission of India related penalties.
An UltraTech Cement spokesperson said she is not aware of the development pertaining to CCI and declined to comment on the matter. 
In 2016, CCI had imposed a penalty of Rs1,175.49 crore on UltraTech. This was part of an overall penalty of Rs6,700 crore imposed on 11 cement companies, including UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja Cements Ltd, Ramco Cements Ltd and JK Cement Ltd, as well as industry body Cement Manufacturers Association for indulging in cartelisation. UltraTech approached the Competition Appellate Tribunal against the order, which stayed it.
The second person said the committee of creditors will meet representatives of the consortium over the next two days to crystallize the plan further. “The lenders will be able to recover almost all the money. The committee of creditors will be holding meetings over the next couple of days to negotiate with the consortium on any further tweaks that may be needed to the resolution plan,"" he said. 
According to the resolution plan, Binani Cement will be kept as a separate entity until the restructuring is completed. Once the resolution takes place, the entity will be merged with Dalmia Bharat. “The consortium has offered around 20% stake to the lender in Binani Cement. The lenders are, however, more keen on a cash deal,"" the first person said. 
The Dalmia consortium has offered  ₹ 4000 crore as upfront payment to secured lenders.
Binani Cement is a subsidiary of Binani Industries Ltd (BIL), a part of the Braj Binani Group. BIL is the holding company of the group, and has presence in five key businesses areas, including cement, fibreglass, infrastructure and energy. Binani Cement has an integrated plant in Sirohi Rajasthan which will help Dalmia Bharat Cement to strengthen its foothold in western India. Dalmia Cement, on the other hand, has a stronghold in south India. The firm has cement manufacturing plants in Dalmiapuram and Ariyalur Tamil Nadu and Kadapa in Andhra Pradesh, with a total capacity of 9 million tonnes per annum."

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd. has increased its bid for Binani Cement Ltd. in an email to the resolution professional overseeing the company’s bankruptcy proceedings as it tries to beat a consortium backed by Bain Capital that’s in the lead.
The company has raised its offer to about Rs6,600 crore ($1 billion) from about Rs6,200 crore earlier, chief financial officer Atul Daga said in an interview on Wednesday. UltraTech, controlled by billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, is competing with the consortium led by Dalmia Bharat Ltd., which has been chosen as the highest bidder. Vijaykumar Iyer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India LLP is the resolution professional overseeing the bidding.
“We are not happy with the way the process has been dealt with,"" Daga said. “It’s not transparent and equitable. Specially when there was only a marginal difference in both the bids, the lenders should have called both the bidders to maximize the value.""
UltraTech, India’s biggest cement maker, has approached the National Company Law Tribunal and the matter will be heard on 19 March, he said. Deloitte did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.
Dalmia Bharat had put in a bid of about Rs6,350 crore, people familiar with the matter said last month.

Dalmia Bharat proposed to make the Binani Cement investment through a 50-50 joint venture with India Resurgence Fund, which is backed by Bain Capital Credit and local conglomerate Piramal Enterprises Ltd., according to Thursday’s filing.
A successful sale may lure buyers for assets in Asia’s third-largest economy as authorities push lenders to clean up $210 billion of stressed debt. The central bank has already asked commercial lenders to resolve bad loans of the 40 biggest defaulters within a year as overdue borrowings hamper fresh investment and slow economic growth.
The process could be delayed as UltraTech, India’s biggest cement maker, has approached the NCLT with complaints on how the Binani sale process was run. A hearing will be held 19 March to consider UltraTech’s case, chief financial officer Atul Daga said in an interview on Wednesday. UltraTech has also written to the resolution professional overseeing the Binani sale, offering to increase its bid to about Rs6,900 crore from about Rs6,200 crore earlier, he said.
Dalmia Bharat said the Competition Commission of India has already granted approval to its proposed acquisition. Binani Cement has 11.25 million metric tons of global cement capacity, including 6.25 million tons in the Indian state of Rajasthan as well as operations in Dubai and China, the filing shows.
Binani Cement would mark Dalmia Bharat’s third successful bid for an insolvent cement company under the new Indian bankruptcy process. The company won approval for its resolution plans for Kalyanpur Cements Ltd. in January and Murli Industries Ltd. in December last year. Bloomberg"

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd, the Aditya Birla group company that has lost a bid to acquire Binani Cement Ltd, has challenged the sale of the cement maker to rival Dalmia Bharat Ltd, alleging lack of transparency in the bidding process. 
Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd, the Aditya Birla group company that has lost a bid to acquire Binani Cement Ltd, has challenged the sale of the cement maker to rival Dalmia Bharat Ltd, alleging lack of transparency in the bidding process.
“The creditors of Binani Cement have overlooked important aspects of the resolution plan submitted by us and have hastily decided to approve the sale to Dalmia for reasons best known to them,"" Atul Daga, chief financial officer at UltraTech Cement, said in an interview. 
“We fail to understand the reasons behind approving the sale to Dalmia, although we had made the highest bid,"" Daga said. “Isn’t the committee of creditors responsible for looking after the interests of all stakeholders?"" 
UltraTech has now challenged the sale to Dalmia Bharat at the National Company Law tribunal (NCLT), and the matter is scheduled to be heard on Monday at the Kolkata bench of the tribunal.
On 16 March, a committee of Binani Cement creditors approved the resolution plan from a consortium led by Dalmia Bharat Ltd.
The Dalmia Bharat consortium had bid about Rs6,350 crore ($978 million) and had offered close to a 20% stake in Binani Cement to its lenders.
Dalmia Bharat proposed to make the Binani Cement investment through an equal joint venture with India Resurgence Fund, which is backed by Bain Capital Credit and Piramal Enterprises Ltd. 
Mint had reported on 19 February that both UltraTech and Dalmia had submitted bids of roughly around Rs6,000 crore each, with included upfront cash payments, as well as an offer of close to 20% stake in Binani to lenders. 
Although Dalmia Bharat’s bid was marginally higher, UltraTech had raised the offer by Rs700 crore, taking its overall offer above Rs7,000 crore.
Mint had reported on 16 February that UltraTech was specifically asked by the creditors to provide information on a Competition Commission of India (CCI) penalty, which is a contingent liability on the company. 
In 2016, CCI had imposed a penalty of Rs1,175.49 crore on UltraTech.
This was part of an overall penalty of Rs6,700 crore on 11 cement companies, including UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja Cements Ltd, Ramco Cements Ltd and JK Cement Ltd, as well as industry body Cement Manufacturers Association for indulging in cartelization.
UltraTech approached the Competition Appellate Tribunal against the order, which stayed it.
“We were told that our bid was not being considered because of the contingent liability following the CCI order,"" said Daga.
“Even before we revised the bid higher, the difference in score between us was marginal, but lost out as creditors unilaterally decided that we will not get the Competition Commission of India approval for the deal,"" Daga added. 
On 23 February, UltraTech had approached the Competition Commission of India, seeking an approval in the event of it acquiring Binani Cement.
Dalmia Bharat, too, had made a similar request to CCI. Binani Cement is a unit of Binani Industries Ltd (BIL).
In July last year, NCLT’s Kolkata bench had admitted the insolvency petition against Binani Cement. Bank of Baroda (BoB) had referred the company to NCLT after it failed to repay around Rs100 crore, following which Vijaykumar V. Iyer of Deloitte India was appointed as the interim resolution professional (IRP). 
At the time of being admitted in NCLT, Binani Cement owed a consortium of lenders close to Rs3,042.93 crore.
Mint reported in January that at least two lenders holding corporate guarantees of Binani Cement had approached the appellate bankruptcy tribunal after IRP rejected their claims on corporate guarantees worth Rs2,000 crore.
Following the appeal, the appellate tribunal had admitted them as creditors of Binani Cement, thereby adding an additional Rs2,000 crore to its unpaid loans."
81,2018-03-20,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement offers Binani Cement's parent Rs7,266 crore on condition of terminating insolvency proceedings

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd has upped the ante in its bid to acquire debt-laden Binani Cement Ltd by initiating talks with its parent Binani Industries Ltd outside the bankruptcy process.  
Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd has upped the ante in its bid to acquire debt-laden Binani Cement Ltd by initiating talks with its parent Binani Industries Ltd outside the bankruptcy process. 
This adds a fresh twist to Binani Cement’s resolution and will test the bankruptcy framework as courts will now to have to decide if a counter-offer can be accepted after the creditor committee had declared a Dalmia Bharat-led consortium as the winning bidder. 
Separately, on Monday, the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) allowed the resolution professional to file the resolution plan submitted by the Dalmia consortium, despite opposition from UltraTech and the Binani group.
UltraTech Cement, India’s largest cement maker, informed the stock exchanges on Monday that it was willing to pay Rs7,266 crore to acquire Binani Industries’ 98.43% stake in its cement unit “subject to termination"" of insolvency proceedings. UltraTech’s board also agreed to issue a letter of comfort to Binani Industries, committing Rs7,266 crore funding, as the Braj Binani-led firm seeks to stop insolvency proceedings of the cement unit. 
On being asked if the agreement with UltraTech violates the insolvency and bankruptcy framework, Sameer A. Kaji, senior adviser for corporate strategy at Binani Industries, said, “It is an evolving process. It should ideally be within the right of the debtor to clear its dues. Creditors should not have any issue with it. The UltraTech deal leaves around Rs600 crore for the equity shareholders besides the clearing of all outstanding dues.""
According to legal experts, withdrawal of insolvency proceedings at the end of the resolution process could prove to be a difficult proposition as there is no clear procedure under law. 
“While the creditors could potentially consider such debt payoff proposals by promoters in cases where no bids have been received, it will be a difficult proposition for the lenders to accept where a winning bidder has already been finalized, and the promoter proposal involves funding from the sale of the distressed asset to another bidder. Also, the withdrawal of post-admission insolvency petitions requires court approval,"" said Sudip Mahapatra, a partner at S&R Associates, a Mumbai-based law firm.
Creditors, however, are now of the view that if an out-of-court settlement is approved and secured creditors are paid in full, they will support the deal. 
“If someone is covering up for the entire amount outstanding, we will be more than happy to consider the proposal. The proposal may need the blessings of the Supreme Court,"" an official from one of the creditors said on condition of anonymity.
UltraTech’s offer to Binani Industries came up after the cement maker challenged the sale of Binani Cement to Dalmia Bharat, alleging lack of transparency in the bidding process. It had complained to the NCLT and had also written to Binani Cement’s resolution professional offering to increase its bid to about Rs6,900 crore from about Rs6,200 crore earlier. 
Vijaykumar Iyer of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India Llp is the resolution professional overseeing the bidding.
Despite the higher bid, lenders had questioned UltraTech about a past penalty of Rs1,175.49 crore imposed by Competition Commission of India (CCI). This was part of an overall penalty of Rs6,700 crore on 11 cement companies, including UltraTech, ACC, Ambuja Cements Ltd, Ramco Cements Ltd and JK Cement Ltd, as well as industry body Cement Manufacturers Association for indulging in cartelization.
On Wednesday, the committee of creditors approved Dalmia Bharat’s bid.
The tribunal will now examine if the due process of law has been followed in firming up the resolution plan and if the selected bidder is eligible to acquire the company. Only if the resolution plan has been legally struck down, other bidders such as UltraTech could be considered, according to lawyers associated with the case, who asked not to be identified.
Even the agreement between UltraTech and Binani Industries is of no consequence if the resolution plan filed with the tribunal on Monday is found to be legally bullet-proof, they said, adding that under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, shareholders have no say in implementing a resolution plan approved by creditors.
It appears the matter will go all the way to the Supreme Court though there is only about a month left of the stipulated 270-day period within which creditors must approve a resolution plan, the lawyers said."

Kolkata: Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement Ltd is likely to get support from Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement in the ongoing fight for control after the Birla company issued comfort letter worth Rs7,266 crore to Binani group for 98.43% stake. 
Kolkata: Aditya Birla Group’s UltraTech Cement Ltd is likely to get support from Committee of Creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement in the ongoing fight for control after the Birla company issued comfort letter worth Rs7,266 crore to Binani group for 98.43% stake.
UltraTech had said that Binani Industries Ltd—the promoter firm of Binani Cement—had approached it for arranging funds to pay off the lenders. “As a creditor, we support the UltraTech offer as it offers a better deal for us,"" an official from a lead creditor said. This is despite the CoC’s approval of the Dalmia Bharat’s bid.
“Since, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) proceedings initiated about 7-8 months back on Binani, a moratorium on interest had been imposed. The UltraTech offer allows the loan to a regular one and there will be no haircut even in the interest loss in the interim period,"" the official said.
A revised bid after the CoC approval is perhaps a first instance and legal opinions remain divided on its sanity. But, if the NCLT proceeding is challenged in the Supreme Court, CoC will support the move.
The bid by Dalmia Bharat Cement jointly with Bain Capital’s Resurgent India Fund of Rs6,350 crore has been to buy Binani Cement offering 20% equity in Binani to the lenders. The total secured and unsecured debt of financial creditors is around Rs6,265 crore, of which the largest exposure is from Edelweiss ARC with an outstanding of about Rs2,775 crore.
The Dalmia offer covered the financial creditors but several small operational creditors have claimed their debt has not been taken care of properly and haircut of even 80% was sought, said Rajesh Tibrewal, who is representing these operational creditors. “We have also moved an intervention petition against the resolution professional (RP) for neglecting our interest and the same was listed for hearing on 22 March, he said. The MSME operational creditors’ dues are about Rs700 crore in Binani Cement, he added.
Tibrewal said that the insolvency law does not treat operational creditors at par with financial creditors which is lacunae in the law."

A tug of war between UltraTech Cement Ltd and Dalmia Bharat Ltd over the acquisition of Binani Cement Ltd’s assets has intensified. 
A tug of war between UltraTech Cement Ltd and Dalmia Bharat Ltd over the acquisition of Binani Cement Ltd’s assets has intensified.
In the latest twist, UltraTech Cement has offered to pay Rs7,266 crore to acquire Binani Industries Ltd’s 98.43% stake in its cement unit (Binani Cement) subject to termination of insolvency proceedings.
The UltraTech Cement board has also agreed to issue a letter of comfort to Binani Industries, committing Rs7,266 crore funding. The latter is now seeking to stop insolvency proceedings of the cement unit.
Ever since the Binani Cement assets were put on the block a few months ago, it has garnered a lot of interest from a range of suitors.
Cement companies including UltraTech Cement, HeidelbergCement India Ltd, JSW Group, Dalmia Bharat, Ramco Cements Ltd, and billionaires Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and Radhakishan Damani were reported to be in the race to buy the debt-laden company.
Last week, the committee of creditors approved Dalmia Bharat’s bid of around Rs6,300 crore. Following that, UltraTech Cement began aggressive countermoves challenging the committee’s decision.
Binani’s cement assets include a 6.25-million-tonne (mt) integrated cement unit in Rajasthan and 5mt grinding units in the overseas markets of China and Dubai. These assets are said to be the last of their kind, having good quality of limestone reserves, with a potential for brownfield expansion.
No wonder then the cut-throat competition.
As for financials, in fiscal year 2017 Binani Cement had gross consolidated sales of Rs2,100 crore, of which domestic sales were Rs1,500 crore, and debt of Rs4,200 crore, said a Kotak Institutional Equities report. It should be noted that Binani Cement has a fibreglass business as well.
For UltraTech Cement, which is among the top pan-India cement makers, successful acquisition will aid in consolidating its presence in the northern market, especially south Rajasthan.
According to analysts, at an enterprise value of around Rs7,300 crore, the transaction implies a value of $102/tonne, which is attractive compared to its previous acquisition of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd’s six integrated cement units.
Also, given UltraTech Cement’s large balance-sheet size, the company has the wherewithal to absorb Binani Cement’s losses, without severe stress on its overall debt position. 
Further, UltraTech Cement may see some savings on the logistics front, but it is too early to quantify these.
On the other hand, for south-based Dalmia Bharat, a decision in its favour would give the company access to newer markets of north India, taking its total capacity to around 40mt per annum. 
Interestingly, this would be the third acquisition of a bankrupt cement firm by Dalmia Bharat, after Murli Industries and Kalyanpur Cements.
While a final decision on the acquisition is awaited, the winner would face stiff competition from Shree Cements Ltd, which is a dominant company in Rajasthan, and other regional cement producers such as JKCement Ltd."

Kolkata: The takeover war for Binani Cement between Dalmia Bharat and UltraTech Cement Ltd refuses to ease as both the bidders remain committed to an acquisition despite the revelation of an alleged fraud involving the stressed asset.
Binani Cement’s resolution professional Vijaykumar V. Iyer has moved the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), alleging suspect and fraudulent transactions in Binani Cement carried out by an independent forensic auditor.
Dalmia Bharat Group CEO Mahendra Singhi said the company too had found some suspicious transactions during their internal evaluation but declined to quantify the amount.
At the time when UltraTech Cement was raising questions about transparency of the resolution professional, Singhi had a different view and supported the Iyer, saying there was no suppression of fact by the him and a transparent process was followed.
“A full lawful transparent process had been followed by the resolution professional and committee of creditors and accordingly all the bidders participated, and now Dalmia has submitted the 10% performance bank guarantee of the winning bid amount with the CoC,"" he said.
Dalmia Bharat has bid Rs6,500-6,600 crore for the Binani acquisition.
Singhi wondered whether UltraTech Cement would join hands with Binani in the wake of the alleged fraud. According to him, there is no legal provision under the insolvency and bankruptcy code to takeout the case which is already an admitted asset with the NCLT.
UltraTech CFO Atul Daga said though he had not seen those details of the alleged fraud, but said even then they remain interested on the asset. “Whatever revelation has come has taken place in the past and we want to start with a clean slate,"" Daga told PTI.
Daga, however, believes there was lack of transparency as UltraTech was not called for revised regulations before the voting of the Committee of Creditors. Singhi claimed that they have also taken care of small operational creditors but some of the MSME operational creditors have moved an application that their concerns were not addressed.
However, the counsel representing these small operational creditors said their interest was not taken care of and the amount involved would be about  ₹ 700 crore. PTI BSM NN"

Mumbai: Lenders differ with UltraTech Cement Ltd over the claim amount that it has to pay if the insolvency proceedings of Binani Cement Ltd are terminated, according to two people aware of the matter. 
While some creditors support UltraTech’s offer, they claim the company will have to repay liabilities worth over Rs8,000 crore.
“Some of the claims submitted by creditors were not eligible under insolvency proceedings. With Binani Cement looking to exit NCLT, the bidder should be able to repay the entire claim amount,"" said one of the people cited earlier.
According to this person, the break-up of the liabilities is as follows: Binani Cement owes Rs6,500 crore to financial creditors, Rs700 crore to operational creditors, Rs1,000 crore is statutory liability, Rs400 crore towards interest accrued from time of resolution process till now and Rs100 crore towards cost of the insolvency proceedings. That amounts to Rs8,700 crore.
UltraTech, on the other hand, believes that the claim amount is less than Rs7,000 crore.
“Whatever is the admitted amount under IBC (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code) that figure is finalized and should be paid off. The admitted amount is much less (than what some creditors are saying). Lenders’ liability is only Rs6,476 crore,"" said K.K. Maheshwari, managing director, UltraTech Cement. 
UltraTech Cement is negotiating with Binani Industries to acquire its 98.43% stake in Binani Cement outside the insolvency framework. 
It informed the stock exchanges on Monday that it was willing to pay Rs7,266 crore for this stake, provided the insolvency proceedings were terminated, and agreed to provide a letter of comfort to Binani Industries. UltraTech is competing with a Dalmia Cements Ltd-led consortium that was chosen by the committee of creditors as the winning bidder.
“Where all creditors are paid in full, there is a case for equity value where IBC is silent. If at all IBC allows a new equity holder to buy the shares and pay creditors in full, the investor takes all liabilities of the enterprise and cannot get a guarantee of any liability cap that a resolution plan in IBC offers,"" said Abhizer Diwanji, partner and national leader- financial services, EY India.
UltraTech’s offer to Binani Industries came up after the cement maker challenged the sale of Binani Cement to Dalmia Bharat, alleging lack of transparency in the bidding process. 
It had complained to NCLT and had also written to Binani Cement’s resolution professional offering to increase its bid to about Rs6,900 crore from about Rs6,200 crore earlier.

74,2018-03-23,UltraTech,"The Braj Binani group has argued that UltraTech Cement has offered a better deal than Dalmia Bharat for Binani Cement, and that in the interest of a more optimal solution, the resolution provess should be suspended

Kolkata: The Braj Binani group on Thursday asked the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to suspend the ongoing resolution process of group firm Binani Cement Ltd, even as one of the stakeholders said that the sanctity of the bankruptcy resolution process is now at stake. 
Kolkata: The Braj Binani group on Thursday asked the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to suspend the ongoing resolution process of group firm Binani Cement Ltd, even as one of the stakeholders said that the sanctity of the bankruptcy resolution process is now at stake.
After lenders chose Dalmia Bharat Ltd to take over Binani Cement, its parent Binani Industries Ltd entered into an agreement with UltraTech Cement Ltd to sell a 98.43% stake in the cement firm on termination of the resolution process. As per this deal, UltraTech would pay Rs7,266 crore, compared with Dalmia Bharat’s Rs6,350 crore offer made under the insolvency resolution process.
The insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) has no provision to suspend the resolution process after it has started, but the Supreme Court set a precedent last year by allowing a Mumbai-based realtor and its creditor to settle their dispute on mutual consent outside the framework of IBC even after the resolution process had started.
“If the process (of insolvency resolution) is seen as unclear or arbitrary...bona fide applicants will decline to spend time and money to submit bids,"" Dalmia Bharat said in its petition with NCLT.
The Braj Binani group argued UltraTech offered a better deal for all stakeholders, and that in the interest of a more optimal resolution, the dispute resolution process under IBC should be suspended.
The bench did not pass any interim order. At least 14 applications filed by different stakeholders were heard on Thursday. Hearing is to continue on Tuesday.
The Kolkata bench had earlier rejected a similar application by the founders of Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd and ordered the firm to be liquidated. According to multiple lawyers associated with the case, the lenders’ stand will determine the course of this dispute.
“IBC is, at the end of the day, a law created to maximize returns for creditors from stressed assets through a time-bound process that cannot drag out beyond 270 days,"" said one of these lawyers, who asked not to be named. “At the same time, the proposal to suspend the resolution process should be weighed against its potential broader implications for dispute resolution under IBC, and in the light of the fact that the window of 270 days cannot be extended.""
The dispute started after Binani Cement’s creditors on 27 February declared Dalmia Bharat as the top bidder. With the approval of creditors, that resolution plan was filed with NCLT amid opposition from other interested parties such as UltraTech and the Braj Binani group.
After being outbid, UltraTech, one of the five unsuccessful bidders, alleged the process for determination of the top bidder was not transparent and that the resolution professional had not followed established best practices in managing the process. UltraTech claimed to have filed revised bids, topping Dalmia Bharat’s bid, on 8 March.
UltraTech’s counsel Sudipto Sarkar argued at the tribunal that the committee of creditors did not consider the AV Birla group company’s “substantially"" higher bid for Binani Cement’s assets, and instead gave its approval to Dalmia Bharat’s bid on 14 March. The Braj Binani group claimed that if the resolution process is terminated, creditors will be paid their dues within a definite time frame.
UltraTech also claimed the resolution process through bidding was invalid because the resolution professional had at the behest of the creditors engaged an external consultant in November last year to conduct a forensic audit of Binani Cement’s accounts, and this was not disclosed at the time of receiving bids.
The forensic audit conducted by Haribhakti and Co. Llp eventually indicated possible diversion of funds through related party transactions, the maximum impact of which was assessed at around Rs2,400 crore. This, UltraTech claimed, was suppression of material facts. But Dalmia Bharat told the tribunal that nothing of consequence was concealed from bidders."

Mumbai: India’s largest cement maker, UltraTech Cement Ltd, aims to aggressively cut its debt over the next two years to help prepare for more acquisitions.
UltraTech, controlled by billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla, plans to prepay some loans through its internal cash accruals, according to chief financial officer Atul Daga. It targets to cut the ratio of its net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to 1 time by 2020, from 2.3 times currently, Daga said in an interview Thursday in Mumbai.
The company is pushing ahead with further dealmaking, even as it challenges the outcome of Binani Cement Ltd’s sale after being bested by a rival bidder. UltraTech boosted its offer for insolvent Binani Cement to about Rs69 billion ($1.1 billion) after the bidding closed and later approached the National Company Law Tribunal with complaints on the transparency of the auction process.
“It is our pride,"" Daga said when asked why UltraTech was contesting the outcome. “Somebody is playing mischief. We will not tolerate that.""
UltraTech is looking to purchase additional capacity in India, where it sees the most demand, according to Daga. It will look at more stressed cement assets being auctioned under India’s new bankruptcy law, as well as other companies that come up for sale, he said. UltraTech needs to maintain its market share in the growing Indian cement sector, Daga said.
‘Big shocker’
Binani Cement creditors earlier this month picked an offer from a consortium led by Dalmia Bharat Ltd, a domestic rival of UltraTech. The Dalmia Bharat bid, which had backing from Bain Capital Credit, was chosen as the best proposal and submitted to the NCLT for approval. UltraTech has since made its latest offer, valued at Rs72.7 billion including working capital commitments, directly to Binani Cement’s parent, conditional on the building material producer being taken out of insolvency proceedings.
Daga said UltraTech had expected to be called for further negotiations after submitting its initial offer. It had kept some money on the table to allow for further increases of its bid, but the resolution professional overseeing the sale made a decision based on the level of the bids that were submitted, he said.
“One fine day, we got an email that you are not the highest bidder,"" Daga said. “That was a big shocker for us.""
UltraTech’s proposal may have won if the resolution professional overseeing the sale had not deemed the company less likely to get Indian antitrust approval for a deal, according to Daga. The region where Binani operates has 18 active cement producers and intense price competition, leaving little room for UltraTech to exercise any dominance of the market, he said.
“The whole bidding process was not transparent,"" Daga said.
New statute
UltraTech’s net debt to Ebitda ratio could rise to 2.6 times if it ends up winning control of Binani Cement, though that won’t change the company’s debt reduction goal, according to Daga. Representatives for Binani Cement’s resolution professional, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India, and Dalmia Bharat didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.
Any acquirer of Binani Cement would boost its position in northern India as well as gain access to the company’s reserves of limestone, a key raw ingredient. UltraTech has a production capacity of 92.5 million metric tons, which will increase to 99.5 million metric tons after planned greenfield expansions, according to Daga. It has a 22% market share in the country currently.
The NCLT will next meet March 27 to consider the Binani Cement case and the grievances raised by UltraTech. India’s insolvency law is a new statute, with many eventualities left to be tested, said Mathew Antony, a managing partner at Aditya Consulting.
“The legal minds in UltraTech are exploring the possibilities of setting a precedent through this aggressive bidding,"" Antony said. Bloomberg"

72,2018-03-28,UltraTech,"The counsel for Binani Cement lenders described UltraTech Cement's offer as 'excellent' and asked NCLT for time till 2 April to consider the offer as the matter had to be discussed among 25 lenders

Kolkata: Lenders to Binani Cement Ltd have asked for time till 2 April to consider UltraTech Cement Ltd’s bid for the company outside the bankruptcy process.  
Kolkata: Lenders to Binani Cement Ltd have asked for time till 2 April to consider UltraTech Cement Ltd’s bid for the company outside the bankruptcy process. 
On Tuesday, the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) asked the lenders if they were willing to consider UltraTech’s proposal to buy a 98.43% stake in Binani Cement from its parent Binani Industries Ltd. Binani Cement is currently undergoing resolution under the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC).
The counsel for the lenders described the UltraTech deal as “excellent"" and asked the NCLT for time till 2 April to decide whether to consider it. The tribunal will now hear the matter on 2 April.
Though he described the proposal as “excellent"" and acknowledged that the deal could result in all creditors being repaid, the counsel for the lenders, Pratap Chatterjee, asked the Kolkata bench of the NCLT if there was any provision under IBC for an out-of-court settlement. Only the Supreme Court has the authority to terminate resolution proceedings, he said.
 Chatterjee sought time saying the matter had to be discussed among 25 lenders.
The Braj Binani group had earlier prayed for suspension of the proceedings so that it could sell its stake in Binani Cement for Rs7,266 crore and repay creditors.
It has committed to pay off Binani Cement’s dues within two weeks if allowed to sell stake to UltraTech.
Dalmia Bharat Ltd, which had earlier been declared as the highest bidder for the assets of Binani Cement, has argued that allowing an out-of-court settlement at this stage will undermine the sanctity of the insolvency resolution process under IBC. 
“If the process (of insolvency resolution) is seen as unclear or arbitrary...bona fide applicants will decline to spend time and money to submit bids,"" Dalmia Bharat has said in a petition.
After Dalmia Bharat offered Rs6,350 crore and was on 27 February declared the top bidder, UltraTech, one of the unsuccessful bidders, raised its offer substantially. Eventually, on 19 March it concluded a deal with Binani Industries for sale of 98.43% stake in the cement maker for Rs7,266 crore.
Even without rejecting UltraTech’s revised bid, Binani Cement’s committee of creditors approved a resolution plan with Dalmia Bharat as the highest bidder. Amid opposition from the Braj Binani group and UltraTech, the plan was earlier this month filed with the tribunal for its approval.
Though there is no provision under IBC to terminate the resolution process, the Supreme Court created a precedent last year. It allowed a Mumbai-based realtor and its lender to settle their dispute on mutual consent outside the framework of IBC."
70,2018-03-29,UltraTech,"After UltraTech obtained CCI approval for Binani Cement's acquisition, Dalmia Bharat said the likelihood of obtaining the regulator's approval was not a criterion in bid evaluation

Kolkata: UltraTech Cement Ltd on Wednesday said it had received clearance from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for its proposed acquisition of the assets of Binani Cement Ltd, while claiming that its bid was declared the second-highest because the resolution professional was apprehensive about the AV Birla Group firm’s ability to secure the clearance. 
Kolkata: UltraTech Cement Ltd on Wednesday said it had received clearance from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) for its proposed acquisition of the assets of Binani Cement Ltd, while claiming that its bid was declared the second-highest because the resolution professional was apprehensive about the AV Birla Group firm’s ability to secure the clearance.
“A lot of apprehensions were raised by the resolution professional about UltraTech obtaining CCI clearance,"" the company said in its statement. “UltraTech was rated the H2 (second highest) bidder instead of H1 for this reason. The CCI clearance validates UltraTech’s contention that it was wrongly and unjustifiably rated H2 instead of H1.""
Dalmia Bharat Ltd, which was on 27 February declared the highest bidder by the committee of creditors of Binani Cement, also issued a statement saying that the evaluation criteria for bids were “fair and made known to all bidders"" in advance. “We state emphatically that the likelihood of obtaining the CCI approval was not at all a criterion in bid evaluation,"" a statement by Dalmia Bharat quoted its group chief executive officer Mahendra Singhi as saying.
Resolution professional Vijaykumar V. Iyer was not immediately available for comment. He did not reply to text messages till the time of publishing this story.
The administrator has already filed a resolution plan for the approval of the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) with Dalmia Bharat as the top bidder, amid opposition from UltraTech and Binani Industries Ltd, the holding company of the cement maker. The two companies announced on 19 March that an agreement had been concluded under which Binani Industries would sell its 98.43% stake in Binani Cement to UltraTech for Rs7,266 crore.
Dalmia Bharat, which offered Rs6,350 crore for Binani Cement’s assets, has claimed in its petition that UltraTech raised its offer after being outbid. 
Its revised bid was circulated among lenders and the resolution professional by email, Dalmia Bharat has said.
Praying for termination of the resolution process without which the deal cannot be consummated, the two companies have said at the NCLT that UltraTech’s offer was better than Dalmia Bharat’s and that Binani Industries would settle the dues of all creditors within two weeks.
Dalmia Bharat has said in its petition that suspending the resolution process at this stage has larger implications, and that it would undermine the sanctity of the insolvency resolution process under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
On Tuesday, the Kolkata bench of the tribunal asked the counsel for the committee of creditors if the lenders are willing to consider UltraTech’s bid for Binani Cement. There are around 25 lenders, and they are to decide on the matter by 2 April, when the dispute is to be heard by the NCLT."
68,2018-04-02,UltraTech,"That UltraTech Cement struck a deal with Binani Cement outside the IBC framework, especially when lenders had already chosen Dalmia Bharat as the top bidder, tests the sanctity of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code

Fourteen petitions. That’s the number of pleas filed against the insolvency proceedings of Binani Cement Ltd, which is fast turning out to be a test for the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) due to multiple issues ranging from allegations of fraud to lack of transparency in the bidding process. Hearings are currently underway at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). 
Fourteen petitions. That’s the number of pleas filed against the insolvency proceedings of Binani Cement Ltd, which is fast turning out to be a test for the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) due to multiple issues ranging from allegations of fraud to lack of transparency in the bidding process. Hearings are currently underway at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT).
1. What’s the background?
Binani Cement was a regular bankruptcy case under IBC. Bids were called for, and the committee of creditors chose a Dalmia Bharat Ltd-consortium as the winner. The resolution professional had also filed the Dalmia Bharat resolution plan with the tribunal. However, UltraTech Cement Ltd, which had also put in a bid for Binani Cement, alleged that the process for choosing the top bidder was not transparent and that the resolution professional had not followed established best practices.
2. What did UltraTech do then?
It complained to NCLT and also wrote to Binani Cement’s resolution professional, offering to increase its bid to about Rs6,900 crore from about Rs6,200 crore earlier. But when that was not accepted, the firm struck a deal with Binani Industries Ltd, the parent of Binani Cement, to buy its 98.43% stake in the cement unit, provided the insolvency case was terminated. On its part, Binani Industries approached NCLT asking that the case be terminated. At a hearing last week, Binani Industries told the tribunal that it will repay creditors within two weeks.
3. Why is this important?
UltraTech has struck this deal outside the bankruptcy framework. Striking a deal outside the framework, especially when the process is nearing completion, tests the sanctity of the code. If UltraTech wins, every unsuccessful bidder could approach the promoter and strike a deal to fund the repayment of the liabilities with the banks.
4. What does the law say?
The code itself does not have a procedure laid down for terminating the insolvency process. However, in another case last July, the Supreme Court ruled that a settlement can be considered and a case can be withdrawn after insolvency proceedings have started against a company. In that particular case, the company and its creditors had settled their dispute.
5. What next?
The committee of creditors has indicated its willingness to consider the UltraTech-Binani Industries deal since it would entail a lower sacrifice on the lenders’ part. Its counsel had sought time till Monday to consider UltraTech’s offer. If the lenders do choose to accept the offer, the Kolkata NCLT will have to rule. An adverse ruling for Dalmia may prompt the consortium to approach higher courts. If the case ends up at the Supreme Court, its ruling could set a precedent for other cases. Expect the drama to continue."

Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday gave Binani Cement Ltd’s lenders one more week to decide on the revised acquisition offer made by UltraTech Cement Ltd. 
Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Monday gave Binani Cement Ltd’s lenders one more week to decide on the revised acquisition offer made by UltraTech Cement Ltd.
Counsel for the committee of creditors told the NCLT that Binani Cement lenders could not consider UltraTech’s proposal because the interim order from last week asking them to do so wasn’t available on the NCLT’s website.
In its interim order passed on 27 March, the NCLT had said “in the larger interest of all stakeholders the possibility of having a harmonious settlement is to be considered"", adding that the “parties are free to consider it out of tribunal"".
“The decision by the NCLT today reaffirms the chances for an out-of-court settlement,"" said Sameer Kaji, senior adviser to Binani Cement. People close to Binani Industries Ltd said a detailed proposal will be submitted in a day or two to the CoC.
When asked whether this proposal will override Dalmia Bharat’s, Dalmia officials said the status does not change as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code does not allow out-of-court settlements.
Dalmia Bharat Cement CEO Mahendra Singhi is of the view that once a resolution plan is submitted to the NCLT, there is a binding contract with CoC and the party. Binani Cement had proposed to pay back all the secured and unsecured financial creditors and trade operational creditors, besides clearing all statutory dues on the condition that IBC proceedings against it have to be terminated.
UltraTech Cement has agreed to pay Binani Industries Rs7,266 crore to take 98.47% stake in Binani Cement directly from the promoters. This after Dalmia Bharat was declared the highest bidder for Binani Cement by the CoC in March beating UltraTech, which had bid marginally lower. Dalmia had agreed to invest about Rs6,700 crore in Binani Cement over a period of time. UltraTech swiftly challenged the decision of the CoC at the Kolkata NCLT, stating lack of transparency in decision-making. UltraTech also received a nod from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to pursue the deal on 28 March.
NCLT’s Kolkata bench will hear the matter on 9 April.

Mumbai: Dalmia Bharat Cement Ltd will approach a higher court if the Kolkata bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) decides against it in the battle for Binani Cement acquisition, a top company official said. 
While Dalmia continues to repose faith in the ongoing legal process, it will challenge any move to wrest control of Binani Cement Ltd by rival UltraTech Cement Ltd, the Dalmia Bharat official said on condition of anonymity.
Dalmia Bharat was declared the highest bidder for Binani Cement by the committee of creditors (CoC) in March beating UltraTech, which bid marginally lower.
Dalmia had agreed to invest about Rs6,700 crore in Binani Cement over a period of time. UltraTech swiftly challenged the decision of the CoC at the Kolkata NCLT, stating lack of transparency in decision-making. UltraTech also received a nod from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to pursue the deal on 28 March.  
Meanwhile, Binani Industries Ltd, Binani Cement’s parent company, signed a bilateral agreement with UltraTech to sell the company and has approached the NCLT seeking termination of insolvency proceedings against Binani Cement and has offered to settle all its outstanding loans including those of operational creditors and statutory dues.
The Binani Industries settlement offer is understood to be based a letter of comfort by UltraTech which has committed Rs7,266 crore payment for Binani Cement subject to termination of insolvency proceedings. 
Responding to a query from Mint on whether Dalmia Cement plans further legal action, Mahendra Singhi, the cement maker’s chief executive officer, said, “One has to follow proper legal processes but we hope that there won’t be any need for it. But if someone wants to further litigate and delay the whole process, it is up to them.""
The case which will be heard by NCLT on Monday is likely to set a precedent for several other bankruptcy cases where promoters are seeking out-of-court settlements. Singhi, however, said that Dalmia Bharat is not keen on an out-of-court settlement. 
“With us, no settlement can take place out of court. As a responsible corporate citizen, we are bound by a legal contract so under no case we can settle outside the court,"" he said. 
Dalmia Cement is also understood to have sent a reminder to the creditors last week about the binding contract it has signed with lenders that lays down legally enforceable conditions and the indemnities thereof. 
Last week, the Kolkata bench of the NCLT told CoC that in the larger interest of the creditors, it could consider the application by Binani Industries looking for an independent solution outside the insolvency process—its request to UltraTech Cement to take over its subsidiary Binani Cement, the Financial Express reported on 30 March."

Mumbai: Binani Cement Ltd. lenders will entertain a local tycoon’s last-minute $1.1 billion bid for the insolvent Indian company, people with knowledge of the matter said.
The committee of creditors decided at a meeting on Wednesday it would be willing to support the proposal, which would see Binani Cement sold to billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla’s UltraTech Cement Ltd., according to the people. The banks plan to tell Binani Cement’s parent company that they could give their backing if it first obtains relevant approvals, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private.
Lenders will require Binani Industries Ltd. to pay them an initial Rs750 crore ($115 million) and provide a bank guarantee covering the remaining bid amount, one of the people said. The plan would need approval from India’s National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), according to another person.
The move would overturn a decision the lenders made last month to support an offer from a rival consortium that includes Dalmia Bharat Ltd., a domestic competitor of UltraTech, and a Bain Capital-backed fund. After creditors picked their preferred bidder, UltraTech made a higher offer directly to Binani Industries.
Binani Industries’s shares rose as much as 5.6% in Mumbai on Thursday, set for the biggest gain since 28 December, and UltraTech advanced about 2%.
UltraTech’s latest bid for Binani Cement was conditional on insolvency proceedings being terminated. The National Company Law Tribunal has adjourned a case filed by UltraTech to 9 April and asked Binani Cement lenders to form an opinion on the offer by then.
The situation is fluid, and there’s no certainty the deal will be completed as currently envisioned, the people said.

64,2018-04-10,UltraTech,"Binani Industries has agreed to sell Binani Cement to UltraTech Cement for Rs7,266 crore, a deal opposed by suitor Dalmia Bharat as it was struck outside the scope of the insolvency and bankruptcy code

New Delhi: Binani Industries Ltd moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking permission for an out-of-court settlement and end insolvency proceedings against its debt ridden subsidiary, Binani Cement Ltd. 
New Delhi: Binani Industries Ltd moved the Supreme Court on Monday seeking permission for an out-of-court settlement and end insolvency proceedings against its debt ridden subsidiary, Binani Cement Ltd.
The company’s lenders have asked for necessary permissions to be obtained before they proceed with the settlement.
The matter was mentioned before a bench headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra, who said that it will be taken up for hearing on 13 April.
While seeking an end the resolution process, Binani Industries said that it had struck a deal with UltraTech Cement Ltd for Rs7,266 crore. UltraTech was one of the initial bidders in the resolution process.
The total liability of Binani Cement Ltd stands at Rs7,290 crore including the liability of Rs4,049 crore towards secured lenders, it was stated.
It was claimed that the original promoters of UltraTech had mobilized sufficient funds to clear off all the outstanding claims against lenders/financial creditors resulting which Binani Cement would be restored to its full financial health.
Last week, the committee of creditors (CoC) of Binani Cement had decided to stick with the offer of Rs6,350 crore to buy Dalmia Bharat Cement for the debt-ridden firm’s sale under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016.
Moreover, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) had also asked the adjudicating authority, which is the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), to proceed with the resolution process of Binani Cement as per the IBC.
Hearing at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has been adjourned till 16 April in view of the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the dispute later this week.
On 5 April, while posting the matter for further hearing on 19 April, the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal had stated that “pendency of the appeal will not come in the way of the adjudicating authority to proceed with the corporate insolvency resolution process in accordance with the provisions of I&B Code, 2016.""
The Dalmia Bharat-Bain Piramal consortium has warned that lenders will be in breach of contract if they accept Binani Industries’ offer, since 99.5% of them had initially agreed to Dalmia’s bid and had entered a binding contract with them. Mahendra Singhi, Group CEO, Dalmia Cement Bharat Ltd, said, “We haven’t heard anything from the lenders that they are keen on UltraTech’s revised offer. The promoters of Binani Cement seem to have come to an agreement with UltraTech outside the IBC process. They are acting as a defeated bidder’s proxy, which itself should disqualify them.
“We will fight to uphold the IBC law. You can’t work outside the law just for a few hundred crores,"" Singhi added. 
Two weeks ago, Binani Industries’ troubled cement assets were almost a done deal for the Dalmia-led consortium but is now in danger of slipping through its fingers. UltraTech’s second and more aggressive bid of Rs7,618 crore for these assets and a promise to pay back all dues in full has won the tacit support of both banks and trade creditors.
Countering Singhi’s argument, Sameer Kaji, Senior Group Advisor, Binani Industries Ltd told Mint that a borrower or mortgager can redeem a pledge or pay back a loan anytime he wished to. “We are offering to pay back all lenders and operational creditors in full. I’m not settling or negotiating with lenders by offering a lower haircut on their loans. This sets our case apart from all other companies in bankruptcy proceedings.""

Mumbai: Dalmia Bharat Ltd, whose successful bid for debt-ridden Binani Cement Ltd in a bankruptcy auction is under threat from a higher bid from rival UltraTech Cement Ltd outside the bankruptcy process, on Tuesday wrote to the central bank and nine lenders of Binani Cement that entertaining bids outside the established bankruptcy code will flout banking conventions. 
Mumbai: Dalmia Bharat Ltd, whose successful bid for debt-ridden Binani Cement Ltd in a bankruptcy auction is under threat from a higher bid from rival UltraTech Cement Ltd outside the bankruptcy process, on Tuesday wrote to the central bank and nine lenders of Binani Cement that entertaining bids outside the established bankruptcy code will flout banking conventions.
The consortium led by Dalmia Bharat is now facing a challenge in the Supreme Court by Binani Industries Ltd, the parent of Binani Cement Ltd, to exit the insolvency proceedings and buy out lenders and creditors in full with financial help from UltraTech Cement.
In a letter addressed to the Reserve Bank of India governor, Rajputana Properties Pvt. Ltd (the Dalmia-Bain-Piramal consortium) alleged that a proposal made outside the bankruptcy process once the details of the winning bid were made public is “fraudulent"". Mint has seen a copy of the letter. 
“Besides the fact that the Binani Industries Ltd (BIL) is barred as a promoter under Section 29A of the Code to participate in the corporate insolvency resolution process, BIL and other affiliates of Braj Binani have been suspected of undertaking various transactions which are undervalued, fraudulent and extortionary, totaling to approximately Rs2,400 crore, as suggested by a detailed forensic report prepared by Haribhakti and Co., hired by the resolution professional under instructions of the committee of creditors,"" the letter said.
Binani Industries itself is insolvent, the letter said, and has not paid its own creditors for debts adding to over Rs1,700 crore for several years and has a winding-up petition admitted against it at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). “Banking conventions in India,"" it concluded, “do not favour any dealings with an indicted promoter.""
On 5 April, Dalmia Bharat wrote to the Central Vigilance Commission asking it to intervene in the case. The letter said Binani Cement’s promoters were effectively acting as a proxy for UltraTech Cement by exiting the insolvency process, flouting the vigilance commission’s guidelines.
Refuting the allegations, Sameer Kaji, senior group advisor, Binani Industries told Mint: “On March 12, the forensic auditor formally submitted its report to the Committee of Creditors (CoC). If this report had been material, the resolution professional would have shared this with all bidders, which he did not do. Bids were called independent of the audit process.""
Separately, the Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear the Binani Operational Creditors Forum (BOCF), which has alleged discrimination against different classes of operational creditors of Binani Cement Ltd under the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016."

61,2018-04-18,UltraTech,"Dalmia Bharat has been declared the top bidder for Binani Cement and a debt resolution plan with its Rs6,700 crore bid has been filed with NCLT Kolkata

Mumbai: Lenders of Binani Cement Ltd on Tuesday told the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that they declined to consider the revised bid of Ultratech Cement Ltd because they were of the view that the sanctity of the IBC process and “certainty of contracts"" were more important than higher realization through an unsolicited bid. 
Mumbai: Lenders of Binani Cement Ltd on Tuesday told the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that they declined to consider the revised bid of Ultratech Cement Ltd because they were of the view that the sanctity of the IBC process and “certainty of contracts"" were more important than higher realization through an unsolicited bid.
If lenders started to consider revised bids of unsuccessful bidders, the process of time-bound insolvency resolution through “secret bids"" would be undermined, Pratap Chatterjee, counsel for the company’s committee of creditors, submitted at the tribunal. Creditors followed established guidelines of the Central Vigilance Commission while rejecting UltraTech’s revised bid, he added.
When asked by the bench if by a majority decision, lenders could ignore a higher bid, Chatterjee said they took a stand that the rules of the game couldn’t be changed after the game had started. They decided to stick to the so-called process document, which was agreed upon by the committee of creditors at the beginning of the resolution process.
At least 90% of the creditors had agreed when finalizing the process document that the committee will negotiate only with the highest bidder, Abhrajit Mitra, counsel for the resolution professional said.
Dalmia Bharat Ltd was declared the top bidder for Binani Cement’s 11 million tonne production capacity, and a resolution plan with its Rs6,700 crore bid has been filed with the Kolkata bench of the NCLT for its approval. After being outbid, UltraTech made a higher bid and circulated it among lenders and the resolution professional by email.
UltraTech also struck a deal with Binani Industries Ltd, the parent of the delinquent cement maker, to acquire its 98.43% stake in the company at Rs7,266 crore. However, the plan did not materialize as it required the insolvency resolution process to be halted, and the Supreme Court declined to do so.
According to some reports, UltraTech has since raised its offer again to around Rs8,000 crore. Its bid is backed by the operational creditors of Binani Cement, who claim their interest will not be protected if Dalmia Bharat wins the firm.
They have submitted that the firm owes some 3,000 vendors over Rs700 crore, which Dalmia Bharat is looking to settle for only Rs151 crore. UltraTech declined to comment on lenders’ view on its unsolicited bid.
Exim Bank, an unsecured creditor, on Tuesday said it would be forced to take a haircut of Rs170 crore if Dalmia Bharat’s resolution plan is accepted.
But Mitra, counsel for the resolution professional and Chatterjee, lawyer for the lenders, submitted Exim Bank had earlier voted in favour of Dalmia Bharat’s resolution plan.
Exim Bank had asked for further negotiation with the highest bidder so that its offer could be raised, they said, adding that Dalmia Bharat had eventually agreed to sweeten its offer for Exim Bank. Whereas the lender was to receive only 52% of its dues under Dalmia Bharat’s initial offer, it was raised to 72% after discussions with the bidder, they added.
Hearing will continue on Wednesday.

60,2018-04-20,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement is willing to pay Rs7,960 crore for Binani Cement if NCLT orders liquidation and will raise its offer by Rs500 crore if any firm matches its bid

Kolkata: UltraTech Cement Ltd’s legal counsel on Thursday raised the company’s bid for Binani Cement Ltd by Rs500 crore, while reaffirming the AV Birla Group company’s Rs7,960 crore bid in the event of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordering liquidation of the beleaguered cement maker. 
Kolkata: UltraTech Cement Ltd’s legal counsel on Thursday raised the company’s bid for Binani Cement Ltd by Rs500 crore, while reaffirming the AV Birla Group company’s Rs7,960 crore bid in the event of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) ordering liquidation of the beleaguered cement maker.
Though the liquidation value of the firm is as little as Rs2,300 crore, counsel Mukul Rohatgi said UltraTech was willing to pay Rs7,960 crore for Binani Cement if the tribunal ordered liquidation of the firm. And during liquidation, if any bidder matched its offer, UltraTech would raise its bid by another Rs500 crore, Rohatgi submitted before the Kolkata bench of the NCLT.
When asked if UltraTech would stand by the statement made by its legal counsel at the tribunal, a spokesperson for the company declined to comment.
Even in the wake of UltraTech’s aggressive bidding for Binani Cement, Dalmia Bharat Ltd, the company chosen by the lenders as the top bidder, said there was no question of upping its bid. Dalmia Bharat’s resolution plan has already been accepted and submitted to the tribunal for its approval, said Mahendra Singhi, group chief executive officer of Dalmia Bharat. “We have strong case,"" he added.
Rohatgi claimed at the tribunal that Dalmia Bharat had initially offered Rs6,589 crore for the assets of Binani Cement, which include limestone deposits that would last several decades. UltraTech’s original bid was only Rs50-100 crore lower than Dalmia Bharat’s, according to an AV Birla Group official who declined to be named.
Though the committee of creditors engaged in discussions with Dalmia Bharat exclusively and got its bid raised to Rs6,932 crore, it did not give a similar opportunity to UltraTech, Rohatgi submitted at the tribunal, adding that the resolution professional, or the administrator for Binani Cement, had extended the deadline for filing nominations at least five times.
Rohatgi prayed for cancellation of the lenders’ approval of Dalmia Bharat’s bid. He said the committee of creditors should consider UltraTech’s bid as well, and take a decision accordingly.
With its latest bid of Rs7,960 crore, UltraTech has said it would pay all creditors in full including vendors, except those found to be related to the promoters of Binani Cement. The AV Birla Group company has said it will fully pay off statutory dues of Rs177.5 crore, unlike Dalmia Bharat, which has proposed to pay Rs33 crore only.
Claiming that some lenders could be short-changed if Dalmia Bharat’s bid is approved, UltraTech has said it would pay all banks in full, and even pay Rs381.96 in accrued interest. Dalmia Bharat had proposed to offer 20% equity stake post-resolution to IDBI Bank.
Dalmia Bharat has offered to settle the dues of operational creditors assessed by the administrator at Rs503 crore for Rs151 crore. But UltraTech has offered to pay Rs443 crore—only Rs60 crore of dues to related parties are to be forfeited, shows the bid reviewed by Mint. Both bidders have pledged to infuse Rs350 crore as working capital for Binani Cement and pay workers in full.
Operational creditors have claimed that Binani Cement owes them over Rs700 crore, but the administrator has admitted claims up to Rs503 crore only, of which Rs60 crore has been identified as dues to related parties."
59,2018-04-24,UltraTech,"NCLT finishes hearing the dispute over insolvency resolution at Binani Cement, with Dalmia Bharat, the highest bidder selected by the lenders, insisting that there was no question of allowing Ultratech Cement's revised bid

Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday finished hearing the dispute over insolvency resolution at Binani Cement Ltd, with Dalmia Bharat Ltd, the highest bidder selected by the lenders to take over the assets, insisting that there was no question of allowing the revised bid of Ultratech Cement Ltd. 
Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Tuesday finished hearing the dispute over insolvency resolution at Binani Cement Ltd, with Dalmia Bharat Ltd, the highest bidder selected by the lenders to take over the assets, insisting that there was no question of allowing the revised bid of Ultratech Cement Ltd.
In his submission, the legal counsel for Dalmia Bharat made a sharp distinction between Ultratech and Liberty House Group, whose bid for Bhushan Steel and Power Ltd was summarily dismissed by the resolution professional. The Delhi bench of the tribunal ordered the committee of creditors of Bhushan Steel to reconsider Liberty House’s bid. Ultratech has cited the Delhi bench’s decision to argue that its revised bid, which is substantially higher, should be considered.
Dalmia Bharat has offered to pay Rs6,932.46 crore for Binani Cement whereas Ultratech has raised its bid to Rs7,960 crore, and claimed that in the interest of all stakeholders, its bid should be considered by the lenders. 
“Accepting Ultratech’s bid will lead to better realisation for most stakeholders, but the fact that it was an unsuccessful bidder at the end of bidding process weakens its case,"" said a senior lawyer, who has appeared in this matter.
Throttling up the battle for Binani Cement, Ultratech’s counsel Mukul Rohatgi had submitted at the tribunal last week that the AV Birla group company was willing to raise its offer by another Rs500 crore, if any other bidder was willing to match its offer. To strengthen its bid, Ultratech has also obtained advance clearance from the Competition Commission of India.
The bench will now have to choose between a “substantially higher bid"" and the sanctity of the resolution process, said the unnamed lawyer cited above, asking not to be named. The tribunal has reserved its judgement for now. “Whichever way the verdict goes, the matter will go to the appellate tribunal and perhaps to the Supreme Court as well,"" the lawyer added.
Both the committee of creditors and the resolution professional have maintained that it was decided at the beginning of the bidding process that they would negotiate only with the highest bidder, and hence Ultratech’s revised bid wasn’t considered. 
Pratap Chatterjee, counsel for the committee of creditors, said the rules of the game couldn’t be changed after the game had started.
Apart from Ultratech, operational creditors of Binani Cement have also opposed Dalmia Bharat’s bid, saying that their dues of over Rs700 crore were to be settled for as little as Rs151 crore. The resolution professional has, however, accepted only Rs503 crore as legitimate dues to Binani Cement’s vendors. 
Counsel for Dalmia Bharat, S.K. Kapoor submitted that claims of six operational creditors exceeding Rs10 crore each have been found to dubious through a forensic audit.
Though Ultratech has offered to pay Rs443 crore to operational creditors, it has declined to pay the dues of those vendors who are found to be related to the management of Binani Cement.
Kapoor said Dalmia Bharat has agreed to pay the dues of some 2,941 operational creditors in full. Their claims are up to Rs1 crore each."

56,2018-04-25,UltraTech,"UltraTech Cement's standalone net profit stood at Rs488 crore for the March quarter, not up to Street expectations

Pan India cement manufacturer UltraTech Cement Ltd saw its domestic cement sales volumes grow 32% year-on-year (y-o-y)to 17.64 million tonnes (mt) in the March quarter. But we needn’t read too much into that, because volumes have been boosted by acquisitions. ACC Ltd too saw healthy volume growth in its key markets in the same quarter. 
Pan India cement manufacturer UltraTech Cement Ltd saw its domestic cement sales volumes grow 32% year-on-year (y-o-y)to 17.64 million tonnes (mt) in the March quarter. But we needn’t read too much into that, because volumes have been boosted by acquisitions. ACC Ltd too saw healthy volume growth in its key markets in the same quarter.
In any case, everybody expected cement makers to report decent volume growth, but what’s encouraging is the improvement in realizations. UltraTech said it has seen its realizations improve 5% during the quarter. 
There is, of course, a fly in the ointment. Operating costs are surging at a rapid pace, due to the rise in petroleum coke (petcoke) and coal prices and the ban on petcoke usage in thermal power plants. Petcoke prices increased as much as 20% during the quarter to $104/tonne, the company said. 
Consequently, on a per tonne basis, its energy cost jumped 17% y-o-y to Rs987. That is no mean jump. Logistic costs too continued to head northwards.
Of course, the company is not sitting on its hands and no doubt it’s doing all it can to improve efficiency, thereby mitigating the impact of elevated costs. Towards that end, they’ve gone in for increased usage of low-cost fuel and alternate additives. But despite their best efforts, the improvement in realizations is unlikely to offset the cost pressures.
What of the stock? Year to date, the company’s shares have under-performed the broader market. The stock did see a sharp uptick last week after the company announced the commissioning of a greenfield clinker unit with a capacity of 2.5 million tonne per annum capacity (mtpa) at Manawar, in the Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh. This new plant will provide a strategic advantage to the company for serving the growing cement demand from Madhya Pradesh’s main industrial belt—the Dewas-Ratlam-Pithampur-lndore sector, the company said in a press release.
But that hasn’t been enough to support the stock, with the rally fizzling out. On Wednesday, the stock was under pressure ahead of the earnings announcement and while it did swing to the green after the results came out, it ended the day in the red.
The company’s financials for the March quarter are not comparable with the year ago period, simply because the results include the output from cement plants acquired from Jaiprakash Associates and Jaypee Cement in the last one year.
The company’s standalone net profit stood at Rs488 crore for the March quarter, not up to Street expectations. Profit was hit by a one-time provision for stamp duty of Rs266 crore and Rs41 crore for deferred tax due to changes in tax rates. On a consolidated basis, the company’s profit came in at Rs724 crore.
It goes without saying that we need to closely watch the trend in realizations and operating costs. More interestingly, the stock will be in the news for the twists and turns in UltraTech’s ongoing tussle with Dalmia Bharat Ltd for the acquisition of Binani Cement."

Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of the bankruptcy court on Wednesday ruled that the lenders of debt-ridden Binani Cement Ltd should consider the revised offer of UltraTech Cement Ltd even as it allowed Dalmia Bharat Ltd, chosen by lenders to take over the indebted cement-maker, to submit new bids, effectively restarting a contest between the two suitors. 
Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of the bankruptcy court on Wednesday ruled that the lenders of debt-ridden Binani Cement Ltd should consider the revised offer of UltraTech Cement Ltd even as it allowed Dalmia Bharat Ltd, chosen by lenders to take over the indebted cement-maker, to submit new bids, effectively restarting a contest between the two suitors.
After being outbid by Dalmia Bharat, UltraTech made a binding offer to pay Rs7,960 crore for the assets of Binani Cement, compared with Dalmia Bharat’s offer of Rs6,932.46 crore. However, Binani Cement’s lenders declined to consider UltraTech’s higher offer because it came after Dalmia Bharat was declared the highest bidder.
The lenders had decided before bids were received that they would negotiate only with the highest bidder, their legal counsel told the tribunal. Though UltraTech offered to pay over Rs1,000 crore more, they were constrained from considering it by rules they had themselves set.
Appearing for UltraTech, lawyer Mukul Rohatgi told the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that UltraTech was ready to raise its bid by Rs500 crore more if Dalmia Bharat matched the current offer.
“It is made clear that if both (companies) are willing to participate in the bidding process, the committee of creditors is expected to allow both in the bidding process,"" the tribunal said in its order.
With this verdict, the committee of creditors now has the legal sanction to consider UltraTech’s bid, said Ratnanko Banerji, senior counsel who represented Binani Industries Ltd, the parent of the beleaguered cement-maker.
In the same order, the bench has extended the time for finalizing a resolution plan for Binani Cement till 24 June. It will review progress on 4 June.
“We are surprised by the order passed by the NCLT today,"" Dalmia Bharat said in a statement. The insolvency resolution professional, or the administrator, and the committee of creditors had followed “the due process of law"" in selecting the Dalmia Bharat-led consortium as the highest bidder, it said. 
“In our view, any revised offer from an unsuccessful resolution applicant outside the resolution process cannot become a basis for setting aside the decision of the committee of creditors. We have strong conviction that we have followed the law as per due process and believe that we will eventually succeed. We will take all the appropriate steps required,"" Dalmia Bharat said."

Kolkata: The lenders of Binani Cement Ltd may not be meeting on Thursday at St. Regis Hotel in Mumbai to consider UltraTech Cement Ltd’s revised bid. 
Kolkata: The lenders of Binani Cement Ltd may not be meeting on Thursday at St. Regis Hotel in Mumbai to consider UltraTech Cement Ltd’s revised bid.
The scheduled meeting to comply with an order of the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) may have been called off in view of the latest objections raised by Dalmia Bharat Ltd, which was declared by the committee of creditors as the highest bidder.
According to some lenders, who asked not to be named, the resolution professional Vijaykumar V. Iyer late on Wednesday evening sent out a message to the committee of creditors saying that the meeting stands cancelled because he wants to review the allegations made by Dalmia Bharat.
Dalmia Bharat has alleged that UltraTech is ineligible to bid for the assets of Binani Cement under section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. The company, however, had not argued that its competitor was barred from bidding under this section during the protracted legal battle at the Kolkata bench of the tribunal, which ended last week.
After being outbid by Dalmia Bharat, UltraTech revised its offer for Binani Cement, topping its competitor’s bid by over Rs1,000 crore, and moved the NCLT. It wanted the lenders to consider its revised bid even after they had filed Dalmia Bharat’s bid as the chosen resolution plan.
Last week, the tribunal passed its verdict saying that UltraTech’s bid should be considered as also Dalmia Bharat’s fresh bid if it wishes to revise it, restarting a two-way contest between the two suitors. Dalmia Bharat has since moved the Supreme Court challenging the NCLT’s verdict allowing the lenders to consider UltraTech’s revised offer. 
The matter has not been heard yet at the apex court."

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed an appeal by Dalmia Bharat Ltd-controlled Rajputana Properties Pvt. Ltd (RPPL) challenging an order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) that refused to stay UltraTech Cement’s revised bid of Rs7,900 crore from being considered in the ongoing resolution process for Binani Cement 
This comes as a setback for Dalmia Bharat as the apex court refused to interfere in the resolution process. The court however, asked the NCLAT to hear the case on a day-to-day basis, without adjournments. 
Dalmia Bharat has offered to pay Rs6,932.46 crore for Binani Cement whereas UltraTech has raised its bid to Rs7,960 crore, and claimed that in the interest of all stakeholders, its bid should be considered by the lenders.
On 4 May, the appellate tribunal refused to grant an interim stay on a 2 May order of the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which had asked the insolvency resolution professional (IRP) and the committee of creditors (CoC) to consider the revised bid of UltraTech Cement. 
On 2 May, the Kolkata branch of the NCLT passed an order asking the IRP to accept UltraTech’s revised bid of Rs7,900 crore within three days with a provision for Dalmia Bharat to match UltraTech’s offer. This put UltraTech back in the race for acquiring Binani Cement. Thereafter, Dalmia Bharat moved the appellate court to obtain a stay on the NCLT order. NCLAT declined immediate stay.
According to a Mint story on 28 February, the Dalmia consortium had agreed to invest around Rs6,700 crore in the stressed cement firm over a period of time. Binani Cement, which was admitted by NCLT in July 2017 for resolution under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, owes around Rs6,500 crore to its lenders.
UltraTech Cement, which was initially outbid by Dalmia Bharat, later struck a deal with Binani Industries Ltd to acquire 98.43% in the cement maker for Rs7,266 crore.

Kolkata: The resolution professional for Binani Cement Ltd has convened a meeting of the company’s lenders on Friday in Mumbai to consider the revised bid of Ultratech Cement Ltd after cancelling last week’s scheduled meeting in view of objections raised by Dalmia Bharat Ltd about the AV Birla group company’s eligibility to bid. 
Kolkata: The resolution professional for Binani Cement Ltd has convened a meeting of the company’s lenders on Friday in Mumbai to consider the revised bid of Ultratech Cement Ltd after cancelling last week’s scheduled meeting in view of objections raised by Dalmia Bharat Ltd about the AV Birla group company’s eligibility to bid.
Binani Cement’s committee of creditors was to meet on Thursday, 10 May, but Vijaykumar Iyer, the resolution professional called off the meeting, after Dalmia Bharat, which was earlier chosen as the successful bidder, claimed Ultratech was ineligible to bid under section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. He had said he wanted to get legal opinion on the objections raised by Dalmia Bharat.
After a protracted legal battle at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) over whether or not lenders could consider Ultratech’s revised bid after Dalmia Bharat was declared the successful bidder, it has held by the tribunal that fresh bids made by both companies should be considered in the interest of better realisation for all stakeholders.
Dalmia Bharat moved the appellate tribunal in Delhi, and then the Supreme Court, challenging the Kolkata bench’s verdict but couldn’t win reprieve. The appellate tribunal is hearing Dalmia Bharat’s challenge, but has not imposed injunction on the Kolkata bench’s verdict allowing creditors to consider Ultratech’s revised bid of Rs7,960 crore, which was at least Rs1,000 crore more than Dalmia Bharat’s offer.
Though Dalmia Bharat did not challenge Ultratech’s eligibility to bid under section 29A at the Kolkata bench of NCLT, it has lately claimed that the company was barred from bidding in the first place.
On Friday, for the first time, Ultratech’s revised bid is to be considered by Binani Cement’s creditors, according to two persons, who had received the intimation from the resolution professional. These persons asked not to be identified.
Friday’s meeting could potentially kick off a two-way contest between the two suitors, according to a lawyer in Kolkata. Lenders and the resolution professional were looking for a legal sanction to consider Ultratech’s offer which they now have, he said, asking not to be named.
Dalmia Bharat has said it will move the apex court again if it failed to secure satisfactory orders at the appellate tribunal."

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd, part of the Aditya Birla group, will acquire the cement business of BK Birla group’s Century Textiles and Industries Ltd in an all-stock transaction.
Shareholders of Century Textiles will receive one share of UltraTech for every eight shares held, according to the plan. The enterprise value of Century’s cement business is pegged at Rs8,561 crore and UltraTech will absorb debt of Rs3,000 crore, managing director K.K. Maheshwari said over the phone. 
Sunday’s announcement is the culmination of a plan that was eight years in the making and involved consolidating the cement businesses of the two groups into one firm and the BK Birla group exiting non-core businesses to focus on real estate.
Century Textiles’ cement assets comprise three integrated units in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra with a total capacity of 11.4 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) and a 2 mtpa grinding unit in West Bengal.
“The transaction provides UltraTech the opportunity for further strengthening its presence in the highly fragmented, competitive and fast-growing east and central markets and extending its footprint in the western and southern markets in the country,"" the company said in a statement. 
On completion of the transaction, UltraTech’s capacity will rise to 109.9 mtpa, including its overseas operations. This will make UltraTech the world’s third-largest cement maker outside China.
The transaction is part of the Birla family’s plan to consolidate its cement businesses within one company, said UltraTech’s Maheshwari. “Some of these (acquired) plants are old and they would need significant capital expenditure to modernize them,"" Maheshwari said. 
The transaction is subject to the regulatory approvals and is expected to be completed within six to nine months, UltraTech said in a press statement on Sunday. Walker Chandiok & Co. and Bansi S Mehta & Co. were the independent joint valuers. Axis Capital provided the fairness opinion and Khaitan & Co. and Trilegal were the legal advisers.
In December, Century’s board sold the operating rights of its viscose filament yarn business for 15 years on a royalty basis to Grasim, another Aditya Birla group company. 
Century reported revenue of Rs4,306 crore and operating profit of Rs492 crore (excluding non-recurring items) in the year to 31 March. Debt stood at Rs4,300 crore.
UltraTech is also in the race to buy the cement assets of its insolvent competitor Binani Industries. It has bid Rs7,990 crore for Binani’s cement plants and is fighting off a challenge for the same from the Dalmia Bharat group."

New Delhi: Ultratech Cement Ltd, an Aditya Birla group company, on Monday said that it has bagged the Deora-Sitapuri-Udipyapura limestone mining block in Madhya Pradesh. 
New Delhi: Ultratech Cement Ltd, an Aditya Birla group company, on Monday said that it has bagged the Deora-Sitapuri-Udipyapura limestone mining block in Madhya Pradesh.
The block is in close proximity to its existing limestone mines of the company’s recently commissioned unit Dhar Cement Works, said the company.
“The company has won the Deora-Sitapuri-Udipyapura limestone mining block in the State of Madhya Pradesh,"" Ultratech Cement said in a BSE filing. “This mining block is spread over 344.783 hectares of land having minable reserve of around 54 million MT.... This (limestone mining block) will be useful for augmenting the capacity of Dhar Unit in future,"" it added.
At 12.13pm, Ultratech Cement shares were trading 0.20% higher at Rs3,867 apiece on BSE."
48,2018-05-22,UltraTech,"With increasing competitive intensity, if UltraTech Cement decides to aggressively chase volume growth, cement prices, which have slowly begun to rise, would suffer again

UltraTech Cement Ltd is on an acquisition spree. The latest addition to its shopping basket is the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries Ltd. 
UltraTech Cement Ltd is on an acquisition spree. The latest addition to its shopping basket is the cement business of Century Textiles and Industries Ltd.
UltraTech will acquire 13.4 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of Century Textiles’ cement assets for an enterprise value of Rs8,600 crore. With that, the pan-India cement producer’s presence in the eastern (Chhattisgarh), central (Madhya Pradesh) and western (Maharashtra) markets will strengthen further.
Following this acquisition, the company’s domestic capacity will increase nearly 15% to 106 mtpa from 92.6 mtpa (see Chart 1) Its all-India capacity market share will rise from around 20% to 23% by the end of the current fiscal year (FY19). Region-wise, its capacity market share would improve by 7%, 6% and 8% in the central, eastern and western markets, respectively, say analysts. 
Moreover, UltraTech’s cement capacity will stand augmented to 109.9 mtpa including its overseas operations, making it the third-largest cement maker in the world, outside China (see Chart 2). 
While the deal does not give UltraTech Cement access to newer markets, it clearly consolidates the company’s dominant position across these regions. 
This may be good news for the company’s shareholders , but would get its competitors in these regions worried because, despite this being the busy construction season, the sector’s demand growth is not strong enough to support higher prices. And with increasing competitive intensity, if UltraTech Cement decides to aggressively chase volume growth, cement prices, which have slowly begun to rise, would suffer again. 
This is the company’s second acquisition in two years. As for the first one, it is ramping up the 21 mtpa of cement capacities acquired from Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. That, coupled with a ramp-up of capacities by other large cement producers such as Shree Cement Ltd, has kept cement prices in north India under pressure.
So much so that cement prices on an all-India basis inched up in May, but the north remained a laggard.
It should be noted that a final decision on the acquisition of Binani Cement Ltd is still pending. UltraTech Cement is desperately trying to acquire those assets, and ramping up of capacities by the acquirer would also have a bearing on cement prices in Rajasthan. 
As for other regions, cement prices in the west saw the highest increase of Rs14 per bag on a month-on-month to Rs324 per bag in May, showed a monthly cement dealer channel check report by Kotak Institutional Equities. One cement bag weighs 50kg.
The price increase in Maharashtra was moderate at Rs8 per bag from a month earlier. In the central region, prices in Madhya Pradesh fell by Rs5 per bag month-on-month and prices in the east remained flat at Rs337 per bag in May, the report added. 
Meanwhile, the transaction with Century Textiles is subject to the Competition Commission of India’s approval and is expected to be completed in the next six-nine months. 
In any case, the scenario remains challenging as far as input costs are concerned, and if cut-throat competition leads to larger cement companies pushing volumes at the expense of prices, then smaller cement makers may not be able to survive the pressure."

New Delhi:The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday refused to stay the corporate insolvency resolution process for Binani Cement Ltd. 
New Delhi:The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday refused to stay the corporate insolvency resolution process for Binani Cement Ltd.
An NCLAT bench, headed by justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay, maintained a status quo after hearing the petition by Dalmia-Bharat-controlled Rajputana Properties Pvt. Ltd, which had challenged the revised resolution plan made by UltraTech Cement Ltd for debt-ridden Binani Cement. 
Former attorney general Gopal Subramanium, who appeared for Rajputana Properties, sought an order of status quo in view of the appeal pending before the appellate tribunal.
The bench refused to stall the insolvency resolution process and stated that the outcome of the process would be subject to the final decision in the appeal. 
Earlier this month, Rajputana Properties had challenged the 2 May order of the NCLT’s Kolkata bench, which allowed the resolution professional and committee of creditors (CoC) for Binani Cement to consider the revised resolution plan submitted by UltraTech, while offering Rajputana Properties an opportunity to revise its resolution plan of Rs6,930 crore.
UltraTech Cement’s revised offer was at Rs7,900 crore, against its earlier bid of Rs7,200 crore.
On 15 May, the appellate tribunal had asked the resolution professional to continue with the resolution process by submitting the revised resolution plans for the corporate debtor in a sealed cover before the CoC, along with his opinion on questions pertaining to conformity with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.
Binani Industries Ltd, the parent of Binani Cement, has also offered to pay all the dues of its subsidiary to its financial and operational creditors in two weeks, if the tribunal so permitted.
Binani Cement, which was admitted by NCLT in July 2017 for resolution under the IBC, owes over Rs6,500 crore to its lenders. The matter will be next heard on 10 July."

The order had also prohibited the resolution professional for Binani Cement Ltd from seeking an opinion from the resolution applicants and other parties on the questions of eligibility.
Simultaneously, it has challenged a 22 May order of the NCLAT that refused to stay the corporate insolvency resolution process for Binani Cement. RPPL has sought stay of both the NCLAT orders on an urgent basis.
Dalmia Bharat has offered to pay Rs6,932.46 crore for Binani Cement whereas UltraTech has raised its bid to Rs7,960 crore and claimed that, in the interest of all stakeholders, its bid should be considered by the lenders.
The matter was mentioned before the apex court by former attorney general Gopal Subramanium.
Seeking urgent listing of the matter and for it to be heard on a day-to-day basis, RPPL sought stay of the impugned orders directing the resolution professional and CoC to consider the resolution plans as per the guidelines prescribed under the 15 May order. 
The appeal holds that through the impugned orders of 15 May and 22 May, NCLAT has erroneously laid down a procedure unknown to the statutory framework devised for the purpose of evaluation of a resolution plan by eliminating scrutiny regarding its legality and eligibility of a resolution applicant under Section 30(3) and 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC).
The effect of the 15 May order is that while the legality and correctness of the rejection of a resolution plan submitted by the applicant is pending adjudication before the adjudicating authority, the CoC has been allowed to consider the revised offer of an unsuccessful resolution applicant (UltraTech), it was stated.
On 15 May, an NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay had asked the resolution professional to submit the revised resolution plans for the corporate debtor in a sealed cover before the CoC along with his opinion on questions pertaining to conformity with the IBC. The appellate tribunal further asked the CoC to record reasons for accepting or refusing a resolution plan, as well as the opinion of the board of directors. 
The appellate tribunal on 4 May refused to grant an interim stay on a 2 May order of the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which had asked the resolution professional and the CoC to consider the revised bid of UltraTech Cement.
On 2 May, the Kolkata branch of the NCLT had passed an order asking the resolution professional to accept UltraTech’s revised bid of Rs7,900 crore within three days with a provision for Dalmia Bharat to match UltraTech’s offer. This put UltraTech back in the race for acquiring Binani Cement. Thereafter, Dalmia Bharat moved the appellate court to obtain a stay on the NCLT order. NCLAT declined immediate stay.
The appeal is likely to be heard by the top court next week."

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd’s Rs7,950 crore bid to acquire Binani Cement Ltd has received near-unanimous backing from lenders to the distressed building material maker even as a legal battle reached the country’s top court, two people aware of the development said.
Binani Cement’s committee of creditors (CoC) voted in person to approve UltraTech’s bid at the meeting on Monday, the people said, requesting anonymity. 
“UltraTech is being supported almost unanimously by the lenders,"" one of the people, a banker, said. “The Supreme Court has not put a stay on the process; so the direction is clear."" 
The acquisition of Binani Cement will, however, be subject to the Supreme Court’s ruling, with a Dalmia Bharat Ltd-led consortium challenging the 15 May order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal that allowed lenders to consider UltraTech’s revised offer. The offer was submitted after lenders selected Dalmia as the top bidder. 
The Supreme Court is likely to hear the appeal by Dalmia Bharat next week. The consortium is challenging UltraTech’s eligibility to bid under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which disallows defaulting promoters from being resolution applicants. Dalmia’s contention is that UltraTech is working in concert with Binani Industries Ltd, the parent of Binani Cement, and is hence a defaulter. 
Piramal Enterprises and Bain Capital are the other members of the Dalmia Bharat-led consortium. 
“The process has been laid out and has to be followed. The (value) maximization is happening beyond the process, which is not correct. It is a lacuna in the law and is being decided by NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) and SC,"" Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Enterprises, said in an interview. 
Dalmia Bharat has offered lenders Rs6,350 crore to take over Binani. UltraTech, which had originally bid lower, later raised its bid by more than Rs1,000 crore. Binani Cement’s lenders allowed Dalmia to match UltraTech’s bid, but Dalmia chose to challenge the process in court. 
Bankers say the insolvency code allows for “value maximization"" of an asset and NCLT and the Supreme Court are also of the same view. 
Binani Cement owes about Rs6,313 crore to banks and operational creditors, who will be paid back in full under UltraTech’s resolution plan."

 Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd has successfully secured its brand in a case of copyright infringement, winning a lawsuit against a firm selling cement brands resembling its own.
Billionaire Aditya Birla-owned UltraTech Cement had moved the Bombay high court on 21 March against Everest Industries, which was using the marks “Ultratruf"" and “A One Ultratruf"" that were deceptively similar to its own registered mark “UltraTech"". In intellectual property rights law, this is called passing-off—making a false representation that is likely to induce a person to believe that the goods or services are those of another. Typically, consumer goods and pharmaceutical firms go to court to protect their brands. 
UltraTech said Everest was using the mark “Ultratruf-The Builders Choice"". 
The placement of the mark, its style, font, colour combination, etc, were deceptively similar to the registered mark and, hence, it had sent a cease-and-desist notice to Everest. “Prima facie, the marks ‘Ultratruf-The Builders Choice’ and ‘A One Ultratruf’ used by the defendants are deceptively similar to the plaintiffs’ registered trademark ‘UltraTech’,"" justice S.J. Kathawala observed in his order. “The defendants have adopted the font, style, colour combination, placement of material and the words in such a manner that the products of the defendants looks as if the same are the products of the plaintiffs.""
The court also observed that Everest was deceptively using another brand name, Ambruja, similar to that of Ambuja Cements Ltd. 
The court on 14 May ordered Everest Industries not to use the mark in any manner and directed it to submit to the court  ₹ 10 lakh as costs and damage within two weeks.
“The court receiver appointed by the court confirmed the allegations of UltraTech. The defendants even admitted their mistake before the court,"" said trademark attorney Pranit Nanavati of Gujarat-based law firm Nanavati Associates.
Questions emailed to UltraTech and Everest Industries were not answered till press time. “Much like the commodity cement is, it takes years of consistent efforts on multiple fronts to build a brand out of it and create one’s position as a leader in that segment,"" said Tina Jain Mehta, co-founder of boutique branding and design firm Pineapple Consulting. “UltraTech has built a name for itself by being consistent in its effort to build a brand promise over a period of time. It is an easy, tempting lure of shortcut to success by riding over somebody else’s efforts that make people give in for getting into acts like these. No wonder UltraTech has to be vigilant as that comes as the cost of being successful."""

Kolkata: The resolution professional of Binani Cement Ltd. on Monday submitted the resolution plan of Ultratech Cement Ltd. at the Kolkata bench of the National Company Law Tribunal for its approval even as the tribunal agreed to hear Dalmia Bharat’s objections about Ultratech’s bid.
Counsel for the resolution professional submitted at the court that lenders of Binani Cement have unanimously approved Ultratech’s plan to take over the company. It was submitted that the committee of creditors had considered and rejected Dalmia Bharat’s allegations.
According to Dalmia Bharat, Ultratech is ineligible to bid for the assets of Binani Cement under section 29A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, which bars delinquent promoters from bidding for distressed assets. Dalmia Bharat argues that Ultratech is ineligible since it has been working with Binani Industries Ltd., the parent of the delinquent cement maker.
Resolution professional Vijaykumar V. Iyer had previously cancelled a CoC meeting scheduled on 10 May because he wanted to review Dalmia Bharat’s latest objections to Ultratech’s bid. However, Ultratech’s resolution plan was approved later by the lenders.
S.K. Kapoor, counsel for Dalmia Bharat sought the tribunal to direct the resolution professional to share Ultratech’s resolution plan with them. However, the tribunal has directed the administrator to share necessary details pertaining to the lenders’ observations about Dalmia Bharat’s objections only.
Counsel appearing on behalf of Ultratech Cement Siddhartha Mitra submitted that both the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and the Supreme Court have asked the lenders to continue with the resolution process. However their decision will be subject to the verdicts of these appellate authorities. Dalmia Bharat had moved these courts seeking a stay on the resolution process.
The Dalmia Bharat-led consortium had offered Rs6,932.46 crore to take over Binani and was declared the highest bidder. While Ultratech had bid at least Rs50 Crore lower originally, it later revised its bid to Rs7,950 crore. This led to a protracted legal battle. The Kolkata bench of the NCLT ordered the lenders to reconsider both bids and allow Dalmia Bharat to match Ultratech’s bid if it wished to. “It is made clear that if both (companies) are willing to participate in the bidding process, the committee of creditors is expected to allow both in the bidding process,"" the tribunal had said in its order of 2 May.
The NCLAT is supposed to hear Dalmia Bharat’s plea from 10 July on a daily basis. The Kolkata bench intends to conclude its hearing before that. It will hear the matter again on 18 June."

Mumbai: Ultratech Cement’s fiscal-first quarter profit fell 30% on higher petcoke and fuel prices.  
Mumbai: Ultratech Cement’s fiscal-first quarter profit fell 30% on higher petcoke and fuel prices. 
Net profit declined to  ₹ 631 crore in the three months ended 30 June from  ₹ 898 crore in the year earlier, the country’s largest cement maker said in a filing on Wednesday.
In a presentation to investors, the company said that logistics costs, which account for 34% of overall expenses, rose 9% from a year earlier to  ₹ 1,199 a tonne. Energy costs rose 18% due to higher prices of petroleum coke and a weakening rupee making imports more expensive. Additional royalties on limestone mines transfer, among other raw material costs, rose 8% from a year earlier. Net profit was also affected by depreciation of  ₹ 486 crore and interest costs of  ₹ 336 crore.
Revenue rose 30% from a year earlier to  ₹ 8,476 crore while profit before interest, depreciation and taxes fell 2% to  ₹ 1,763 crore. Capacity utilization of its total capacity of 92.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) stood at roughly 70%.
At the company’s annual general meeting held on Wednesday, K.M. Birla, chairman of Ultratech, said that the company’s acquisition of 21.2 mtpa cement capacity from Jaiprakash Associates Ltd and Jaypee Cement in June 2017 achieved an average capacity utilisation of 70% across all the regions and a cash break-even.
Birla told shareholders that Ultratech is seeking to increase its white cement capacity in the future, and is considering new limestone mining rights in this regard. 
The board recommended a dividend of  ₹ 10.5 per share.

UltraTech Cement Ltd’s volume jumped 34% year-on-year to 16.8 million tonnes in the June quarter, aided by faster ramp-up of assets acquired from Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. While UltraTech Cement further consolidates its national leadership position, it gives investors in the stock little reason to cheer. 
UltraTech Cement Ltd’s volume jumped 34% year-on-year to 16.8 million tonnes in the June quarter, aided by faster ramp-up of assets acquired from Jaiprakash Associates Ltd. While UltraTech Cement further consolidates its national leadership position, it gives investors in the stock little reason to cheer.
Although cement volume grew in double-digits, surging operating expenses and interest cost weighed on overall financial performance. Freight, energy and raw material costs continue to head northwards (see chart).
Increased diesel prices pushed logistics costs higher. Additional royalty on limestone mines transfer and higher additive costs impacted raw material costs.
Further, the company increased its petroleum coke (petcoke) usage from 75% in the previous quarter to 83% in the June quarter. Prices of this key input material have increased around 35% year-on-year. Also, its import duty was raised to 10% a few months ago from 2.5%. Since most cement makers meet their petcoke requirements through imports, the depreciating rupee is adding fuel to the fire. 
A relief on the cost front is unlikely anytime soon. Cement prices were weak even in a busy construction season and the inability of cement producers to pass on the burden remains a worry. Consequently, margins have suffered. But this is the case with all cement makers and not just UltraTech alone. 
However, the company’s ongoing acquisition spree, which is feared to push debt higher, is seen as an added concern for investors. As debt levels rise, interest expenses would also increase. 
UltraTech will acquire 13.4 million tonnes per annum of Century Textiles’ cement assets for an enterprise value of  ₹ 8,600 crore. The company is simultaneously battling to acquire Binani Cements Ltd and may pay around  ₹ 7,900 crore for it. 
Finance cost or interest expense saw a sharp increase of 161% year-on-year in the June quarter. That, along with increased depreciation, eroded its stand-alone net profit.
No wonder then the UltraTech Cement stock ended Wednesday’s session down 2.2% on NSE. The stock trades at a rich one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 33 times and given these concerns, its valuation needs to correct."

This was challenged by the cement makers before the Competition Appellate Tribunal, which had on 22 November stayed the CCI’s direction to pay 10% of the penalty within a month of the order.
In the August 2016 order, apart from penalizing the CMA, the CCI had directed all the firms to “cease and desist"" from indulging in any activity relating to agreement, understanding or arrangement on prices, production and supply of cement in the market.
The CCI had imposed the highest penalty of  ₹  1,175.49 crore on Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech."

However, a two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay said, “Maybe the plan is not just and proper, but the plan is good. It is fulfilling all the conditions but the offer may be bad.""
The appellate tribunal said that it will hear the resolution professional of Binani Cement along with Rajputana Properties on 13 August.
Last month, the Supreme Court had directed the NCLAT to adjudicate upon all issues in the Binani Cement insolvency case, including the question of UltraTech Cement’s eligibility under Section 29A as well the legality of its bid, at the earliest. In doing so, the apex court transferred the matter from the NCLT’s Kolkata bench to the insolvency appellate authority in New Delhi.
Rajputana Properties had moved the NCLAT in May against the 2 May order of the NCLT, which allowed the resolution professional and committee of creditors (CoC) for Binani Cement to consider the revised resolution plan submitted by UltraTech, while offering Rajputana Properties an opportunity to revise its resolution plan of  ₹  6,930 crore.
UltraTech Cement’s revised offer was  ₹  7,900 crore, against its earlier bid of  ₹  7,200 crore.

However, the copy of the CCI order is awaited, it added. The board of directors of UltraTech Cement on May 20, 2018 approved a scheme of arrangement amongst Century Textiles and Industries and its respective shareholders and creditors, the Aditya Birla Group firm said in a statement.
The transaction would provide UltraTech an opportunity to further strengthen its presence in the east and central markets, extending its footprint in the Western and Southern markets in the country.
Century Textiles has three integrated cement units situated in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra with a total capacity of 11.4 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) and a grinding unit in West Bengal of 2.0 mtpa."

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday reserved its judgment on the Binani insolvency matter, as it concluded hearing various appeals related to the matter.  
New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Thursday reserved its judgment on the Binani insolvency matter, as it concluded hearing various appeals related to the matter. 
The two-judge NCLAT bench headed by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay also directed all parties concerned, including Rajputana Properties Pvt. Ltd. and UltraTech Cement Pvt. Ltd., to submit their additional written responses, if any, by 4 September.
Appearing for UltraTech, lawyer Mukul Rohatgi argued before NCLAT that UltraTech’s plan was Rs. 1,000 crore more than Rajputana’s. “I am paying all operational creditors in full as opposed to their (Rajputana’s) plan,"" claimed Rohtagi.
In its last hearing, the appellate tribunal had sought the payment terms for stakeholders, including financial and operational creditors of the debt-ridden firm, in the resolution plan submitted by Rajputana and UltraTech, respectively.
Last month, the Supreme Court had directed NCLAT to adjudicate upon all issues in the Binani Cement insolvency case, including the question of UltraTech Cement’s eligibility under Section 29A as well the legality of its bid, at the earliest. In doing so, the apex court transferred the matter from the NCLT’s Kolkata Bench to the insolvency appellate authority in New Delhi.
Dalmia Bharat-controlled Rajputana Properties had moved NCLAT in May against the 2 May order of NCLT, which allowed the resolution professional and Committee of Creditors (CoC) for Binani Cement to consider the revised resolution plan submitted by UltraTech, while offering Rajputana Properties an opportunity to revise its resolution plan of  ₹ 6,930 crore.
UltraTech Cement’s revised offer was  ₹ 7,900 crore, against its earlier bid of  ₹ 7,200 crore.
The NCLAT on 15 May refused to stall the insolvency process and asked the resolution professional to submit the revised resolution plans for the corporate debtor in a sealed cover before the CoC, along with his opinion on questions pertaining to conformity with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).
Binani Cement, which was admitted by NCLT in July 2017 for resolution under the IBC, owes more than  ₹ 6,500 crore to lenders."

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd’s quarterly profit dropped 9.4% and missed market expectations, hurt by higher expenses, the company’s statement showed on Friday.
Standalone net profit, which does not account for its subsidiaries, stood at  ₹ 391 crore for the quarter ended 30th September, compared with a profit of  ₹ 431 crore a year earlier, the company said in a statement.
Analysts on average had expected the company to post a profit of  ₹ 415 crore, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
However, revenue from operations jumped 20.9% to  ₹ 7,771 crore, while total expenses rose 23.5%.
Rising energy and logistics cost coupled with rupee depreciation led to a 14% increase in costs compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the company said.
Shares of UltraTech Cement dropped 4.2% after the results.

Ahead of its September quarter (Q2) earnings, UltraTech Cement Ltd was trading deep in the red on Friday. Taking cues from ACC Ltd’s unimpressive operating performance, the Street was visibly nervous about UltraTech results. And the fears of investors came true after the company’s earnings disappointed on all key fronts. 
Ahead of its September quarter (Q2) earnings, UltraTech Cement Ltd was trading deep in the red on Friday. Taking cues from ACC Ltd’s unimpressive operating performance, the Street was visibly nervous about UltraTech results. And the fears of investors came true after the company’s earnings disappointed on all key fronts.
Standalone net profit at  ₹ 390.80 crore slipped 9% year-on-year (y-o-y), missing analysts’ consensus estimate of  ₹ 420.70 crore. While standalone revenue was up 21% y-o-y at  ₹ 7,771.3 crore, it also fell short of expectations. The 21% y-o-y growth in cement volume at 15.1 million tonnes let down investors, as analysts were pencilling in a 23% growth.
Nearly 80% of UltraTech’s fuel mix comprises petroleum coke (petcoke), so margin compression was on the cards. However, operating margins were severely dented. They were not just impacted by high petcoke prices, but also by increased logistics cost and a depreciating rupee.
Punished for the poor show, the UltraTech stock slumped to a 52-week low of  ₹ 3,525 intraday on the National Stock Exchange on Friday. Although the stock recovered, it ended the day in the red.
Even though Q2 has been seasonally lean for cement makers, of late the Street has not been gung-ho on this sector, given the multiple challenges.
While demand is slowly recovering, it continues to be driven by government spending on infrastructure. Demand from the housing segment, a significant contributor to overall cement demand, remains muted. Consequently, the sector’s capacity utilization remains low.
Secondly, there is no respite in sight, at least in the near-term, as far as input cost inflation is concerned. This comes at a time when cement prices across most parts of the country are on a weak footing. While cement companies are trying hard to boost their operating efficiencies and control costs, the measures will take time to yield results.
Despite these concerns, valuations of many cement stocks remain expensive. No wonder then that a slew of brokerage houses have a cautious stance on the sector. Furthermore, disappointing Q2 results of these large-caps leave little hope for other cement makers who are yet to announce their results. 
In short, given that key cement producers have succumbed to cost pressures, the outlook for the sector remains muted and may lead to a further derating."

Rajputana Properties had moved the apex court a day after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) gave a nod to UltraTech, expressing urgency in the matter. 
The matter was mentioned before a bench headed by CJI Ranjan Gogoi who said that it would be taken up for hearing on Monday. 
On Wednesday, a two-member bench of the NCLAT had dismissed an appeal by Rajputana Properties saying that its offer for Binani Cement was “discriminatory"" against some financial creditors.
“The objective of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code is resolution (and) the purpose of the resolution is for maximization of the value of assets of the corporate debtor,"" the tribunal ruled.
At the root of the dispute is a decision by Binani Cement’s committee of creditors to consider an improved bid from UltraTech after Rajputana Properties’  ₹ 6,930 crore bid was declared the highest bidder and filed with the Kolkata bench of the bankruptcy court for its approval.
Rajputana Properties had in July approached the Supreme Court challenging the committee of creditors’ decision to consider UltraTech’s revised proposal, which would entirely pay off all secured and unsecured financial creditors, as well as operational creditors.
The apex court referred the matter to NCLAT.
In its Wednesday order, the NCLAT said that the resolution process under the IBC should consider the interests of even those creditors who are not part of the resolution process, such as operational creditors, while also maintaining the ability of the target company in continuing as a going concern."
31,2018-11-19,UltraTech,"Although Shree Cement continues to trade at a premium to ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech Cement, the company's performance is expected to remain challenging

Shree Cement Ltd’s September quarter (Q2) result was a mixed bag. 
Shree Cement Ltd’s September quarter (Q2) result was a mixed bag.
Cement sales volume grew 16% on a year-on-year basis aided by capacity expansions. Realization growth was muted, and operating margins contracted due to higher raw material and fuel prices.
Profit was dented by an exceptional loss of  ₹ 180 crore from investments in preference shares of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS). The company also incurred forex losses.
Shree Cement also announced the setting up two greenfield projects in eastern India, which are expected to be operational by 2019-20. These projects include a 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) grinding unit in Cuttack and a 2.5 mtpa unit in Jharkhand.
Although the Shree Cement stock continues to trade at a premium to other large-cap cement producers such as ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd, the company’s performance is expected to remain challenging.
The trend of cement prices in its key markets including northern, central and eastern India remains volatile. In an environment of input cost inflation, the inability to take price hikes indicates further pressure on the margins of most cement producers, including Shree Cement.
The company’s decision to increase capacity comes at a time when there is already a situation of oversupply, and utilization levels are low, as demand growth is still not adequate. 
Some analysts are also wary that capital outlay of around  ₹ 900 crore required for these projects could strain the company’s balance sheet in the near term. 
Consequently, a slew of domestic brokerage firms including Edelweiss Securities Ltd, Reliance Securities Ltd and IDBI Capital Ltd have trimmed their target price on the Shree Cement stock. Some, such as Elara Securities (India) Ltd, have also cut the FY20 earnings estimates. 
As for the valuations, on a one-year forward price-to-earnings basis, the Shree Cement stock trades at a multiple of 35 times, which is expensive in the current scenario and needs to correct."

The tug of war between UltraTech Cement Ltd and Dalmia Bharat Ltd over the acquisition of Binani Cement Ltd has finally ended. Effective 20 November, Binani Cement is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UltraTech Cement, following a favourable Supreme Court ruling. For Dalmia Bharat, which has a significant presence in the southern and eastern markets, the acquisition would have given access to new markets in the north, especially in south Rajasthan. 
The tug of war between UltraTech Cement Ltd and Dalmia Bharat Ltd over the acquisition of Binani Cement Ltd has finally ended. Effective 20 November, Binani Cement is a wholly-owned subsidiary of UltraTech Cement, following a favourable Supreme Court ruling. For Dalmia Bharat, which has a significant presence in the southern and eastern markets, the acquisition would have given access to new markets in the north, especially in south Rajasthan.
Investors are also relieved that Dalmia Bharat didn’t stretch itself and pursue the deal far too aggressively. Its net debt-to-Ebitda stands at 1.97 times, using FY19 earnings estimates of JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd.
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
In fact, analysts tracking the cement producer haven’t changed their stance or recommendation on the stock after the apex court’s decision. The Street had factored in a decision in UltraTech’s favour, said an analyst with a domestic brokerage firm.
But what next for Dalmia Bharat? Even before the Binani bid, it was already on an acquisition and capacity expansion spree. So, the market’s attention has now shifted back to developments on those fronts.
In the March quarter of FY18, the company had announced a capex of  ₹ 5,000 crore for the next three years. This included its capacity expansion in the east and acquisitions of debt-laden Kalyanpur Cements Ltd and Murli Industries Ltd.
In a recent conference call with analysts, Dalmia said it had spent  ₹ 350 crore in the first half of FY19 on an expansion project and the revival of Kalyanpur Cements. Besides, the company’s board has approved the amalgamation of OCL India Ltd, which it had acquired in 2016, with itself. However, the acquisition of Murli Industries is slightly delayed, as National Company Law Appellate Tribunal proceedings are still pending. 
Further, its management said that Dalmia’s gross debt as of 30 September 2018 stood at about  ₹ 7,100 crore and net debt at about  ₹ 3,800 crore. As per analysts, apart from the progress on consolidation of acquired assets, deleveraging is a key upside trigger for the stock. 
The company’s performance in the September quarter was subdued. Although cement sales volumes growth was decent, profitability was impacted by increased input cost pressures. As the chart shows, high cost of petroleum coke and diesel resulted in margins slipping by 60 basis points on a year-on-year basis. A basis point is 0.01%. 
While the demand outlook is improving for Dalmia’s key markets in east and south India, many brokers have cut operating margin estimates, after factoring in the high cost inflation and weak prices."

After a hiatus of more than a year, pan-India cement producers ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd are expanding capacities. ACC will be incurring a capital expenditure of  ₹ 3,000 crore to add 5.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) cement capacity and 3 mtpa clinker capacity in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The company’s existing cement capacity stands at 33.41 mtpa.

ACC will be incurring a capital expenditure of  ₹ 3,000 crore to add 5.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) cement capacity and 3 mtpa clinker capacity in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The company’s existing cement capacity stands at 33.41 mtpa. 
In a separate filing to stock exchanges, Ambuja Cements said that it will invest  ₹ 2,350 crore for a series of capacity additions. These include a clinker unit, a cement grinding unit, and a captive power plant and waste heat recovery system. Following these expansions, its total cement capacity will increase to 31.5 mtpa.
Lack of clarity about growth plans had investors worried, given competitors UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd had been aggressively adding capacities.
That explains the Street’s positive reaction to the expansion plans of ACC and Ambuja Cements. The two stocks have gained 4.8% and 2.6%, respectively, since the capacity expansion news became public.
Although the timeline of commissioning of capacities is not known yet, the worry of capacity overhang is behind these stocks.
“Capacity constraint was a key concern for both ACC and Ambuja. With these expansions, that overhang will be over. Going by ACC’s free cash flow at current levels, from FY2018-2020, the company could generate  ₹ 4,000-4,500 crore. So, internal accruals should be sufficient to fund the capex of  ₹ 3,000 crore. Capital is not a constraint for both these companies,"" said Binod Modi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. 
Since these companies had been abstaining from expanding capacities despite being flush with cash, some investors were worried that their parent firm LafargeHolcim might use these funds for further restructuring, points out another analyst.
He said because there was no plan on how their capital would be deployed, it gave peers UltraTech and Shree Cement an edge over them. On the valuation front, ACC and Ambuja Cements are trading at a discount to their peers.
However, analysts now expect these stocks to rerate and valuations to improve. 
Meanwhile, from the industry’s perspective, these expansions would weigh on the demand-supply scenario, especially in central India. Overall cement demand is yet to catch up with the spree of capacity additions that have happened recently. And that has kept the sector’s utilization levels below 70%. Secondly, higher supply in absence of adequate demand growth, would delay the sector’s price recovery, which is already subdued."

Mumbai: For capital-starved IDBI Bank Ltd, UltraTech Cement Ltd’s winning bid for insolvent Binani Cement Ltd was good news: the cement maker owed it  ₹ 1,600 crore, and UltraTech had promised to repay lenders. But now, the bank must wait.
According to two people familiar with the matter, the way it made the loan—through its Dubai branch to a Binani group company in Belgium—has become a sticking point, with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) sending IDBI Bank a set of questions. Without RBI’s permission, IDBI Bank cannot receive money from UltraTech Cement or remit it to its Dubai branch.
According to the people cited above, who spoke on condition of anonymity, the loan was originally given to 3B-The Fibreglass Co., a Binani group firm in Belgium, but as the loan was guaranteed by Binani Cement, IDBI Bank was allowed to recover its loan through the insolvency process.
“We need RBI permission to remit the money to the Dubai branch where the loan was given in euros,"" the first of the two people cited above said. This person added that the central bank has sent a set of questions to IDBI Bank and the approval of the transaction is contingent upon receiving satisfactory reply from the bank.
The second person quoted above said senior IDBI Bank officials are planning to meet RBI deputy governor B.P. Kanungo to clarify its position on the transfer of funds. “This money would substantially aid our recovery efforts,"" the second person said, adding UltraTech agreed to pay the entire principal of  ₹ 1,600 crore.
In February 2012, Binani Industries Ltd, the holding company of the Binani Group, acquired 3B-The Fibreglass Co. Based in Battice, Belgium, 3B is Europe’s leading manufacturer of fibreglass for reinforcement of thermoplastics and thermoset polymer applications.
Binani Cement is part of the Braj Binani Group and is a unit of Binani Industries Ltd (BIL), which is the holding company of the group, and which has presence in business areas including cement, fibreglass, infrastructure and energy.
The loan recovery is vital for the public sector lender struggling with bad loans of  ₹ 60,875 crore, forming 32% of total loans.
IDBI Bank’s total capital adequacy ratio has, in fact, slipped below the regulatory requirement of 9% and stood at 6.22% as on 30 September 2018. The bank is also on the cusp of a major change as the government gives up its majority stake in the bank to Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC). 
Emails sent to IDBI Bank and the RBI seeking comments remained unanswered till publishing of this story.
Last month, the Supreme Court had upheld an order of the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) approving UltraTech’s revised  ₹ 7,900 crore bid to buy debt-laden Binani Cement.
On 14 November 2018, a two-member bench of NCLAT had dismissed a plea by Rajputana Properties Pvt. Ltd, owned by Dalmia Bharat Ltd, saying its offer for Binani Cement was “discriminatory"" against some financial creditors. The dispute is related to a decision by Binani Cement’s committee of creditors to consider an improved bid from UltraTech Cement after Rajputana Properties’  ₹ 6,930 crore offer was declared the highest, and filed with the Kolkata bench of the bankruptcy court for its approval.
Mint reported on 12 January 2018 that at least two lenders of Binani Cement moved the appellate bankruptcy tribunal after the resolution professional (RP) rejected their claims on corporate guarantees worth  ₹ 2,000 crore issued by the firm to some subsidiaries in the Binani group.
Banks, including IDBI Bank and SBI, had lent money to some companies in the Binani group, after Binani Cement issued corporate guarantees worth  ₹ 2,000 crore for these loans.
In July 2017, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) bench in Kolkata had admitted the insolvency petition against Binani Cement. State-owned lender Bank of Baroda (BoB) had referred the company to the NCLT after it failed to repay around  ₹ 100 crore, following which Vijaykumar V. Iyer of Deloitte India was appointed as the resolution professional."

Brokerage house CLSA downgraded shares of key Indian cement makers on Tuesday because of a muted outlook on price realizations. It has trimmed earnings estimates of large-cap companies under its coverage by around 3-15% for fiscal years 2020 and 2021.
Cement stocks responded to it with a yawn. Shares of large-cap firms such as ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd ended the day’s session largely flat.
Cement prices have remained weak from the past many quarters now. That the much-awaited recovery in pricing has been delayed is not new. Still, these stocks don’t seem too perturbed.
According to analysts, cement makers have been beneficiaries of the general move towards large-cap stocks in the past year. Since mid-caps were badly battered last year, domestic fund managers flocked to park their money in large-cap stocks, in the so-called chase for quality. This has kept the momentum in these stocks going, despite dismal earnings.
The market capitalization of 15 cement makers has risen by around 32% in the past three calendar years, showed an analysis by Mint. This is despite pressure on pricing and earnings. While prices have corrected from their highs a year ago, the fall isn’t commensurate with shortfall in performance, say analysts.
“Cement stocks have traded at high valuations in the past three years on expectation of a revival in demand growth and low capacity additions. The revival in demand growth did not materialise, and owing to announcements for increasing capacity addition, expectations of an upcycle have substantially waned,"" IIFL Institutional Equities said in a report last June. IIFL downgraded its outlook on the sector to negative after remaining positive/neutral for almost seven years.
MNC brokers such as CLSA and Morgan Stanley seem to be catching up with the view, although it remains to be seen when investors also take note.
ALSO READ | The real reason for 28% GST on cement
Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its view on the industry to an “in-line"" rating. “Profitability of Indian cement companies should recover from the recent lows, but the pace will be slower than expected,"" it said in a report on 19 December.
Cement companies have grappled with a variety of challenges, such as subdued demand growth due to the lull in real estate sales, the sand mining ban in some parts of the country and surging input cost pressure.
ALSO READ | The cement industry’s problem of plenty
While input cost inflation is easing and the sand mining issue is out of the way, demand growth is mainly driven by government spending on infrastructure projects. And this has been inadequate to match the ongoing spate of massive capacity additions. As a result, the capacity utilization levels of the industry remain below 70%. All of this is weighing on prices.
Speaking of valuations, large-cap cement stocks are trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 11-22 times. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Now that the MNC brokers have joined the chorus of downgrades, perhaps the strength of some cement stocks may get tested."

23,2019-01-25,UltraTech,"A number of brokerage firms recently downgraded the sector due to concerns on pricingUltraTech’s stand-alone operating margin shrunk 121 basis points on a year-on-year basis to 15.8%

Elevated input costs eroded margins of UltraTech Cement Ltd even in the December quarter. The pan-India focused company’s stand-alone operating margin shrunk 121 basis points on a year-on-year basis to 15.8%. A basis point is 0.01%
Increased diesel prices pushed logistics cost higher by 4% year-on-year to  ₹1,169/tonne. A rise in the prices of petcoke during the quarter along with a depreciating rupee led to energy costs rising 16% as well. Petcoke, which is crude oil derivative, is a key input for cement producers. UltraTech meets 35% of its petcoke requirement via imports. Further, raw materials costs rose 3% owing to increased additive prices.
Not just UltraTech, but the whole sector has been battling cost pressures for some time now. What makes the situation worse is the lack of pricing power alongside.
Thankfully, crude oil prices are now easing. In a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Atul Daga, UltraTech’s chief executive, said that there is some relief on the cost front. Diesel and petcoke prices have corrected and would reduce the company’s overall costs, which would start reflecting from the March quarter onwards.
Life would have been simpler for investors in cement stocks if a timeline for price recovery would be known as well. But as Daga said, it would require a magic wand or crystal ball to know when prices will start improving.
The pricing environment for the sector remains challenging as average cement prices dropped nearly 1-2% compared to the preceding quarter, according to the company’s investor presentation. North and central India witnessed marginal improvement, whereas prices in the rest of the markets declined.
High competitive intensity in the sector has kept supply higher than demand, resulting in low utilization levels. The industry’s current capacity utilization of around 70% is not good-enough for natural pricing improvement. In the past, cement companies did well on profitability when capacity utilization was above 85%, said Daga. However, cement prices have been hiked in the northern and southern markets in January.
But sustenance is the key here. Note that a number of brokerage firms recently downgraded the sector due to concerns on pricing. It has been witnessed in the past that cement companies had to roll back prices due to subdued demand. The same is feared this time as well.
A key concern on the demand front is the forthcoming general election, said Daga. Usually, the fourth and first quarters are seasonally strong for the sector. But due to the election model code, which restricts the incumbent government from massively spending on infrastructure and related activities, Daga expects demand in the April-June quarter to be subdued. However, for the full fiscal year 2020, he foresees 7-8% cement demand growth.
Meanwhile, UltraTech’s cement volume grew 13% year-on-year to 17.9 million tonnes, in line with expectations. However, profit growth missed analysts’ estimates due to rising costs and weak realization growth.
In reaction to this, the UltraTech stock declined nearly 2% intraday on the National Stock Exchange on Thursday and ended the day’s session in the red. The stock is trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda multiple of 15 times, making it the second-most expensive cement stock. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Analysts are also concerned about the sector’s valuations, which they find uncomforting given the pressure on realizations and profits."
22,2019-02-07,UltraTech,"The key upside trigger for shares of all cement firms remains a significant revival in their pricesGiven the recent trends in cement prices across India, a sharp recovery still looks some time away

It is said that money saved is money earned. ACC Ltd appears to be living by this maxim. Despite cost headwinds, the cement producer’s key operating expenses on power, fuel and freight did not escalate in the December quarter. In fact, as the alongside chart shows, the company has achieved higher cost-efficiencies on these fronts compared to its peers. Even though the unexpected spike in raw material price did dent ACC’s operating margin growth, its efforts to limit cost increases were a positive.
But considering most cement makers are exploring options to optimize costs, getting a better handle on expenditure is not unique to the company. This also means that improvement on the cost front will not be enough for ACC to shine among peers.
The key upside trigger for shares of all cement firms remains a significant revival in their prices. Given the recent trends in cement prices across India, a sharp recovery still looks some time away.
In the case of ACC, volume growth has to catch up, too. Its domestic cement sales volumes in the December quarter grew 8.4% on a year-on-year basis to 7.5 million tonnes. While this was better-than the Street’s expectations, it still compares poorly with the double-digit growth reported by other large cement makers in the same quarter.
To be sure, ACC’s recently announced expansion plans in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand improve growth visibility as existing plants are already running at about 85% capacity utilization levels.
Since these plants are likely to be commissioned by fiscal 2022, volume growth expectations are muted until then, say analysts.
So, the company is expected to underperform the industry on volume growth in the near term. Until the expansions yield results, the ACC stock may continue to lag peers on valuations.
On an EV/Ebitda basis, shares of ACC are trading at 9.8 times, which is a steep discount compared to 17 times and 20 times of UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd, respectively. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization."
21,2019-02-22,UltraTech,"Ambuja Cements' sales volume grew 4.4% y-o-y in the Dec quarter, much lower than peers' 8-10% volume growthNew capacities are likely to be commissioned only by 2020-end, capping sharp improvement in volumes until then

Some cement producers are relying on volume growth to drive earnings. Some others are sincerely hoping that recent cement price hikes will sustain, and will aid realizations. But Ambuja Cements Ltd doesn’t belong to either of these camps.
In the wake of capacity constraints, Ambuja Cements’ sales volumes grew 4.4% in the December quarter compared to the year-ago period. This is much lower than other pan-India cement makers who saw 8-10% volume growth. To be sure, the company’s plan to add capacities in Rajasthan should address this concern. But new capacities are likely to be commissioned only by the end of 2020, capping sharp improvement in volumes until then.
Secondly, Ambuja Cements has no presence in South India, where cement prices have been recently raised. So, investors shouldn’t expect much on the realizations front as well. The company has a large presence in the northern and western parts of the country, and dealer channel checks indicate that prices had declined by 1-3% sequentially during the quarter in these geographies.
Cement prices are expected to remain subdued in the run-up to the general election. Consequently, analysts have cut realization growth estimates for 2019 from 4-5% to 1-1.5%. Ambuja Cements follows a January-December fiscal year.
In short, the outlook on volumes and realizations for the company is muted. So, increased focus on cost optimization is the only feasible alternative that could aid its operating performance in the near term.
As the chart above shows, Ambuja Cements’ cost per tonne has been on the rise. Even though competitors—including UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd—have seen a rise in energy and freight costs, they are better placed compared to Ambuja Cements on volumes growth. ACC Ltd has managed costs more efficiently than the above-mentioned peers.
No wonder then that the Ambuja Cements stock is the cheapest among large-cap cement companies. The stock trades at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 7.8 times. EV stands for enterprise value, and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Not many analysts are bullish on this sector due to the prolonged absence of price recovery. Still, if one has to choose from blue-chip cement companies, then Ambuja seems to be the least preferred."
20,2019-03-12,UltraTech,"Companies are complaining about the endless host of litigation that they face under IBC codeOperational creditors, who are unhappy with the settlements, often stall the insolvency process

Mumbai: Now that two years have passed since the first major acquisitions under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), several players—buyers, investment bankers and dissatisfied creditors—are slowly opening up about what they see as chinks in India's bankruptcy law.
These include repeated litigation—both during and after the process—missing physical assets in plants, the lack of judges and questions over the integrity of promoters of distressed businesses and resolution professionals.
The cracks in the resolution process are evident from the following developments:
■ After acquisition of Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel Ltd in September 2018, operational creditor Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) and unsecured creditor IFCI Ltd have challenged the resolution plan.
■ The bidders for Amtek Auto and its unit Metalyst Forgings—London-based Liberty House and US-based hedge fund Deccan Value Investors, respectively—are challenging the information provided to them by the resolution professional during the bidding process. While Deccan Value Investors has asked NCLT to cancel its resolution plan, Liberty house has alleged in court that the contents of a forensic audit conducted by EY into Amtek Auto were not revealed to it.
“Often, resolution professionals are ill-equipped to fully oversee operations at companies. In other cases, there are serious integrity issues among resolution professionals and promoters,"" an investment banker said on condition of anonymity. “We know of cases where equipment has been stolen from plants during the resolution process. In some cases, promoters litigate to draw out the resolution process while we hear of money being siphoned away from the company during this period."" 
Mahesh Singh, founder and managing director, Singhi Advisors, said sometimes assets do go missing at the time of closure of the deal. “Buyers should get a chance to do the closing due diligence. Even so, there are legal remedies for when assets are missing because there is always a lag between selling a business and finally getting possession.""
Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej said: “The bankruptcy code has been very poorly implemented because there have been so many cases of bankruptcy which have not been finalized. We allow them to go from one court to another and then we give them stay order. Our judicial process is very slow. “It (IBC) is not being implemented as well as it could have been. That is not perhaps for lack of trying but it is also our legal system and legislation.""
JSW Steel's joint managing director, M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao said in a recent interview: “Under IBC, once a case in admitted, whatever cases are pending against a company, there is a moratorium on them. But once the resolution plan is approved, all of these spring up again. We are seeing this in several forums, in all companies that have been acquired, not just ours. I think some clarity is required here so winning bidders feel more comfortable that once the settlement is paid, everything else is extinguished.""
The major acquisitions under IBC were those of Bhushan Steel by Tata Steel Ltd; Binani Cement Ltd by UltraTech Cement Ltd; and Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel-AION Capital.
Kalpesh Kikani, managing director and senior partner, AION Capital, said at the Mint Investment Summit in Mumbai on 1 March: “First, the challenge is getting to know what the true price for the asset is. Step 2 is who gets how much among various financial creditors, be it secured, unsecured, secured with guarantee, unsecured with guarantee, and then you have some operational creditors who believe they are equal to financial creditors and others who believe they are better than financial creditors in terms of supplying (goods to a company even during distress). This Stage 2 of who gets how much is an integral part of IBC and will be the subject matter of litigation—and as a bidder this is something we always factor into our bids."""
19,2019-04-04,UltraTech,"Over the past three months, nearly 7.5 million houses have been completed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)While this may benefit UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement, it is not enough to move the needle on overall cement demand in India

A review of the government’s flagship scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, or Housing for All, shows mixed results. In fiscal year 2019, while the progress in rural India was fairly good, construction of homes in urban regions continued to lag.
Houses completed under the PMAY urban scheme stood at 1.9 million at the end of the March quarter, rising sharply from 1.26 million at the end of the December quarter, analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a report on 1 April. Despite that, the government has been able to achieve just about 75% of the target.
Over the past three months, nearly 7.5 million houses have been completed under the PMAY. This seems impressive and should benefit central- and eastern-focused cement producers such as UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd.
But it is not enough to move the needle on overall cement demand in India. According to analysts, there are various estimates of incremental cement demand arising from this scheme. But even if one considers that the scheme has achieved more than 80% success, it won’t be sufficient to absorb the large supply that is available.
Secondly, housing demand—apart from the constructions under the PMAY scheme—remains subdued. Concerns over stress in rural India and a potential consumption slowdown could act as dampeners.
With a contribution of more than 60%, the housing sector is among the key drivers of overall cement demand. This is followed by infrastructure and commercial property.
“As per DIPP data, industry volumes increased by 11% year-on-year to 30 million tonnes in January 2019—we note that strong volume growth was despite a high base. Management narratives indicate strong demand from the infrastructure sector even though demand from the trade segment is relatively subdued,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 27 March. DIPP is now department for promotion of industry and internal trade.
In short, given the inadequate demand growth, cement industry’s capacity utilization levels are unlikely to improve from the current 70% levels. As such, cement prices and profitability may remain under check."
18,2019-04-16,UltraTech,"The to and fro on cement prices restricts clarity regarding better long-term realizations for cement firmsIt remains to be seen if govt-led infrastructure demand can compensate for overall housing demand

Mumbai: The good news for cement makers is savings from lower input costs, which would show from the March quarter. 
Imported petroleum coke (petcoke) prices declined by around 20% from the recent peak in August 2018. Similarly, domestic petcoke and international coal prices have eased.
As a result, power and fuel cost would soften by  ₹17.10 a tonne sequentially, according to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. Year-on-year, savings for cement companies would be about  ₹54.50 per tonne, it said in a note on 15 April.
But the good news ends there. 
A larger concern is whether the revival in cement prices will persist.
As feared, the steep cement price hikes announced in early March failed to take hold in most parts of the country. Inadequate demand growth was no match for excess capacity and weighed on prices. Dealer channel checks by Kotak Institutional Equities showed cement prices dipped in many regions, barring the south and the east.
In March, all-India cement prices averaged  ₹334/bag. One cement bag weighs 50kg.
Still, cement companies continue to drive price increases in certain pockets. Media reports state that cement prices were hiked in some metros by  ₹25-30/bag in April as rural cement demand picked up. For now, realizations for cement companies may rise by 2-3% quarter-on-quarter, especially for south-exposed companies, said analysts.
But this to and fro on cement prices restricts clarity regarding better long-term realizations. Also, it remains to be seen if this government-led infrastructure demand can compensate for overall housing demand, they added.
Hopes aren’t too high, though. As pointed out recently, the mammoth Housing for All scheme has not been able to significantly absorb the excess capacity. And, unless the sector’s capacity utilization improves, a marked rise in profitability would be capped. In short, investors expecting blockbuster earnings from cement companies would be in for a disappointment.
Despite that, large-cap cement stocks continue to quote at multiples of 14-16 times one-year-forward EV/Ebitda. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In the present context, these valuations appear rich and should now soften."

After struggling for most part of the session, Indian markets ended sharply higher today, led by a late rebound. Strong earnings from UltraTech Cement helped lift the sentiment. The Sensex rose 490 points to 39,054 while Nifty settled at 11,726, up 1.5%. A slide in oil prices also helped to ease investor concerns. Higher crude prices had put pressure on domestic share markets and the rupee in recent days. Oil pulled back from a six-month high as an industry report signaling a gain in US crude inventories partly offset concerns over US measures to halt Iranian exports.

1) ""After three consecutive days of decline, the bulls staged a smart comeback as the Indian benchmark indices ended with strong gains of led by supportive global cues,"" said Jayant Manglik, president of retail distribution at Religare Broking.
2) Manglik expect markets to remain volatile in the near term due to election uncertainty and earnings outcome. The price of crude and would be closely monitored along with currency movement, he added.
3) The rupee came close to breaching the 70 level against US dollar, falling to 69.98 at day's low before pulling back.
4) UltraTech Cement shares surged over 5% to  ₹4,435. The cement maker reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹1,014 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31. Shares of other cement companies like India Cements and Ramco Cements also settled higher.
5) However, another cement maker ACC fell 3%. ACC had announced earnings on Tuesday, disappointing investors with poor realisations growth. (Read: Why the ACC stock is reacting negatively to Q4 results)
6) Banking stocks rebounded today. Nifty Bank index rose 1.3%, with SBI, Yes Bank, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank and PNB among top gainers.
7) Reliance Industries, which rose 2%, led gains in energy stocks. Oil marketing companies BPCL, HPCL and Indian Oil surged today after struggling in the past few sessions amid elevated global oil prices.
9) Indiabulls Real Estate surged 10% to  ₹115 after the company decided to sell its London property for  ₹1800 crore to promoters. Post this transaction, Net debt of the Company would be below  ₹3,000 crore.
10) The broader markets under-performed but the BSE midcap and smallcap indices still rose around 0.40% each.
10) The global cues were mostly positive with Wall Street overnight hitting record highs. Asian markets ended mixed today while European markets were flat.  (With Agency Inputs)

NEW DELHI :
Aditya Birla Group firm UltraTech Cement on Wednesday reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹1,014.19 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31.
The company had posted a net profit of  ₹446.13 crore in the January-March quarter a year ago, UltraTech Cement said in a BSE filing.
The company's total income stood at  ₹11,031.27 crore during the quarter under review. It was  ₹9,401.39 crore in the corresponding period previous fiscal.
Meanwhile, UltraTech informed that its result for the quarter and the financial year ended March 31, ""are not comparable with the previous period"" due to merger of Binani Cements into the company, which has now been named as UltraTech Nathdwara Cements.

15,2019-04-25,UltraTech,"The positives accruing from UltraTech Q4 results have been factored in its valuation, limiting a meaning upside from current levelsUnless cement prices rise meaningfully and hold ground, valuations of most cement stocks, including UltraTech, look expensive

Mumbai: Ahead of its Q4 results announcement on Wednesday, the UltraTech Cement Ltd stock was in the red. Clearly, after peer ACC Ltd’s disappointing earnings, the Street was fearing a repeat. But on the contrary, UltraTech posted decent quarterly results.
In fact, it has surpassed analysts’ estimates on most counts. Standalone net profit more than doubled to  ₹1,017 crore in the March quarter (Q4). Bloomberg’s consensus net profit estimate was at  ₹769.90 crore. Aided by robust domestic sales, its overall cement volumes grew 15% year-on-year to 21.3 million tonnes.
Unlike ACC, UltraTech’s operating margins improved by more than 100 basis points year-on-year to 21%. This was on the back of a sharp reduction in freight costs and other operating expenses. UltraTech said it saw complete benefits of the revised axle load norms in the March quarter, which helped lower freight costs.
While fuel cost was flat sequentially, but remained high annually, the recent softening of petroleum coke and coal prices are expected to aid margins, going ahead.
In the case of ACC, lower supply of linkage coal and an increased mix of domestic petroleum coke pushed costs higher. Its operating margins missed estimates.
Another disappointment was ACC’s lower-than-industry cement sales volume growth. No wonder then that ACC trades at a much lower valuation than most of its large peers.
Meanwhile, improved performance of acquired assets from Binani Cement Ltd and Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (Jaypee Cement)—which translated into better overall capacity utilization levels—was another positive for UltraTech.
Further, the company is in the process of selling non-core assets acquired in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and China. The sale proceeds of these are said to be used to deleverage the balance sheet.
Rewarded for stellar Q4 results, UltraTech shares surged nearly 6% intraday on NSE, ending the day 4.68% higher at  ₹4,394.65. But before one gets carried away by this near-term spurt, a look at the stock’s valuations is a must.
The UltraTech stock is trading at a rich one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 16 times. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. It is the second most expensive pan-India focused cement stock after Shree Cement Ltd. As per analysts, most of these positives have largely been factored in, limiting a meaningful upside from the current levels.
Had cement prices been on a firm footing, these valuations would have seemed justified. But as witnessed lately, cement price hikes in most regions have failed to sustain. Although several media reports say that prices were increased again in April, it remains to be seen if these hikes sustain.
Unless cement prices increase meaningfully and hold ground, valuations of most cement stocks, including UltraTech, look expensive."
14,2019-05-02,UltraTech,"It is already known that Ambuja’s medium-term growth is constrained by capacity expansion, the completion of which is still some quarters awayEV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization

ACC Ltd’s dismal March quarter results perhaps set the tone of expectations from Ambuja Cements Ltd, both controlled by Lafarge Holcim Ltd. The Ambuja Cement stock traded in the red ahead of its earnings on Tuesday, mirroring the Street’s nervousness.
Ambuja, as feared, disappointed on most counts. Cement volumes grew 2.4% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 6.37 million tonnes for the quarter ending March 2019. This is nearly 50% lower than analysts’ 4-5% growth expectation. Though ACC’s 5% cement volume growth too was lower than estimates, it was well ahead of Ambuja’s. On the other side of the competition, Ultratech Cements Ltd outshone both these all-India cement makers with a 15% annual cement volume growth.
Growth in Ambuja’s realization was muted because of subdued cement prices in the key markets of the northern and western regions. Standalone net profit came in at  ₹427 crore, beating Bloomberg’s analysts’ consensus estimate of  ₹343.70 crore.
However, there’s a catch here as well. Analysts at IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd said, “The company reported higher other income of  ₹240 crore, up 374% y-o-y as it accounted for  ₹132 cr dividend from ACC in the quarter. Moreover, there was a one-off tax provision reversal of  ₹51.58 crore. Adjusted for this, profit after tax at  ₹240 crore would have declined 10.4% y-o-y.""
Operating costs eased sequentially but were higher than the previous year. Also, ACC and Ultratech Cements have kept a better handle on costs. For instance, Ambuja’s power and fuel costs surged higher annually in the March quarter, while others reported a reduction.
It is already known that Ambuja’s medium-term growth is constrained by capacity expansion, the completion of which is still some quarters away. Therefore, improvement in earnings outlook depends on cost stabilization and an upswing in cement prices.
Petroleum coke and coal prices have started to ease, but the reduction seen in Ambuja’s operating expenses isn’t enough to beat the competition. Besides, analysts expect only marginal cost savings benefit from Ambuja’s master supply agreement with ACC. As for cement prices, while companies have struggled to keep prices up, the higher prices have failed to persist.
Despite these factors, surprisingly, shares of Ambuja trade at EV/Ebitda of 16 times for fiscal year 2020.
EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization.
This valuation is higher than ACC’s EV/Ebitda of 11 times and Ultratech’s 15 times. After Ambuja’s disappointing earnings performance, this premium is unwarranted, and valuations should now shrink."
13,2019-05-28,UltraTech,"Better-than-expected March quarter earnings by companies are driving the rallyAccording to companies, input costs are likely to remain stable in the near term

A clutch of cement stocks touched their 52-week highs in the last two trading sessions. Stocks of large cement firms ACC Ltd, UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd, besides mid-caps like JKCement Ltd, JK Lakshmi Cement Ltd and Ramco Cements Ltd, made considerable gains.
A combination of factors is driving the Street’s sentiments towards these stocks. One, some firms have reported better-than-expected March quarter earnings. While capacity expansions aided volumes, softening input costs provided some relief to operating expenses. Managements of cement producers indicated that input costs should remain stable in the near term.
Two, the election is over. Given the lull in the real estate sector, spending on infrastructure and allied-activities have been the only support to cement demand in the recent past. Demand had weakened in the run-up to the general elections due to a combination of factors. Cement prices have increased, government projects have slowed down, and there was a shortage of labour and water in select states.
The hope is that the government’s increased thrust on infrastructure spending will revive cement demand. However, for the Street’s optimism to last, demand push won’t be enough. There has to be a meaningful improvement in cement prices.
A cement dealer channel check by Kotak Institutional Equities showed that price hikes, which started in the south in February, have become more broad-based now. All-India cement prices have risen from  ₹359 per bag, which weighs 50kg, in April to  ₹367 in May. Prices in the March quarter stood at  ₹328 per bag. That said, the survey also showed that demand has been stagnant in most regions in the current quarter so far.
Similarly, a sentiment survey of 250 entities across the construction value chain conducted by Crisil Research Ltd painted a grim picture of near-term cement demand.
“Pan-India cement demand shall post muted 3-5% growth in the current quarter-Q1FY20 with the states in East (Bihar, Odisha) and South (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu) moving at a snail’s pace of 2-4%. Northern and central states shall limit the fall by posting 6-8% growth in the ongoing quarter driven by institutional demand from roads, Metro, and affordable-housing. Further on the western side, while Maharashtra shall continue its healthy growth momentum in wake of upcoming state elections; Gujarat shall be laggard,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director at Crisil Research.
There is no harm in hoping that cement demand would pick up in the quarters to come. But existing capacity is quite large and demand growth has to be substantial to absorb it. Moreover, it needs to be accompanied by price hikes, which is doubtful for now because the June quarter is a seasonally weak one for the sector. Unless that happens, operating margins may not improve enough to justify the sector’s valuations."

In 2017, Ultratech Cement acquired part of JP Associates’ cement business and Temasek is looking to buy a stake of up to 20 per cent in Wonder Cement, though the talks are yet to be concluded, reported ET . KKR had also been interested in cement business as it bought Dalmia Cements and and sold it in 2017 at a 150 per cent return in less than two years. KKR has also invested in south India-based Bhavya Cements through a structured credit deal. Read more

Coca-Cola looks to buy stake in Café Coffee Day
Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola may buy a significant stake in Café Coffee Day (CCD) as it looks to increase its footprint in the fast-growing café business in India, The Economic Times reported citing executives with knowledge of the matter. The move would also help the firm diversify and hedge risks associated with its core carbonated drinks business, which has been slowing down over the past few years. While the talks are still at a nascent stage, a potential stake acquisition may be driven by Coca-Cola’s Atlanta headquarters as both managements are already engaged in engaged in talks. Promoted by VG Siddhartha, the country’s largest coffee chain is owned by Coffee Day Global, a subsidiary of Coffee Day Enterprises. With a footprint of 1,752 cafés as of March, CCD competes with Starbucks and smaller chains such as Barista and Costa Coffee, and has not been able to expand much over the past two years due to its rising debt.

""This transaction gives us an opportunity to strengthen our presence in the highly fragmented, but competitive and fast growing Eastern and Central markets. It will also extend our footprint in the Western and Southern markets,"" Birla said.
Century's cement business consists of three integrated units in MP, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra and a grinding unit in Bengal.
He further said once the transfer of the mining leases gets completed, the financials will be recast to give effect to the necessary changes.
During FY19, the company had completed acquisition of Binani Cement, which was subsequently renamed Ultratech Nathdwara Cement, which has a 6.25-mt capacity in Rajasthan, and operates plants in China and the UAE.

8,2019-08-09,UltraTech,"Cement sales volume increased by merely 2% year-on-year to 17.86 million tonnesImprovement in margin was primarily driven by higher price realizations

Mumbai: The key positive highlight of UltraTech Cement Ltd’s June quarter earnings is the sharp improvement in operating margin. Cast your eyes on the chart alongside. Ebitda margin surged 26%, exceeding analysts’ estimate of 23-24%.
Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and is a key measure of profitability.
This improvement in margin was primarily driven by higher price realizations. “Cement realisation/tonne witnessed sharp uptick by 13.5% YoY and 12% QoQ at  ₹5,037 (which seems to be the highest compared to peers reported so far),"" said analysts from Reliance Securities Ltd. Softening input costs also supported operating performance.
Unfortunately, the margin performance wasn’t enough for investors to shift focus from the company’s weak volume growth. Cement sales volume increased by merely 2% year-on-year to 17.86 million tonnes (mt), much lower than the anticipated 18.5 mt.
In its investor presentation, UltraTech Cement indicated that the cement industry’s volumes declined by 3-4% during the June quarter. At the same time, industry’s capacity utilization was at 67%, suggesting demand was rather tepid.
In a post-earnings conference call with analysts, the management said that cement demand was impacted by general election code of conduct, but is likely to improve in the second half of the year. The company foresees 6% growth in cement demand for the industry in fiscal year 2020.
As far as prices are concerned, the management said the June exit price was 3% lower than the average price seen earlier in the month and the demand-supply dynamics would play on prices, hereon. The benefits of the decline in the price of petroleum coke, a key input, will be seen in the quarters ahead, it added.
Going ahead, UltraTech Cement’s focus remains on deleveraging and consolidation of sister firm Century Textiles’ cement assets.
Meanwhile, improved performance of the acquired assets from Binani Cement Ltd and Jaiprakash Associates Ltd (Jaypee Cement), besides sequential reduction in debt were some other positives. But the sour point for the market remained poor volume growth.
Reacting to its earnings, the UltraTech Cement stock swung from the green to red, closing over 2% lower to  ₹4,233.15 on Thursday. Nonetheless, it was the second-most expensive pan-India-focused cement stock after Shree Cement Ltd, trading at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 15 times. EV stands for enterprise value.
To be sure, analysts have cautioned of some more downside in the UltraTech Cement stock given that September is a seasonally weak quarter for the sector.
The lull in demand, especially from the housing sector, continues to weigh on cement prices. This does not bode well. Cement prices across the country corrected further in July and are likely to remain on a weak footing, at least for now."
7,2019-09-25,UltraTech,"The brokerage has rebalanced its 'quality list' of stocks againSome other stocks included in this list include Britannia Industries, UltraTech Cement, GAIL, Hero MotoCorp and Repco Home Finance

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits"" for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt.
The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list"" of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries Ltd. to smaller names including Manappuram Finance Ltd., Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.
“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,"" he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.""
India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.
Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9% while small cap names gained 7%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3% in the last three sessions.
The gains show that the “first round impact"" of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.
Here are the key insights from the report
-Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6% above Tuesday’s close
-Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75% of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment
-Quality list additions: Britannia Industries, UltraTech Cement, GAIL, Hero MotoCorp, AU Small Finance Bank, Nestle India, Manappuram Finance, Repco Home Finance, Symphony, Power Grid, GlaxoSmithkline Consumer

6,2019-10-22,UltraTech,"Ultratech’s volume growth disappointed in the September quarter like most peersInput prices eased but rising other expenses pushed operating cost per tonne higher

Dismal volume growth was a key disappointment in UltraTech Cement Ltd’s September quarter earnings. Given the seasonal weakness, analysts were anticipating only a modest growth of 2-3% in sales volumes. But the company missed these low estimates as well.
At 17.77 million tonnes, its cement sales volumes fell by 2% on a year-on-year basis, mainly impacted by the heavy and extended monsoon. ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd too saw their sales volumes decline in the September quarter. However, an exception to this trend among large-cap cement makers was Shree Cement Ltd, whose volumes registered an increase.
Although UltraTech Cement’s consolidated net profit increased more than 60% year-on-year to  ₹579 crore, it missed the  ₹716.7 crore consensus estimate of analysts polled by Bloomberg. Considering the ongoing seasonal price correction across the country, as anticipated, the firm’s realizations declined sequentially, but grew annually. Its consolidated revenue growth on a year-on-year basis was also aided by higher sale of premium products. According to the company’s investor presentation, premium products contributed 10% to trade sales volume.
On the cost front, even though prices of raw materials and freight eased, low utilization levels, along with higher other expenses, pushed UltraTech Cement’s operating cost per tonne higher. Annual maintenance undertaken during the quarter resulted in variable costs increasing 3% compared to the previous quarter, the company said in a press release. The number of kilns shut down in the September quarter were 14 versus 10 in the June quarter, according to its investor presentation.
In short, the fact that even a market leader like UltraTech Cement isn’t immune to demand slump won’t go down well with investors. Poor earnings coupled with dim hopes of an instant demand revival, would weigh on the near-term stock performance and valuations. At a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 13 times, UltraTech Cement is the second-most expensive Indian cement stock. EV stands for enterprise value, and Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.
Meanwhile, so far this calendar year, the stock has given returns of around 8%. Most of its peers have posted more or less similar returns. Analysts say apart from improvement in demand, meaningful upside in the stock would also depend on balance-sheet deleveraging.
It is already known that UltraTech Cement has been very aggressive on acquisitions in the recent past, keeping its debt elevated. However, the company has said that it is in the process of selling its non-core assets acquired in China and the United Arab Emirates. Sale proceeds will be used to deleverage the balance sheet. Post the Century Cement merger, the company’s net debt/Ebitda ratio stood at 2 times at the end of the September quarter. UltraTech Cement targets to bring it down to less than 2 times by March 2020, according to its investor presentation."

Adani seeks extension of deadline to buy Bidvest stake in Mumbai airport
Adani Properties wants the deadline for closing its proposed acquisition of Bidvest’s stake in GVK-controlled Mumbai International Airport to be extended by three months to February 2020, The Economic Times reported. The company is willing to deposit the entire amount in a no-lien bank account if the transaction deadline is postponed to February 7 from November 7, Darius Khambata, senior counsel for Adani Properties, said in the Bombay high court on Tuesday. Bidvest agreed in April to sell its stake to Adani Properties by September 30 for  ₹1,235 crore. Adani Properties approached the court to restrain Bidvest from selling its stake to any other party. GVK had exercised its right of first refusal to buy Bidvest’s holding. The Gautam Adani-controlled company is also seeking the court’s intervention to appoint Bidvest as the ‘constructive trustee’ to make sure that GVK and the AAI abide by the right of first refusal to sell their stakes to them. After GVK delayed its payment, Bidvest approached the Delhi HC and was allowed to move an arbitration tribunal, which gave GVK until October-end to make the payment.

Shree Cement Ltd, India’s third largest cement maker, is at an advanced stage of raising more than  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, two people aware of the development said.
“The money will be used for capex and debt reduction. They have been meeting investors for this purpose and are targeting to close this fundraise within this quarter,"" said one of the two people cited above. “They could raise anywhere between  ₹2000- ₹3000 crore depending on demand from investors.""
Shree Cement has hired JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to manage the QIP, the people said, requesting anonymity. QIP is a tool, through which listed companies can sell shares, debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
While e-mails written to Shree Cement and JM Financial remained unanswered, ICICI Securities declined to comment on the matter.
Cement producers in the country have been hit by a prolonged monsoon season and falling cement prices amid an ongoing demand slump. While other large cement producers such as UltraTech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd saw their sales volume decline in the September quarter, Shree Cement was an exception.
In the quarter ended 30 September, the Rajasthan-based cement maker’s sales volume grew marginally at 1.5% to 5.72 million tonnes and net realizations rose 9% to  ₹4,654 per tonne from a year earlier. The company’s profit also rose over five times to  ₹309 crore, compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal.
On 19 October, the company’s board had said that it planned to raise as much as  ₹3,000 crore equity, in one or more tranches, through QIPs. It planned to use these funds for inorganic growth opportunities that may come up over the next 12-18 months, according to a 22 October note by HDFC Securities.
“Markets have done well recently and we have seen a few QIPs getting closed with Bajaj Finance raising almost $1.2 billion. In this environment, companies are eager to re-look at equity deals and we may see some more QIPs hitting the market,"" said the first person.
As of October, five companies have raised  ₹17,930 crore via QIPs, exceeding the  ₹10,489 crore raised by 13 firms in the entire fiscal year 2018, according to primary market tracker Prime Database.
Recently, consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd mopped up  ₹8,500 crore through private placements to qualified institutional investors. Subscribed over five times its size, the QIP got interest from foreign institutional investors including BlackRock, Nomura and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.
In September, private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest QIP from domestic institutions and large foreign investors, including GIC, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Nomura and American investors T Rowe Price and BlackRock.

2,2019-12-23,UltraTech,"UltraTech has offered Kolkata-based firm  ₹6,500-7,000 cr in all-cash dealThe acquisition of Emami Cement would help UltraTech strengthen its position in east India

Mumbai: UltraTech Cement Ltd, India’s largest producer of the building material, has emerged as the front-runner to buy the cement business of Emami Group in an all-cash deal worth  ₹6,500-7,000 crore, according to three people with direct knowledge of the discussions.
The sale of Emami Cement Ltd has entered the final binding bid round, with Ambuja Cements Ltd, part of the LafargeHolcim Group, as the only other contender, the people said on condition of anonymity. Ambuja’s offer is less than that of Aditya Birla Group-owned UltraTech, they said without disclosing the value of the bid.
“UltraTech is most likely to win the bid, especially considering their keenness to expand in the east and the offer price made. The final binding bid round is likely to end next week,"" said one the two people.
The purchase of Emami Cement will help UltraTech make deeper inroads into eastern India and further consolidate its leadership of the domestic market.
“Both UltraTech and Ambuja’s offers are currently undergoing final due diligence by the banker and adviser. UltraTech intends to monopolize the market in the central-east, east and the far-east geography, where Emami owns most of its cement manufacturing units,"" said the second person cited earlier.
Kolkata-based Emami has hired Credit Suisse as the investment banker and Arpwood Capital as the deal adviser.
Credit Suisse and Arpwood declined to comment, while emailed queries to Emami, UltraTech and Ambuja did not elicit a response.
Emami Cement has a total capacity of around 8 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) across three operational cement plants in eastern and central India, while UltraTech has a capacity of over 117 mtpa.
“Given the concentration of Emami Cement’s business and its capacity, it may get a fair value of $105-110, which, along with a 10% premium for the eastern zone monopoly, could go up to a maximum of around $120 per tonne, which translates to a valuation of  ₹6,800 -7,000 crore,"" said the third person cited earlier.
UltraTech has been acquiring cement assets over the past few years to enhance its reach in tier II and tier III locations. It has been particularly keen on the eastern zone.
On 21 October, the board of UltraTech approved the expansion of grinding capacities by 0.6mtpa each in Bihar and West Bengal and to open a grinding unit of 2.2mtpa in Odisha. Following this, UltraTech said it had plans to invest  ₹940 crore to increase the production of premium products for strengthening its position in eastern India.
All plants will be commissioned by the first quarter of 2021.
UltraTech recently completed the acquisition of Century Textile’s cement business, with the scheme of demerger becoming effective from 1 October.
UltraTech Cement acquired Rajasthan-based Binani Cement in November 2018 in a  ₹7,950 crore deal through the bankruptcy resolution process. In June 2017, UltraTech acquired 21.2mtpa cement capacity from Jaiprakash Associates.
UltraTech Cement has 23 integrated plants, a clinker plant, 27 grinding units and seven bulk terminals, after the Century transaction. Its operations span India, the UAE, Bahrain, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. For fiscal 2019, UltraTech recorded revenue of  ₹35,703.50 crore.
Emami Group has been looking to monetize its cement business, primarily to repay the group’s debts and reduce share pledges by promoters.
Apart from cement plants, Emami has mining leases in Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh. Some of Emami’s projects are under construction.
Emami’s key cement production units include a 2.5mtpa plant at Risda, Chhattisgarh, and another 2.5mtpa plant in Panagarh, West Bengal. Emami has a production unit in Odisha’s Jajpur district that is yet to be commissioned. The company is carrying out a brownfield expansion at its plant in Bhabua in Bihar to raise capacity to 3mtpa from 1.8mtpa now.
Emami Cement had a total debt of  ₹2,246.76 crore as on 31 March 2018, consisting of  ₹2,093.86 crore as secured term loan from banks and financial institutions and  ₹152.90 crore working capital borrowings from banks.
In June, Emami Group promoters sold a 10% stake in Emami Ltd for  ₹1,230 crore to reduce debt at the promoter level. Post the repayment, promoter pledge has fallen to around 37% in Emami, which had once shot up to over 50% due to a steady correction in the stock price. The debt was taken in their personal capacity to fund group firms.
Post the stake sale, the total promoter stake in Emami is 52.74%.
Emami Group had earlier planned to raise funds through an initial share sale of Emami Cement. It had even filed a draft prospectus in October 2018. However, that got delayed."
