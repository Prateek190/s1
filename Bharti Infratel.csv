67,2018-02-21,Bharti Infratel,"The move comes after HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius), a minority shareholder in Reliance Infratel, approached NCLT seeking redress

Mumbai: Reliance Infratel Ltd, the telecom tower arm of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), has agreed to share details of a deal to sell its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a firm controlled by elder brother Mukesh Ambani, after minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd approached the National Company Law Tribunal seeking redress.  
Mumbai: Reliance Infratel Ltd, the telecom tower arm of Anil Ambani’s Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), has agreed to share details of a deal to sell its assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a firm controlled by elder brother Mukesh Ambani, after minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd approached the National Company Law Tribunal seeking redress. 
HSBC Daisy had approached the Mumbai bench of NCLT in October 2016 under sections 397 and 398 over the oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.
On Monday, the counsels representing Reliance Infratel told the tribunal they are willing to share details of the deal with Reliance Jio with the shareholders, with two caveats. 
One, the investors can’t disclose these details anywhere in any manner, and two, if they wish to argue about deal-related details, they will have to do it in the chamber of the presiding officer rather than in open court.
“They had agreed to keep us informed about any decision they take about the company and now we are here,"" argued Iqbal Chagla, a senior counsel representing HSBC Daisy Investments in the matter. “Earlier, there were four attempts by the firm to either sell the assets or merge it with the RCom. Fairness demands that they need to buy us out at the market rates or give us an exit.""
RCom and Reliance Jio have not disclosed the valuation of the deal.
“When we asked them what happens to the firm where we had invested? It becomes defunct since all those assets will get sold to Reliance Jio. You have taken my money and now you are doing everything because of majority,"" said Chagla.
HSBC Daisy Investment had invested around Rs1,100 crore in July 2007 for about 5% stake in the firm which is now reduced to 4.26%.
Countering this, senior advocate U.K. Chaudhary, who appeared for the Anil Ambani-controlled firm, argued the petitioner is merely arm-twisting the firm. “This is not a loan that needs to be given back, but this is equity infusion which is irretrievable. They are investors and not borrowers and they knew where they are investing. Now, the value of their share is not over Rs400 crore.""
“It’s their commercial investment that has gone wrong and they being 5% equity holder they are suffering, we are also suffering being 95% equity holders,"" argued Chaudhary.
Also, senior counsel Birendra Saraf, appearing for the joint lenders’ forum, argued RCom’s assets, including the tower business, are a pledge and the entire plan was monitored by the lenders; hence, nobody can see any asset in isolation.
Email queries to RCom and Reliance Jio did not elicit any response till the time of filing the report. 
After hearing the arguments from offshore investors, Reliance Infratel as well as the counsel of the joint lender forum, the court posted the matter for 27 February. 
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case."
66,2018-02-23,Bharti Infratel,"An earlier plan of Bharti Infratel to buy out Vodafone India an Idea Cellular's stake in Indus Tower has been scrapped as the telecom firms want to stay invested in the telecom tower business

Mumbai: Bharti Infratel Ltd and Indus Towers Ltd—two of India’s largest telecom tower firms—are planning to merge their businesses, three people aware of the matter said. 
Mumbai: Bharti Infratel Ltd and Indus Towers Ltd—two of India’s largest telecom tower firms—are planning to merge their businesses, three people aware of the matter said.
Vodafone India Ltd and publicly traded Bharti Infratel Ltd hold 42% each in Indus Towers. Idea Cellular Ltd owns 11.15% and US-based private equity fund Providence owns 4.85%.
Bharti Infratel was earlier planning to acquire a controlling stake in Indus Towers and make the latter a subsidiary.
According to that plan, Bharti Infratel was to acquire the stake it didn’t own in Indus Towers in an all-cash transaction and later sell the combined business to external investors. 
“Both Vodafone and Idea wanted cash from the deal; now they want to stay invested in their tower business as they expect valuation of the business to go up in the near term. Also, the companies do not need cash at the moment,"" said a person aware of the matter.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular are set to merge this year to create India’s largest telecom operator, surpassing Bharti Airtel Ltd.
The merged entity of Vodafone India and Idea now expect to have additional cash of about Rs21,000 crore in the first year, which includes Rs6,750 crore raised by Idea through sale of shares to institutional investors, Vodafone’s investment of Rs6,750 crore and about Rs8,400 crore from savings in operational and capital expenditure, another person with direct knowledge of the matter said.
A Vodafone India spokesperson declined to comment while an email sent to Idea remained unanswered. 
A Bharti Infratel spokesperson said, “As a policy, we do not comment on market speculation. Being a responsible corporate, we always make appropriate disclosures to the stock exchanges and our stakeholders as and when required."" 
The decision to merge the two tower companies comes in the wake of Airtel’s announcement that it would list its Africa business to raise money.
The new arrangement will also give freedom to each of the stakeholders in the merged tower entity to sell their stakes at their convenience.
“It is all about financial benefit. Everybody is working on this. It is being done internally,"" said this person. 
The valuation of a tower whose tenancy rates used to be Rs50 lakh has now declined to Rs30-35 lakh, according to a Mumbai-based analyst with a brokerage.
“There has been a price correction of about 20% in the industry,"" the analyst said, requesting anonymity, citing examples of the tower sale by Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, who agreed to sell their standalone telecom tower businesses to ATC Telecom Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd in November. 
“The tower sale was earlier pegged at Rs50 lakh per tower. However, Idea/Vodafone got about Rs40 lakh per tower from ATC in the deal,"" the analyst said.
There would be a further price correction in the tower business after Vodafone and Idea complete their merger, which will lead to a decline in the number of towers required for the merged entity to function.
“The minute this merger (Idea-Vodafone) gets announced, the valuation of towers will go down further,"" said the first person cited earlier, adding that valuation of tower business will start to go up when telcos will start investing massively to ramp up infrastructure to meet data demand, which is expected to go up from around 20 petabytes a day to about 120 petabytes a day in the near term.
“Once the telcos start announcing their capex, valuation will start growing up,"" the person added."
65,2018-03-08,Bharti Infratel,"HSBC Daisy-led investors have argued that Reliance Infratel would become defunct after the RCom-Reliance Jio deal as it would not have any assets left

Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), to stay the sale of its assets until 13 March. 
Mumbai: The Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Wednesday directed Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), to stay the sale of its assets until 13 March.
The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, which are alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.
After hearing the arguments of Reliance Infratel, overseas investors and the joint lenders’ forum of RCom, the NCLT division bench of B.S.V. Prakash Kumar and Ravikumar Duraisamy reserved its final order, to be released on 12 March.
This might create a minor hiccup as the Anil Ambani-owned company has entered into a binding agreement to sell off parts of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, controlled by Anil Ambani’s older brother Mukesh Ambani. An RCom spokesperson declined to comment.
Earlier on 28 December, both companies in separate statements said that Reliance Jio had emerged as the highest bidder for the wireless spectrum, tower, optical fibre network and media convergence node assets of RCom. The companies did not disclose the deal value.
HSBC Daisy-led investors argued that the company in which they had invested—Reliance Infratel—would become defunct because it would not have any assets left.
“When we had invested Rs1,100 crore in the company, under the agreement, we had the right to know about any changes that (the) company does, but we were not aware of anything that the company did,"" argued their counsel Iqbal Chagla.
He further argued that out of the total debt of RCom of around Rs45,000 crore, Reliance Infratel had debt of mere Rs3,400 crore, while the valuation of the latter’s tower business alone was Rs11,000 crore when its parent was in talks with Brookfield to sell assets.
“Currently, all the assets including those owned by Reliance Infratel are mortgaged and today, if the assets are not sold, the lenders will approach the tribunal under insolvency and bankruptcy code to recover their dues,"" argued Alpana Ghone, counsel for Reliance Infratel. 
“The entire procedure was conducted by the joint lenders’ forum where Reliance Jio was the highest bidder.""
According to Ghone, the sale of RCom group assets will fetch around Rs24,707 crore, out of which the assets of Reliance Infratel will fetch around Rs8,000 crore. Ghone also argued that the valuations of the telecom tower company had gone down because anchor tenant RCom had decided to terminate the rental agreement, and any delay might further dent valuation. 
Earlier, on 20 February, Reliance Infratel had agreed to share details of the deal to sell its assets to Jio with shareholders led by HSBC Daisy. These investors are seeking an exit from Reliance Infratel at fair market value.
In July 2007, HSBC Daisy Investment along with a clutch of other investors had invested around Rs1,100 crore in Reliance Infratel for about 5% stake, which has now come down to 4.26%. 
Appearing for the joint lenders’ forum, senior counsel Birendra Saraf argued that RCom’s assets, including the tower business, are a pledge and the entire plan was monitored by the lenders; hence, nobody can see any asset in isolation. 
Late on Tuesday, in an exchange filing, RCom said that it had appealed in the Bombay high court against an arbitration court which restrained it from sale, transfer or mortgage of its assets.
The arbitration court was ruling on an appeal by Swedish telecom vendor Ericsson, an operational creditor of RCom.

Mumbai: In a setback for Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has continued the stay on the sale of its assets to Reliance Jio until further order. 
Mumbai: In a setback for Reliance Infratel Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Communications Ltd, the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has continued the stay on the sale of its assets to Reliance Jio until further order.
The tribunal was hearing the plea filed by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, who is alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement.
On Monday, NCLT had allowed the amendment application of offshore investors to make changes to their original petition seeking a stay on sale of Reliance Infratel’s assets.
The tribunal also posted the hearing on investors’ contempt petition on 6 April.
“We intend to file an appeal immediately before the NCLAT for the vacation of the stay, to protect the interests of our secured lenders,"" said an RCom spokesperson in an email response to Mint query. “It is to be noted the stay granted by NCLT today relates only to RCOM’s tower and fibre assets and does not apply to spectrum, MCNs, real estate, etc.""
The RCom spokesperson further said that “We expect our secured lenders to also take appropriate steps for the expeditious completion of processes transparently run by lenders for monetisation of their securities, and realisation of their dues.""
“As legally advised, the claims of minority investors and/or unsecured vendors cannot under any circumstances rank in higher priority than the undisputed claims of secured domestic and international lenders, and any stay granted in this regard is not defensible in law and liable to be vacated,"" the RCom spokesperson further added.
HSBC Daisy and other investors had originally approached the tribunal in 2015 against the proposed merger of Reliance Infratel with its parent company Reliance Communications. 
Currently, the investors were opposing the transaction on the grounds that once the deal with Jio goes through, the company in which they had invested around Rs1,100 crore will become defunct. In July 2007, HSBC Daisy Investment along with a clutch of other investors had invested around Rs1,100 crore in Reliance Infratel for about 5% stake, which has now come down to 4.26%.

63,2018-04-06,Bharti Infratel,"The Supreme Court also rejected the plea of Reliance Infratel, a subsidiary of RCom, and SBI challenging an NCLT order that stayed an asset sale to Reliance Jio

New Delhi: In a partial relief to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), the Supreme Court on Thursday cancelled a March order of the Bombay high court that had rejected the company’s appeal of an order from an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets. 
New Delhi: In a partial relief to Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), the Supreme Court on Thursday cancelled a March order of the Bombay high court that had rejected the company’s appeal of an order from an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets.
Accordingly, RCom is at liberty to proceed with the sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) that were previously under challenge.
“It is not a block sale. The court has today paved way for sale of the spectrum, MCNs and real estate,"" Punit Garg, executive director of RCom, said in an interview after the court order. Other people aware of the developments have however, maintained that the asset sale is a block deal.
The top court also rejected the plea of Reliance Infratel, a subsidiary of RCom, and the State Bank of India (SBI) challenging an order of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) that stayed an asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. A two-judge bench headed by justice A.K. Goel asked the parties to approach the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) in accordance with law. RCom is likely to move the appellate forum on Friday. 
“As legally advised, and based on the order of the Hon’ble SC as above, RCom is confident of securing appropriate relief from the NCLAT to enable sales of tower and fibre assets to also be completed at the earliest. The claim of the minority investors (which is fully disputed by RCom) can, in any case, be a maximum of approx. Rs200-300 crore from the sales proceeds,"" a RCom spokesperson said. 
RCom had moved the top court on 19 March seeking a stay on orders of the Bombay high court and the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) Mumbai bench, barring it from selling its wireless assets to Reliance Jio without prior approval. The company was joined by SBI which approached the court on 20 March seeking approval for the sale of RCom’s assets to Reliance Jio. 
The tribunal was hearing a petition filed by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, which are alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement. While RCom owes a total of Rs45,000 crore to its lenders, total dues to SBI as on 28 February stood at Rs4,027 crore. On 8 March, the high court had rejected RCom’s appeal against an order of an arbitration tribunal barring the sale or transfer of its assets without prior permission. The tribunal had passed the interim order on a plea by Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson for recovery of Rs1,012 crore from RCom.
Ericsson being an unsecured creditor, through its counsel, C.A. Sundaram, said, “It is not that we don’t have any rights. I have the right to recovery. This cannot be a private transaction; one brother selling to another.""
“Am I to be left in the lurch like this? After they sell the assets, they will say that they don’t have money left to pay us,"" he remarked. He added that its rights were being defeated and being a small company, it would suffer irreparably. It was observed by the court that as unsecured creditors, it (Ericsson) could not be deprived of its statutory rights.
This was opposed by Mukul Rohtagi, representing RCom who told the court, “Even under civil law or commercial law, secured creditors are above unsecured creditors"".

The appelate tribunal also recalled its 6 April interim order partially allowing Reliance Infratel to execute its Rs25,000 crore asset sale programme with Reliance Jio Infocomm, after the said order was stayed by the Supreme Court on 16 April in an appeal moved by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd.
On 6 April, a bench headed by S.J. Mukopadhaya had without vacating the stay on the sale and transfer of Reliance Infratel’s assets, allowed lenders led by the State Bank of India (SBI) to go ahead with the deal in favour of Reliance Jio and deposit the sale proceeds in a separate escrow account subject to its final decision.
Reliance Infratel had moved the tribunal earlier this month against a 12 March stay order passed by NCLT Mumbai bench, in a plea by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company. 
A stay imposed by the Bombay high Court on sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) was vacated by the Supreme Court on 5 April.

Mumbai: Telecom tower infrastructure provider Bharti Infratel, which has witnessed tenancy losses due to consolidation in the telecom sector, expects better business in the future as telcos continue to roll out 4G telecom networks and prepare for 5G services, top company officials said. 
Mumbai: Telecom tower infrastructure provider Bharti Infratel, which has witnessed tenancy losses due to consolidation in the telecom sector, expects better business in the future as telcos continue to roll out 4G telecom networks and prepare for 5G services, top company officials said.
“With improving industry structure, rising consumer demand, and the need to expand 4G network in the short-term and potentially 5G in the longer term, we expect the (tower) industry to come out of the current phase (of slow growth) much more stronger,"" Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta told analysts in a post-earning call. 
“With data demand growing at a very rapid pace, it is clear that all private operators have to invest heavily on network throughout the country to remain competitive,"" Gupta said.
“In addition, in the longer term, the advent of 5G would significantly increase the demand for sites because of the spectrum being in higher frequency,"" Gupta added.
The tower arm of Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel on Monday reported a 2% rise in consolidated net profit at Rs606 crore for the March quarter against Rs597 crore a year ago.
The company ended FY2018 with 91,451 towers, up from 90,646 towers a year ago. 
However, it also lost 22,134 co-locations during the year due to consolidation. Co-locations are points where a tower operator deploys antennae of multiple carriers.
The revenue decline of Bharti Infratel will be driven by the exit of select players (RCom, TTSL and Aircel), said IDFC Securities Telecom Research dated 3 April. “This is likely to drive increase in churn and overall gross adds for the quarter are unlikely to offset this drag,"" it said.
However, Bharti Infratel managing director and chief executive Devender Singh Rawat told analysts that he doesn’t agree that there is excess of supply in the tower industry.
“With Reliance Jio’s announcement of 210,000 towers, it is clearly showing that new normal for an operator, who is trying to compete in the (market) post consolidation, is north of 200,000 towers,"" Rawat said, adding, “This clearly means that there is further requirement of rolling out new towers as we go forward.""
Rawat added that the tower industry is still to see much growth coming from areas with weak coverage.
Bharti Infratel expects average revenue per tenant, which has been stagnant for a few quarters, to increase after the Vodafone-Idea Cellular merger goes through.
“They (Vodafone/Idea) haven’t discussed with us on their exit,"" Devender Singh Rawat told analysts. “We will look to engage with them after they get DoT approval for the merger.""
Uninor, which is waiting for integration with Airtel, is also yet to cancel its tenancy with Bharti Infratel, Rawat addd.
Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers Ltd—two of India’s largest telecom tower firms—could also merge in the near future.
“Indus-Infratel merger remains a potential and is always a possibility,"" said Bharti Infratel chairman Gupta said adding, “But it’s a shareholders’ matter and we are not in a position to comment much on this.""
Mint had on 23 February reported that Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are planning to merge their businesses, citing three people aware of the matter.
Meanwhile, growth triggers for Bharti Infratel include the merged entity of Vodafone and Idea Cellular increasing tenancy, and Reliance Jio rolling out services.
“Jio has completed their earlier phase of growth at the end of the second quarter and are planning for the next phase of growth and rollout, and we are hoping to get a fair share of business,"" Rawat said."

56,2018-04-26,Bharti Infratel,"As per the Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers deal structure, Indus's valuation in case of a cash transaction will be a 10% discount to Bharti Infratel's EV/Ebitda multiple

Cash is king, while debt puts you in a bind. Ask Idea Cellular Ltd, perhaps the most leveraged company among India’s surviving telcos. It’s in a catch-22 situation with the decision to monetize its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers Ltd. 
Cash is king, while debt puts you in a bind. Ask Idea Cellular Ltd, perhaps the most leveraged company among India’s surviving telcos. It’s in a catch-22 situation with the decision to monetize its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers Ltd.
Idea has been given two options for its stake in the proposed merger between Indus and Bharti Infratel Ltd. It can exchange it for shares in the combined entity, but this won’t address its high debt levels. The other option is to exchange the stake for cash, although this comes with strings attached. According to the deal structure agreed upon by shareholders of the two companies, Indus’s valuation in case of a cash transaction will be at a 10% discount to Bharti Infratel’s EV/Ebitda multiple. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. 
Mint’s calculations suggest that Indus has been valued at a discount, albeit to a lesser extent, even in the case of a share swap. Shouldn’t Indus have been valued at a premium to Infratel, given its much larger size and better business mix in terms of the number of circles it operates in? 
Indus Towers currently operates in 15 telecom service areas (circles) and Bharti Infratel’s operations are focused on the remaining 7 circles. Indus operates 123,639 towers, 3.1 times that of Infratel and its revenues are 2.8 times higher at Rs18,742 crore.
Besides, when American Tower Corp. had bought Idea and Vodafone’s standalone towers last November, the transaction was at a 20% premium to Infratel’s valuations then.
But on the flip side, Infratel’s leaner operation generates a considerably higher profit margin. Besides, Airtel will be settling for joint control of the company with Vodafone, even though it will have a higher stake in the merged entity. As such, there are arguments both ways and the decision to favour Infratel’s shareholders may not be something to split hairs about. But Idea’s decision to settle for an additional discount in case of a cash transaction suggests nervousness about its cash position. In some such cases, where a company is selling a block of shares and giving up control, they even manage to get a premium.
Note also that proceeds from the Indus stake sale is lower than what analysts anticipated. Some analysts assumed inflows will be in the region of Rs8,500-9,000 crore, whereas Idea will get only Rs6,500 crore if it sells its stake to Infratel. A stock exchange announcement by Bharti Airtel Ltd suggests a possible deal with a consortium of PE investors didn’t materialise, which perhaps explains why Indus’s selling shareholders have to settle for lower valuations. Infratel shares have also corrected since the ATC deal, which made things worse. 
All of this means that Idea’s leverage ahead of its merger with Vodafone will be higher than estimates. Meanwhile, losses and cash burn continue to worsen. In the December quarter, Idea’s Ebitda was about sufficient to meet interest costs; in the March quarter, Ebitda is expected to fall short by a margin. After accounting for capex as well, the dent in balance sheet will be significant. From the looks of it, Idea’s financials won’t be a pretty sight when it eventually merges with Vodafone India Ltd."

54,2018-04-27,Bharti Infratel,"Consolidation in telecom tower industry could eventually restore some of their pricing power, though they would also need to diversify their business for growth

New Delhi: India’s telecom tower industry is expected to see more consolidation after the Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers merger, a development that could eventually restore some of their pricing power, though they would also need to diversify their business for growth. 
New Delhi: India’s telecom tower industry is expected to see more consolidation after the Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers merger, a development that could eventually restore some of their pricing power, though they would also need to diversify their business for growth.
Tower companies have frequently faced challenges such as right of way, fear of radiation and rising fuel costs. Consolidation among telecom service providers, triggered by the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016, has added to their woes.
“Tower companies in India grew as there were many telecom operators earlier, which resulted in higher tenancies. With consolidation among telecom operators, tower companies face lower tenancies and eventually they will also consolidate. Going forward, tower companies have two options—either diversify and get into areas like Smart Cities and utilities, or move up the value chain and get into small cells, etc.,"" Amresh Nandan, research vice president, Gartner, said.
After the merger of Bharti Infratel Ltd, the tower arm of Bharti Airtel, and Indus Towers, the combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers and will create the world’s largest tower company outside China.
The merger will help Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which came together in 2007 to form Indus Towers, easily pare their stakes in the combined entity to raise funds to invest in their struggling telecom operations and cut debt.
With revenue streams of tower companies largely dependent on telecom service providers, a turnaround of the industry is some time away.
“While in the near term, earnings and return ratios are largely shielded, we are cautious on the long-term outlook. With operators likely to remain under pressure, there may be stress on growth and margins for tower companies too,"" brokerage Jefferies India said in a note on 25 April.
Moreover, with Airtel and Vodafone sharing controlling rights of the merged entity, it would give them the leverage to negotiate for lower tower rentals. “The lack of pricing power in the near term will trickle down to other smaller tower companies which would also not be able to charge higher rentals,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said, requesting anonymity.
In the tower industry, at present, ATC owns or operates over 68,000 tower sites in India with final approval pending to acquire another 10,000 standalone towers from Idea Cellular. BSNL owns 66,000 towers, Reliance Communications has 43,000 towers which it plans to sell to Reliance Jio, while GTL Infra has 27,000 towers. Tower Vision India and Ascend Telecom Infrastructure are other smaller players with 8,500 and 4,000 towers, respectively. 
“The smaller players with fewer towers will be the first ones to be acquired as they don’t have the scale and are not present across all 22 telecom circles,"" an industry executive said requesting anonymity.
This would, however, also result in a leaner industry structure where tower companies would be ready to grab the low hanging fruits of expanding 4G rollouts by telecom service providers and the advent of 5G.
“Given that there is a shortage of about 2 lakh towers and that the network is not fully spread across the country, there is much room for growth. Going forward, the tower industry would see some relief when telcos are able to improve ARPUs, fiberisation increases the value proposition of tower companies and if they are able to deal with diesel costs,"" Mahesh Uppal, director at communications consulting firm ComFirst India said.
The Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association (TAIPA), meanwhile, is working towards ironing out issues related to the deployment of towers, especially as the implementation of right of way rules, 2016, remains a challenge at state level despite the department of telecommunications asking states to align their respective policies with the said rules.
“There are around 7-8 states such as Rajasthan, Assam, Odisha and Jharkhand which have aligned their policies with the said rules while for others, we are in active discussions to do the same,"" Tilak Raj Dua, Director General, TAIPA, said."

New Delhi: The planned merger of Bharti Infratel Ltd and Indus Towers will not affect their relationship with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd as it continues to be an important customer, Bharti Infratel chairman Akhil Gupta said.
“Both Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel have Jio as a customer and the same will continue. After the merger, nothing changes in terms of customer and competition relationships,"" Gupta said in response to an analyst’s question at a conference call on Wednesday.
“Jio is and remains an esteemed customer...and if we were that uncompetitive, then we would be getting no orders from anyone,"" he added.
The two companies on 25 April agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company outside China. 
The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower. The merged company will be listed on the stock exchanges, as Bharti Infratel is a publicly traded company.
The merger will help Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which came together in 2007 to form Indus Towers, easily pare their stakes in the combined entity to raise funds to invest in their struggling telecom operations and cut debt.
“The merger will have no immediate difference other than increase in business...there will be savings of Rs200 crore per year on account of savings of the dividend distribution tax that Indus Towers pays to Bharti Infratel...there will also be some savings due to economies of scale and rationalisation of overlaps,"" Gupta said.
Bharti Infratel and Vodafone India own 42% each in Indus Towers, while Idea Cellular holds 11.15%. The remaining 4.85% is held by private equity firm Providence.
“Combined, the two tower firms will also have a much bigger play in the government’s smart city projects,"" he said.
Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are in the final stages of commissioning of their smart city projects in Bhopal and Vadodara respectively.
On an analyst’s query on the impact of the cancellation of tenancies by Vodafone and Idea as a result of their proposed merger, Gupta said, “The merger (between Indus and Infratel) has nothing to do with the exit of (tenancies of) Vodafone and Idea.""
The Vodafone-Idea merger is expected to attract exit penalty due to cancellation of their tenancies, but it is unclear whether it could be waived after the two tower companies merge. 
Overall 25,000 tenancy exits are expected due to the Vodafone-Idea merger.
“We could look at options...which are win-win for all...Vodafone and Idea are our long-term partners,"" a Bharti Infratel spokesperson had said in a post-earnings call on 24 April, responding to an analyst’s question on whether the exit penalties would be waived if Indus and Infratel merged.
The merger of Indus and Infratel will need approvals from Competition Commission of India (CCI), Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and the telecom department. It is expected to close by 31 March 2019.
Once the merger is completed, Airtel, which currently owns 53.5% stake in Bharti Infratel, will hold between 33.8% and 37.2% in the merged entity, while Vodafone India will own between 26.7% and 29.4%. 
Airtel and Vodafone India will have equal rights in the merged entity.
As part of the proposed merger, Idea has the option to either sell its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers for Rs6,500 crore or get a 7.1% stake in the combined company if Providence also opts to receive new shares in exchange for its shareholding in Indus Towers.
Providence has the option of choosing cash or shares for 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding in Indus Towers, with the balance exchanged for shares."
52,2018-05-07,Bharti Infratel,"The amount of investment is similar to last year's levels and will go into 'new towers, tenancies and replacement capital'

New Delhi: Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are likely to invest  ₹ 3,500 crore in operations as capital expenditure for 2018-19 as they continue to operate on ‘business-as-usual’ mode till their merger happens before the fiscal-end, people familiar with the matter said. 
New Delhi: Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are likely to invest  ₹ 3,500 crore in operations as capital expenditure for 2018-19 as they continue to operate on ‘business-as-usual’ mode till their merger happens before the fiscal-end, people familiar with the matter said.
The two companies, last month, announced a merger deal that will create a $14.6 billion firm with world’s second-largest number of mobile masts. The merged entity will have, in its fold, more than 1,63,000 towers across India - largest after China Tower.
The transaction is subject to regulatory and other approvals which the two companies will now pursue, starting with Competition Commission of India (CCI) and thereafter Sebi, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Department of Telecom (FDI approval).
The companies have said the deal is expected to close before the end of 2018-19. 
A source privy to the development said the annual financial planning continues on course for both the companies as it is ‘business-as-usual’, and that Infratel’s capex is expected to be in the ballpark range of Rs1,200 crore in 2018-19.
Similarly, Indus Towers — where Infratel holds 42% stake — is likely to infuse roughly Rs2,300-2,500 crore as capex this year, said the official who did not wish to be named. 
Indus Towers is jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42% holding), Vodafone (42%), Idea Group (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%). The amount of investment is similar to last year’s levels and will go into “new towers, tenancies and replacement capital"", the official said adding that the investments are being funded from internal accruals of the two tower firms.
A Bharti spokesperson declined to comment on a detailed e-mailed query sent to the company. Indus Towers did not wish to comment.
“The capex amount will also be used for replacement of batteries, DG (diesel generators), power equipment...As the tenancies increase, the two companies will continue to increase their capacities of mobile towers ahead of their proposed merger,"" said the source.
Last month, the two entities announced that, “Indus Towers will be merged with and into Bharti Infratel through a scheme of arrangement."" The merged entity, which will be called Indus Towers, will remain listed. 
Bharti Airtel, which owns 53.5% in Bharti Infratel, will get 33.8-37.2% stake in the combined entity. 
Its final shareholding depends on what Aditya Birla Group’s Idea and Providence do with their minority shareholding in Indus Towers. Vodafone India will get between 26.7% and 29.4% of the Indus-Bharti Infratel combine. 
The merger will help unlock value for the companies which are locked in a tariff war unleashed by newcomer Reliance Jio Infocomm that has hurt earnings and triggered consolidation in the sector. Vodafone and Idea are already in the final stages to merge their mobile operations. 
Airtel had separately also stated last month that it plans to engage with potential investors to evaluate a stake sale in the combined tower company, which will have an equity value of Rs96,500 crore ($14.5 billion).
Under the mega tower deal, Idea has the option to sell its 11.15% stake in Indus for cash at the merger ratio that values the stake at Rs6,500 crore ($1 billion).
Under the transaction, Infratel agreed to pay 1,565 of its own shares for each Indus Towers share. Vodafone India will receive 783.1 million shares in the combined company, valuing the UK-based firm’s stake at Rs28,400 crore ($4.3 billion).
If Idea decides to sell all its stake and Providence sells 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding, the new entity will be 37.2% owned by Airtel and 29.4% by Vodafone Group, while 1.1% will be with Providence and the rest by public shareholders.
In case Idea and Providence decide to continue to stay invested, Airtel would have a shareholding of 33.8% in the combined entity. Vodafone, in such a scenario, would have 26.7% while Idea Group would get 7.1% and Providence would have 3.1% holding. The remaining 29.3% would be with public."

New Delhi: Reliance Infratel Ltd Tuesday told the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday that there was no choice but to sell its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd. 
New Delhi: Reliance Infratel Ltd Tuesday told the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Tuesday that there was no choice but to sell its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
Reliance Infratel counsel Kapil Sibal informed the court that in order to evade initiation of proceedings under the Insolvency Code, The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002 and liquidation, the company decided to sell its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio after it emerged as the highest bidder for the same.
“This transaction allows lenders to monetize the assets to an extent of Rs8,000 crore. Under any other circumstances, the company would not be able to recover its outstanding debt,"" Sibal stated, arguing that the decision to sell the assets to Reliance Jio was in no way prejudicial or oppressive. 
An NCLAT bench head by president S.J. Mukhopadhaya was hearing Reliance Group unit Reliance Infratel’s appeal against a 12 March order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal, which prohibited it from selling its tower and fibre assets to Reliance Jio. 
The 12 March stay order was passed in a plea by offshore investors of Reliance Infratel led by HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd, alleging oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement for not taking their consent for the asset sale as per the articles of association of the company.
Out of 43,000 towers owned by RInfratel, 32,000 towers are already leased out to Reliance Jio, NCLAT was informed. 
Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group owes over Rs45,000 crore to various banks. 
In December 2017, as part of its debt resolution plan, RCom struck a Rs25,000 crore deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, to avoid insolvency proceedings.
On 5 April, Supreme Court had allowed RCom, in a partial relief, to proceed with the sale of spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati) by vacating a March order of the Bombay high court.

“Ultimately, it will come down to normal market principle and market pricing,"" the person cited above said.
Emails sent to Vodafone India, Idea, Bharti Airtel Ltd and ATC were unanswered till press time.
The two telecom operators, which are likely to complete their proposed merger by June, had in November 2017 separately agreed to sell their respective standalone telecom tower businesses in India, totalling 20,000 towers to ATC Telecom Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd, a unit of ATC, for Rs7,850 crore.
As part of the deal, both Vodafone India and Idea as customers, and ATC as a mobile network infrastructure provider, had agreed to treat each other as long-term preferred partners, subject to existing arrangements.
Post the Vodafone-Idea merger, 6,300 co-located tenancies of the two operators on the combined standalone tower businesses will collapse into single tenancies over a period of two years without the payment of exit penalties, the companies had then said.
ATC last month completed the acquisition of Vodafone India Ltd’s 10,200 standalone telecom towers for around Rs3,800 crore but the deal to purchase Idea Cellular’s stand-alone towers for Rs4,000 crore is yet to be completed.
Meanwhile, Bharti Infratel Ltd, the tower arm of India’s largest telecom operator, and Indus Towers on 25 April agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company outside China.
Under this proposed merger, Airtel and Vodafone India will have equal rights in the merged tower entity.

Airtel, which owns 53.5% stake in Bharti Infratel, will hold between 33.8% and 37.2% in the merged entity. 
“What is interesting is that Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers have not clarified what happens to the exit penalties payable by Idea and Vodafone because of cancellation tenancies as a result of their merger,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said requesting anonymity.

“Parties have reached settlement. The moment company exits IBC process, they would sign the terms of consent,"" the Reliance Infratel counsel said.
Following this, a NCLAT bench headed by chairman justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya allowed them to withdraw. “In view of consent terms, parties are allowed to withdraw their appeal. Both appeals are accordingly disposed of,"" the bench said.

New Delhi: Reliance Infratel Ltd and its offshore investor and minority shareholder HSBC Daisy Investments (Mauritius) Ltd on Friday submitted to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) their final consent terms with respect to their dispute over sale of tower and fibre assets by the telco to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd.
This comes a month after Reliance Infratel, a unit of Reliance Communications Ltd (RCom), withdrew its appeal before NCLAT against an order of the Mumbai bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT), which prohibited it from selling its assets, following a settlement with HSBC Daisy.
The settlement paved the way for Anil Ambani-led RCom’s deal with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio for the sale of its assets mortgaged with different banks, to avoid insolvency proceedings.
The final agreement was signed by the parties on 15 June, Salman Khurshid and Ashish Prasad, appearing for Reliance Infratel and HSBC Daisy, respectively, informed the two-judge NCLAT bench led by Justice S.J. Mukhopadhyay, and placed the agreement for record before the bench. 
On 12 March, NCLT’s Mumbai bench had stayed the sale of tower and fibre assets by Reliance Infratel in a plea by HSBC Daisy that alleged oppression of minority shareholders and mismanagement and saying that their consent was not taken for the asset sale as should have been done under the articles of association of the company.
Subsequently, in April, Reliance Infratel moved the appellate tribunal challenging the stay.
A stay imposed by Bombay high court on the sale of other assets—spectrum, media convergence nodes (MCN) and real estate (at New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Jigni and Tirupati)—was vacated by the Supreme Court on 5 April.

The nod from the competition watchdog is the first in several required for the merger. 
The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) and Department of Telecommunications also need to give the green signal for the merger. 
Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers in April announced a merger which would create the world’s largest tower company outside China. The merger will help Bharti Airtel Ltd, Vodafone India Ltd and Idea Cellular Ltd, which came together in 2007 to form Indus Towers, easily pare their stakes in the combined entity to raise funds to invest in their struggling telecom operations and cut debt.

New Delhi: Mobile tower arm of telecom major Bharti Airtel, Infratel on Wednesday said it has received clearance from stock exchanges for its merger with Indus Towers. 
It will now approach National Company Law Tribunal for its approval, the company said. 
“We are pleased to inform you that “no adverse observation"" letter has been received from the stock exchange for the proposed merger of Bharti Infratel Limited and Indus Towers Limited. The Company will file the first motion petition before the National Company Law Tribunal in due course,"" Bharti Infratel said in filing at both BSE and NSE. 
In April this year, Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone Group had announced an agreement for the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel to create the largest mobile tower operator in the world outside China. 
It will have over 163,000 towers across 22 telecom service areas in India. The combined company will own 100% of Indus Towers—jointly owned by Bharti Infratel (42% holding), Vodafone (42%), Idea Group (11.15%) and Providence (4.85%). 
Post the deal, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone will jointly control the combined company, and the transaction is expected to close before the end of 2018-19, subject to statutory approvals. 
The deal gives Idea Group an option to sell its 11.5% stake in Indus Towers for cash or in lieu of receiving new shares. 
Providence too has the option to receive cash or shares for 3.35% of its 4.85% shareholding in Indus Towers with balance exchanged for shares. 
As per the deal structure, Vodafone will be issued 783.1 million new shares in the merged entity in exchange for its 42% stake in Indus Towers, and this could take its holding to 29.4% in new company depending on the options finally taken by Idea and Providence. 
Similarly, Airtel’s stake in new combined tower behemoth may be diluted to 37.2% in the combined entity from 53.5% it currently holds in Bharti Infratel. 
The transaction values Indus Towers at an enterprise value of Rs71,500 crore. Bharti Infratel stock was trading 0.44% up at Rs287.6 on BSE in the afternoon."

New Delhi: Reliance Communications on Wednesday said it has got relief from the telecom tribunal and will now be able to complete its planned spectrum sale, whose proceeds will be used to make payments to Ericsson India and RITL minority investors.
In a regulatory filing to the BSE, RCom said it will receive  ₹ 975 crore from the sale of spectrum, and it will pay Ericsson  ₹ 550 crore and RITL (Reliance Infratel) minority investors  ₹ 230 crore.
“Reliance Communications has been granted relief by the...Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) vide its interim order dated 1 October 2018, whereby...TDSAT has stayed the demand of bank guarantee of  ₹ 2,900 crore by the Department of Telecommunications,"" it said.
Anil Ambani-led RCom noted it had challenged the “unjustly sought security for the alleged demands"" by the telecom department with regard to spectrum usage charges. “After multiple hearings since August 28, 2018 the Hon’ble TDSAT, vide its interim order dated October 1, 2018 has stayed the said demand and directed DoT to expeditiously grant its approval for trading of the spectrum,"" RCom added.
The debt-laden firm pointed out that 38 secured lenders of the group had already approved the spectrum sale. “...and the proceeds thereof will be used for making payments to Ericsson India Private Limited and to RITL Minority Investors, as per settlement terms,"" it added.
The company on Tuesday said it had learnt that unsecured creditor Ericsson India had filed a contempt petition on 1 October in the Supreme Court, in relation to the settlement amount of  ₹ 550 crore to be paid by RCom. RCom had also stated that it filed an application on 28 September in the apex court, seeking 60 more days for making payment to the Swedish telecom equipment maker. That matter is slated for hearing on 4 October, it pointed out.
“The extension has been sought purely due to the fact that, as approved by 38 secured lenders, and as per RCom’s undertaking, Ericsson is to be paid from the sales proceeds of spectrum being traded by RCom, and such sale could not be completed as yet owing to factors beyond the control of RCom,"" according to the filing.
The company was at that time awaiting the copy of the order passed by TDSAT.
Last year, Reliance Communications (RCom) signed a pact with Reliance Jio for the sale of wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes assets — the proceeds of which were to be used to pare debt. From that deal, RCom far announced the completion of the sale of optical fibre assets worth  ₹ 3,000 crore and sale of its media convergence nodes worth  ₹ 2,000 crore to Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio Infocomm.

Bengaluru: Indian telecom tower company Bharti Infratel Ltd reported a 10.8% rise in third-quarter profit on Wednesday, beating market estimates.
Profit after tax came in at  ₹648 crore ($90.90 million) for the quarter ended 31 December, compared with  ₹585 crore a year earlier, the company said.
Analysts on average had expected a profit of  ₹559 crore, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.
The company, majority owned by telecoms carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd, merged its operations with Indus Towers last year amid a vicious price war in the world's second-biggest market by mobile phone users.

NEW DELHI :
Bharti Infratel Ltd will closely watch how Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, which competes with its parent Bharti Airtel in the market for telecom services, hives off its tower assets and monetizes surplus capacity.
“We will have to wait and watch,"" Bharti Infratel chief executive D.S. Rawat said in a post-earnings call with analysts when asked how Jio’s plan to hive off tower assets will impact its business prospects.
“We are not aware of any agreements that they have signed...Jio could look at opportunities based on what percentage of towers are shareable and where they could share sites. We will have to wait and see how this plays out,"" Rawat said.
This comes after Reliance Jio on 17 January said that it proposes to transfer its fibre and tower businesses to separate companies and enter into arrangements for long-term use of these assets.
Analysts say that such a move by Jio would increase competition in the tower operator segment and could hurt Bharti Infratel. “Jio is in the process of demerging its tower and fiber assets into a separate company. Jio will lease the infrastructure from these companies and would look to raise funds in these companies. Assets and part of the debt will move to these companies, making Jio asset light. Part of the future capex will also move. Jio is also open to sharing its tower and fiber with competition. While we look forward to more details, this can be a potential competitor for Bharti Infratel,"" BNP Paribas said in an 18 January note.
However, the impact on Bharti Infratel can only be assessed based on how Jio’s assets would be shared with rival telecom operators. “Allowing full sharing of a key asset that bestows significant competitive advantage is going to be a hard decision (for Jio),"" Credit Suisse said in a note dated 17 January.
Reliance Jio in December 2017 signed an agreement with Reliance Communications to buy the latter’s telecom assets including over 43,000 towers."
40,2019-01-25,Bharti Infratel,"Average revenue per operator increased 7.3% on a sequential basis, reflecting increased usage by customersProfit was aided by the  ₹55 crore penalty amount the firm received towards contract terminations

Appearances can be deceptive. At first glance, Bharti Infratel Ltd’s results for the December quarter look better than expectations. Reported revenue fell just 0.8% on a sequential basis despite a notable reduction in customer tenancies.
But as soon as it became clear that much of the earnings beat was driven by non-recurring revenues, the Bharti Infratel stock fell by 5%.
Profit was aided by the  ₹55 crore penalty amount the firm received towards contract terminations. An additional  ₹40 crore was said to have been booked from customers who are in the process of terminating their contracts. Accounting for these non-recurring revenue, the earnings beat is not substantial, say analysts.
Note that post-merger, Vodafone Idea Ltd has been rationalizing its tower network to remove duplication, and these exits are resulting in penalty payments to Bharti Infratel.
That said, telcos’ focus on 4G networks is aiding Bharti Infratel. This is not only helping the firm add fresh customers at its tower sites but is also improving its realizations.
Average revenue per operator increased 7.3% on a sequential basis, reflecting increased usage by customers. But tenancy additions have been poor owing to the exits mentioned above. Net tenancy addition stood at a poor 654 in the December quarter, with exits being as high as 4,000.
According to analysts at JM Financial Ltd, the newly merged group is not only shutting down sites in the same location but also ones with low utilization levels. So even as Bharti Infratel continues to see incremental benefits from investments in 4G networks, exits can constrain growth for some quarters.
“Bharti Infratel has a growth problem—we expect underlying sharing revenues and EBITDA to remain under pressure over the next few quarters, in view of Vodafone Idea’s indicated shutdown of additional 22,000 network sites (likely from October 2018 through March 2020),"" add analysts at JM Financial. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Some analysts are also concerned that Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd’s plans to monetize its stake in its tower assets could have adverse ramifications for Bharti Infratel’s valuations. “Jio’s tower assets add to supply of tower assets available in the market for monetization and may have some adverse impact on Bharti Infratel’s valuations going forward,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
In this backdrop, it’s hardly surprising that the stock has lost nearly a fourth of its value in the past year."

NEW DELHI :
Telecom tower firm Bharti Infratel Thursday said it has reached a settlement with four operators, including Vodafone Idea, that exited from its cell sites before the expiry of their contracts at a payment of around  ₹3,800 crore. 
The payments include one-time charge of  ₹2,000 crore and rental of around  ₹1,800 crore. 
Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta during the company's earnings call said that all the charges with Airtel, Tata, Telenor, Vodafone Idea have been settled for all exits that were received up to November 30, 2018. ""As a snapshot, on a consolidated basis, of the the total exit charges approximately  ₹20 billion, which related to  ₹37 billion on 100 per cent basis, we had cash settlement against  ₹20 billion ...,"" Gupta said.
He said that operators have jointly paid  ₹55 crore in cash to Bharti Infratel during the October-December 2018 period and rest of the payment will made in monthly installments with interest spread over period of 36 months. ""In line with our accounting policy  ₹550 million accounted for revenue in this quarter. Instalment amounting to approximately  ₹900 million per quarter shall be accounted for from next quarter as the revenues for the next 12 quarters,"" Gupta said.
He said that the third quarter of ongoing financial year recorded the highest gross tower and co-location additions in last five quarters.
The company on Wednesday posted an 11 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at  ₹648 crore for the December quarter.
Consolidated revenues, however, marginally dropped to  ₹3,640 crore, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at  ₹1,513 crore, 6 per cent lower than the year-ago period.
""With completion of Vodafone Idea merger, we believe the consolidation phase is largely behind us and so are co-locations exits that we have been witnessing. Between Indus and Infratel, there were exits of over 57,000 on a consolidated basis till December 31, 2018 spread over six quarters. We believe industry will now move to higher network roll out,"" Gupta said.
He said that the merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers is on track and there will be meeting on February 2 to get approval of Bharti Airtel shareholders.

NEW DELHI :
Ericsson India Pvt. Ltd moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against Reliance Communications Ltd and its chairman Anil Ambani for “wilful disobedience"" of its earlier orders to pay its dues.
The telecom equipment maker asked the court to direct Ambani to submit  ₹550 crore along with interest of 12% per annum and urged that till such time, his investment in firms including Reliance Capital Ltd, Reliance Inceptum Pvt Ltd, and Reliance Innoventures Pvt. Ltd be frozen. This is the third time that Ericsson is seeking contempt proceedings against RCom to recover dues.
The court orders cited by include those of 3 March 2018, 23 October 2018 and 7 January 2019, and relate to RCom’s dues payment of  ₹550 crore.
Ericsson has also sought contempt proceedings against Reliance Infratel Ltd and its chairperson Chhaya Virani; Reliance Telecom Ltd and its chairman Satish Seth; and the State Bank of India (SBI).
Apart from payment of dues, Ericsson also wants the contemnors to file affidavits stating the total amount of unencumbered assets belonging to them in India or abroad.
The court is also vested of another contempt plea by Ericsson against Ambani for allegedly not complying with its order to clear dues of  ₹550 crore. Ericsson had also sought that Ambani be “detained in civil prison"" unless the payment is made.

37,2019-03-04,Bharti Infratel,"While Airtel and Vodafone Idea have announced fundraising plans, Reliance Jio is looking to deleverage—a move typically associated with a stake sale at a later stageThe telecom firms are loaded with debt, forcing them to look at multiple avenues to raise funds and reduce leverage

Mumbai: ""There are but two ways of paying debt: increase of industry in raising income, increase of thrift in laying out,"" said Thomas Carlyle, a Scottish writer and philosopher. Indian telecom firms have tried all they could—raising revenues, cutting costs—but all of that has amounted to a few drops in the ocean when compared to their monumental debt.
Bharti Airtel Ltd, the best placed of the lot, with a debt to Ebitda ratio of about 4.2 times, lost its investment grade rating last month from Moody’s Investors Service. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. 
While the company already had plans to reduce leverage by selling its stake in Africa operations and in Bharti Infratel, its tower infrastructure business, it evidently believes that much more needs to be done.
Late last week, Airtel announced plans to raise as much as  ₹32,000 crore, largely through a rights issue and selling perpetual bonds worth  ₹7,000 crore. The move will bring down its debt to Ebitda to around three times, which can potentially get Moody’s to revisit the ratings downgrade, and result in better borrowing rates.
The need to bring down leverage isn’t the only reason driving telcos such as Airtel to raise large funds. “The capex intensity of the sector will continue to remain high. While 4G capex may be at its peak, we see 5G spends kicking in from next year,"" says Rajiv Sharma, co-head of research at SBICAP Securities Ltd. Analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd say, “The fundraise may provide (Airtel) the financial flexibility to participate in 5G spectrum auction in FY21.""
While companies are now saying that the reserve price for 5G spectrum is too high to even consider bidding, analysts say companies may not ignore the chance to upgrade for too long, especially given how aggressive they have been in the recent past with regard to upgrading their networks.
Airtel isn’t alone in its fundraising efforts. Vodafone Idea Ltd had earlier announced a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore. It was already walking a tightrope and now suddenly faces competition for public funds, with Airtel announcing a similar-sized issue. 
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd decided late last year to hive off its fibre and tower assets and house them in two separate companies, a move that is typically associated with a plan to sell a stake to a strategic or financial investor at a later stage.
The big worry in all this is there is hardly any talk of raising income—as Carlyle suggests—and reducing leverage. In fact, in Airtel’s decision to raise what is being considered a larger-than-needed amount of capital, the worry is that cash burn will continue longer than what was earlier anticipated.
“It is better to be over-capitalized than under-capitalized amid the continued uncertainty in the Indian wireless market. A well-capitalized balance sheet is a must to fight the ‘brutal battle of capital and capacity’ that the Indian wireless market currently is,"" say analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients.
Vodafone Idea comes across as the weakest placed in this brutal battle. Compared to peers Reliance Jio and Airtel, the company has been lagging in capital expenditure (capex), say analysts. As Rajiv Sharma of SBICAP Securities points out, “Government (department of telecommunication) dues coming up for payment in the next two years itself amount to  ₹21,000 crore for Vodafone Idea, leaving limited scope for tactical investments such as 5G.""
The Indian telecom industry is experiencing the “escalation of commitment"" problem, where the tendency to escalate capital commitments ends up being disastrous for firms, especially in hypercompetitive markets. The coffee wars in the US between Philip Morris’s Maxwell House and Procter and Gamble’s Folgers brands is a classic example, where both companies struggled to make money thanks to their fight for dominance.
Also read: Indian telcos may well lose by winning
As pointed out in a Mint article, citing research from Kotak, what the telecom industry really needs is so-called de-escalation bids such as an increase in tariffs. Instead, the path the industry has chosen is to escalate their commitments. Of course, one can argue that they have little choice but to keep pumping in money to protect their already large investments. But as history has shown, this strategy doesn’t end very well."

Bengaluru:  India's Bharti Infratel Ltd said on Tuesday mobile carrier and its majority shareholder Bharti Airtel Ltd will lower its direct stake in the telecom tower company by more than a half.
Airtel's unit Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd will buy an up to 32 percent stake in Bharti Infratel by March 18, Infratel said in an exchange filing.
Airtel will own an 18.3 percent stake in Infratel after the transfer, down from its current stake of 50.33 percent.
""Whenever Airtel transfers stake to Nettle Infrastructure, (eventually) they will sell the stake to a third party. This will help them raise money,"" said a Mumbai-based an analyst, who did not want to be named.
Airtel, like its peers in the industry, has faced immense competition since the entry of Reliance Industries' upstart Jio in late 2016 with its debts soaring and profit margins eroding.
Singapore Telecommunications Ltd said last week it will buy roughly $525 million worth Airtel stock as part of Airtel's plan to raise $4.6 billion through shares and bonds.
Nettle will buy Infratel shares for up to 362.45 rupees each, a premium of up to 13.4 percent to the stock's closing price on Monday. Nettle already owns a 3.18 percent stake in Infratel.

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd will transfer as much as 32% stake it owns in tower company Bharti Infratel Ltd to wholly owned unit Nettle Infrastructure Investments Ltd to explore opportunities to monetize the asset, the telecom operator said on Tuesday.
Airtel and Nettle own 50.33% and 3.18%, respectively, in Bharti Infratel now. After the transfer of stake, which is scheduled to be completed on or after 18 March, Airtel and Nettle will own 18.33% and 35.18%, respectively, the company said in an exchange filing. The move is in line with Airtel’s earlier stated strategy to sell a controlling stake in Bharti Infratel, which is in the midst of a merger with Indus Towers.
In October 2017, Airtel said it has been approached by a few global investors to acquire a significant stake in Bharti Infratel, and if their interests are accepted, this could result in such investors acquiring control of Bharti Infratel. In a bid to trim debt, Bharti Airtel had also announced the sale of 20% stake in DTH arm Bharti Telemedia Ltd to Warburg Pincus for $350 million.
Triggered by intensive competition after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in September 2016, which brought down tariffs to rock bottom and hit revenue streams, operators have been selling or paring stakes in their non-core assets.
Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, now merged, had in November 2017 separately agreed to sell their respective standalone tower businesses in India, totalling 20,000 towers, to ATC Telecom Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd (ATC) for  ₹7,850 crore.
Vodafone Idea now also plans to monetize its stake in the merged entity of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers.
“We are expecting this (Indus-Infratel merger) to be completed in early Q1 FY20 (April-June). And so as soon as that completion happens, we have the option to monetize this asset,"" Akshaya Moondra, chief financial officer of Vodafone Idea said on 7 February in a post-earnings conference call with analysts.
The stake sale exercise is crucial for both Airtel and Vodafone Idea as their profitability have been severely hit after Reliance Jio’s entry and at the same time they need to invest in networks to upgrade capacity.
Vodafone Idea posted a loss of  ₹5,004 crore in the December quarter (Q3) while Bharti Airtel Ltd’s profit plunged 72% to  ₹86 crore in Q3 from  ₹306 crore a year earlier. Vodafone Idea’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) from wireless operations in India at  ₹1,136.8 crore is the lowest among all operators. Reliance Jio, in comparison, posted Ebitda of  ₹4,053 crore while Bharti Airtel Ltd reported  ₹1,949.8 crore.
However, both Airtel and Vodafone Idea have announced plans for significant fund infusion from their promoters. Vodafone Idea in January said that its board had approved a rights issue of  ₹25,000 crore to existing eligible equity shareholders while Bharti Airtel’s promoters and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd will together invest  ₹16,785 crore as part of a rights issue.
Bharti Airtel hopes that the fundraising will strengthen its balance sheet and give it the financial flexibility to grab future opportunities. Of the rights entitlement of  ₹16,785 crore, the promoter and promoter group will subscribe to  ₹11,785 crore, while GIC will subscribe to  ₹5,000 crore by way of renouncement in their favour. The promoter and promoter group have also reserved the right to subscribe either itself or through investors for additional shares in the issue, including in the event of under-subscription by the public.
The telecom operator is also preparing an IPO for its Africa unit, after having raised $1.25 billion in October in a pre-IPO fund-raising round from large investors, including Warburg Pincus, Temasek, Singtel and SoftBank Group International. The company plans to hold the IPO for Airtel Africa by June-July."

33,2019-04-09,Bharti Infratel,"The company expects that the money raised from the stake sale in Indus Tower and the  ₹25,000 crore rights issueThe board of directors of Vodafone Idea on 20 March cleared the planned  ₹25,000-crore rights issue at a price of  ₹12.50 per equity share

NEW DELHI :
Vodafone Idea expects the sale of its 11.15% stake in Indus Tower to complete in the next three-four months which could yield an estimated  ₹5,500 crore, a senior company official said Tuesday.
Under a contract signed with Bharti Infratel in April 2018, the company has an option to sell the 11.15% stake in Indus Tower for cash ahead of the merger of the country's largest mobile tower firm with the Bharti group firm.
""As things stand now, that process is in NCLT and expectation is that it should be completed in the next 3-4 months timeframe. Before the merger is consummated, we have the right to receive that in cash. The value will fluctuate.
""The value is dependent on Bharti Infratel (stock) price. At current Bharti Infratel price, the cash value is more than  ₹5,500 crore,"" Vodafone Idea Chief Financial Officer Akshaya Moondra told PTI.
The company expects that the money raised from the stake sale in Indus Tower and the  ₹25,000 crore rights issue, which is opening on Wednesday, will give it long term war chest to compete in the market.
""We believe that the proceeds from the rights issue coupled with the monetisation of our stake in Indus Towers Limited will allow us to make the required investments in the business to achieve our strategic goals,"" Vodafone Idea Chief Executive Officer Balesh Sharma said.
The board of directors of Vodafone Idea on 20 March cleared the planned  ₹25,000-crore rights issue at a price of  ₹12.50 per equity share, a steep 61 per cent discount to the prevailing market rate.
In a regulatory filing, the company had said the rights entitlement ratio has been fixed at 87 equity shares for every 38 shares held by eligible shareholders of the company on the record date, that is 2 April, 2019.
""Rights issue gives us good funding along with the two other monetisations that we are looking at - a long term war chest to continue on the stated strategy of ours. Our strategy primarily is to integrate the two network as quickly as we can to achieve much gain in coverage and customer experience on one side and profitability on the other because of synergies coming,"" Sharma said.
Promoter shareholders -- Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group -- have reiterated to the board that they intend to contribute up to  ₹11,000 crore and up to  ₹7,250 crore respectively, amounting to a total of  ₹18,250 crore, as part of the rights issue. While Vodafone Group’s entire funding will be considered as a foreign investment in the rights issue, Aditya Birla Group may also route funds from its foreign entities, according to sources.
The promoter shareholders have also said that in case the rights issue is under-subscribed, each of the promoter shareholders reserves the right to take up part or whole of the unsubscribed portion, subject to stipulated law.
When asked about the plan of action in case promoter shareholding in Vodafone Idea breaches 75% cap, Moondra said there is interest from investors and he does not promoters holding to breach the limit.
""We don't expect it to cross 75% mark but because this is rights issue and there was some doubt whether Axiata-- one of our large shareholder will participate or not. The shareholders and promoters as a precautionary measure had taken the SEBI approval if they were to participate beyond their entitlement and in case they exceed 75%. At this point of time, we do not see there will be a need to utilise that approval,"" Moondra said.
According to a JM Financial report, minority shareholders will need to make an investment of at least  ₹5,410 crore in the rights issue to keep promoters holding at 75 %.
Vodafone Idea is looking to invest proceeds from the rights issue, Indus Tower stake sale and partial sale of the optical fibre in telecom networks to expand 4G coverage from 61% population at present to over 85%  population coverage by March 2020.
Vodafone Idea is in discussion to sell 1.56 lakh kilometre of optical fibre. According to sources, it has received a combined valuation of  ₹20,000 crore for the mobile tower and optical fibre assets.

32,2019-04-22,Bharti Infratel,"March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this weekIn the US, big companies like Facebook, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft will report earnings this week

March quarter earnings and elections are going to drive markets movement this week. In the global markets too, earnings will be key for equities. This week will go a long way in determining whether investors should be concerned about the dawning of an earnings recession or whether back-to-back quarters of negative growth can be avoided in what is the heaviest week for profit reporting by US companies.
In the US, big companies like Facebook, Amazon, Coca-Cola and Microsoft will report earnings this week. Among key Indian companies to declare March quarter earnings this week are Maruti Suzuki, Yes Bank, Hero Motocorp, Tata Steel, Axis Bank, Bharti Infratel ACC, SBI Life, HDFC Life.
During this week, the markets are expected to consolidate and then turn volatile due to expiry of April series Futures and Options.
“The near term trend of Nifty is range bound and one may expect this high low range of 11,750-11,550 levels to continue for the next curtailed week. Further upside from here could encounter a resistance at 11,710-11,750 levels in the next week. The expected range or consolidation movement is unlikely to damage the near term uptrend status of the market, ""Nagaraj Shetti Technical Research Analyst HDFC securities.
On Monday, HDFC Bank and Reliance Industries stocks will be in focus after posting their quarterly earnings.
Net profit of Reliance Industries rose 9.79% to  ₹10,362 crore for the quarter ended 31 March while revenue rose 19.4% to  ₹1.54 trillion in the same period. This is the second straight quarter when the Mukesh Ambani-led company has reported a quarterly profit of more than  ₹10,000 crore.
RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.
HDFC Bank Ltd reported a record Q4 net profit of  ₹5885 crore up 22.6% meeting market expectations as the country's biggest lender by market value raked in higher interest and fee income. Asset quality improved slightly, with gross bad loans as a percentage of the total at 1.36 % by the end of March, compared with 1.38 % in the previous quarter and 1.30 % in the same period last year."
31,2019-04-25,Bharti Infratel,"Consolidated revenues rose 1% in FY19. Despite the intense competition, operating profit dropped just 6%If one excludes exit penalties received from customers, Bharti Infratel's revenues will fall 4.4% in Q4, while operating profit will drop 12.6% from the year ago

At first glance, it looks like tower infrastructure services provider Bharti Infratel Ltd exited FY19 on a rather steady note. It reported a 1% rise in consolidated revenues. The brutal competition in the sector notwithstanding, operating profit dropped just 6% and net profit was flat for the full year ended March 2019. The March-quarter results seem alright as well, with revenues down 2% and operating profits falling around 4%.
But dig deeper into the results and the impact of the turbulence in the telecom sector is visible. The reported figures include exit penalties received from customers who discontinued their service contracts. These receipts are best treated as one-off incomes, according to analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities. Such penalties amounted to  ₹99.7 crore in the last quarter.
Exclude this, and the revenues last quarter will fall by 4.4%. More importantly, operating profit will drop by 12.6% from the year ago, according to analysts at Kotak.
""Infratel's reported earnings print was weak and reflected the expected pain of tenancy exits for the first time,"" the analysts said in a note to clients.
The consolidation in the sector has hit tenancies and revenues, with companies such as Vodafone Idea Ltd getting rid of duplicate tower infrastructure. For Infratel, this meant that the sharing factor in the total tower base declined from 2.25 at the end of FY18 to 1.87 last fiscal (FY19). Total co-locations on the company’s towers dropped as much as 16% last quarter from the same period last year.
The impact of this will continue to be felt by Bharti Infratel. Several customer tenancies are in their notice period. Technically this lets Bharti Infratel to continue charge them. But such revenues will cease once the contracts end, further eroding Bharti Infratel’s earnings. “There were as many as 4,308 tenancies for which the company received exit notices, but were billed during 4QFY19. This is nearly 2.5% of the company's end-4QFY19 tenancy base. EBITDA could go down another 3-3.5% when billing on these tenancies stops,"" analysts at Kotak added.
While investors were somewhat aware of these pressures, they were evidently surprised at the extent of the fall in profit. Infratel shares were trading down 5% today. The worry is that the pressure on Bharti Infratel’s earnings is likely to worsen. These concerns emerge from two fronts. One is continuing consolidation in the telecom sector. The Vodafone Idea Ltd combine continues to rationalise its telecom sites. After exiting the overlapping sites, the focus now is on reducing the presence in low-revenue generating sites.
The second is Reliance Jio’s plans to float its tower infrastructure business into a separate entity. Analysts fear such a move can curb incremental tenancies from Jio. The scenario can deteriorate if the new entity created by Jio is successful in finding external customers. This can exert pricing pressure, impacting Bharti Infratel’s prospects further."

15,2019-07-25,Bharti Infratel,"Consolidated revenue grew 1% from a year ago, making it the first time in a year that revenues have grownRevenue per tower, per tower per month, and per customer saw notable rise in Q1, against the March quarter

Bharti Infratel Ltd’s June quarter results has impressed investors. The stock was the biggest gainer among Nifty stocks in early deals on Thursday.
Consolidated revenue grew for the first time in a year, rising 1%. Lower fuel, other expenses and changes in accounting norms means operating profit jumped 28% from a year ago boosting return ratios. “Rental EBITDA grew strongly by 6% on account of better rental revenues and a 60 basis points margin improvement,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note. “Average rental yield increased by a strong 3% QoQ (quarter-on-quarter), attributed to loading and higher rate reset at sites that have seen terminations.""
More importantly, key parameters show signs of stabilising. Revenue per tower per month and revenue per customer per month saw notable rise from March quarter. Even the closing sharing factor which indicates tenancy, and has been on a steady decline, stabilised in the June quarter. “We are pleased to note that after negative trend in net co-locations for the last six consecutive quarters due to consolidation in the telecom industry, we had net additions in co-locations this quarter,"" Akhil Gupta, chairman, Bharti Infratel said in a statement.
However, it is not clear yet how much revenue Bharti Infratel derived as exit penalties from customers who discontinued services. Companies such as Vodafone Idea Ltd have been getting rid of duplicate tower infrastructure focusing on high paying cell sites.
A significant portion of the improvement in operating metrics is driven by Indus Towers, in which Bharti Infratel holds 42% stake. Total co-locations at the company increased 0.8% sequentially, improving the closing factor. Comparatively, co-locations at Bharti Infratel standalone level continued to decline – it was 0.3% from the March quarter.
Even so revenue per tower per month and revenue per customer per month increased at both the entities. “Bharti Infratel’s core operating performance was better on account of better-than-expected rental income, while margins were better than our expectations on lower repairs and maintenance expenses,"" ICICI Direct Research said in a note to its clients.
If the current trends hold ground, one may see a steady recovery in financial performance, partly aided by a favourable base. Last financial year, Bharti Infratel’s operating profit dropped 5.5% as it lost customers. As the company recalibrates its costs aligning its network to new technology (4G), earnings are projected to recover. “EBITDA may have bottomed out in Q1, even as we expect some pick-up in tenancy exits by Vodafone-Idea over the coming 1-2 quarters. We see room for EBITDA upgrades,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Equities Ltd said in a note to their clients. Ebitda is earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization."

New Delhi: Telecom operator Vodafone Idea has received shareholders' approval to raise its authorised share capital to  ₹50,000 crore, according to a regulatory filing by the company on Wednesday.
The increased authorised share capital provides headroom for the company to infuse additional funds.
""The members have approved increase in the authorised share capital of the company from existing  ₹3,02,93,00,20,000 (over  ₹30,293 crore) to  ₹5,00,00,00,00,000 ( ₹50,000 crore) by amending clause V of the memorandum of association,"" Vodafone Idea said in a BSE filing. The proposal was approved by over 92% shareholders in the annual general meeting of the company held on Tuesday.
The proposal to increase the share capital follows ₹25,000 crore rights issue which led to the issue of additional shares by the company.
The shareholders also approved Vodafone Idea's proposed transactions with Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers about company's plan to monetise 11.15% stake in Indus Tower.

12,2019-09-30,Bharti Infratel,"Telco explores options to sell off its entire stake to private equity fundsAirtel holds 53.51% in Bharti Infratel, while Vodafone Idea has an 11.15% stake in Indus Towers

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel Ltd is exploring the option of completely selling its stake in its tower infrastructure business to private equity funds so that it can sharpen its focus on its core business of offering wireless services, said two people familiar with the plan.
A stake sale in the merged entity combining its telecom tower unit, Bharti Infratel Ltd, and Indus Towers Ltd may, however, take place only when valuations improve from the current subdued levels, said one of the two people cited above.
A potential deal will allow India’s second-largest telecom operator by revenue to reinforce its war chest to take on market leader Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in this intensely competitive market. Since its entry in September 2016, Jio, the telecom arm of Reliance Industries Ltd, has rattled incumbents with a brutal price war, forcing them to either merge or exit.
“Some of the private equity funds are trying to come together to buy a majority stake in Airtel’s tower assets as these are usually yield-generating and operating them isn’t very complex,"" the first person said on condition of anonymity. “All the three telcos (Jio, Vodafone Idea and Airtel) are trying to reduce their respective stakes in this business, while Bharti in the long term is looking for a complete exit.""
Jio’s strategy to garner subscribers through cheap data has prompted rivals to pump in funds in the cash-guzzling telecom business. As of 30 June, Airtel had a consolidated net debt of  ₹1.16 trillion.
“Sunil Mittal is very clear that he wants to compete fiercely with Jio. He will hence divest all non-core infrastructure and put money into mobile network and compete,"" the second person said, requesting anonymity. “But the tower stake sale may take some time as currently valuations don’t look too great. This isn’t the ideal time to sell. The tower stake sale will happen when prices improve.""
Bharti Airtel did not respond to an emailed query sent by Mint on Monday.
“It makes sense for them to completely exit the tower business as they won’t be a majority stakeholder in the merged entity anyway,"" a Mumbai-based analyst said on condition of anonymity. “Based on current market cap, Airtel would be able to raise at least  ₹35,000 crore if it sells all its stake in the Indus-Infratel merged entity. They can use this to reduce debt so that they are in a better position to raise money for 5G.""
Airtel said in November 2017 that it had been approached by a few “global investors"" to buy a significant stake in its tower unit, Bharti Infratel. If their interests are accepted, this “could result in such investors acquiring control of Bharti Infratel"", the company had said then.
Airtel currently holds 53.51% in Bharti Infratel. The remaining stake is held by domestic and foreign investors.
To be sure, Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers are in the final phase of completing their merger and only government approval is pending. Indus Towers was started as a joint venture between Vodafone India, Bharti Infratel and Idea Cellular.
The two tower companies had in April last year agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest telecom tower company outside China. The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower Corp. Ltd.
Once the merger is completed, Airtel will hold between 33.8% and 37.2% in the merged entity. Vodafone Group Plc will own between 26.7% and 29.4%. Airtel and Vodafone will have equal rights in the merged entity.
Vodafone Idea’s 11.15% stake in Indus Towers had an implied value of  ₹5,630 crore as of June-end, which it plans to monetize on completion, the telecom firm said on 29 July.
Airtel and its rival operators need to raise cash ahead of a planned auction of airwaves in January by the telecommunications department for the launch of 5G services. The operators are already saddled with a mountain of debt, largely due to spectrum-related dues to the government.
Raising more funds is critical for Airtel as its revenue from the domestic wireless business was  ₹10,724 crore for the June quarter. Reliance Jio, in comparison, generated  ₹11,679 crore in operating revenue in the same quarter."

New Delhi: The merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers has been hit by a delay due to to delay in securing government approvals and a new committee will now explore “all possible options"".
“The scheme (of merger) contemplated the closing by October 24, 2019 (long stop date), by which time a large number of processes and conditions precedent were required to be completed, which included but were not limited to all requisite Government approvals and filings,"" Bharti Infratel said in an exchange filing on Monday.
“The Board noted that all the requisite government approvals have not been received till date and conditions precedent and processes not completed. It therefore concluded that it is not possible to complete the scheme by the long stop date. Accordingly, the Board authorized a Committee of Directors to explore and evaluate all possible options to secure the best interests of the company and its shareholders under the current facts and circumstances,"" the company told the exchanges.
The companies had aimed to complete the merger by August, Bharti Infratel Chairman Akhil Gupta had told analysts at a post-earnings conference call in July.
The two tower companies had in April last year agreed to merge their businesses to create the world’s largest tower company outside China. The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower. The merged company will be listed on the stock exchanges as Bharti Infratel is a publicly traded company. Its nearest rival in India will be ATC, which has 78,000 towers.
The merger will help Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group, promoters of Indus Towers, to sell their stake, bring down debt and invest in their wireless operations in India, which has been facing the heat of a tariff war started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.
Bimal Dayal, chief executive officer, Indus Towers, and Hemant Ruia, chief financial officer, Indus Towers, have been appointed CEO and CFO, respectively, of the merged entity of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel.
Dayal, who had joined Indus Towers as its chief operating officer in 2010, will now be responsible for the combined business and will take forward integration of the two companies in preparation of the merger. He has previously worked with Ericsson and Qualcomm."

“The delay in getting this approval is because of the procedure involved,"" he added.
Gupta’s statement comes a day after Bharti Infratel informed the stock exchanges that its board had noted that all the requisite government approvals had not been received till date, and conditions precedent and processes were not completed.
“Accordingly, the board authorized a committee of directors to explore and evaluate all possible options to secure the best interests of the company and its shareholders under the current facts and circumstances,"" the company told the exchanges on Monday.

Embassy Office Parks, Actis, others bid for Mapletree’s tech park
Singapore-based real estate asset manager Mapletree Investment Pte. Ltd has received bids of  ₹2,300-2,400 crore for its Global Technology Park in Bengaluru from Embassy Office Parks, UK-based Actis Llp, and Singapore’s GIC Pte. Ltd, among others, Mint reported citing three people familiar with the transaction. This reflects significant global interest in rent-yielding office assets in India. The bids, submitted in two rounds, are being shortlisted, the people mentioned above said on condition of anonymity. Mapletree started its second innings in India last year, acquiring Chennai-based information technology park SP Infocity for  ₹2,400 crore. Its only previous investment was made in 2011, when it bought Assetz Global Technology Park, now known as Global Technology Park, for  ₹800 crore from the Mapletree India China Fund. Embassy Office Parks, which owns India’s first listed real estate investment trust (REIT) and is a joint venture between Blackstone Group Lp and Embassy Group, has offered  ₹2,300 crore to buy the park.

Manjushree plans to fast track growth via M&A
Private equity firm Advent International-backed Manjushree Technopack Ltd. has outlined a strategy to increase sales through acquisitions. In October 2018, Advent International acquired a majority stake in the rigid plastic packaging maker in a transaction that valued it at over  ₹2,400 crore. Advent currently holds about 77% in the company. Its former promoter, the Kedia family, holds 20% while 3% is held by other smaller parties. The polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based packaging maker’s growth strategy aims to triple its revenue to  ₹3,200 crore in the next four years through acquisitions and organic growth. The company currently makes PET jars and bottles, multilayer containers, PET hot-fillable bottles, and pre-forms for use in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical, cosmetic, agricultural chemicals, and allied sectors. The firm plans to add  ₹1,000 crore worth of sales through acquisitions in the next four years. The firm expects to close its first acquisition in the coming weeks and the next acquisition will close in six months. There will also be two to three more acquisitions in the next fiscal. This is not the first time Manjushree has set its sights on expanding market share through acquisitions. In 2016, it acquired five facilities of a Delhi-based rival, Varahi Ltd.

B2B firm Zetwerk in talks to raise $35 million
Zetwerk, a business-to-business marketplace for custom manufacturing, is in talks to raise $35 million as part of its series B equity financing round, led by venture capital firms Lightspeed Venture Partners and Greenoaks Capital, Mint reported citing two people close to the deal. The Series B round will also see participation from its existing VC investors, Sequoia Capital, Accel Partners and Kae Capital. Founded in 2018 by Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras alumni Amrit Acharya and Srinath Ramakkrushnan, the firm procures manufacturing services such as fabrication, machining, casting and forging from small and medium companies and connects them to mid-to-large OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and engineering, procurement and construction firms in India and South-East Asia. Zetwerk works primarily with clients in the oil and gas, power, renewable energy and infrastructure businesses. Zetwerk last raised $9 million in a Series A round from Accel, Sequoia and Kae in March 2019. It followed a $1.2 million seed funding round from Kae and Sequoia in August 2018.
PayU eyes MobiKwik’s payment gateway
Naspers-owned digital payments major PayU has held discussions to acquire MobiKwik’s payment gateway business, valuing it around $45-50 million and signalling consolidation efforts in the hyper competitive sector, The Economic Times reported citing two people in the know of the matter. Other strategic and financial investors are also in talks to buy the fintech firm’s payment business. MobiKwik is fighting a broader battle against deep-pocketed rivals such as Paytm, Flipkart-owned PhonePe and Google Pay in a highly competitive digital payments sector. Its payment gateway subsidiary, Zaakpay, has been looking for fresh funding for a fairly long time, having held discussions with potential investors. A lack of investor interest may have been the reason why MobiKwik decided to put its payment business on the block. Two of the biggest sources of transactions for MobiKwik’s payments gateway business are ride hailing firm Uber and its own mobile wallet business One MobiKwik. These businesses account for 90% of the transactions on the MobiKwik payment gateway. This deal will further reinstate the leadership position that PayU has in the payment gateway space and give them access to card transactions happening on Uber, which will be a big win.
Can’t Close Merger with Indus Towers by Oct 24: Bharti Infratel Board
The board of Bharti Infratel said it was not possible to complete its merger with Indus Towers by October 24, given the still-required government approvals, throwing away the deal which would have created among the world’s largest telecom tower companies into disarray, The Economic Times reported. The development also puts a cloud on the hopes of Vodafone Idea, its co-parent Vodafone Group of UK and Bharti Airtel — joint owners of Indus Towers — of raising funds by divesting stake in the merged entity, say analysts. Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, currently holding 11.15% in Indus Towers, was banking on an exit at the time of merger to raise over  ₹5,500 crore to fund its future network expansion needs to compete against Airtel and Reliance Jio. In a release issued on Monday, the board of Bharti Airtel’s telecom unit said it has set up a panel of directors to advise by Thursday on the future steps needed to be taken by the tower company to “secure"" the interests of its shareholders. The board noted that all the requisite government approvals have not been received till date and conditions precedent and processes not completed. It, therefore, concluded that it is not possible to complete the scheme by the long stop date. As per the merger terms, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Plc — which currently own 42% each in Indus Towers — were expected to hold 37.2% and 29.4%, respectively, in the merged entity. KKR and Canada Pension Plan Investment board were expected to own a combined 6%, stemming from their stake of over 10% in Bharti Infratel. US-based asset management firm Providence Equity Partners was also likely to join Vodafone Idea in selling stakes in Indus Towers for roughly  ₹2,000 crore."

Infosys: An anonymous group of employees has accused the management of taking “unethical"" steps to boost short-term revenue and profits. The group, which calls itself “ethical employees"", has complained to the board of Infosys Ltd and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The whistleblower complaint triggered a massive sell off in the company’s American depositary receipts (ADRs) on Monday. Indian financial markets were shut on Monday.
Piramal Enterprises: The firm on Monday reported a 15.3% rise in its net profit to  ₹554 crore for July-September on the back of a robust performance in its pharma and healthcare business. The Mumbai-based diversified conglomerate saw its revenue jump 18% to  ₹3603.56 crore during the second quarter. Its financial services business grew 13% on year due to a three-fold increase in housing loan book.
Yes Bank: Shares of the private lender had surged more than 8% on Friday after a news report suggested that industrialists Sunil Mittal and Sunil Munjal were interested in buying stake in the bank. However, the bank declined commenting on the news as it was not aware of the source, it said in an exchange filing. The stock has seen its value erode due to concerns around the bank’s stressed financials.
DHFL: A forensic audit of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd, conducted by accounting firm KPMG and submitted to the lenders of the debt-ridden mortgage lender last week, has revealed several gaps in the financials, according to a Mint report. The new disclosures can jeopardise the ongoing resolution process.

BPCL: Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total SA and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. are among companies that have had conversations with the Indian government on asset sales and are likely to bid for the government’s stake in Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd. The privatization of BPCL is expected to attract global energy majors given that India is the world’s fastest-growing major oil market.

Automotive, constructive and packaging are the key UK markets for Tata Steel BSL Ltd.
Wipro: The company plans to promote around 5,000 employees in the coming quarters to check attrition and make the firm future-ready, according to a Business Standard report. For the quarter ended September, the Bengaluru-based company’s attrition rate stood at 17%, 60 basis points sequentially.

IHH Healthcare to exit two hospital JVs in India
Caught in the legal crosshairs that has put its Fortis acquisition in a limbo even after a year of its announcement, Malaysia’s IHH Healthcare is planning to reduce its India footprint by selling two major assets back to their original founder-promoters, The Economic Times reported citing multiple people aware of the development. It has initiated discussions to cash out of its 62.2% stake in Hyderabad-based Continental Hospitals and 74% in Global Hospitals back to the promoter family. Hyderabad based Continental Hospital has a capacity of 750 beds while Global Hospitals has a capacity of over 2,000 beds under hospitals in Hyderabad, Chennai, Bengaluru and Mumbai. IHH is believed to be open to divesting its stakes at almost half the value at which it originally bought them. Continental’s founder Gurunath Reddy and family has been trying to rope in a strategic partner who can help in buying back shares from the Malaysian group. Dr Ravindranath of Global Hospitals has been in talks with various private equity investors for backing his buyback transactions. Alleged mismanagement and differences between promoters and IHH are the major reasons behind IHH’s move to exit. The performances of these chains have also come down in the recent past.

Chairman Akhil Gupta said lack of a key government approval has held up the process, making it impossible to complete the merger by 24 October. The companies had earlier aimed to complete the merger by August.
HCL Tech: The stock was the top gainer among Nifty 50 companies. The IT major reported its earnings for the September quarter on Wednesday. It posted a 6.9% year-on-year rise in net profit to Ra 2,711 crore during the reporting quarter. The company had recorded a net profit of  ₹2,534 crore a year ago. It has also announced a bonus share offer. Shares traded up nearly 3%.
MTNL: The Cabinet on Wednesday approved the proposed merger of debt-ridden telecom firms BSNL Ltd and MTNL Ltd. The merger is part of the revival package that includes raising sovereign bonds worth  ₹15,000 crore, monetising  ₹38,000 crore of assets in the next four years and a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) for employees. Until the merger is completed, MTNL will operate as a subsidiary of BSNL. Shares of the telecom operator traded nearly 5% higher.
Biocon: The pharmaceutical major posted a 39% slump in its consolidated net profit for July-September at  ₹216 crores primarily due to the presence of a large one-time gain in the corresponding quarter last year.

Separately, the company said it received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for Fexodenadine Hydrochloride tablets, used to treat allergy symptoms.

Here is a list of top stocks that are buzzing in early trade on Friday.
Indigo: Shares of Interglobe Aviation Ltd, which runs India’s largest budget airline Indigo, slumped more than 9% in early deals after the company reported its first quarterly loss during the current fiscal due to higher maintenance and overhaul costs that outweighed an increase in passenger traffic. It posted a loss of  ₹1,062 crore in the September quarter as against a loss of  ₹652 crore a year ago.
SBI: The stock of the country’s largest public-sector lender recovered from Thursday’s loss and rose more than 2% ahead of its September quarter earnings to be released later today. Shares had fallen after the SC upheld the department of communications’ (DoT) definition of adjusted gross revenue (AGR), dealing a severe blow to telecom companies. The bank has huge exposure to the sector and more financial stress for telecom companies would increase the risk of fresh bad loans for the lender.
Bharti Infratel: Shares fell for the second consecutive session as its merger with Indus Tower has been delayed by two more months to 24 December. Chairman Akhil Gupta had said lack of a key government approval has held up the process, making it impossible to complete the merger by 24 October. The companies had earlier aimed to complete the process by August. The stock plunged nearly 9%.
Vodafone Idea: After crashing 23% on Thursday, the stock pared some losses and traded down 6% in early deals. There are concerns over the telecom operator shutting down as investors anticipated that it will not be able to meet its payment obligations under the DoT’s definition of AGR. Vodafone Idea Ltd alone has to pay a massive  ₹28,308 crore as the SC ruled in favour of the government.
Tata Motors: Shares traded down more than 2% ahead of the September earnings to be released later today. Investors are treading cautiously as the numbers will be announced at a time when the auto sector has been grappling with severe demand slowdown. The company’s sales had nearly halved to 36,376 units in September from 69,991 a year ago.
Castrol India: Shares of the automotive and industrial lubricant maker extended gains from Thursday, rising nearly 3% in early deals as it reported a 25% growth in its net profit at  ₹188.4 crore in the quarter-ended September. The company had posted a net profit of  ₹150.4 crore in the same period last fiscal. It also announced the appointment of Sandeep Sangwan as the managing director from 1 January, 2020."

Shares of Bharti Infratel Ltd slumped 9% on Tuesday, taking the cumulative losses since the Supreme Court (SC) verdict on licence fees to 25%.
Last week, the apex court ruled that telecom operators need to pay the government licence fee dues, along with penalties, totalling  ₹92,000 crore.
Traders and investors fear the new payouts may worsen the already precarious financial condition of Vodafone Idea Ltd, pushing it to bankruptcy. The ruling pegs the collective liability of Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea, the major tenants of Bharti Infratel, at  ₹50,000 crore.

The exact liabilities are not clear yet. Even so, the prospect of large payouts are making stakeholders worried. Bharti Airtel delayed its September quarter results to determine the exact liability.
Analysts at two domestic broking firms fear that the payouts may weigh on the already slow progress of capital investments at telcos. Vodafone Idea, whose cash levels are depleting, is expected to curtail investments, impacting Bharti Infratel’s growth, warns one analyst.
The latest financial results and technological innovations corroborate the view. Though tenancies stabilized last quarter, the company is not seeing a pick-up in tenancy additions. In fact, net tenancy additions dropped from 523 in June to 159 last quarter. “Tower addition was at its highest level in the past 15 months, but tenancy additions were muted as exits continue,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
As a consequence, financial performance remains lacklustre. Sequential revenues were down 2% last quarter. Operating profit was down 3.5% from the June quarter.
Meanwhile, telcos, faced with earnings pressure, are giving preference to network enhancement through multiple input multiple output (mimo) and small cell techniques, rather than linear expansion, analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said. This, combined with the fact that the network coverage of the new entrant, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, has already reached optimal levels, means that the scope of fresh investments may remain low for the near term.
“With Bharti Airtel the only telco operator that is likely to provide any further tenancies, the likelihood of growth in tenancies for Bharti Infratel is muted, in our view,"" SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a results review note last week.
“We are factoring in further tenancy declines as we expect Vodafone-Idea to remain in cost-conscious mode over the next 2-3 quarters at the least,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities added."

New Delhi: Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel and private equity firm Varde Partners have submitted their bids for assets of debt-laden Reliance Communications, while Reliance Jio has sought extension of the asset sale deal deadline by another 10 days.
Airtel has placed conditional bid to buy spectrum of RCom while Bharti Infratel has submitted bids for mobile towers, a Bharti spokesperson said.
Banking sources involved in the process told PTI that a total of six bids have come for assets of Anil Ambani-led RCom on Monday.
""Six bids have come for assets of Reliance Communications. This includes bid from Bharti Airtel, Bharti Infratel, private equity firm Varde Partners. RCom committee of creditors is scheduled to meet on November 13, 2019 to take call on the bids opening,"" a banking source said.
Reliance Jio did not comment on the email query.
""The bid conditions include that the overall consideration will primarily be by way of the deferred spectrum payables to the government being passed on to us on terms and schedules applicable to such deferred payments,"" Bharti Airtel spokesperson said.
Apart from real assets, RCom telecom assets on sale include spectrum holding of 122 MHz which the company before insolvency proceedings had estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, towers business for  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.
Sources estimate that RCom Group's total secured debt is around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claim of around  ₹49,000 crore in August. 
Reliance Group companies have sued HT Media Ltd, Mint’s publisher, and nine others in the Bombay high court over a 2 October 2014 front-page story that they have disputed. HT Media is contesting the case.

NEW DELHI :
A day after it posted a staggering  ₹50,921 crore loss for the September quarter, Vodafone Idea on Friday said it believes the government is aware of the ""tremendous stress"" being faced by telcos and wants a healthy sector with three private and one public operator.
In a post-earnings investor call, Vodafone Idea CEO Ravinder Takkar said the company has been engaging ""very positively"" with the government and that its discussions on telecom stress began even before the AGR ruling was pronounced by the Supreme Court.
""In our engagements...the response of the government has been very consistent. They said they want this sector to be healthy, it is a very strategic sector, too important for the country, too important for Digital India vision...Secondly, they have said to us that they want to see three private players and one public sector player in this sector,"" Takkar said.
The company believes the Centre is looking at a ""comprehensive solution"" for the sector with an aim to restore the industry's health, he said.
""We hope to hear something from them very soon,"" he added.
On a specific question on minimum tariff fixation, Takkar said he did not wish to speculate on how floor price mechanism can be implemented.
""We know it is in the purview of the regulator and government and it can be implemented...We know it has been done in certain other countries in the region, but I don't want to speculate on what they would implement or how they would implement,"" he said.
Vodafone Idea Ltd (VIL) plans to monetise its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers on completion of the Indus Towers-Bharti Infratel merger, and is also exploring options to monetise nearly 160,000 kms of intra-city and inter-city fibre as well as data centre.
Akshaya Moondra, chief financial officer of VIL, said the company continues to remain engaged with its financial creditors but asserted that there is no acceleration of payment which has happened.
""From time to time, some banks have requested us if we could pre-pay them any amount...we have declined that. We continue to remain engaged with all our financial creditors but there is no acceleration of payment that has happened,"" he said.
On vendor finance, Moondra said the company has strong vendor partners and that ""they are already supporting us through vendor financing route"".
Vodafone Idea on Thursday reported a consolidated loss of  ₹50,921 crore -- the highest ever loss posted by any Indian corporate -- for the September quarter on account of liability arising out of the Supreme Court's order in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) case.
The Supreme Court, last month, ruled in favour of the government and directed telecom companies, including Vodafone Idea, to pay dues as demanded by the Department of Telecom.
Vodafone Idea has said its ability to continue business will depend on relief sought from the government and positive outcome of the legal option it has (filing of a review petition).
It said the company, through the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), has made representations to the government to provide relief to the telecom sector.
This includes request to not press for the AGR liability payment and grant waivers, not levying spectrum usage charges (SUC) on non-licenced revenue, reduction of licence fee and SUC rates and use of GST credit for payment of government levies.
The industry body has requested the government to allow payment to be made in installments after some moratorium, and grant a moratorium of two years for the payment of spectrum dues beyond April 1, 2020 up to March 31, 2022."

NEW DELHI :
The BSE Telecom index was up 7% on Friday in the afternoon trade, tracking strong operational performance of the telecom companies in the second quarter ended September 30. At 1320, Bharti Airtel shares were trading at  ₹386 a piece, 6.5% up from the previous close. Vodafone Idea shares were 4% at  ₹3.08 per share. Bharti Infratel stock was 5.7% up at  ₹220.55 per share.
While Vodafone Idea’s September quarter loss of  ₹50,921 crore was its biggest, the company’s revenue from operations surged more than 37% at  ₹10,844 crore in the same quarter last year.
While provisions of  ₹28,450 crore forced Bharti Airtel to report a loss of  ₹23,044 crore in July-September, its second quarterly loss in 14 years and also its highest ever, the company’s consolidated revenue from operations grew 4.9% from a year earlier to  ₹21,131 crore in the last concluded quarter.
Last month, the Supreme Court (SC) had rejected the contention of telecom operators to exclude revenue from non-core telecom operations such as rent, dividend and interest income. The order marked the end of a 14-year legal tussle between the department of telecommunications (DoT) and telecom operators.
Vodafone Idea is staring at an insolvency, the top management of the two partners in the company, Vodafone and Idea, having suggested that there will be no further equity infusion. Vodafone retracted the statement later.
The entry of Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio in 2016 disrupted the market with free data and voice offerings, shrinking revenue streams of all operators like Vodafone and Bharti while forcing others to fold up."
9,2019-11-26,Bharti Infratel,"I Squared Capital, Varde Partners and UV Asset Reconstruction are also said to have bid for the assetsReliance Communications’ assets include spectrum, towers, fibre, data centres and real estate housed under its subsidiaries Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd and Bharti Airtel Ltd on Monday submitted bids for assets of bankrupt Reliance Communications Ltd and its two units, two people aware of the matter said.
Monday was the last day for submitting bids, 10 days after insolvency resolution professional Anish Niranjan Nanavaty of Deloitte India extended the previous deadline.
Airtel and Bharti Infratel, which had earlier bid together for RCom, are likely to have bid jointly again. That bid was withdrawn in protest against the deadline extension made on the request of Reliance Jio.
Spokespersons for Airtel and Reliance Jio declined to comment on the bids.
The Economic Times also named private equity (PE) investors I Squared Capital, Varde Partners and UV Asset Reconstruction Co. Ltd as bidding, but this could not be confirmed.
“We are bound by confidentiality obligations and are unable to comment on client-specific matters,"" a Deloitte India spokesperson said in an email to Mint.
China Development Bank, Life Insurance Corp. of India, State Bank of India, Exim Bank of China and Bank of Baroda are among the 41 creditors to the beleaguered Anil Ambani group company.
According to information available on the company’s website, it owed financial creditors  ₹49,193.46 crore at the time of being taken to bankruptcy court in May last year.
The company’s subsidiaries are Reliance Telecom Ltd and Reliance Infratel Ltd. They owe financial creditors  ₹24,306.27 crore and  ₹12,687.65 crore, respectively. Reliance Communications thus owes debtors  ₹86,187.58 crore at a consolidated level. This is besides  ₹28,837 crore it owes to the department of telecommunications (DoT) in spectrum dues and other charges as well as the amounts it has to pay its operational creditors.
Reliance Communications’ assets include spectrum, towers, fibre, data centres and real estate housed under its subsidiaries Reliance Telecom and Reliance Infratel.
Reliance Jio, promoted by Anil’s elder brother Mukesh Ambani, had last year agreed to buy the assets of Reliance Communications that included its spectrum, 43,000 telecom towers and 178,000 route km of optic fibre. The deal failed to secure the requisite clearance from the DoT.
The resolution professional had on 13 November received bids from firms including the Airtel-Bharti Infratel combine and PE firm Varde Partners.
Anil Ambani had on 16 November, along with four other directors, resigned from the company. But the lenders rejected the resignations on Sunday, requesting Ambani and the other officials to cooperate in the ongoing insolvency resolution proceedings.
The company had pioneered CDMA services in the country when Mukesh Ambani ran it, before he handed it to younger brother Anil after the two brothers split family assets under a 2005 agreement. As its fortunes dwindled and cut-throat competition eroded margins in the sector, the company considered selling its assets, a process more than five years in the making. The entry of Reliance Jio in 2016, which came with free voice services bundled with ultra cheap data, sounded the death knell for the company.
The company, unable to bear the onslaught of Jio, shut its mobile voice operations in December 2017, then choosing to offer only data services.
Reliance Communications, once part of the National Stock Exchange’s Nifty index, is now reduced to a penny stock. It shot up 6.7% on Monday to close the session at 80 paise, spurred by reports of various firms showing interest in its assets."
8,2019-11-29,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Airtel has also made conditional bid for spectrum of Reliance Communications (RCom)RCom's secured debt is estimated to be around  ₹33,000 crore

NEW DELHI :
Reliance Jio has emerged as the highest bidder for mobile tower and optical fibre assets of Reliance Infratel by placing bids of around  ₹3,600 crore, according to banking sources privy to the development.
Bharti Airtel has placed a bid of around  ₹1,800 crore for the same, according to the sources.
""Reliance Infratel's tower and fibre is likely to go to Reliance Jio as its bid of  ₹3,600 crore is the highest and the company has committed to make the payment in 60 days. Bharti Airtel has placed a bid of  ₹1,800 crore for the same,"" a banking source said.
Another source privy to the development said the process of finalising the bids will take a minimum of one-two weeks as committee of creditors (CoC) will meet all the bidders and negotiate with them and then vote on it.
Bharti Airtel has also made conditional bid for spectrum of Reliance Communications (RCom).
The sources said the conditions placed by Bharti Airtel will make it difficult for the resolution professional (RP) to close the process by January 10 as directed by the National Company Law Tribunal.
Reliance Jio did not bid for RCom spectrum.
VFSI Holdings Pte Ltd and UV Asset Reconstruction Company Limited have also submitted their bids for the assets of RCom.
RCom's secured debt is estimated to be around  ₹33,000 crore. Lenders have submitted claims of around  ₹49,000 crore in August.
Reliance Communications, which is undergoing insolvency proceedings, has put all its assets for sale, which include spectrum holding of 122 MHz that the company before insolvency proceedings estimated to be around  ₹14,000 crore, tower business worth  ₹7,000 crore, optical fibre network worth  ₹3,000 crore and data centres worth  ₹4,000 crore.
According to an NCLT order, RP has to complete the process by January 10, 2020.
RCom in the past has tried to sell assets to various companies, including Reliance Jio, to clear debts but the deals did not crystallise. Reliance Jio cancelled the agreement to buy RCom assets as it did not want to bear the previous liabilities of the debt-ridden firm.
Later, the insolvency proceeding against RCom was started on a plea filed by Swedish telecom gear maker Ericsson after the company failed to clear its dues.
RCom Chairman Anil Ambani had tendered his resignation after the company posted a consolidated loss of  ₹30,142 crore for July-September 2019 due to provisioning for liabilities after the Supreme Court ruling on statutory dues.
This was the second-highest loss posted by any Indian company till date.
The CoC has, however, rejected Ambani's resignation and asked to cooperate in insolvency proceedings."

Vodafone Idea: The telecom operator announced a hike in mobile calls and data charges from December 3. Voda Idea has announced new plans for prepaid product and services with 2 days, 28 days, 84 days, 365 days validity.

Stocks of Grasim Industries and Hindalco, promoters of Vodafone Idea, may also react to the latest hike in tariffs.
Reliance Jio: Come 6 December, Reliance Jio will raise mobile services rates by up to 40%. ""New 'All in One' plans across multiple price points, with unlimited voice and data, to meet the needs of all customer segments.

RBL Bank: Private sector lender RBL Bank, on Saturday, said it has approved raising of  ₹825.79 crore worth equity capital by way of preferential allotment to five investors. The bank’s board has agreed to allot 24.24 million shares at  ₹340.70 apiece.
Auto Stocks: The auto majors on Sunday posted a drop in their sales numbers. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MSIL) recorded a 2% year-on-year (YoY) drop in its total wholesales in November, while Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M) reported a 9% YoY decline. Tata Motors also reported a 25% YoY decline its domestic wholesale volumes for November at 38,057 units.
Axis Bank: The private sector lender is setting aside more capital, more than twice over the regulatory requirements, for loans in sectors it has identified as stressed, according to a PTI report. The high level of NPAs and the ensuing provisioning have impacted the profits of a majority of lenders, including Axis Bank, over the past four years.
DHFL: The RBI on Friday referred Dewan Housing Finance Corp. Ltd (DHFL), which has a debt of  ₹83,873 crore, to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings. DHFL is the first financial services firm to be sent to the bankruptcy tribunal after the government notified the rules for referring financial services providers (FSPs) on 15 November.
NBCC: State-owned NBCC Ltd is likely to offer more land to lenders and reduce timeline for completion of about 20,000 flats in its final bid to acquire bankrupt realty firm Jaypee Infratech.

6,2019-12-16,Bharti Infratel,"Deal values firm’s subsidiary Tower Infrastructure Trust at  ₹55,400 croreTower Infra Trust will own 100% of the issued and paid-up shares of Reliance Jio Infratel after the deal

Reliance Industries Ltd’s wholly owned subsidiary, Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd, has entered into binding agreements with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP and its institutional partners for an investment of  ₹25,215 crore in the units to be issued by Tower Infrastructure Trust, its tower arm, the company said in a filing to the exchanges on Monday.
The deal is in line with the overall objective of RIL, the parent of India’s only profitable telecom operator Reliance Jio, to reduce debt in its high-capex telecom business and increase focus on building its digital services portfolio.
Reliance had in July announced that it was in talks with Brookfield and that the transaction closure was subject to completion of due diligence, documentation, and statutory and regulatory approvals. This is the single largest foreign investment in an Indian infrastructure vehicle, the company had said in July.
Before this announcement in July, tower and fiber passive infrastructure assets of approximately  ₹1.25 trillion were demerged from Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in March 2019 to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs).
The fibre and tower undertakings, Jio Digital Fibre Pvt. Ltd and Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt. Ltd respectively, operate as independent entities with transfer of control to the Securities and Exchange Board of India registered Infrastructure Investment Trusts.
On Monday, Reliance said that at the closing of the transaction, the Tower Infrastructure Trust will own 100% of the issued and paid up equity share capital of Reliance Jio Infratel Pvt. Ltd, which has 130,000 communication towers in its portfolio. The company plans to take the total number of towers to 175,000. The Brookfield deal values the tower assets undertaking at  ₹55,400 crore.
Jio will be the anchor tenant of the tower portfolio under a 30-year master services agreement, Reliance said on Monday.
RIL is also simultaneously engaged with potential investors to divest stake in its fibre assets.
The tower stake deal will give more firepower to Jio in the telecom battlefield at a time when its loss-making rivals Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea await government clearance for the merger of Indus Towers and Bharti Infratel. This merger will help Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Group Plc, promoters of Indus Towers, to sell their stake, bring down debt and invest in wireless operations in India, which have been facing the heat of a tariff war started with the entry of Reliance Jio in September 2016.
The merger is stuck because of a delay in securing approvals and a committee set up in October extended the long stop date to 24 December.
As the merger is contingent upon receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfilment of other conditions, there can be no assurance that the merger can be completed within the extended time-frame, Bharti Infratel had informed the BSE on 24 October."
5,2019-12-23,Bharti Infratel,"The Bharti Infratel-Indus Towers merger is expected to create the world’s second largest tower firmThe merger is crucial as it will help promoters Airtel and Voda Idea sell stake to raise funds

NEW DELHI :
The merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, pegged to create the world’s second largest tower company, hangs in balance with a key government approval pertaining to FDI enhancement not coming in time.
The board of Bharti Infratel will meet on Tuesday and is likely to take a decision on a second extension for the long stop date in order for the companies to secure this approval, to complete the merger that was announced back in April 2018.
“If the board feels more time is needed (to secure government approval) then it (long stop date) may be extended further or else various other options can be looked at,"" a person familiar with the matter told Mint.
To be sure, in October a special committee by Bharti Infratel had extended the long stop date to 24 December.
The merger is crucial as it will help loss-making telecom companies Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea sell stake to raise funds in the competitive telecom battleground, especially at a time when they have to pay huge dues to the department of telecommunications after an unfavourable court verdict in October.
Bharti Airtel has set aside  ₹34,260 crore and Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore in the September quarter after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of revenue based on which telecom companies pay levies.
“Since the merger (of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers) is contingent upon receipt of regulatory approvals and fulfilment of other conditions, there can be no assurance that the process can be completed within the extended time-frame,"" Bharti Infratel had informed the BSE in October.
“There are high chances that the deal could fall through and then all shareholders will have to monetise towers assets separately,"" another person aware of the matter said requesting anonymity.
Emails sent to DoT and Vodafone Idea were unanswered till press time. The spokesperson for Bharti Airtel declined to comment on the query.
Even if the two tower companies get a second extension of the long stop date, which is key to completing the merger, monetizing stake in tower assets is likely to be difficult at this stage even if the merger goes through, as there are clouds of uncertainty on Vodafone Idea’s future.
At the Hindustan Times Leadership earlier this month, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said that the group’s telecom unit, Vodafone Idea, will have to “shut shop"" if there was no relief from the government following the Supreme Court ruling requiring it to pay statutory dues of  ₹40,000 crore to the DoT within three months.
“The valuation of tower assets is also directly dependent on its anchor tenants. Since Vodafone Idea will be an anchor tenant of the proposed merged entity, any potential investor will wait for clarity whether government will offer relief on the AGR case,"" an industry executive said requesting anonymity.
The two tower companies had in April last year agreed to merge their businesses. The combined entity will own more than 163,000 towers, second only to China Tower. Airtel and Vodafone India will have equal rights in the merged entity.
The Economic Times on Monday reported that the merger was delayed due to the proposal being stuck at the Department of Revenue because of the concerns over the withholding tax case against Vodafone Group which are yet to be resolved.
“Under the tax withholding case, it is the shareholder’s (Vodafone Plc) liability and hence it doesn’t make sense for the government to hold up the Indus-Infratel merger, if it is a tax neutral merger, as the company involved here is Indus Towers and not the shareholder. Even if the merger goes through, because of the AGR verdict, it would make little sense for any investor to be keen at telecom assets currently given the huge dues payable by operators who are promoters of these tower companies,"" Sumit Mangal, Partner, L&L Partners, said."

“The board has further extended the long stop date till February 24, 2020, subject to agreement on closing adjustments and other conditions precedent for closing, with each party retaining the right to terminate and withdraw the scheme,"" the company informed the exchanges.
Bharti Infratel also said that since the completion of merger is contingent upon receipt of requisite regulatory approvals and fulfilment of other conditions precedent, there can be no assurance that the merger can be completed within the extended time-frame.
The merger of Bharti Infratel and Indus Towers, pegged to create the world’s second largest tower company after China Tower, hangs in balance with a key government approval pertaining to enhancement in foreign direct investment not coming in time.
The merger is crucial as it will help loss-making telecom companies Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea sell stake to raise funds in the competitive telecom battleground, especially at a time when they have to pay huge dues to the department of telecommunications after an unfavourable court verdict in October.
Bharti Airtel has set aside  ₹34,260 crore and Vodafone Idea has made provisions for  ₹25,677.9 crore in the September quarter after the Supreme Court upheld the government’s definition of revenue based on which telecom companies pay levies."

1,2019-12-26,Bharti Infratel,"Bharti Infratel extended the long stop gap date for its merger with Indus Towers, yet againGiven the delays in approvals some fear the company may call off the merger all together

Bharti Infratel Ltd’s decision to extend the long stop date of its proposed merger with Indus Towers Ltd again does not come as a surprise. The stock gained 0.4% against a 0.7% decline in the Nifty on Thursday.
In fact, the management commentary is leading to the belief that the merger may be called off eventually. Bharti Infratel has said the merger is contingent upon receipt of regulatory approvals and there can be no assurance that the merger can be completed in the extended time-frame.
“Considering it has been challenging to secure merger-related permissions over the past 18-20 months, we believe Bharti Infratel could call off the merger,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.
The impact will be felt by key shareholders of both companies—Bharti Airtel Ltd and Vodafone Idea Ltd. More so by Vodafone Idea, as the company is banking upon selling its stake in the combined entity to raise funds for its India mobile services business.
For Bharti Infratel, which also holds a stake in Indus Towers, the opportunity to enhance its financial returns through better management of taxes as a combined entity (however meagre these benefits maybe) will be lost.
Importantly, the merger would have created a large telecom tower firm, which would have made it easier to raise fresh funds or sell stakes to new investors, said an analyst at a domestic broking firm, requesting anonymity. Of course, given the state of the Indian telecom industry, investors are broadly shying away from the sector. The Bharti Infratel stock has been a laggard, losing about 30% of its value in the past two years.
The concerns are not unfounded. Exit of small telecom companies from the Indian market and consolidation of Vodafone India with Idea Cellular Ltd has significantly impacted Bharti Infratel’s tenancies. Total co-locations, or the total antennas deployed by telecom service providers, dropped 21% between September 2017 and September 2019. Agreed, the company’s recent quarterly results show signs of stabilization, but analysts do not expect an immediate revival.
Cash-strapped Vodafone Idea, a large customer, is not in a situation to aggressively incur network investments. Of late, Vodafone Idea’s focus is optimizing investments in key revenue-generating regions, instead of blanket network upgrade.
The company is losing subscribers, and the continuous pressure on operating earnings make it tough for a substantial expansion in tenancies in the near-term.
“Even as the recent developments in the wireless sector increase the likelihood of a three-player market structure sustaining, Vodafone Idea getting back into a meaningful network expansion phase would need a lot more. Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel have both indicated that they are past their peak 4G capex phase,"" analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities Research said in a note."
