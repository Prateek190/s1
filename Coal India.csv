157,2018-01-02,Coal India,"The inability of state distributors to utilize existing power plants leaves India with a glut of capacity while nearly 300 million Indians remain without access to electricity

New Delhi: India is adding the least amount of coal-fired power in more than a decade as tepid demand from indebted state retailers fails to utilize the nation’s existing generation capacity. 
New Delhi: India is adding the least amount of coal-fired power in more than a decade as tepid demand from indebted state retailers fails to utilize the nation’s existing generation capacity.
Coal-fired capacity, which accounts for more than three quarters of the nation’s electricity, rose by 809 megawatts during the April-November period, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the latest available data from the Central Electricity Authority, the planning wing of the power ministry. That’s the slowest pace since 680 megawatts was added during the same eight-month stretch in 2006.
Power producers have cancelled some coal-fired projects as existing plants fail to sell all the electricity they can produce. Nearly 40% of the country’s coal-based capacity is unused because the core customers — state-managed distribution companies — struggle to increase purchases in the face of massive debts and losses through electricity theft, insufficient metering and selling power below cost.
The inability of state distributors to utilize existing plants leaves India with a glut of capacity while still nearly 300 million Indians, mostly rural, remain without access to electricity. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration, which came to power in 2014 promising electricity for all, has launched ambitious programs to bring electricity to every household by December 2018.
“Financially, the distribution companies are still not out of the woods and there isn’t enough demand to use up all the power capacity,"" said Debasish Mishra, a partner at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu LLP in Mumbai. “Net capacity additions for coal may fall even lower in coming years as some of the older plants get phased out.""
A rapid increase in renewable power on the back of Modi’s pledge to provide clean energy is exacerbating the glut. During April-November, the country added 4.8 gigawatt of renewable capacity, according to the ministry of new and renewable energy. That’s almost sixfold the additions for coal.
A central government-led campaign for energy efficiency is also weighing on demand. The country’s electricity consumption peaked at 164 gigawatts during the eight months ended November, using up barely half of the installed capacity, CEA data show. Bloomberg"
156,2018-01-02,Coal India,"Union power minister R.K. Singh says electricity tariffs across India are expected to rise by 62 to 93 paise per kilowatt-hour (kWh) during the first year of upgrades to coal-fired power plants

New Delhi: Electricity tariffs across India are expected to rise by 62 to 93 paise ($0.0098-$0.0146) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) during the first year of upgrades to coal-fired power plants, power minister R.K. Singh told lawmakers on Tuesday.  
New Delhi: Electricity tariffs across India are expected to rise by 62 to 93 paise ($0.0098-$0.0146) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) during the first year of upgrades to coal-fired power plants, power minister R.K. Singh told lawmakers on Tuesday. 
The estimate of tariff increases of up to nearly 20% on average power fees comes amid rising levels of smog in the capital and other major cities, which has put pressure on the government and generators to tackle a growing public health crisis.
Power tariffs are a politically sensitive issue in India, where more than three quarters of the electricity is generated by coal-fired power plants. The average power tariff in India is around Rs5 per kWh.
Reuters reported in November that India was considering letting power companies pass on costs of installing emission-cutting equipment to consumers. 
India, which is looking to facilitate loans to power producers through state-run financial institutions to fund one-time costs, aims to make all coal-fired power plants comply with emission-cutting norms by 2022, Central Electrical Authority (CEA) chairman Ravindra Kumar Verma told Reuters in November. 
CEA has prepared a phase-in plan for implementing new environmental norms to ensure minimum disruption while plants are shut down for retrofitting, Singh told the upper house of India’s parliament in a written reply. 
Thermal power companies account for 80% of all industrial emissions of lung-damaging particulate matter, sulphur and nitrous oxides in India. Reuters"
155,2018-01-03,Coal India,"Coal India says about 71% materialisation of coal was done during April-December for both IPPs and CPPs and assured ICPPA that there is no shortage of coal

New Delhi: State-owned miner Coal India has assured coal availability to Indian Captive Power Producers Association (ICPPA), whose members include firms from steel and aluminium segment, as they are heavily dependent on the dry fuel.  
New Delhi: State-owned miner Coal India has assured coal availability to Indian Captive Power Producers Association (ICPPA), whose members include firms from steel and aluminium segment, as they are heavily dependent on the dry fuel. 
Coal India chairman and managing director Gopal Singh along with other senior officials held a meeting with members of ICPPA in Delhi on Tuesday, a person privy to the development said. In India, captive power producers’ capacity stands at 40,000 mega watts (MW) and about 30,000 MW is produced by using coal, which is about 75%.
The rest is produced through alternate materials like gas-based and others, ICPPA general secretary Rajiv Agarwal told PTI. “The industry is highly dependent on coal and the government must understand this. There are many plants who are on the verge of shut down. Many may become a non-performing asset (NPA),"" he said. 
Coal India, in the meeting, said about 71% materialisation of coal was done during April-December 2017 for both integrated power producers (IPPs) and captive power plants (CPPs) and assured there is no shortage of coal.
ICPPA said it is not satisfied by the words of the public sector unit (PSU), who it said is supposed to supply the dry fuel to industry. Agarwal said, “The given figure included dispatches by both rail and road. The share of CPPs rail dispatches is in the range of only 30 to 50% and out of this 30% major supply was given to those plants who were near the pits"". 
Even if coal linkage auction is concerned, 41.5 million tonnes (MT) was offered to the CPPs, he said and added, that out this the industry could not bid for 8.5 MT offered at “Magad-Amrapali of CCL (Central Coalfields Ltd)"" a place with evacuation constraint. 
Railways is also doing “choosy deliveries"". “To meet their loading targets, the zonal railway is making deliveries to plants which are near pits. This is something which is not justified. Captive power producers are already facing shortage from one body of the government, which is Coal India and now this practice of Railways make the matter worse,"" he added. 
Earlier, the ICPPA had urged the government to ensure coal availability, saying most CPPs are facing severe shortage of the fuel, which may lead to closure of plants. The body had said that the dry fuel must be supplied by Coal India Ltd to CPPs at the same rate at which it is being given to the IPPs. 
“There is a shortage of coal for CPPs and the difference in price is also something which we are concerned about,"" Agarwal had said."
153,2018-01-09,Coal India,"Coal India shares rise 7.69% to Rs310 after its board approved a hike in non-coking coal prices for both power and non-power consumers with immediate effect

Kolkata: State-run miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) on Tuesday said its board has approved a hike in non-coking coal prices for both power and non-power consumers with immediate effect. 
Kolkata: State-run miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) on Tuesday said its board has approved a hike in non-coking coal prices for both power and non-power consumers with immediate effect.
People familiar with the matter in Coal India indicated that the average price hike could be around 10%. Due to this revision, the world’s largest coal miner will earn an incremental revenue of Rs1,956 crore for the remaining period of the 2017-18 fiscal year, while total revenue will be Rs6,421 crore, the company said in a regulatory filing.
Coal India shares closed 5.63% higher at Rs304.05 on BSE, while the Sensex ended 0.26% higher at 34,443.19 points. In intraday trade, the stock rose as much as 7.69% to Rs310.
The price hike will be applicable to “all subsidiaries of Coal India, including NEC for regulated and non-regulated sectors"", the filing said.
The miner was compelled to revise prices in the wake of rising costs which was a drag on its profitability for the last few quarters. CIL had last revised price for the fossil fuel in May 2016 by 6.3% on an average that helped the miner to collect additional revenue of Rs3,234 crore in 2016-17.
Coal India slapped a levy of Rs50 per tonne as coal evacuation charges in early December which is set to earn the public sector miner Rs2,500 crore every year. In the remaining part of 2017-18, additional revenue from evacuation levy will be Rs800 crore.
The recent wage revision had pushed up its annual employees cost by additional Rs5,600 crore. Meanwhile, Coal India also said sales bills will be raised on GCV (kcal/Kg) basis with effect from 1 April 2018 and the present mode of raising bill would continue till then."

Kolkata: Coal India Ltd (CIL), the country’s largest miner, is set to introduce a new pricing policy for coal which will be linked strictly to quality, a top official said on Tuesday. 
The company will implement the new pricing mechanism latest by April this year, Coal India chairman Gopal Singh told PTI. The new mechanism will compute prices on every unit of gross calorific value (GCV) of coal, doing away with the grade policy at present. 
“You pay exactly what quality you get,"" Singh said. Explaining, the new policy, he said for each GCV, 48 paisa will change either upward or downward from the median of each grade that the company has proposed. CIL has 17 grades from 2000 to 7000 GCV with difference of 300 GCV between two grades. 
CIL hopes that the new pricing policy will also have a positive impact on coal production. “Earlier, mining workers were not encouraged to cross a grade which was difficult but all miners will now be encouraged to produce more,"" Singh said."
151,2018-01-10,Coal India,"The expected increase in power tariffs is fuelled by Coal India revising coal prices by around 15-18%

New Delhi: Electricity tariffs may go up by 11 paise per unit due to an increase in coal prices by state-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL), rating agency ICRA said on Tuesday. 
New Delhi: Electricity tariffs may go up by 11 paise per unit due to an increase in coal prices by state-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL), rating agency ICRA said on Tuesday.
This expected increase in power tariffs is fuelled by CIL revising coal prices by around 15-18% effective from Tuesday midnight.
“This along with the levy of evacuation charges of Rs50 per MT is estimated to increase the cost of generation for coal-based power plants by about 13-15 paise/unit, as per ICRA estimates,"" the agency said in a statement.
Of India’s installed power generation capacity of 330,860.58 megawatt (MW), 58% or 192,971.50 MW is fuelled by coal.
This fuel price increase comes at a time when utilities recorded a high quarterly generation in the three months ended 31 December, indicating a recovery in electricity demand. Any fresh demand for electricity, the absence of which is weighing down the entire power sector, will also help in resolving the stressed assets problem and improve the sector’s financial viability.
“Given that coal based generators with an automatic pass through of fuel costs account for about 60% of the total power procured by discoms and assuming a partial pass-through by other IPPs (independent power producers) with competitively bid PPAs which account for balance, this translates into about 9 paise per unit increase in power procurement cost for discoms on an all India basis,"" said Sabyasachi Majumdar, group head and senior vice president, ICRA Ratings in a statement.
“In turn, assuming the average AT&C (aggregate technical and commercial) loss level at around 23% in the country, we estimate the impact on cost of power supply per unit sold and retail tariffs (assuming full pass through by state regulators) at around 11 paisa per unit or about 2% tariff hike,"" Majumdar added.
This comes in the backdrop of an uncertain outlook for the power sector and the National Democratic Alliance government trying to revive electricity demand in the country."
150,2018-01-10,Coal India,"Coal India points out that the price hike will bring in additional revenues worth Rs6,421 crore on an annualized basis and Rs1,956 crore for the rest of this fiscal

Hopes of a price hike after Coal India Ltd (CIL) introduced evacuation facility charges of Rs50 a tonne in December were probably running low. That perhaps explains why CIL shares jumped 5.6% on Tuesday after the coal producer announced it will increase prices of non-coking coal late on Monday. 
Hopes of a price hike after Coal India Ltd (CIL) introduced evacuation facility charges of Rs50 a tonne in December were probably running low. That perhaps explains why CIL shares jumped 5.6% on Tuesday after the coal producer announced it will increase prices of non-coking coal late on Monday.
This price hike is a much needed one and the quantum has surprised positively. According to analysts at IIFL Institutional Equities, the price hike effectively translates into ~11% increase over the FSA realizations during 1HFY18. FSA refers to coal sold through the fuel supply agreement route. CIL points out that the price hike will bring in additional revenue of Rs6,421 crore on an annualized basis and Rs1,956 crore for the rest of FY18. The additional revenue will fully offset the impact of the wage hike taken.
Following the announced increase in non-coking coal prices, IIFL has upgraded its Ebitda/profit after tax estimates for FY19-20 by 12%. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and is a key measure of profitability. “Higher realization led improved cash flows would lower need to access accumulated cash for maintaining dividend payout at Rs20/share over FY19-20,"" added IIFL.
For CIL investors, it is encouraging that 2018 has started on a brighter note what with the stock appreciating a huge 15.6% till now. But go back a bit in time and the picture was not so pretty. Despite the recent increase in the share price, the CIL stock has underperformed the benchmark Sensex in FY18. Currently, the shares trade at nearly 14.5 times expected earnings for FY19, based on data from Bloomberg.
For further expansion in valuations, investors would do well to watch the volumes. Sure, offtake increased by 7.6% year-on-year for the April-December 2017 period and that’s not too bad. Still that’s lower than CIL’s target. In fact, the company is expected to miss its production as well as offtake target of 600 million tonnes each for FY18, and the outlook isn’t rosy.
“We see limited additional triggers with volume expected to grow ~5-6% YoY and FSA prices likely to remain stable at current levels,"" point out analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd. “We see dividend yield at 4-6% to be the sole trigger over the next two years.""
Nevertheless, with the price hike now behind it, any surprises on the volume front could well bring some cheer for CIL investors."

Washington: There is a huge opportunity for the US to export LNG to India and China in the next five years as they push to replace coal, the head of the International Energy Agency has said as he highlighted the growing importance of the two nations in the energy market. 
Fatih Birol, executive director for the agency, said both India and China use gas at a minimum level. Globally, the share of gas in the global energy mix is about 25%, and in both these countries, it is less than or around 5% only. “So, there’s a big gap between the world average and them,"" Birol told US lawmakers during a hearing on domestic and global energy outlook held by Senate Committee on Energy and natural Resources. 
“And both of them are facing major challenges in terms of environment, namely, local pollution in the cities. And this is an issue for both of these countries and others—a reason for social unrest, in fact,"" he said, insisting that there is a huge opportunity to export Liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India and China in the next five years. “I am sure Asian region will be the primary destination for the US LNG,"" he said. 
China, Birol said, will overtake the US as the largest oil consumer around 2030. “But stringent fuel-efficiency measures for cars and trucks, and a shift which sees one-in-four cars being electric by 2040, means that China is no longer the main driving force behind global oil use – demand growth is larger in India post-2025,"" he said. 
“In fact, India is the largest contributor to demand growth to 2040 – almost 30% of total growth – as its share of global energy use rises to 11%,"" Birol said. India, he said, is pushing natural gas strongly to replace coal. “But coal is also growing because, in India, as people having no access to electricity in India,"" he said. India has to build some power plants from coal, but also more and more natural gas, renewable energy and nuclear, he said. 
“India is also very important, because their economic growth is very strong and they have a very, in my view, wise, sound energy policy,"" Birol said. “To be very frank, the Modi government is pursuing an energy policy which is very good for their people because, in a very short period of time, almost 11 years, they are bringing electricity to about 500 million people. That’s a big, big, big achievement,"" Birol said. 
“And they are using gas, they are using coal, they are using renewables—all of these technologies—much more diverse. And I expect the share of gas will increase significantly in India in the next years to come,"" Birol said. PTI"

Kolkata: Coal India Ltd supplied 371.8 million tonnes of coal to the power sector in the last 10 months ending January, up 6.8% from the corresponding period last year, a senior company official said.
The state-owned miner also supplied 103.1 million tonnes of coal to the non-power sector in the April-January period of the current fiscal, registering a growth of 8.8% over the corresponding period last year.
This comes at a time when it has missed its own production target by 29.2 million tonnes. The Coal India has produced 440 million tonnes of coal in the April-January period of the ongoing fiscal.
The Coal India official, however, said the miner has a huge potential to increase its coal production in the peak period of the ongoing quarter and hopes to surpass the previous month’s productions. The current level of pithead coal stock is more than 34 million tonnes.
The official said various steps have been taken to increase the offtake and after sustained effort, an all time high rake loading could be achieved which was 300 rakes a day consistently in the last fortnight of January. The average rake loading to the thermal power plant has also increased from a level of 209.8 rake per day in October 2017 to 226 rake per day in February 2018.
To boost supply to thermal power stations, a strategic decision was taken to ensure coal supply from pit head to power stations located within 50 km by road. The available rake from the circuit was utilised to supply coal to distant thermal power stations.
Coal India had to curtail production in two subsidiaries—Central Coalfields and Bharat Coaking Coal—in early FY17 due to huge lying stock.

Vinod Nair, head of research at Geojit Financial Services, said the current earnings season is showing strong signs of revival in corporate earnings, underlining long-term growth prospects, which is providing relief for investors. “However, the prevailing inflationary pressure and fiscal slippage may turn the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to a more hawkish stance in the near future. Considering this, the near-term profitability of domestic corporates might get impacted by higher inflation and interest cost. Further, the volatility in global market is spooking investor sentiments given the premium valuation,"" he added.
Stocks like State Bank of India, Coal India and Bank of Baroda will be also watched after they announced December quarter results last week after market hours. Coal India reported a 4.21% increase in its consolidated net profit at Rs3,004.79 crore for the quarter ended December 2017. SBI reported a net loss of Rs2,416 crore for the fiscal third quarter from a net profit of Rs1,582 crore in the July-September quarter. In the third quarter, SBI made a loan loss provision of Rs17,760 crore, as compared with Rs9,662 crore a year ago.
Nagaraj Shetti, technical research analyst, HDFC Securities, said there is a possibility of a minor halt in downside momentum or an attempt of minor upside bounce from near 10,350-10,400 levels, but eventually this support could be broken on the downside over the next couple of weeks. “Any attempt of upside bounce is going to be a sell on rise opportunity for next week and the downside target to be watched is around 10,000 mark for the next couple of weeks,"" he said.
Meanwhile, industrial output data for December, both Consumer Price Index or retail inflation and wholesale price index (WPI)-based inflation for January will be released this week.
Industrial and manufacturing production data for December, and CPI inflation for January will be released on Monday, while WPI inflation for January will be announced on Wednesday. Factory output growth leapt to a 17-month high in November, while WPI inflation slowed to 3.58% in December, but CPI accelerated to a 17-month high of 5.21% in the same month.

141,2018-02-13,Coal India,"Coal India's average price realizations of coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route declined 3.4% quarter-on-quarter to Rs1,182 a tonne

Coal India Ltd’s (CIL’s) December quarter consolidated net profit rose 4% to Rs3,005 crore and is better than expectations. In fact, last quarter’s earnings looks encouraging when compared to the decline in profit seen in the June and September quarters. 
Coal India Ltd’s (CIL’s) December quarter consolidated net profit rose 4% to Rs3,005 crore and is better than expectations. In fact, last quarter’s earnings looks encouraging when compared to the decline in profit seen in the June and September quarters.
However, the pain lies elsewhere. Average price realizations of coal sold through the fuel-supply agreement (FSA) route fell 3.4% quarter-on-quarter to Rs1,182 a tonne. The measure was below estimates and comes at a time when the marginal sequential improvement in the September quarter FSA realizations had hinted that the worst was over. Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd believes December quarter FSA decline in price realizations was owing to lower dispatches to non-power customers (these fetch a premium) and that preference was given to the power sector due to a spike in demand.
Realizations for e-auction coal were commendable, increasing 24% over the September quarter and compensating for the underperformance from FSA coal realizations to that extent.
CIL’s costs behaved well in the quarter with power expenses and contractual expenses declining. Overall costs rose 2.8% over last year but net revenue increased at a faster pace of 5.7%. The upshot: Ebitda rose 18% to Rs4,618 crore. Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
What of the stock? CIL shares didn’t budge on Monday in response to the December quarter results announced on Saturday. They have also lagged the benchmark Sensex so far this fiscal year. Concerns on grade slippages and increase in wages are some factors that have kept sentiments low for the stock. The price hikes the firm took at the beginning of 2018 have brought some solace on that front. That should help FSA realizations this quarter onwards. Still, after the December quarter performance, confidence is not too high. The notable dip in FSA realization is a dampener and poses a question mark on the quantum of incremental earnings increase from the recent revision in non-coking coal prices, said analysts from Nomura Financial Advisory and Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd in their December quarter results report.
The CIL stock trades at about 13 times estimated earnings for the next fiscal year, according to data from Bloomberg. Valuations are not expensive. “Volume growth, operating leverage, closure of unviable underground mines and high natural attrition are key drivers of earnings,"" pointed out Motilal Oswal in a report. The brokerage firm expects 30% earnings compound annual growth rate over two years (FY18-20)."

New Delhi: Coal minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday coal output will be ramped up over the coming weeks as efforts are on across ministries to help raise production after an unexpected surge in coal demand from power plants. 
New Delhi: Coal minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday coal output will be ramped up over the coming weeks as efforts are on across ministries to help raise production after an unexpected surge in coal demand from power plants.
Goyal said the ministries of coal, mines and environment are working on the matter and production will be ramped up quickly. A surplus coal output in the wake of muted demand from power plants had last year forced the state monopoly, Coal India Ltd, to slow down production, leading to an unexpected shortage after demand picked up from power stations. 
While electricity generation grew 5.1% in the April-December period over the same time a year ago, mining output grew at a muted pace of 1.2% in the same period. In the April-January period, Coal India Ltd produced 441 million tonnes of the fuel, 94% of its production target for the period. It was an output growth of 1.6% over the same period a year ago. Coal offtake in the first ten months of this fiscal remained robust. The state producer shipped 475 million tonnes of the fuel in the period, meeting 97% of its target. 
Goyal, who was speaking at a review of the performance of NLC India Ltd, formerly Neyveli Lignite Corporation Ltd, said the company seeks to double its mining capacity by 2025. The company, which now produces 31 million tonnes a year, has seen its output surging three-fold in the last three years. NLC, which also produces power, is expected to see its generation capacity more than double from 2.7 gigawatts (GW) in 2014 to 5.7GW by March 2018.
Goyal said that the mining company, which has diversified into clean energy generation, is expected to have 300 megawatts (MW) by March 2018 and is expected to sign a power purchase deal with the Railways for 1,000MW. 
Goyal, who is also the minister for railways, said that the Railway Board is expected to come out with a request for proposal (RFP) to use its vacant land for setting up a 3,000MW clean energy capacity, in which NLC will also participate. “The Railway Board will shortly come out with an RFP. We will ask all companies to compete. NLC will also compete. It will benefit both NLC and the Railways,"" said Goyal. It will be a two-stage bidding of 1,500 MW each."

New Delhi: The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday decided to open up the coal sector to commercial mining by private entities. The game-changing move ends state-backed Coal India Ltd’s (CIL) monopoly and enables power, cement and steel producers to access fuel more efficiently. 
New Delhi: The Union cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday decided to open up the coal sector to commercial mining by private entities. The game-changing move ends state-backed Coal India Ltd’s (CIL) monopoly and enables power, cement and steel producers to access fuel more efficiently.
The move is set to usher in competition in coal supply, reduce coal imports and help stressed power plants to attempt a turnaround through better fuel management.
An official statement described the decision as “the most ambitious coal sector reform since the nationalisation of this sector in 1973"".
There will be no end-use restriction as far as output of the auctioned mines are concerned. Under private commercial mining modalities approved by the cabinet, coal blocks will be allocated by “ascending forward auction"" in which the winner will be determined by the price per tonne of coal offered to the state government where the mine is located. “There shall be no restriction on the sale and/or utilization of coal from the coal mine,"" said the statement.
An enabling provision for commercial coal mining by private players was included in the Coal Mines (Special Provisions) Act, 2015, which the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government had brought in to replace administrative allocation of coal blocks with auction after the Supreme Court had in 2014 cancelled 204 coal blocks allocated to various state and private companies.
The official statement said the methodology approved by cabinet on Tuesday gives highest priority to transparency, ease of doing business and ensures that natural resources are used for national development. The move is also expected to allow the use of best possible technology in the sector, drive investments and create direct and indirect employment in coal-bearing areas, it said.
“This is a game changer across multiple sectors. Power generators can use commercial coal to improve margins or availability, and as merchant prices fall, utilities and manufacturing sector too will benefit from lower energy costs,"" said Kameswara Rao, partner, PwC India. Rao said that new owners of distressed assets need no longer risk e-auction supplies as commercial coal offers a credible strategy to revive those projects.
The government expects revenue from private commercial mining to help in the development of backward areas, especially in the eastern part of the country.
Meanwhile, the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) approved infrastructure projects worth Rs15,700 crore, including railways and national highways.
The committee gave its nod for railway projects worth Rs11,660 crore which included doubling of rail lines along with electrification and a new railway line in Bihar, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
The projects approved include 116.95-km long Bhatni-Aurnihar line doubling with electrification at a cost of Rs1,301 crore to decongest the Mughalsarai-Allahabad route, and easing rail connectivity to the prime ,inister’ s constituency Varanasi. 
Other doubling and electrification projects approved are 100.6km Muzaffarpur-Sagauli, 109.7km Sagauli-Valmiki Nagar, 425km Jhansi-Manikpur link and Bhimsen-Khairar.
The CCEA also approved a new railway project in poll-bound Odisha, where a 130km long new railway line will be laid from Odisha’s Jeypore to Malkangiri, both left-wing extremism (LWE) affected districts, at a cost of Rs2,676.11 crore. The project will be completed by 2021-22. At present, there is no railway connectivity with Malkangiri and the new line will provide basic infrastructure support for the development of area.
The two national highway projects approved include construction of a 4.5km long tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri in Uttarakhand and six-laning of the 60km Nidagatta-Mysuru highway at Rs4,040 crore.
Railway minister Piyush Goyal said, “The railway projects will create employment for 211 lakh mandays and would be rolled out soon."""

New Delhi: The government may in near future scrap the present system of allocating coal mines for captive use and instead only auction mines for commercial use to private as well as foreign companies with a view to boost domestic product and cut imports, a top official said.
The move, which would not just help attract foreign investment but also bring in efficiency and promote competition, follows government’s decision of opening up the coal sector to commercial mining by private entities. “We can also take a decision that in future only commercial mining will be done.... things are evolving, we will see. One experience is there of end-use auctions. This will be another experience of commercial mining auctions. So we will see and compare whatever is better for the country in the longer term,"" coal secretary Susheel Kumar told PTI in an interview. 
The cabinet had last week approved auctioning of coal mines to any firm bidding the highest per tonne price. 
At present, private sector firms are only allowed to mine coal for use in cement, steel, power and aluminium plants. Coal India Ltd (CIL) is the sole commercial miner with 80% market share. 
Terming commercial mining a “full-fledged reform"" in the coal sector, the secretary said the government is evaluating whether it is advisable to go for end-use restrictions. “There is an idea floated by few people which we are examining whether it is advisable to go for end-use restrictions because that is a half-hearted reform. It is not a full-fledged reform. Commercial mining is a full-fledged reform so that is something which we are evaluating and whatever is in the best interest of the country will be done,"" Kumar explained.
Stating that the country was slowly moving towards free market in the coal sector, the secretary said CIL ought to improve its efficiency else it “will not be in the market."" 
On deadline for commercial mining auctions, the secretary said : “Our expectation is that we will complete the process of auction by March 2019."" He, however, did not divulge the number of blocks to be put for bidding in the first tranche.
The government had in 2014 auctioned 29 mines to private players and states for capital use in power, steel, aluminium and cement plants. In the following year, it permitted the allotment of coal mines to states for mining and commercial sale to medium, small and cottage industries. Close to 16 mines were allotted to several states."

Hong Kong/Sydney: Australian mining legend Lang Hancock’s dream four decades ago of exporting coal from the country’s remote Galilee Basin is becoming a nightmare for two Indian conglomerates. 
Hong Kong/Sydney: Australian mining legend Lang Hancock’s dream four decades ago of exporting coal from the country’s remote Galilee Basin is becoming a nightmare for two Indian conglomerates.
Adani Group bought into the Queensland basin in 2010, followed a year later by GVK Group, with plans to ship thermal coal by the middle of the decade. Deals to build ports and rails signalled early promise, but the projects became embroiled in legal challenges and financing setbacks. Adani now sees first exports from its massive Carmichael mine around 2020, six years behind schedule, as it struggles to shore up financing, with the federal government making clear Wednesday it won’t help with investments or loans.
“There are regulatory and environmental infrastructure requirements, which have thrown up significant hurdles,"" said Daniel Hynes, a Sydney-based analyst at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. “There’s still a chance we won’t see Galilee supply in the market in the foreseeable future. It’s nothing to do with the quality of the coal. It’s more around the infrastructure, which has been quite difficult to overcome.""
Hancock, who was among prospectors that discovered Australia’s iron ore riches in the 1950s, reportedly told a gathering 40 years ago at a hotel in the rural town of Alpha that the area was getting a coal mine. Decades later, it’s still waiting and the challenges of making the mine viable endure.
Remote basin
The Galilee Basin holds large deposits of thermal coal, burned to generate electricity, over its 247,000 sq. km, but its remote location and lack of water, power and rail infrastructure have discouraged large-scale mines, according to the state government. It’s about 200km inland to the west from the Bowen Basin, where miners including BHP Billiton Ltd and Anglo American Plc produce metallurgical coal, used to make steel.
“Isolation is absolutely key,"" Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies for Australasia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in a Bloomberg TV interview Thursday. “There is no workforce, no infrastructure, no power, no roads, no railways, no airport. So everything has to be built from scratch.""
The GVK venture, known as GVK Hancock, didn’t respond to emails or a phone call seeking comment on first sales. Its chief executive officer left in 2016 and the company is still without a replacement. G.V. Sanjay Reddy, vice chairman at the group’s publicly traded unit in Secunderabad, India, declined to comment. 
Adani’s proposed A$16.5 billion ($12.9 billion) Carmichael project includes the construction of a 388km rail line to the Abbot Point port and the development of Australia’s largest thermal coal mine, which will have the capacity to produce as much as 60 million tonnes a year. The venture is facing strong opposition from environmentalists who say it will increase carbon pollution and endanger the health of the Great Barrier Reef marine park. Bloomberg"

New Delhi: Rationalisation of sources of coal for power plants under public sector units (PSUs) has resulted in annual savings of Rs3,354 crore, parliament was informed on Wednesday.  
New Delhi: Rationalisation of sources of coal for power plants under public sector units (PSUs) has resulted in annual savings of Rs3,354 crore, parliament was informed on Wednesday. 
“Coal India has rationalised sources of coal supply to thermal power plants of PSUs to the tune of 30.46 million tonne on the basis of requests received from them. They have resulted in annual potential savings of  ₹ 3,354 crore,"" coal minister Piyush Goyal said in a written reply to Lok Sabha.
In order to optimise transportation cost, an inter-ministerial task force (IMTF) was constituted by the coal ministry for a comprehensive review of existing coal sources as also feasibility for rationalisation of the sources. 
The task force recommended rationalisation of existing sources on case to case basis for 19 thermal power plants of PSUs (public sector undertakings). “This has resulted in rationalisation of sources of 24.238 MT of coal. In addition, an agreement was signed between Gujarat State Electricity Corporation (GSECL) and NTPC for swapping of 1 MT of domestic coal with imported coal,"" the minister said. 
Further, the government has permitted flexibility in utilisation of domestic coal by allowing central/state utilities to use the fuel in such power plants to achieve overall reduction in cost of generation. In addition to the above, it has been decided that all power plants located within 20km from pit-head shall construct elevated closed belt conveyor within next two years (up to 1 April 2020), Goyal said. 
“It is also decided that power plants located within 40 km from pit-head shall construct MGR (merry-go-round) within three years (up to April 1, 2021),"" he said. Power plants located beyond 40km and up to 100km, may also consider the option of MGR depending on the financial viability, he added."

New Delhi: Adani Enterprises on Monday said it has signed a coal mining agreement with NLC India Ltd for development and operation of Talabira II and III coal block. 
In a BSE filing, it said its subsidiary, Talabira (Odisha) Mining Pvt. Ltd (TOMPL), “has signed coal mining agreement (CMA) with NLC India Ltd along with the company for development and operation of Talabira II and III coal block..."". 
TOMPL has become a successful bidder for mine developer and operator (MDO) tender of Talabira II and III coal block issues by NLC India Ltd, it said. “The project is expected to generate a revenue of Rs12,200 crore.

New Delhi: Given the changing global energy mix, Coal India Ltd, the world’s largest coal miner, plans to set up 20,000 megawatts (MW) of solar projects over the next 10 years, a top executive said.
It is estimated that at a per-MW cost of around Rs4.5 crore, Coal India will require an investment of around Rs90,000 crore to set up this capacity.
“If you look beyond 2050, one priority is to reach over to renewable energy,"" said Coal India chairman and managing director Gopal Singh, adding that the miner has the 40,000 hectares of land required to set up such a large solar capacity. 
“Affordability is a big factor for us,"" he added.
Such a large green capacity addition will help boost India’s clean energy commitments. India, the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases after the US and China, plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030, as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in 2015.
India plans to achieve 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2022. Of this 100GW is to come from solar projects.
With India setting in place a new energy architecture, Coal India’s diversification drive includes setting up coal-to-methanol projects and coal gasification projects. It also plans to monetise waste water by distilling it and selling it to the Indian Railways.
In another development, the state-run firm that accounts for 84% of India’s primary fuel production, will register a 2.52% or 14 million tonne (mt) increase in coal production for the current financial year to reach 568mt. Also, the quantum of coal dispatched in 2017-18 is expected to reach 580.50mt as compared to 543.32mt in 2016-17.
“This year is going to be a milestone year,"" Singh said.
This comes in the backdrop of an unexpected surge in coal demand from power plants during August-September. 
Surplus coal output in the wake of muted demand from power plants last financial year had resulted in coal stocks of around 68.4mt and forced the state monopoly to slow down production. This led to an unexpected shortage after demand picked up from power stations due to low nuclear and hydropower generation.
“It is not the production that matters but the supply of coal that matters,"" Singh said, adding, “our bottom line depends on the offtake and dispatch.""
According to the Geological of India, the country has an estimated 315 billion tonnes of coal reserves. The country mined 655.31mt of coal in the last financial year as compared to 3.5 billion tonnes mined by China.
“If we have so much of reserves, there shouldn’t be a shortage,"" Singh remarked.
Coal India has set a target of mining 650mt of coal in 2018-19. Of the 2.7mt of coal mined by it every day, 1.8mt is dispatched. It doesn’t make economic sense for the miner to hold a large quantum of coal in stock, due to the fuel being combustible. 
“Currently, about 94% of the mining is being done by government-owned entities Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd. Despite the recent increase in domestic coal production, India still meets a fifth of its annual requirement through imports, which cost about  ₹ 1 lakh crore,"" according to a 6 March statement from credit rating firm Crisil Ltd.
As part of its attempts to improve efficiency, Coal India has introduced a staggered weekly off for its 298,000 workforce since October last year. This in turn has ensured round-the-week operations.
Going forward, Coal India’s strategy is to liquidate stocks. Also, the firm is set to implement the new pricing policy from 1 April wherein coal prices will be linked to quality with prices being calculated on every unit of gross calorific value (GCV) of coal rather than the grade. 
Calorific value refers to the amount of heat that can be generated by burning a certain amount of a fuel.
In response to a query about the likely impact of the new pricing mechanism on Coal India’s revenue, Singh said, “There will be an impact because our interest is not profiteering... As we have to compete with commercial miners, Coal India will have to transform completely."""

Kolkata: Coal India Ltd has budgeted for a capital expenditure of Rs9,500 crore in 2018-19 and is looking to pare operating costs even as the state-owned miner braces for competition from the private sector.
In 2017-18, Coal India spent Rs8,600 crore—Rs100 crore more than what it had planned—to expand mining, chairman and managing director Gopal Singh said in Kolkata on Friday.
Even in the face of private mining, Coal India will remain the leader, Singh said. The government recently eased norms to allow private companies to start commercial coal mining.
But to remain competitive, Coal India is looking to reduce costs. In the December quarter, it pared operating costs by Rs52 per tonne, which resulted in its pre-tax profit going up by 10.9% year-on-year to Rs4,610.21 crore, Singh said.
The cost of coal produced by Coal India is at least 42% lower than imported coal even after the price hike in January, according to the chairman. Certain grades are cheaper by as much as 64%, he added.
In the 11 months to 1 March 2018, Coal India produced 495.09 million tonnes (mt) of coal. The management expects to close the current fiscal with a total output of 568 mt. The target for the year was 600 mt.
Coal India, at present, has a pithead inventory of 54 mt compared to 68 mt at the beginning of 2017-18. It had contracted to 29 mt at the end of November, but the inventory has swelled again indicating that the company has produced more than it has managed to sell."

New Delhi/Mumbai: Coal India Ltd’s sales and output in March rose to the highest on record as the world’s biggest coal miner rushed to meet its annual production target, a goal that it missed for at least the sixth consecutive year.
Boosting output is crucial for Coal India to meet rising demand from power plants, its biggest customers. An early onset of summer is expected to boost electricity consumption. To meet that demand, the miner is seeking more railway carriages and is also trying to ship the fuel through roads to some customers.
The company is unable to raise production to its full potential as it is facing logistical issues in transporting coal, inflating stockpiles, Union coal secretary Susheel Kumar has said. Inventories at Coal India stood 55.5 million tons as of 1 April, it said.
“We see production growth slowing down in the coming months as the company deals with a bloated inventory,"" Goutam Chakraborty, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services in Mumbai, said. “Transportation continues to be the weak link and the company has to obtain more railway rakes to be able to ship more coal.""

The decision will help India’s natural gas production and reduce the demand-supply gap in the country. It comes in the backdrop of India putting in place a new energy architecture, with CIL’s diversification drive focusing on setting up coal-to-methanol projects and coal gasification projects. 
India has been pushing for a gas-based economy. As the world’s fourth-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, it has been trying to leverage the glut in global LNG supplies to renegotiate its contracts. India imported 19 million metric tonnes of LNG in 2016-17 to meet its domestic demand.
In another decision, the cabinet gave its approval to a preliminary pact between India and the UK on the return of illegal migrants—seen as a major bone of contention between the two countries.
“The MoU (memorandum of understanding) will facilitate visa-free entry for holders of diplomatic passports as well as liberalization of the UK visa regime for those who are travelling to the UK legally,"" a government statement issued on Wednesday said. “It will ensure the return of persons who have no lawful basis to be in the territory of the other party after verification of nationality to its satisfaction,"" the statement added.
“It will help in streamlining the procedure of return of nationals who are caught staying illegally... in a specified time frame,"" it added without giving details about the time frame.
According to a person familiar with the development, India will commit to verifying —within a specific time frame —whether people identified as illegal Indians are actually its nationals or not. “Most times people identified as Indians are actually not Indians but South Asians,"" said the person, who did not wish to be named. 
“We have not been told how many Indian nationals are in the UK without relevant papers but the UK Home Office says the number is in the thousands. Our point is that the question of illegal migration should not stand in the way of the UK giving visas to genuine Indian travellers, businessmen etc.,"" the person added."

New Delhi: The finance ministry may come out with a Rs10,000-crore follow-on fund offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) as it looks to dilute stake in Coal India to meet the minimum public holding norm. 
New Delhi: The finance ministry may come out with a Rs10,000-crore follow-on fund offer of the Bharat-22 exchange traded fund (ETF) as it looks to dilute stake in Coal India to meet the minimum public holding norm.
Besides, the ministry is keen to take the ETF route to sell off government shares held through the Specified Undertaking of the Unit Trust of India in private companies (SUUTI)—ITC, Axis Bank and L&T, an official told PTI. 
The government had in November last year launched Bharat-22 ETF comprising shares of 22 companies, including public sector undertakings (PSUs), public sector banks, ITC, Axis Bank and L&T. The fund had garnered bids to the tune of Rs32,000 crore, although the government retained only Rs14,500 crore.
An official said the ETF route is a safer mode of disinvestment as it shields investors against stock market volatility. “Based on the current composition of the Bharat-22 ETF, the leg room for a follow-on fund offer would be around Rs10,000 crore,"" the official added.
The state-owned companies or PSUs that are part of the new Bharat ETF-22 include ONGC, IOC, SBI, BPCL, Coal India and Nalco. The other central public sector enterprises on the list are Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks—SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda—figure in the Bharat-22 index.
The official said, by using the ETF route, the government may dilute about 3.55% stake held in Coal India to comply with the minimum 25% public float requirement as mandated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
The government plans to raise Rs80,000 crore in the current fiscal from disinvestment, lower than over Rs1 trillion raised last year.
Prior to the launch of Bharat-22 ETF, which has a diversified portfolio, the government had floated the CPSE ETF comprising stocks of 10 bluechip PSUs—ONGC, Coal India, IOC, GAIL (India), Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, Engineers India and Container Corporation of India.
Through the CPSE ETF, the government had raised Rs11,500 crore in three tranches, with Rs3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014, Rs6,000 crore from the second tranche in January 2017 and Rs2,500 crore from the third tranche in March 2017."

New Delhi: State-owned Coal India Ltd (CIL) on Friday said that it would put on offer a little over 45 million tonnes (MT) of coal under the special forward auction in the current fiscal. 
“In yet another step in reaching out to its consumers, CIL has announced a special forward e-auction calendar for 2018-19 facilitating the power plants to systematically plan the lifting of the coal requirement for the fiscal 2018- 19,"" a CIL official said in a statement. 
The state-owned firm said it will put on the block a little over 45MT of coal under the special forward auction. All the coal producing arms of CIL have uploaded the month-wise, source-wise quantity of coal they will be putting up for sale under the special forward auction right up to March next year. 
“The power producers, particularly the IPPs (independent power producers), can now plan much in advance their coal requirement source-wise, grade-wise, size-wise, quantity-wise and mode-wise as the company has indicated the availability right in the beginning of the fiscal itself,"" the official said. 
With this move of CIL the power producers could also plan their operational logistics suiting to their coal requirement."

New Delhi: Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac put together a coalition of southern states earlier this month to challenge the references of the fifteenth finance commission (FFC) which they felt were biased in favour of less developed northern states. 
New Delhi: Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac put together a coalition of southern states earlier this month to challenge the references of the fifteenth finance commission (FFC) which they felt were biased in favour of less developed northern states.
Now Isaac is looking to expand this coalition to include non-Bharatiya Janata Party states in other parts of India, giving it a clear political hue. 
Isaac has invited the finance ministers of Delhi, Punjab, Odisha, West Bengal and Mizoram along with the southern states to a meeting in Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh, on 7 May to discuss the potential loss of revenue due to the change in the census data year to 2011 from 1971.
States that have succeeded in controlling their population growth rate feel they will lose out, as compared to those states who have failed to do so, and are therefore lobbying against the commission’s terms of reference. The finance ministers of Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Puducherry met in Thiruvanathapuram earlier this month over the issue where they pushed for a level-playing field with other states. 
“We phoned Manpreet Singh Badal FM of Punjab and Manish Sisodia FM of Delhi. Both Delhi and Punjab will be participating in the Vijayawada Conclave on May 7th. Hoping that Odisha, West Bengal, Mizoram and southern States will be participating the deliberations at Vijayawada,"" Isaac wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter on Sunday night.
Opposition to the terms of the FFC, chaired by former revenue secretary N.K. Singh, has grown with states like Odisha voicing the fears of the southern states. 
In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the mandate of using the 2011 census data instead of the 1971 census data is contrary to national population policy statements and assurances to states which have actively implemented population stabilisation measures. He argued that it will adversely impact Odisha’s share of devolution as it is already below the population replacement rate of 2.1%.
Among major states, Bihar (25.1%), Chhattisgarh (22.6%) and Jharkhand (22.3%) have the highest decadal (2000-2011) population growth rates, according to the 2011 census. On the other hand, southern and eastern states like Andhra Pradesh (11.1%), West Bengal (13.9%) and Odisha (14%) have among the lowest decadal population growth rates.
The widespread opposition has forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi to announce that the government has asked the FFC to consider incentivizing states that have worked on population control. 
But southern states had countered the argument stating that the incentives will be inadequate to compensate the potential loss of revenue due to the change in the population base year.
“We should not be struck with the population issue. It is a matter of tinkering with the weightage of the various factors to ensure that better performing states do not lose out and states that need more resources can are provided with the same,"" said N.R. Bhanumurthy, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy."

Kolkata: Poland is looking to forge a partnership with West Bengal to boost bilateral trade with India, its ambassador Adam Burakowski said in Kolkata on Monday.
Bilateral trade between the two countries jumped to a new high of $3.1 billion in 2017, with India exporting goods and services worth $2.3 billion. Of the $800,000 Polish exports to India, coking coal accounted for $180,000 last year, said Anna Rosenthal, second secretary in the Polish embassy in New Delhi.
It isn’t possible for Poland to pursue business opportunities across India, said Burakowski, who speaks Hindi and is an expert on India, though not a career diplomat.
Poland has chosen to partner West Bengal to expand trade with India, and has formed a team with representation from Polish government and private enterprises to pursue business opportunities, he added.
Poland is looking to sell in India mining technology and hardware, apart from coking coal. It currently sells coking coal to Coal India Ltd, a state-controlled enterprise headquartered in Kolkata, according to Rosenthal.
The West Bengal government is looking to develop the Deocha-Pachami coal block, Burakowski said, adding that Polish mining companies were, at the invitation of the state administration, “investigating opportunities"" to partner local enterprises to extract coal from the block.
Deocha Pachami is believed to be one of the biggest coal blocks in India with an estimated reserve of 2 billion tonnes. But geologically, coal extraction is expected to be challenging. The Centre has said it would be allotted to West Bengal, but paperwork has not been completed yet.
During his visit to Kolkata, Burakowski is meeting government officials and entrepreneurs such as Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka group, which has interests in coal and coal mining."

122,2018-05-22,Coal India,"The Karnataka result shows India's main opposition may be prepared to take junior roles in coalitions if it means taking down Modi

New Delhi: India’s divided opposition has seized on a new way to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s powerful Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): bringing national and regional rivals together to take on the ruling party. 
New Delhi: India’s divided opposition has seized on a new way to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s powerful Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP): bringing national and regional rivals together to take on the ruling party.
The reversal of the BJP’s fortunes in the southern state of Karnataka—where it won the most seats but was ousted by a coalition composed of the Congress party and the regional Janata Dal (Secular) party—marks one more election loss at the hands of a united opposition. Despite a string of state poll victories, alliances have also thwarted Modi in recent Uttar Pradesh by-elections and in the 2015 Bihar state elections.
The Karnataka result shows India’s main opposition may be prepared to take junior roles in coalitions if it means taking down Modi. So even if the BJP remains the most popular party, they could still lose upcoming state polls or suffer losses in next year’s national election.
“The alliance in Karnataka is a platform for a larger anti-BJP coalition on a national scale,"" said Sandeep Shastri, a political scientist and pro vice chancellor at Jain University in Bengaluru, the capital of Karnataka. “But how much they build on that platform is an open question.""
Opposition coalitions
The BJP rules 20 of India’s 29 states. In Karnataka, it won 104 seats in the 224-seat legislature, compared to Congress’s 78 seats and 37 for the Janata Dal (S), leaving Modi’s party eight seats short of a majority.
As the battle to form the state government unfolded, the opposition coalition was cheered on by leaders of two powerful regional parties: Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal, and the Bahujan Samaj Party’s (BSP) Mayawati, the Dalit leader and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh.
That support suggests growing national interest in an anti-BJP alliance, said N. Sathiya Moorthy, a Chennai-based senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation (ORF), an Indian think-tank.
“Very clearly it’s an effort to get an alliance of state-based parties—and a message to the Congress party that if they want a future they need to ally,"" Moorthy said.
Unwieldy partnerships
Coalition arrangements are nothing new in India, but they can be unwieldy.
The alliance that defeated the BJP in Bihar—a state of 100 million people—fell apart last year amid corruption allegations, allowing the BJP to prop up the ruling government.
Inherent contradictions among alliance partners will ensure these coalitions are short-lived, said K. C. Tyagi, of the Bihar-based Janata Dal (United) (JDU), an ally of Modi’s coalition. “What are their economic policies, or their stand on corruption? Will they allow state leaders to play effective and leading roles in the coalition?""
He said JDU will be continue part of National Democratic Alliance (NDA).
Defeating Modi via a political alliance will not be easy. Local leaders for the Congress party, which led the fight for India’s independence, may not want to concede power to regional parties. Some upcoming state elections are also likely to be straight contests between the BJP and Congress. And then there’s countering Modi’s successful narrative.
“What will hold together this anti-BJP coalition is their negative view of the BJP,"" Shastri said. “A negative view alone cannot keep an alliance together. There will need to be something positive.""
The result in Karnataka has boosted enthusiasm among Modi’s opponents to unite and try to defeat the BJP in the 2019 national elections, said Yashwant Sinha, a former BJP finance minister who left the party.
“The national elections are the real goal,"" Sinha said. “Karnataka has been a major landmark and has encouraged opposition to the BJP to try and come together, whatever the cost."""
121,2018-05-24,Coal India,"Vedanta has just one day's worth of coal stockpiles left at its Jharsuguda smelter in Odisha after a Coal India unit stopped supplies from 18 May

New Delhi: India’s biggest aluminium producer Vedanta Ltd may be forced to reduce output if restrictions on coal supplies to the non-power sector drag on for another week, according to its chief executive for metals business in the country. 
New Delhi: India’s biggest aluminium producer Vedanta Ltd may be forced to reduce output if restrictions on coal supplies to the non-power sector drag on for another week, according to its chief executive for metals business in the country.
Vedanta has just one day’s worth of coal stockpiles left at its Jharsuguda smelter in Odisha after a unit of state-run monopoly Coal India Ltd stopped supplies from 18 May, Samir Cairae said. Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd last week issued orders to halt deliveries to all non-power customers following a government directive to prioritize the electricity industry.
“The question now is how to run the plant,"" Cairae said in a phone interview Tuesday. If the coal shortage lasts another week, the company will be forced to shut some units at the 1.7 million tons a year smelter. “There will be no other industrial solutions,"" he said.
The government has prioritized supplies to power stations to boost their inventories, which are near the lowest since mid-February. The decision is set to bring industries that generate their own electricity using coal to a standstill, the Indian Captive Power Producers Association said this week.
Temporary measures
An aluminium smelter once shut down needs at least six months to restart, Cairae said. Vedanta will take temporary steps such as purchasing electricity from the grid to prevent a shutdown, Cairae said. The measures will bring down production, but keep the plant running.
A shutdown would not be on the cards for Vedanta because of the time required to restart the facility and a “better way would be to import coal even if they operate at lower margins as aluminium prices are still very good,"" Bhavesh Chauhan, an analyst at IDBI Capital Markets & Securities Ltd., said by phone from Mumbai. The only concern remains “whether it is logistically possible to import high amounts of coal to the plant.""
Jharsuguda requires 17 million tons of coal a year to generate electricity at its captive power plant, half of which comes from contracts with Coal India, Cairae said. It sources the rest from imports and auctions by Coal India. Vedanta imported 2 million tons for the smelter in the year through March, he said.
“We hope this matter is resolved soon and we don’t have to import more. It’s not a sustainable solution for us,"" Cairae said.
Vedanta shares extended their decline in Mumbai following deadly protests at Sesa Sterlite’s copper smelter in Tamil Nadu. The stock slid 2.1% to Rs247.40 on Thursday, the lowest level since June."
120,2018-05-25,Coal India,"The coal ministry admits there is coal shortage after making tall claims of rise in production, asks Coal  India to supply the fuel to PSU power plants to keep them running

New Delhi: In a jolt to private power producers, the government has ordered Coal India Ltd to make ‘out-of-turn’ allotment of scarce coal to central and state electricity generation companies. 
New Delhi: In a jolt to private power producers, the government has ordered Coal India Ltd to make ‘out-of-turn’ allotment of scarce coal to central and state electricity generation companies.
The order follows a Coal Ministry directive earlier this month that instructed companies like Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd to deploy rakes of coal only for power plants and not other users like captive power plants of private industries.
In a 24 May letter to Coal India, the Coal Ministry said there may be an increased demand for coal due to a surge in demand during peak summer. Power generation in April, it said, “has been more than the programmed generation and this, in turn, may lead to a more than anticipated increase in demand of coal from the power sector.""
“In order to avoid possible shortage of coal at thermal power plants it has been decided that wherever it is operationally feasible based on various factors like coal stock availability, where suitable transport arrangements are in place etc, out of turn coal allotment may be made to state and central PSU (electricity) generation companies (Gencos) to meet the surged coal requirement for power generation,"" the ministry said in the letter, reviewed by PTI.
Industry sources said a coal shortage looms in India as demand for electricity is expected to hit record peaks during summer months. Also, Coal India has lagged in meeting surge in demand.
Out of turn allocation would have a direct bearing on coal allocation under the ambitious scheme named Shakti or the Scheme to Harness and Allocate Koyla (Coal) Transparently in India, as well as that done through e-auction. Under the Shakti scheme, fuel was to be allocated to power plants holding letters of assurance (LoAs).
Sources said coal allocation under these is under threat as Coal India has been failing to meet its production target and would not supply the scarce fuel to PSUs on priority. The move to divert fuel from coal starved power projects would take a heavy toll on the already ailing sector, they said, adding the government continues to back PSUs at the cost of independent power producers in coal allocation.
Plant Load Factor (PLF) or average capacity utilisation, of state-owned NTPC plants is over 70%, while independent power producers (which are essentially private firms) are bleeding at 55% PLF.
Coal Ministry has admitted to coal shortage even after making tall claims of rise in production, they said, adding it has now directed Coal India to supply fuel out of turn to PSUs to keep them running and prevent losses, all this at the cost of the private sector.
The move comes at a time when power producers are under tremendous stress and struggling to keep the projects afloat, they added."

Kolkata:State-owned miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) on Tuesday said its net profit for the March quarter had slipped 52% to Rs1,295.34 crore from Rs2,718.80 crore a year ago on the back of a sharp rise in employee benefit costs. 
Kolkata:State-owned miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) on Tuesday said its net profit for the March quarter had slipped 52% to Rs1,295.34 crore from Rs2,718.80 crore a year ago on the back of a sharp rise in employee benefit costs.
CIL’s revenue for the quarter rose 8.5% year-on-year to Rs28,909.32 crore, but overall expenses went up by 24%. Expenses on employee benefits alone jumped 80.2% to Rs16,653.86 crore from Rs9,240.67 crore during the period under consideration.
At the end of the day’s trade, Tuesday, CIL’s shares fell 0.98% to Rs282.15 apiece on the BSE in a weak market.
For the full year, the company’s consolidated net profit fell 24.3%. The miner earned Rs7,020.22 crore in net profit compared with Rs9,279.77 crore in the previous fiscal year. While its total revenue during the fiscal year rose 2.9% to Rs91,926.89 crore, total expenses shot up by 8.4%.
Expenses on employee benefits for 2017-18 was at Rs42,633.60 crore, an increase of 27% over the previous fiscal year. In a regulatory filing, CIL said expenses on employee benefits for the March quarter and the full year included a provision of Rs646.87 crore and Rs899.14 crore, respectively, towards pay revision of executives. 
Executive pay revision comes into force with retrospective effect from 1 January 2017. CIL said that expenses on employee benefits also include a provision of Rs7,384.37 crore towards an increase in gratuity ceiling from Rs10 lakh to Rs20 lakh from March this year.
During 2017-18, the company witnessed production growth of 2.4% to 567.37 million tonnes, while sales grew 6.8% to 580.29 million tonnes."

At first glance, Coal India Ltd’s reported March quarter consolidated Ebitda looks miserably low at just Rs196 crore. But employee costs rose a whopping 80% against the year-ago period, which included Rs7,384 crore towards provisions for an increase in the gratuity ceiling. This is one-off in nature. Adjusting for this, earnings are better than expected, say analysts.

But employee costs rose a whopping 80% against the year-ago period, which included Rs7,384 crore towards provisions for an increase in the gratuity ceiling. This is one-off in nature. Adjusting for this, earnings are better than expected, say analysts. 
Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
In fact, after the March quarter numbers, analysts may upgrade their future earnings expectations. Revenues have exceeded some analysts’ forecasts, helped by higher price realizations. Blended realizations rose nearly 7% year-on-year to Rs1,581 per tonne. This also represents 16% growth over the December quarter. 
Sequentially, realizations of coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route increased at a much faster pace boosting overall realizations. The coal miner took price hikes in January and that was expected to boost FSA realizations. Therefore, better FSA prices for the March quarter may not come as a big surprise. Realizations of e-auction coal also improved compared to the December quarter.
Additionally, other income of Rs2,000 crore proved helpful on an overall basis.
Coal India shares dropped almost 3% lower during trading hours on Tuesday in reaction to the results before recovering eventually and closing 1% lower. So far in 2018, the stock has outperformed the benchmark Sensex for most part of the year. Valuations are not expensive. Currently, the stock trades at about 12 times estimated earnings for fiscal year 2019 (FY19), based on Bloomberg data.
On production and offtake (or sales volume), the year has started on a satisfactory note. Production and offtake rose by 16.7% and 13%, respectively, for April. Sure, production growth was helped by a favourable base as output had declined year-on-year in April 2017. Still, these numbers aren’t bad to begin with. What remains to be seen is whether the momentum is sustained.
Optimism on the company achieving its production target of 630 million tonnes for FY19 isn’t particularly high. To achieve this production guidance, Coal India will have to clock 10.6% increase in production for the remaining 11 months of FY19 over a year ago. That’s a tall ask. The firm fell short of its production targets in FY18. In that light, investors would do well to watch whether production growth momentum seen in April continues. The Coal India stock would also take cues from how demand from the power sector shapes up in the rest of the fiscal year."

He added that the electrification in 2017-18 has increased seven times. 
The minister also said that the railways would procure around 100,000 additional wagons over the next five years, of which half of the wagon requirement will be by Coal India Limited. 
Quoting Steve Jobs, Goyal said great things in business are never done by one person. Industry participation is as important in their mission as to make Indian Railways the newest, finest and safest railways network in the world. It is always a team that needs to work in partnership and the collective effort will help to achieve the common goal. The minister was speaking at Rail Contact 2018 organised by industry lobby group CII. 
Speaking on Indian Railways’ scale of modernisation and transformation, the minister said, it has been able to ramp up renewal of tracks to 476 km every month. In the last 64 years, freight loading has increased by 1,344%, while passenger travel in terms of kilometers has increased 1,642%. The total investments in 2013-14 for railway infrastructure was at Rs46,000 crore, while for 2018-19 it will be Rs1.4 trillion, he added.
He asked the industry to help in developing railway stations under the public-private partnership model as the railways was facing difficulties in finding partners."

The coal production target for June was 52.79 MT, the firm said in a filing to the BSE.

Coal India produced 136.87 million tonnes of coal in April-June period of fiscal year 2018-19, against the output target of 150.77 MT.
Coal India accounts for over 80% of the domestic coal production.
The shortfall has come at a time when some regions, including New Delhi, are facing power shortage due to fast depleting coal stockpiles at power plants. In a letter to the Centre recently, Delhi power minister Satyender Jain stated that thermal power stations Dadri I & II, Jhajjar and Badarpur were facing an “acute coal shortage"" for several days now due to non-availability of transportation rakes.
According to the Central Electricity Authority data, 16 state-run thermal power plants were facing critical stocks or had coal stocks of less than seven days, as of 28 June.

113,2018-07-03,Coal India,"But there's no need to press the panic button yet. Over the years, Coal India Ltd has earned a reputation for missing its guidance

Coal India Ltd achieved 85% of its production target for the month of June, according to provisional numbers released on Sunday. The company had missed its production target in May and April as well. 
Coal India Ltd achieved 85% of its production target for the month of June, according to provisional numbers released on Sunday. The company had missed its production target in May and April as well.
But there’s no need to press the panic button yet. Over the years, the coal producer has earned a reputation for missing its guidance. For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, the company achieved 95% and 93%, respectively, of its production targets. 
Coal India shares fell 1.3% on Monday, a day when the benchmark Sensex declined 0.5%.
What offers reasonable comfort here is the fact that production growth has begun on a strong footing in fiscal year 2019 (FY19), albeit helped by a favourable base effect. Production in June increased 13% year-on-year and for the June quarter, output growth was 15%.
In fact, even dispatch (or sales volume) growth was satisfactory. The measure increased 8.6% in June and 11.7% for the June quarter. Low coal stocks (10 days stock as on 28 June for all India) at power plants help. The expected normative level of stock is 22 days.
In the near term, demand from the power sector is expected to soften a bit. Still, the company is likely to report decent earnings growth in FY19, supported by price hikes taken in January.
While FY18 profit growth has been flattish due to wage provisioning, JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd estimates high growth in FY19 profit (about 20%). This is despite factoring only 7% offtake growth (versus the management’s target of 8.6%) and lower e-auction prices. 
“With all the negatives of wage provisioning and degradation already factored in FY18 earnings, the benefit of growing volumes and price hike would reflect in FY19/20,"" pointed out JM Financial analysts in the March quarter results review report on 31 May.
However, the Coal India stock is down. So far in FY19, the stock has dropped by 11% from the closing high on 31 May. News reports say that the government is considering offloading some stake in Coal India after it received no bids for the Air India divestment. This is one factor that could have weighed on the sentiment; the government owns a 78.55% stake in the company. 
The Coal India stock trades at about 10 times estimated earnings for this year, based on Bloomberg data. In the near term, clarity on a potential divestment, if it is happening, would prove helpful."

New Delhi: Leaving boundaries of their respective parties, political leaders today bid an emotional goodbye to former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee describing him as a visionary statesman with acceptability across a diverse ideological spectrum, a gentle giant and a consensus seeker. 
Vajpayee, who was 93, died at AIIMS this evening after a prolonged illness. Several leaders saw a personal loss in death of Vajpayee, one of India’s most respected leaders who led the nation through several crises and held together a tenuous coalition with his inclusive politics.
Veteran BJP leader L K Advani, who along with Vajpayee was a central figure in the party for much of its existence, described the former prime minister as one of the country’s tallest statesmen and his closest friend for over 65 years whom he will miss immensely.
President Ram Nath Kovind said the “gentle giant"" will be missed by one and all.
Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said Vajpayee was a great patriot and among modern India’s tallest leaders who spent his whole life serving the country.
Former president Pranab Mukherjee said India had lost a great son and an era has come to an end. He described the BJP stalwart as a reasoned critique in the opposition, who dominated the space like a titan, and a seeker of consensus as prime minister. Describing him as a democrat to the core, Mukherjee, in a letter to Vajpayee’s adopted daughter Namita Kaul Bhattacharya, said the former prime minister led the government with aplomb and was an inheritor and practitioner of the best traditions and qualities of leadership.
Congress President Rahul Gandhi said India has lost “a great son"" who was loved and respected by millions. Several of his own party leaders said Vajpayee was an inspiration to millions, an intense speaker and a true diplomat.
BJP chief Amit Shah said Vajpayee nursed the party from its inception to make it a banyan tree and left an indelible mark in Indian politics. The party would work to fulfil the mission he has left behind, Shah told reporters.
Union Minister Jitendra Singh said even non-BJP supporters would listen to Vajpayee in public rallies just to pick up speaking skills from his oratory. Singh, minister of state in the prime minister’s office, said Vajpayee’s demise is a great loss to the nation. “We grew up listening to him, learning from him,inspired by him. There was no electronic media those days, but many of our college-mates,who did not subscribe to our ideology, would come over to his rallies, just to pick up speaking skills from his oratory,"" Singh told PTI.
Union Minister Harsh Vardhan said he has lost his “mentor and guide"" who had hand-held him into politics. “A visionary statesman, with political sagacity, his acceptability across diverse ideological spectrum endeared him to all,"" Vardhan said. He said Indian scientific community would ever be grateful to Vajpayee who he expanded the “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan"" slogan to include “Jai Vigyan"" after the Pokhran nuclear test. His courageous decision to go for the second nuclear test was the beginning of an India to reckon with.
Paying tribute to Vajpayee, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said we are trying to run the government on the path shown by the former prime minister.
Veteran leader Sharad Yadav said Vajpayee was a great human being whose qualities cannot be explained in words. “He was a great poet, leader, Parliamentarian and an able Administrator. His services will always be remembered,"" he said.

Lok Sabha speaker Sumitra Mahajan said Vajpayee had a rare personality and his affectionate nature was unique to him. “He was crafted by the god with special care,"" she said.
Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad said he was deeply saddened by the sad demise of Vajpayee who was a great human being and a true statesman. “He never hesitated in giving full credit to his opposition party leaders whenever due,"" he said.
Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) chief Ram Vilas Paswan said many people are known by the post, but the post of prime minister was very small in front of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. “He was a great politician, intense speaker, a true diplomat, having clarity in thinking, warrior of social justice and a great nationalist,"" Paswan tweeted.
Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma said, “It is a great loss to the country. It was a joy to listen to Atal ji, he cut across ideology, he was a person who had compassion and his belief to take India together is to be remembered. India has become poor in his loss. He has left a deep imprint.""
Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis described the death as his personal loss. Describing him as one of the greatest leaders ever, Fadnavis said his footsteps are followed by many, he is an inspiration to millions, encouraged and taught everyone how to serve the last man with the weapon of democracy.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu also expressed deep sorrow and condolences on the sad demise.
Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav also offered his condolences to Vajpayee and said the inspiration will survive even after the end of a great life.
Odhisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik said,""India has lost the tallest leader.""
OPINION | Atal Bihari Vajpayee: A titan of Indian politics

After a reasonably good start to the first quarter, Coal India Ltd’s outlook for the rest of the fiscal year also looks bright. Demand from the power sector is expected to be strong. Coal stocks at power plants are low. Analysts believe the adverse impact of wage provision and coal grade slippages have also been factored in. Consequently, Coal India is set to benefit from better volume and price increases going ahead.

Coal stocks at power plants are low. Analysts believe the adverse impact of wage provision and coal grade slippages have also been factored in. Consequently, Coal India is set to benefit from better volume and price increases going ahead.
In April and July, Coal India’s production and sales volume increased by 14% and 11%, respectively. While that is good, the numbers also got some support due to a relatively lower base a year ago. According to its fiscal 2018 annual report, Coal India’s production growth target was at 7.5% on a year-on-year basis to 610 million tonnes.
The company’s June quarter results did not disappoint either. Its offtake (or sales volume) increased about 12% year-on-year and blended price realizations increased by about one-tenth. Price increases at the end of the last financial year are reflecting in the realizations of the coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route. Sure, higher share of coal sold through the FSA route in the sales mix is a bit discouraging. However, strong international coal prices meant Coal India’s realization for coal sold through the e-auction route increased by 51%, compensating, to some extent, for the lower volumes sold in this segment.
The upshot: total operating revenue increased by 27% to  ₹  24,261 crore. Costs were under control leading to as much as 63% increase in the reported earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda.
Coal India shares have underperformed the benchmark Sensex so far this financial year. Despite the 2% increase since the coal producer announced its Q1 results, the stock has marginally declined in FY19. On the other hand, the S&P BSE Sensex has increased by 15%. News reports that the government is likely to sell a 5-10% stake in the company is an overhang on the stock.
Valuations are hardly demanding with Coal India shares trading at 10.6 times estimated earnings for this financial year, according to Bloomberg data.
“We see Coal India generating free cash flow (post capex) of  ₹  13,000-13,500 crore over the next two years,"" wrote analysts from Edelweiss Securities in a report on 13 August.

106,2018-08-29,Coal India,"In India or elsewhere, coalition governments have not harmed economic performance, and could even help drive growth, shows a 'Mint' analysis

New Delhi: Multiple opinion polls suggest that anti-incumbency sentiment is on the rise, which could thwart the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) attempt to win a majority on its own in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. According to the latest poll conducted by Karvy Insights and India Today, the BJP is likely to win 30% of votes in the 2019 elections, and secure 245 seats, 27 short of a parliamentary majority. Previous polls conducted by Lokniti-CSDS also suggest that the BJP’s popularity is on the decline although it continues to remain the most popular party in the country.

Previous polls conducted by Lokniti-CSDS also suggest that the BJP’s popularity is on the decline although it continues to remain the most popular party in the country.
The collective weight of the evidence suggests that large coalitions could once again become the norm in Indian politics, come 2019. Whether it will be a BJP-led coalition or a Congress-led, it is still too early to tell.
The return of coalitions also means the return of coalition criticisms. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already dismissed the Congress’ proposed grand alliance as a failed idea.
Critics argue that coalitions are unstable, create policy gridlock and slow growth. The implication is that strong, majority governments are decisive and better for the economy.
But is this true?
Coalition governments do not seem to harm economic performance either in India or elsewhere, a Mint analysis shows. Coalition governments have hardly hindered India’s transition to a high-growth trajectory since the 1980s. If anything, the pace of economic reforms has accelerated since the polity became more fragmented in the late 1980s.
Taken together, the UPA and NDA are associated with the fastest growth in Indian history (growing at a CAGR of 6.4% across their tenures). Conversely, in the first five Lok Sabhas where Congress dominated (almost 70% of seats), growth was significantly lower (CAGR of 3.6%). More than just growth, there also seems to be greater economic stability in coalition times. The standard deviation of growth (a measure of volatility) between 1989 and 2014 has been lower than earlier. Only the old GDP (gross domestic product) series data has been used in this analysis.
On other key economic indicators, there is no discernible difference. For instance, current account deficits (barring the current account crisis in early 1990s) have remained in a similar range in the pre-coalition and coalition era.
Globally too, there is little evidence of coalitions hurting growth. Coalitions are prominent in rich countries, especially in Europe where the proportional representation system generates fragmentation. Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Finland have all been ruled by coalition governments for the last 20 years, shows data from the Comparative Political Data Set (CPDS), maintained by the University of Berne. 
In 2016, half of all OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ) and European governments were ruled by coalitions. Analysing the growth rates of coalition and non-coalition governments in the OECD between 1996 and 2016 reveals no obvious pattern, but the fastest growing economy in the OECD (Ireland) during that period did flourish under significant coalition rule.
 Some political scientists argue that coalitions can actually cause economic growth. Christophe Jaffrelot has suggested that coalition governments generate more inclusive policies because the coalitions represent a wider array of groups and communities. In his book Coalition Politics and Economic Development, another political scientist, Irfan Nooruddin shows that coalitions, because they represent different groups, create constraints on the government’s ability to change policy suddenly and arbitrarily. These ‘credible constraints’ result in policy stability, attracting longer-term and more stable investment, he suggests. One casualty of the coalition era has been the parliament, which has seen much greater logjam than before. The number of bills passed has decreased significantly from 360 bills in the first Lok Sabha (1952-57) to 179 under UPA-II (2009-14).
That apart, coalitions seem to have a solid record in economic management."

For perspective, in April and July, production and offtake had increased 14% and 11%, respectively. Nonetheless, analysts aren’t concerned about the August growth rates, attributing the performance partially to last year’s higher base.
In August 2017, production increased 16%, while offtake growth was even better at 19%. In fact, Edelweiss Securities Ltd’s analysts say the August 2018 offtake at 45.2 million tonnes is the highest ever the company has seen for the month. Besides, for April and August, production and offtake increased by 12% and 9.5%, respectively, which is not too bad.
“Going ahead, we estimate offtake to pick up further as seasonal weakness ebbs. Hence, there is a good possibility of CIL meeting/exceeding our full-year estimate of 620 million tonnes,"" said Edelweiss in a report on 3 September.
Coal India did well in the recently concluded June quarter. Its blended price realizations increased by 10% year-on-year. Price increase taken at the end of FY18 boosted realizations of the coal sold through the fuel supply agreement route. Further, strong global prices helped coal sold through the e-auction route.
Coal India investors though haven’t had much luck. The company’s shares lagged the benchmark Sensex substantially so far in FY19. Reports that the government is considering a 5-10% stake sale in the company have been an overhang.
On the bright side, valuations are not demanding. The Coal India stock trades at 10.5 times estimated earnings for FY19, based on Bloomberg data. The earnings outlook is also decent."

Talcher Fertilizers Ltd is a joint venture between state run GAIL (India) Ltd, Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers Limited (RCF) and Coal India Ltd (CIL). Once commissioned, it will produce 1.26 million metric tonne per annum of neem coated urea.
The Talcher project will reduce dependence on urea and gas imports, Modi said.
“The plant will promote alternative use of domestic coal in an environment friendly manner, thereby supporting India’s commitments under the CoP 21 Paris Agreement 2016. It will produce 2.38 million metric standard cubic meter per day (MMSCMD) natural gas equivalent syngas from coal, leading to reduction in import bill of liquefied natural gas (LNG) by more than  ₹ 1,620 crore per annum,"" GAIL said in a statement.
Reviving sick fertiliser units has been a policy priority of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government as it reduces import of the most commonly used fertiliser urea and deepens the market for natural gas. Gas-based fertiliser units will also add to the customer base of gas trading and energy infrastructure firms such as Gail India Ltd.
Prime Minister Modi is also slated to inaugurate the Jharsuguda airport in the state today.
This comes in the backdrop of the BJD government and the NDA government trying to drum up investments for the state in the countdown to the state assembly elections next year. 
In the run-up to 2019 general elections, Modi said he has been told that the project will be commissioned within 36 months, and he will come back after 36 months to inaugurate the project.
While GAIL, RCF and CIL hold 29.67% each, Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd (FCIL) has a 10.99% stake in the Rs13,000 crore Talcher project. The project is expected to provide direct and indirect employment to 4,500 people.
According to GAIL, FCIL set up the Talcher unit in 1971. Given the problems faced by the unit, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) declared FCIL a sick unit in 1992 and the government started work to close the company in 2002.
The NDA government has been focusing on reviving stalled projects in eastern India such as the Assam gas cracker project inaugurated in 2016 and the ongoing revival of sick fertiliser units at Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, Sindri in Jharkhand, Barauni in Bihar and Talcher in Odisha.
The government wants to step up urea production. India’s urea production capacity is expected to go up from the current 25 million tonnes to 34 million tonnes by 2021-22, according to government estimates.
Speaking separately at a political rally, Modi also spoke about bringing central government schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) and Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana to the people of Odisha.
The Prime Minister said under PMJDY, aimed at providing a bank account to every Indian household, around 1.30 crore bank accounts were already opened for the people of Odisha. Also, under Ujjwala Yojana, which aims to provide free cooking gas connections to poor families, 34 lakh connections have been given in the state.
The Prime Minister also took a dig at the Naveen Patnaik government and said toilets were not being constructed under the Swachh Bharat Mission. He added that the BJD government should also come on-board the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY).
The ambitious health scheme, also known as Modicare, aims to offer an annual health cover of  ₹ 5 lakh per family, targeting more than 100 million families belonging to the poor and vulnerable sections of the society, based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census (SECC) database. The expenditure incurred in premium payment will be shared by the Centre and state governments."

New Delhi: India needs a strong and decisive leadership in the coming years to stay on the high growth trajectory at a time when it faces a plethora external challenges, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley said on Tuesday.
Jaitley took a dig at the opposition, saying unstable coalitions or politicians with no clear policy direction aspiring to be the Prime Minister are not what an economy like India needs. 
“What does India need if this path of high growth trajectory has to continue? India needs a decisive and strong leadership at the centre. A weak leadership could not have handled IL&FS the way the present government did. That a crisis in the making was handled with swiftness is just one example of the way this government has been acting,"" Jaitley said at an event organized by Assocham.
Jaitley’s comments come at a time the Narendra Modi-led government is seeking a second term in general elections due in 2019. 
“India needs higher growth, higher revenue, better infrastructure and more revenue for the poor. You need a government which is absolutely clear on its policy direction. What India needs is not individuals with a lack of understanding of policy or lack of understanding of direction or inherently unstable coalitions. India needs a government and leadership that has absolute clarity of direction,"" he said.
High oil prices will be a big challenge, as will domestic policies followed by some countries that impact India, Jaitley said.
“We are net buyers of oil. Global oil prices, which have risen because of artificial shortages that have been created, adversely impact us. We have to face that challenge by making our economy so resilient that we have the capacity to handle the challenge. The domestic policies of certain countries have spillover effects on us. These won’t be everlasting and are transient in character. We need to prepare ourselves for this,"" he said."

Institutional buyers had on Wednesday bid for 15.84 crore shares or 1.06 times the equity earmarked for them.
Taking together the bids from institutional and retail investors in the two day offer for sale (OFS), the government has sold 3.18% stake in Coal India which will fetch about Rs5,300 crore to the exchequer.
The government had planned to sell over 18.62 crore shares or 3% in Coal India Ltd (CIL) at a floor price of Rs266 apiece.
On top of the 3% stake sale, the government also had an option to retain an over-subscription (green shoe option) of another 6% stake in the CIL OFS.
The government has exercised green shoe option to the extent of 0.18% in case of Coal India, an official said. Shares of Coal India closed at Rs261.10, down 1.90% over previous close.
The government held 78.32% stake in Coal India at the end of September. The government has already raised over Rs10,028 crore through PSU stake sale, including by way of follow on offer of Bharat-22 ETF, and initial public offering of four PSUs -- RITES, IRCON, Mishra Dhatu Nigam Ltd (MIDHANI) and Garden Reach Shipbuilders.
The stake sale in Coal India would help the government move forward towards the  ₹ 80,000 crore disinvestment target in current fiscal.
The government had last sold 10% stake in CIL through an OFS in January 2015. It had then collected up about Rs23,000 crore.

98,2018-11-06,Coal India,"Thermal generation in September 2018 was supported by an increase in monthly coal production by Coal India

 New Delhi: After three months of decline, short-term power prices increased in September, mainly driven by higher demand and lower generation from renewables, said India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) in its report Tuesday. 
 New Delhi: After three months of decline, short-term power prices increased in September, mainly driven by higher demand and lower generation from renewables, said India Ratings and Research (Ind-Ra) in its report Tuesday.
Ind-Ra in its October edition of credit news digest on India’s power sector highlighted the trends in the sector, with a focus on capacity addition, generation, transmission, merchant power, deficit, regulatory changes and recent rating actions.
According to the report in September 2018, short-term power prices rallied upwards to  ₹ 4.69/unit (over September 2017 rate of  ₹ 4.09/unit), post three months of decline, driven by a higher power demand, lower generation from wind capacities, and scanty rainfall and dry weather in some states in the second half of September 2018.
To meet the short-term power requirement, 5,725 MUs (million units) were traded on the Indian Energy Exchange in September 2018, up 44% m-o-m (month-on-month) and 40% y-o-y (year-on-year).
In September 2018, all-India energy requirements increased 7% y-o-y and available energy increased 7.4%, leaving a power deficit of 0.5% (September 2017: 0.9%). The power supply in September 2018 was met through higher hydro (up 23.5% y-o-y) and thermal generation (up 2.7%).
Although generation from renewables also increased 53.6% y-o-y on account of an increase in installed capacity (20%); generation declined 29.5% m-o-m, driven by lower generation from wind energy. Overall, the total power generation increased 8.7% y-o-y in September 2018, it added.
The lower renewables generation coupled with no new capacity addition in the thermal space led to higher reliance on thermal power, which resulted in an increase in all-India PLF (plant load factor or capacity utilization) to 61.1% in September 2018, compared to 60.7% in the same month previous fiscal.
Thermal generation in September 2018 was supported by an increase in monthly coal production by Coal India (up 3.8% y-o-y) to 40.2MT. Coal inventory at power stations also improved 30.3%.
However, it said the number of power plants with sub-critical level of coal inventory increased to 22 in September 2018 (It was 22 in September 2017), on account of uneven distribution of coal across power stations and prioritised coal supply to central and state power stations."
99,2018-11-06,Coal India,"India needs to allow private sector entry into coal production and laying of private railway lines (connecting to major hubs), otherwise, the mesh of policies on coal, power will end up strangulating growth

There is an apocryphal story that goes like this: Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru on a visit to Bihar enquired why mining activity was down. He was told that there were not enough wagons to evacuate the coal from the mines to the factories. Why not enough wagons? Because there wasn’t enough steel for making the wagons. And steel production was constrained because of power shortage. And why was there power shortage? Because there wasn’t enough coal coming out of the mines! Our present coal production is much higher from those early days, but we still seem to be caught up in the deadlock of circularity.

There are at least two new factors in this deadlock of circularity. One is the stress in bank loans given to the power sector. More than  ₹ 1.8 trillion are in these stressed accounts, which might all land up in bankruptcy proceedings. Hence, no further bank funding is forthcoming either as fresh loans or working capital. This can lead to more bottlenecks in projects as well as operations. The stressed banking assets (bad loans) include an estimated 15 gigawatt (GW) generation capacity that is stranded for want of fuel."

Coal India Ltd’s June quarter results had shown that the fuel producer had started the year well. While two swallows do not a summer make, it’s heartening to note that earnings growth was robust in the second quarter as well. Consolidated net profit of  ₹ 3,086 crore for the September quarter broadly meets the estimates of analysts polled by Bloomberg.  
Coal India Ltd’s June quarter results had shown that the fuel producer had started the year well. While two swallows do not a summer make, it’s heartening to note that earnings growth was robust in the second quarter as well. Consolidated net profit of  ₹ 3,086 crore for the September quarter broadly meets the estimates of analysts polled by Bloomberg. 
What helped? 
Primarily, realizations rose both for coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route as well as the e-auction route. E-auctions, which account for 13% of volumes, witnessed a 61% jump in realizations, with demand outstripping supply by a mile. FSA realizations increased 7%, while volumes in the segment rose 12%.
Overall, the company’s operating revenue increased about 22% to  ₹ 22,198 crore. Net profit shows a whopping growth of more than eight times over the same period last year, thanks to the increase in realizations as well as to a low base last year. Profits had fallen 40% in the year-ago September quarter.
Moving ahead, the outlook on offtake (or sales volume) is upbeat. So far this fiscal year (April to October), offtake has increased 7.4% over the year-ago period. For perspective, offtake had increased by 6.8% in FY18. 
Coal stocks at power plants are low. Analysts expect power plants to continue restocking, which would support volume growth. What’s more, e-auction prices are likely to remain stronger even as volumes could be under pressure. 
“Diversion of coal towards power utilities will weigh on e-auction mix. But tighter e-auction coal supply as a result will support strong e-auction prices in our view,"" wrote Bhaskar Basu of Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 12 November.
As for the Coal India stock, it helps that valuations are not demanding. Currently, the stock trades at 10 times estimated earnings for FY19, based on Bloomberg data. “The stock offers over 7% dividend yield potential,"" points out Basu. 
Of course, the fact that the company is exposed to the vagaries of the commodity cycle and government ownership means that not many investors may get excited about the low valuations."

95,2018-11-30,Coal India,"In India, where most energy is still derived from non-renewable sources such as coal, better building facilities management significantly impacts the economy

Buildings play a key role in global energy consumption, eating up about 40% of all energy humanity makes. Buildings also produce 36% of all carbon emissions globally. By 2030, this consumption is expected to reach 50%. In India, the numbers are even steep. Indian buildings consume 70% of all energy generated, of which 50% go only for comfort, such as cooling, and lighting.  
Buildings play a key role in global energy consumption, eating up about 40% of all energy humanity makes. Buildings also produce 36% of all carbon emissions globally. By 2030, this consumption is expected to reach 50%. In India, the numbers are even steep. Indian buildings consume 70% of all energy generated, of which 50% go only for comfort, such as cooling, and lighting. 
The Energy and Resources Institute in India (TERI) says that commercial buildings alone contribute to 8 percent of all building, which are all potential places for facilities optimization initiatives. More than 80 percent of the total lifecycle energy of buildings goes into operations alone, with electricity accounting for more than 90% of it. 
In today’s connected age, the sheer power of bringing together various aspects of building facilities on to a single IoT (Internet of Things) platform makes a remarkable difference to not only a company’s bottom line, but also to the environment. In India, where most energy is still derived from non-renewable sources such as coal, better building facilities management significantly impacts the economy, and eases the stress on the environment. 
The above section focusses much on building energy rather our primary goals include operations, asset health, and sustainability. We could start off with the problem that automation and FM-tech don’t interoperate today and that’s necessary for real-time optimization. Like below, The role of facilities management is changing rapidly, with building owners increasingly expecting facilities management teams to be stakeholders and collaborators for business growth. As an industry, facilities management largely involves people, process, and machines working together. This mandates huge operational spend (globally, facilities services spend is close to $1 trillion today and the spend on energy in buildings is also close to that amount). And despite billions of dollar worth of investments, CRE facilities continue to operate at sub-optimal levels. 
This is because traditionally the building automation layer and the facility management layer have acted independent of each other that has consequently buried useful data and created expensive operational inefficiencies. Up until now, CREs and FMs have been put at a blind-spot and have relied on inefficient processes of juggling between tools and systems to firefight issues rather than proactively controlling operations from the driver’s seat. But now, the focus is shifting towards highly efficient operations and an elevated occupant experience. 
The advantage in technology adoption to unify operations and centrally manage portfolio performance in real-time is multi-fold and it helps to concurrently optimize the lifespan of assets and improve sustainability savings. Operating costs have always been a primary outlay for CREs and this software-led approach directly benefits the net operating income for property owners, while significantly enhancing the amenity value of the property. 
IoT-based platforms: A unified approach for qualitative and quantitative improvement of facilities:
IoT has already begun to positively impact every aspect of buildings, from construction to living, and management. IoT-enabled buildings open new windows into efficient management of facilities when real-time data and insights are available to take informed decisions. In legacy buildings that do not have the facility to either install new systems altogether, or to invest heavily in new hardware, software-driven retrofit integration proves to be an excellent solution. When disparate data from various individual building automation systems are brought together and managed on a single platform, such a unified view and real-time control enables and empowers CREs to take informed decisions and improve bottom-line effectively. 
Facilities optimization with the power of IoT is much more than undertaking energy savings initiatives alone. It is a constant pursuit of improving every aspect of end-to-end facilities management such as real-time building data management, centralized asset performance, fault detection and corrective workflow integration, and tenant request management at both qualitative, and quantitative levels. While streamlined processes, predictive maintenance, workforce efficiency, better asset health and increased resident comfort figure in the qualitative front, energy savings, operating cost reduction and manpower optimization reduction feature in the quantitative front. 
AI and ML in facilities optimization: It gets better with time, and why:
When building owners equip building performance evaluators with a real-time data-backed unified IoT solution, real optimization can be achieved. Facilities optimization is much more than a break-fix, find-and-replace approach of maintaining our living spaces. It is a holistic approach of proactively tuning the whole system into a virtuous cycle, where data empowers continuous improvements of workforce, asset health, and sustainability savings, and the occupant experience, and not serve just as a problem finder. 
What gets measured, gets managed. With artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, a unified platform of facilities data can help achieve the best optimization for any building, based on deeper analysis of patterns, anomalies in usage, peak-hour demand, lifetime of fixtures and appliances – in concurrence with maintenance personnel and operational workflows. 
Therefore, the journey towards facilities optimization begins when data is pooled into a unified platform, and accelerates when AI and ML kick in to zero-in on the root causes of failures and gaps, arrive at actionable insights, and ensures corrective active in real-time. Further, as is with any data-enabled system, IoT-driven facilities management solutions get better with time, as more data patterns invariably helps in making better predictions and maintenance cycle decisions. The sheer repeatability, mobility, scalability, and concurrence make IoT-enabled centralized facilities optimization, a compelling value proposition in the long run.

So far this fiscal year, the stock has underperformed the BSE 100 index, despite decent results in the first two quarters. Analysts say sentiment for the Coal India stock has been muted owing to the government’s offer to sell a 3% stake in the company, and the resulting increase in free float.

Analysts say sentiment for the Coal India stock has been muted owing to the government’s offer to sell a 3% stake in the company, and the resulting increase in free float.
Further, the launch of the fourth tranche of CPSE Exchange Traded Fund (ETF), which included Coal India in the basket, did not help either. After all, if there are other avenues to buy the same shares, demand in the secondary market naturally gets impacted.
Unfortunately, the company’s recently released coal production and offtake, or sales volume, numbers for November don’t offer much inspiration for investors. Production and offtake increased 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively, last month, on a year-on-year basis. The drag in November has pulled down overall growth numbers for FY19 so far.
When October numbers were announced, the company’s production and offtake growth cumulatively over April to October was 10.1% and 7.4%, respectively. April-November coal production and offtake growth has fallen to 8.8% and 6.5%, respectively.
For the rest of FY19, therefore, Coal India’s production needs to grow by 14% to achieve its FY19 production target of 630 million tonnes, pointed out analysts from SBICAP Securities Ltd in a report on 3 December. Offtake growth needs to be 12% for the company to meet its target. These are tall asking rates. This also increases the chances of Coal India missing its targets. The company achieved 95% of its production target and 97% of its offtake target in FY18.
Meanwhile, outlook for international coal prices isn’t rosy and that is expected to weigh on prices of coal sold through the e-auction route, which typically follows market prices. “Seasonally lower demand from China and its decision to restrict imports led to a decline in global thermal prices in November (by 11% from the peak in October),"" said SBICAP analysts.
Sure, coal demand remains strong both from power and non-power sectors, which augurs well for the offtake outlook. In that backdrop, higher production would be helpful.
For now though, the above- mentioned factors are likely to dampen sentiment for the Coal India stock. On the bright side, the underperformance of its shares has made valuations undemanding. The stock trades at nine times estimated earnings for FY19, based on Bloomberg data."

Kolkata: The Kolkata bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) has ordered commencement of corporate insolvency resolution process against the Eastern Coalfields (ECL), a subsidiary of the Coal India, for non-payment of interest.
The order came after the NCLT admitted an insolvency petition filed by Hinduja Group-controlled Gulf Oil Lubricants India (GOLIL).
Although the ECL had paid the principal sum of around  ₹ 84.71 lakh to GOLIL, one of its operational creditors, it allegedly declined to pay the interest amount at the rate of 18 per cent per annum.

Coal India Ltd’s shares are no diamond in the mine. The stock has been a laggard so far this fiscal year, underperforming the Nifty 500 index by 15%, even after adding back the generous dividend it paid investors.
Expect the trend to continue because production and offtake numbers for December are not encouraging at all. Output and sales volumes (or offtake) last month declined by 0.9% and 1.2%, respectively, on a year-on-year basis. According to analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd, the fall in shipments is a first since October 2016.
Sure, growth rates for the nine month period ended December are better with production and offtake increasing by 7.4% and 5.5%, respectively, over the same period last year. But this is hardly helpful. Coal India’s asking production growth rate for the remaining three months to meet its target of 630 million tonnes for FY19 will have to be about 19% year-on-year. That’s a tall order and it’s a foregone conclusion the company will miss its guidance.
From a slightly more near-term perspective, expectations from the December quarter aren’t particularly rosy. That’s mainly on account of subdued outlook on volumes of coal sold through the e-auction route. E-auction coal typically follows market prices and enjoys higher realizations compared to coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA).
“The e-auction volume dwindled in Oct-Nov’18 as the government prioritized supply to power plants under FSA in the festive period, thereby offsetting the benefit of high e-auction premiums,"" wrote analysts from SBICAP Securities Ltd in a note on 2 January. This is likely to impact Coal India’s blended price realization and profitability in the December quarter, added the broker.
Besides, impacted by grade slippages, wage revision and elevated capex, Coal India’s free cash flow to equity (FCFE) increased at a tepid compound annual growth rate of 2.5% over fiscal years 2014-2018 less than half of growth in volumes, pointed out analysts from Prabhudas Lilladher Pvt. Ltd in a report on 26 December.
“We expect FCFE growth to languish between 2.0-2.2% in FY19e-FY21e due to stable earnings growth and high capex intensity,"" they added.
These factors will continue to keep sentiments muted for the Coal India stock. In fact, the stock hasn’t performed on the bourses despite coughing up good numbers for the half- year ended September. 
In the last few months, the government’s offer to sell shares in the company, leading to an increase in free float, is another reason that weighed on the stock."

DAVOS :
Emphasising that cybersecurity is crucial to keep the world safe, global leaders have urged India and the US to join an international coalition against cyber threats.
""The world's biggest democracy needs to stand with the world's other great democratic nations. The world needs India,"" Microsoft's President and Chief Legal Officer Bradford L Smith said here at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2019.
Participating in a panel discussion on 'A new architecture for cyber cooperation', he said, ""It is really about keeping the world safe.""
The world depends on digital infrastructure, it depends on our devices, and they're under attack every single day, he said.
During the discussion, Smith and other experts hoped that democracies which have not signed the Paris Call of November 12, 2018 for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, including India and the US, will join the multi-stakeholder initiative.
They called for a ""coalition of the willing"" to embrace the Paris Call, a multi-stakeholder declaration that favours the development of common principles for securing cyberspace.
The Paris Call has been signed by 64 states, more than 300 private-sector companies and over 150 NGOs and other civil society organisations.
It offers a framework for multilateral action on addressing the critical issue of cybersecurity in a time of increasingly prolific and sophisticated attacks by criminal organisations as well as nation states.
While noting that the Paris Call has been signed by all 28 members of the European Union and by all but one member of NATO, as well as other democratic states, including Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea, Smith singled out two holdouts -- India and the US.
Smith attributed the US reluctance to sign to the current American administration's aversion to multilateralism, but warned, ""Some of the most serious attacks are those against democracy itself. The most significant threat is to voting systems.""
He acknowledged the difficulty of assessing the actual impact of interference operations on the outcome of the 2016 US election, but said, ""Let's focus on what we do know.""
""We do know that 30 million Americans have read intentional disinformation by governments, and they shared it, they liked it, and they believed it. It was done with the goal of disrupting democracy. It was not limited to the United States alone Every single candidate running for the French presidency was attacked in some way. It is a problem, a threat to democracy, and needs to be addressed,"" he said.
Smith and other cybersecurity experts emphasised the importance of attribution but said that itself is not enough.
""I don't think one can expect governments to change what they're doing if there aren't consequences, he said.
Smith also said that the responsibility for security begins with the tech companies themselves.
""People can't trust tech unless they have confidence in the companies that create the technology,"" he said, noting that the Cambridge Analytica incident -- in which Facebook user data was acquired illicitly by a now-defunct political data analytics company -- was a turning point in public distrust of tech companies.
""Tech companies and the sector as a whole need to address this, and they must start with acknowledging the scepticism,"" he said.
Action needs to be taken, he added. ""The public has developed a keen ability to differentiate between words and deeds.""
He, however, said that ""we shouldn't look to the private sector alone to respond to what are essentially military grade cyber attacks. The private sector has not saved the nation from military attacks before.""
Troels Oerting Jorgensen, Head of Centre for Cybersecurity at the WEF, said we are in uncharted waters but lacking the correct global architecture to navigate.
""We must not sell fear but protect hope to make sure the good side of the internet is always in focus,"" he added.
Alison Martin, group chief risk officer at Zurich Insurance Company, said cyber is the number one risk of doing business in many parts of the world.
""If you drive badly, then we charge you a bit more. But if you have bad digital hygiene, you risk infecting everyone, so charging more isn't the answer,"" Martin said.
Tzipi Livni, Head of the Hatnuah Party in Israel, said she believes that cyber attacks are affecting the nature of democracy itself.
Catherine de Bolle, Executive Director of Europol, talked about the worrying rise in the live-streaming of online child abuse.
She also stressed on the need for better exchange of data to counter financial crimes in cyber space, saying we need to move from a compliance-led to a more intelligence-led exchange of information.
As per latest research, more than half of cyber attacks result in financial losses of more than $500,000.
Besides, economic loss due to cyber crime is predicted to reach $3 trillion by 2020, and 74%  of the world's businesses can expect to be hacked in the coming year, another research has showed.

89,2019-01-25,Coal India,"Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, one of the world's largest consumers of coalThat trade gap has been hurting the valuation of the rupee, the worst performing major Asian currency in 2018

NEW DELHI :
India's 2018 thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years, according to two industry sources, despite moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to cut imports in a bid to reduce its trade deficit.
Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, one of the world's largest consumers of coal, and the rise in imports of the fuel after two consecutive years of decline adds to its trade deficit.
That trade gap has been hurting the valuation of the rupee, the worst performing major Asian currency in 2018.
Thermal coal imports jumped 19% to 171.85 million tonnes in 2018, the highest since 2014, according to data from American Fuels & Natural Resources. Thermal coal is mainly used to produce electricity.
Imports of coking coal - which is mainly used in the manufacturing of steel - rose at the quickest rate since 2015 - according to consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie and American Fuels & Natural Resources, a trader of US based coal.
India imported 52.26 million tonnes of coking coal in 2018, up 14 percent from 45.93 million tonnes in 2017, the data showed.
The value of all coal imports for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 was 31.4 percent higher at 1.38 trillion Indian rupees ($19.45 billion) than it was in the same period in 2017, according to government data reviewed by Reuters.
The value of India's coal imports was 1.38 trillion in all of 2017.
Traders say coal imports grew largely due to restrictions on consumption of petroleum coke, a dirtier alternative to coal, in some parts of the country.
""2018 was a booming year for coal imports in India, mostly on the back of demand from cement and small and medium-scale industries in India,"" said Puneet Gupta, founder of online coal and petcoke marketplace Coalshastra.
""Higher demand was also fuelled by restrictions on the use of petcoke,"" he said. Petcoke consumption dropped about 15 percent in 2018, according to government data.
Imports of coking and non-coking coal totalled 176.65 million tonnes in the April-November period, compared with 156.92 million in the same period last year.
While higher coal imports may be bad news for India's trade deficit, they are a boon for international miners such as Indonesia's Adaro Energy, Australia's Whitehaven Coal, U.S, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp and global commodity merchants such as Glencore.
Indonesia provided more than 61 percent of India's thermal coal imports, while South Africa accounted for 22 percent and the United States more than 7 percent.
Imports of U.S. thermal coal, which burns better compared with Indonesian coal, almost doubled to 12.46 million tonnes in 2018, according to American Fuels.
The ports of Mundra, Krishnapatnam and Kandla handled about 37.5 percent of all of the the thermal coal imports, according to American Fuels.
The Adani Group, which handles about a third of India's imported coal, said last year it expects a ""reasonable rise in imports"" till fiscal year 2021 due to ""rail transportation challenges"" affecting India's domestic coal industry.
Analysts say they expect India to be a key market for global miners in 2019 as China's ""war on pollution"" will lead to lower demand from that country."

Coking coal imports in the same period were 34.36 million tonnes, according to government data for April-November. American Fuels estimated those imports were 34.40 million tonnes.
The value of all coal imports for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 28.7 percent higher at  ₹1.72 trillion ($24.25 billion) than it was a year earlier, according to government data from the coal and trade ministries reviewed by Reuters.

Imports of U.S. thermal coal, which burns better compared with Indonesian coal, almost doubled to 12.46 million tonnes in 2018, according to American Fuels.
Cheaper coal from countries such as Indonesia are likely to be preferred by buyers in India in 2019, over better burning coal from the United States, due to lower freight costs, according to Ali Yasrab, director of Iman Resources, a UAE-based trader of US origin coal.
""If coal prices reach 2018 peak levels, US coal will become popular in India again,"" Yasrab said.
The ports of Mundra, Krishnapatnam and Kandla handled about 37.5% of all of the thermal coal imports, according to American Fuels.

87,2019-01-29,Coal India,"Present rules do not allow women to work in underground minesThe new provision would allow them to work in any shift in open cast mine at any time of the day

The Labour Ministry has decided to amend rules for allowing women to work in underground coal mines during day time and in open cast mines round the clock, for the first time, in a bid to bring gender equity and generate job opportunities.
""The ministry has decided to extend the timing of women workers in coal mines initially and would be extended in other such mining sectors on the basis of the initiative. A notification in the regard has already been sent for publication and it would be enforced in next couple of days,"" a senior official said.
Present rules do not allow women to work in underground mines. This provision of allowing them to work in underground coal mines is expected to bring more employment opportunities for them.
At present, women are allowed to work in open cast mines for fixed hours during day time mainly. The new provision would allow them to work in any shift in open cast mine at any time of the day.
The official said, ""At present the strength of Coal India is around 3 lakh, of which women strength ranges from 15-20%t. The relaxed timing for women in open cast mining operation and permission to enter underground coal mines would make them eligible for more jobs available in the public as well as private sector as there are some captive coal mines also.""
The official further informed, ""The new rules provide that there must be at least three consenting women for working in an underground coal mine. At present only some women officials have permission to enter an underground mine for inspection and other purposes.""
A coal company official said, ""Women are not participating in active coal mining in the country as their jobs are generally supportive in nature like working in workshops and drilling holes for blasting etc. Some women these day have learnt to drive dumper and other machines. They are doing these jobs also. But women workers are mainly those who have got job either on compassionate ground or land oustees (those who get job in lieu of their land as compensation).""

85,2019-01-31,Coal India,"Though cost under-recoveries are falling, they remain sizeable. Last quarter, the firm was unable to recover  ₹160 crore NTPC’s working capital is getting stretched, adding to finance costs

Shares of NTPC Ltd have lost 19% over the past year as tight fuel supplies impacted utilization levels at its power plants, weighing on earnings. The December quarter has been relatively better on the operations front. Compared to a fall in the past three quarters, both availability and utilization levels of the coal plants improved year-on- year.
The improvement drove up generation, helping the company clock a 15% rise in revenue. But as was the case in earlier quarters, this growth yielded limited earnings benefits. Reported profit was up just 1%. Perhaps to assuage investors’ concerns, the NTPCboard recommended a 1:5 bonus issue of equity shares.
Further the company’s efforts to resolve fuel issues are bearing fruit. It issued an import tender and began lifting additional coal from Coal India Ltd.
The measures will almost halve the cost under-recoveries due to fuel constraints in the current fiscal year (vis-à-vis the previous one), the management told analysts.
But how much of a boost these measures and the bonus issue can provide to investor sentiment has to be seen. Though cost under-recoveries due to fuel constraints are falling, they remain sizeable. Last quarter the company was unable to recover as much a  ₹160 crore.
With NTPC planning to add 4,000 megawatts (MW) in the rest of the fiscal year and an estimated 5,000MW in FY20, some wonder if the company will be able to find the required fuel at affordable rates.
Adding to the concerns is payment delays from several state utilities. The delays are attributed to weak financial position of the concerned states. Also the company is making advance payments to Indian Railways, a major vendor.
As a consequence, NTPC’s working capital is getting stretched, adding to finance costs.
The company does have a redressal mechanism in place. For instance, it levies a surcharge on delayed payments. But the net impact of all this— cost under-recoveries, large advances to Indian Railways and delay in payments—is a huge impact on NTPC’s earnings. The reported profit in the first nine months of FY19 was flat from year-ago levels.
So while NTPC may continue to have an enviable capacity addition pipeline assuring growth trajectory, other concerns are weighing on investor sentiment. This can limit the much awaited expansion in stock valuations."
84,2019-02-01,Coal India,"India is one of the world's largest consumers of coal and rising imports of the fuel are adding to a burgeoning trade deficit

The Indian government will increase spending on exploration of coal and lignite by 20% in the coming financial year but will slash funding for coal mine safety and conservation, according to the budget document released on Friday.
India is one of the world's largest consumers of coal and rising imports of the fuel are adding to a burgeoning trade deficit, prompting the government to invest in developing more domestic resources.
In the 2019/20 financial year that begins in April, the government aims to spend 6 billion rupees ($84 million) on exploration of coal and lignite, the document for the 2019/20 budget showed.
At the same time, it will cut spending on conservation, safety and related infrastructure development by about a third from last year to 1.35 billion rupees, according to the document.
India is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a coal miner, with one miner dying every six days on average in 2017, according to government data, but this will be the second straight year that the government has cut spending on safety.
The coal ministry said that coal companies had their own safety budgets.
State-run Coal India Ltd has a near monopoly, producing over four-fifths of the country's coal output. It allocated 8.6 billion rupees for safety-related expenditure for the year ending March 2019, up from 8 billion rupees a year earlier, the ministry said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
It did not say how much it would allocate for safety-related spending in 2019/20.
India scrapped a separate excise duty levied on coal companies, which was used by the federal coal ministry to shore up funds for enhancing safety, after it reformed tax policies in 2017.
The coal ministry said it had increased spending for exploration in 2019/20 to develop more coal blocks to increase domestic coal production and minimize imports.
""This will also enable (the) release of more coal blocks for auction/allocation,"" the ministry said.
In 2018, India's thermal coal imports rose at the fastest pace in four years, according to two industry sources, despite moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to cut imports."

NEW DELHI :
Interim finance minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday hinted that Union minister Arun Jaitley who has returned from the US on Saturday may resume charge of the finance ministry soon.
“I have got this opportunity to address you because I have the temporary charge of the finance ministry. It is a matter of happiness that Arun Jaitley has returned yesterday evening in good health. I spoke to him yesterday and told him that can I excuse myself from this event. He said, ‘No, because you have agreed for this event, you have to go’,"" Goyal said at the foundation day event of Security Printing and Minting Corporation of India Ltd, which prints currency notes and mints coins.
A finance ministry official, however, said under condition of anonymity that Jaitley is unlikely to resume office during the current session of Parliament which ends on Wednesday. “Piyush Goyal will reply to the debate on the interim budget in Parliament,"" he added.
It is also unclear who will address the board meeting of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) scheduled for 18 February in New Delhi. It is customary for the finance minister to address the boards of RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India after presentation of the budget wherein RBI members often place their queries on the budget before the finance minister and other ministry officials.
On Saturday, Jaitley tweeted: “Delighted to be back home"".
Soon after, Goyal tweeted: “Delighted to welcome back respected Shri @arunjaitley ji. Very grateful to him for his support, guidance and leadership.""
Railways and coal minister Goyal was assigned the additional charge of finance ministry on 23 January, while the budget preparation was in full swing, as Jaitley flew to the US for medical consultation. Last year too, Goyal was temporarily given charge of finance while Jaitley underwent kidney transplant at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi.
Jaitley was designated “as minister without portfolio during the period of his indisposition or till such time he is able to resume his work as minister of finance and minister of corporate affairs"", a statement from the President’s office had said.
However, Jaitley interacted with the media through video conferencing from the US after Goyal presented the budget. He also continued to share his thoughts from the US on a range of issues including the Rafale fighter jet deal, death of former defence minister George Fernandes, investigations by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the ICICI Bank case, selection process of the new CBI chief and coalition of opposition parties. On Sunday, Jaitley wrote a blog titled “Institutions Under Attack-The Latest Fabrication"", calling the allegation one of several “fake campaigns""."

Coal India Ltd, the world's biggest coal miner, reported a 50.1% jump in third-quarter profit on Tuesday as it benefited from higher coal production.
Its profit for the three months to December reached  ₹45.67 billion($646.5 million), compared with 30.43 billion a year earlier, the company said.
The figure beat analysts' average estimate of  ₹40.69 billion in profit, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.
Quarterly coal production rose 2.6% year-over-year to 155.97 million tonnes."
81,2019-02-14,Coal India,"At a quarterly net profit run rate of  ₹4,500 crore, Coal India could clock around  ₹17,000 crore in annual profit in FY19 At the current market price of  ₹220.25, this results in a forward price-earnings of a mere eight times on its earnings

Beset by production challenges and lower price realizations in recent times, Coal India Ltd’s share price fell to an all-time low of  ₹214 on 11 February on the National Stock Exchange.
For all the pessimism, though, Coal India surprised the Street with better-than-expected volume growth and higher realizations. This was topped off with good discipline in operating expenditure, resulting in better operating margin.
The company achieved a substantial 13% increase in FSA realizations to  ₹1,334 a tonne. (FSA is the fuel-supply agreement the company has inked with power producers.)
Further, in the e-auction segment, slightly better volumes have been a significant contributor to profits in the third quarter. The upshot: net profit increased 52% over last year to  ₹4,565.7 crore.
For some time, the Street has been apprehensive about whether Coal India would be able to ramp-up volumes. Till October, its volumes grew 7.5% year-on-year, but fell in the past few months.
A few concerns on coal production persist. Some of its mines such as Gevra, Dipka and Kusmunda in Chhattisgarh were hit by a delay in renewals with third-party contractors.
Nevertheless, concerns on production are now being addressed. Some of the contracts have been renewed. Besides, the company received approvals to expand production in its Kusmunda mines from 36 million tonnes to 40 million tonnes.
Still, given the past track record and continuing periodic strikes at some fields, analysts are expecting volume growth to continue at slightly lower levels. Brokerage firm Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd has trimmed its FY19 and FY20 volume growth estimates to 4.7% and 5.4%, respectively. This is lower than FY18 volume growth of 6.8%.
On the stock price front, Coal India’s management recently announced a buyback of 44.6 million shares at  ₹234 each. But that has done little to shore up the stock price. The share buyback comprises only 0.76% of its market capitalization of  ₹1.36 trillion. Analysts reckon that with  ₹31,475 crore on its books, a larger share buyback would not have been a constraint, and would have done well for the stock.
Still, at a quarterly net profit run rate of  ₹4,500 crore, Coal India could clock around  ₹17,000 crore in annual profit in FY19, according to analysts. At the current market price of  ₹220.25, this results in a forward price-earnings of a mere eight times on its earnings.
What’s more, Coal India has been paying a tidy dividend over the years resulting in a dividend yield of 7.5%. Nevertheless, for its share price to catch the fancy of investors, much depends on volume expansion. Analysts say that if volume growth exceeds expectations, the share price could swing up from current levels. If not, the stock could continue to meander. In fact, in the past three months, some analysts downgraded the stock to hold and underperform."
80,2019-02-17,Coal India,"Shrinking valuations are also prompting smaller companies to buy their own stock, said analystPSU firms, including Coal India Ltd., NHPC Ltd., are on a buying spree to help the govt to meet asset-sale target

 India Inc. is extending a banner year for share buybacks.
Seven weeks into 2019, two dozen companies led by technology major Infosys Ltd. have announced or completed plans to buy  ₹170.5 billion ($2.4 billion) of their own stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This compares with about  ₹545 billion for all of 2018, which was the highest in at least six years, the data show.
“Buybacks this year are likely to equal the year before, if not exceed, as improving liquidity boosts cash flows for companies,"" said Sameer Kalra, president of Target Investing, an investment advisory firm based in Mumbai.
While the rush to return excess cash to investors is driven by the tax efficiency of buybacks over dividends, declining share values and a slowing global economy has helped accelerate the trend. Software exporters, which get a bulk of their revenue from abroad, are leading the pack as shrinking client budgets leave them with fewer opportunities to use their cash.
Infosys, Asia’s second-largest software exporter, last month said it would buy  ₹82.6 billion of its own stock. The offer accounts for about half of this year’s total deal value. Larger peer Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. completed a  ₹160billion buyback in 2018. Both companies have made the offers for a second time in as many years.
Shrinking valuations are also prompting smaller companies to buy their own stock, according to Indianivesh Securities Ltd. A gauge of midcap shares is down about 10 percent since Jan. 1, extending last year’s drop that was the biggest since 2011, amid an aversion to risk assets.
“The last couple of years, especially 2018, have been a washout for small and medium-sized firms, and despite recent earnings showing signs of economic recovery, investor reaction hasn’t been favorable,"" said Dharmesh Kant, head of research at Indianivesh. “The buybacks show the founders are confident about their business models.""
Even state-run firms, including Coal India Ltd., hydro-power generator NHPC Ltd. and iron-ore miner NMDC Ltd. are on a buying spree to help the government — their biggest shareholder — meet its asset-sale target.
Buybacks allow cash-rich state firms to return excess funds to the government in a tax-efficient manner than paying out dividends, which attract a distribution tax, Target’s Kalra said.

79,2019-02-20,Coal India,"Coal India had filed an application on February 12 with Sebi seeking exemption from the strict enforcement of the buyback normsThe application has been necessitated on account of transfer of equity shares of Coal India which were held by the promoter 

NEW DELHI :
Markets regulator Sebi Wednesday exempted state-owned Coal India from complying with regulations with regard to its proposed buyback programme for 4.46 crore shares.
Coal India had filed an application on February 12 with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) seeking exemption from the strict enforcement of the buyback norms.
The application has been necessitated on account of transfer of 4,46,80,850 equity shares of Coal India which were held by the promoter (government), to the asset management company of the Bharat 22 ETF in the month of February, according to a Sebi order.
The promoter (Government of India) said additional offering period of Bharat 22 ETF was opened and closed on February 14, 2019.
It is noted that the proposed transfer equity shares by the promoters will occur during the period between the date of passing the resolution of the board of directors approving the offer of buyback of securities of the company (i.e. February 4, 2019) and the closure of such offer, Coal India said.
Under buyback regulations, it imposes an obligation on the company to ensure that its promoters do not deal in the shares of the company in the stock exchange or off-market including inter-transfer of shares among themselves during the period from the date of passing the resolution of the board of directors till closing of the buyback offer.
On February 4, Coal India's board had approved the buyback of 4.46 crore equity shares, representing about 9.86% (stand alone basis) of aggregate of fully paid–up equity capital at a price of  ₹235 per equity share for an aggregate consideration of  ₹1,050 crore.
The PSU in its application said that in the proposed buyback, 15% of the number of equities will be reserved for small shareholders which will benefit larger number of such small shareholders.

New Delhi: Essar Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Ltd (EOGEPL) has received environment clearance for exploring shale gas reserves in its Raniganj block in West Bengal, an official said.
This follows the government’s decision to allow operators freedom to explore both conventional oil and natural gas as well as non-conventional sources like coal-bed methane (CBM) and shale reserves within a exploration acreage.
Previously, companies could explore only oil and natural gas or CBM depending on their licence for the block.
The official said the expert appraisal committee (EAC) in 29 January meeting allowed Essar to drill 20 wells to explore shale gas in its Raniganj CBM block.
It has been awarded an exploration lease for shale gas, CBM and hydrocarbons in the Raniganj block.
EOGPL has got approval to drill 20 shale wells at a cost of  ₹10 crore. To start with, it will drill five wells in the block to test the shale potential.
“We will start off with collecting the data. For this, we will need to drill the coal, identify the sweet spot and then drill horizontally for almost a kilometre,"" said Vilas Tawde, managing director and chief executive officer (CEO) of EOGEPL.
“If this exploration is successful, we plan to drill around 220-250 wells that will require an investment of  ₹7,000 crore,"" he added.
The official said the company could spend up to $1 billion in development of shale reserves if the exploration programme was successful."

BENGALURU :
Bengaluru: With Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) banking on regional parties to stitch up their numbers beyond the Hindi heartland states, Elections 2019 is turning out to be the biggest platform for coalition politics.
The resurgence of regional parties and rising instances of identity politics is also heralding an era of pre-poll alliances, forcing the non-BJP and non-Congress outfits to pick a side ahead of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections, which is turning into one of the most divisive ones in recent memory.
Those that have resisted the temptation to form an alliance with either of the two power centres, such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) in Odisha, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in Uttar Pradesh and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in Telangana, seem to be keeping their options open for a post-poll alliance.
Given that the calls for a third front have been put to rest, at least for now, regional parties are trying to have a bigger say at the national level. “Regional parties have gained more significance as it has become almost certain that we are headed towards a hung Parliament,"" said Sumanth Raman, a Chennai-based political analyst.
Alliances with regional parties are most pronounced in the northeast and southern India, where both the BJP and the Congress have limited representations.
Karnataka is, however, an exception.
While the Congress is seeking to regain ground after ceding its dominant position in several states, the BJP is looking to enter new regions with the help of local partners. Insecurities of the local partner, including the fear of being wiped out, is also a factor facilitating alliances.
The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) is hoping that its alliance with the BJP would save it from a crushing defeat in Tamil Nadu. The Congress, on the other hand, with a vote share of just over 4.3% in Tamil Nadu, is hoping to regain some ground riding on the back of a resurgent Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).
The H.D. Deve Gowda-led Janata Dal (Secular), or JDS, in Karnataka hopes the alliance with the Congress will help increase its individual tally by entering new regions in the state. Of the 130 Lok Sabha seats across five states and one Union territory in South India—Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry—the Congress and BJP have only 20 seats each while regional parties account for more than 80 seats."

NEW DELHI :
The government is likely to launch an additional offering of CPSE-Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) on March 19 to raise at least  ₹3,500 crore, officials said Tuesday.
The ETF sale through follow-on fund offer (FFO) will come with the option of retaining up to  ₹5,000 crore through green shoe option, they said.
""The additional offering of ETF would be on March 19. The base issue size has been fixed at  ₹3,500 crore, with an option to retain additional subscription,"" the officials said.
During the last offering in November, the government mopped up  ₹17,000 crore, the biggest disinvestment transaction through ETF.
The proceeds from the ETF sale will help the government move towards meeting the  ₹80,000 crore disinvestment target set for the current fiscal.
As on February 28, the government has realised  ₹56,473.32 crore as disinvestment proceeds against the target of  ₹80,000 crore during the current financial year (2018-19).
The CPSE (central public sector enterprises) ETF comprises shares of the 11 state-owned companies, including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Coal India, Indian Oil Company, Oil India, Power Finance Corporation, Rural Electrification Corporation and Bharat Electronics. NTPC, SJVN, NLC and NBCC are the new entrants in the ETF basket.
CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in 10 companies in the basket in four tranches, raising  ₹28,500 crore.
NTPC carries the highest weight in the index at 19.59%, followed by Coal India at 19.17%, Indian Oil Corp at 18.98%, and ONGC at 18.92%."

Mumbai: The government will launch a further fund offer (FFO) in the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSE) ETF next week. The exchange traded fund is managed by Reliance Nippon AMC. Investors are being offered a 4% discount on the ""reference market price"" of the underlying ETF shares.
The reference market price is the average of the full day volume weighted average price of the constituents of the Nifty CPSE Index on the NSE over 20 and 22 March. The offer will open and close for anchor investors on 19 March 2019. It will open for non anchor investors (including retail investors) on 20 March 2019 and close on 22 March 2019.
The CPSE ETF was launched in 2014 and has seen three additional offerings (tranches) since then. The current offering is the fourth tranche.
Investors who bought the CPSE ETF at its initial launch were offered a 5% discount and bonus units if they held the ETF for more than one year. Investors in the subsequent three offers were also offered discounts of 5%, 3.5% and 4.5%, respectively.
The CPSE ETF has 11 public sector companies, but just 4 companies—Oil and Natural Gas Corp. of India Ltd (ONGC), NTPC Ltd, Coal India Ltd and India Oil Ltd—make up as much as 77% of the ETF. 
These are not the same PSUs as the original composition of the CPSE ETF in 2014. A few PSUs such as GAIL (India) India, NTPC, Container Corporation of India (Concor) and Engineers India Ltd have been dropped while others like Neyveli Lignite Corp. Ltd (NLC), SJVN and NBCC India have been added to the ETF.
""The CPSE ETF is trading at very attractive valuations. As of 28 February, the dividend yield of the index was as high as 5.52% compared to 1.25% for the Nifty 50. The PE ratio was 8.43 compared to 26.32 on the Nifty. In addition, the government is also giving a 4% discount to investors,"" said Vishal Jain, head (ETFs) and fund manager at Reliance Nippon AMC.
Should you invest?
Experts are divided on this question. Shyam Sekhar, founder and ideator at financial consultancy iThought, came out in support of ETF on valuation and macroeconomic grounds.
“PSUs are extremely under-owned and have a lot of short-term negatives priced in. Overall economic growth has been muted in the last five years because there was no investment cycle revival. This is likely to change in the next 5 years regardless of who wins the election. CPSEs in the energy sector will benefit from this revival and an ETF is a good way to access them,"" said Sekhar.
Mumbai-based wealth manager Deepak Khemani recommended the CPSE ETF only as a short-term play due to the discount. “Ideally people should invest in ETFs for the long term. However in PSU-dominated ETFs like CPSE, investors usually enter only for the discount and exit soon after listing. I would not recommend this ETF as a long term investment. However someone who wants to capture the discount can do so,"" he said.
Mint take
The CPSE ETF consists wholly of government-owned companies and this comes with certain risks. Government companies are often managed from a welfare or political point of view rather than the profit motive and this can eat into investor returns.
For example, in January 2018, ONGC, a relatively profitable PSU oil company was forced to buy Hindsutan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL) from the central government to help meet the government’s disinvestment target.
The CPSE ETF has also delivered poor returns in the past.
Its five-year returns stand at just 5.88% (as on 12 March 2019). Valuations of the ETF are indeed attractive compared to the broader market but this may just be a reflection of the poor performance of the ETF constituents and the lack of market confidence in them. The discount can offer short-term gains to investors who exit immediately after listing. However, short term market plays are not a tactic recommended by this pubication."
73,2019-03-19,Coal India,"Govt subsidy will aid deleveraging, making Star Cement debt-free eventually, but further upside largely depends on operatiing performanceSupreme Court’s recent ban on coal mining in Meghalaya is likely to remain an overhang on Star Cement, whose operations are based in North-East India

With the government clearing freight subsidy claims of around  ₹50 crore, the Star Cement Ltd stock is in the spotlight. Shares of the North-East-based cement producer jumped nearly 10% intraday on NSE on Thursday. However, it has given up most of those gains and is up only about 2% since the development.
The government incentivizes, in the form of subsidies, cement producers operating in hilly and backward states. Other companies are also entitled to it. No wonder then that the euphoria didn’t last and the stock gave up the gains.
This , say analysts.
The company’s December quarter results were a mixed bag. Margins took a hit after it stopped receiving a transport subsidy.
“In Q3FY19, the company witnessed a dip in margins from 37.8% to 29.5%, mainly led by end of transport subsidy from January 2018. We believe margins of 25-26% will be the new normal for the company in the coming years,"" ICICI Direct Research said in a report on 6 February.
The Supreme Court’s recent ban on coal mining in Meghalaya is also likely to remain an overhang on the stock.
Star Cement is procuring coal for fuel from the local market at  ₹6,000 per tonne and has an inventory of two months, say analysts. However, an extended ban by the apex court could force it to procure imported or spot coal from Coal India Ltd at  ₹8,000 per tonne, they add.
The company, like its regional counterparts, can use price hikes to offset this impact. However, in the current scenario, the sustainability of price hikes is questionable. This means margins could remain under pressure.
Meanwhile, the outlook on volume growth is improving because of government spending on infrastructure projects in the North-East.
The Siliguri grinding project is on track for commissioning by December this year, the management said in a post-earning conference call with analysts. The company also proposes to set up a clinker unit in Meghalaya.
Investors seem to have concluded that the concerns outweigh the promises. At a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 8.52 times, Star Cement trades at a discount to other mid-cap peers. EV is short for enterprise value and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
For valuations to improve, margins need to grow as well."
74,2019-03-19,Coal India,"Coal India dividend payout so far in FY19 stands at  ₹13.1/share, as compared to  ₹16.50/share in FY18 and  ₹19.9/share in FY17 Interestingly, Coal India's dividend payouts are lower in a year when profits, estimated at  ₹16,416 crore, are relatively higher

Dividends have always been Coal India Ltd’s strong suit. This year, however, isn’t looking bright for investors on this count. The company’s interim dividend of  ₹5.85 per share, announced last week, is lower than the Street’s expectations. With this, the coal producer’s cumulative dividend so far for this fiscal year stands at  ₹13.1 per share. For FY18 and FY17, Coal India's dividend stood at  ₹16.5 and  ₹19.9 per share, respectively.
Interestingly, payouts are lower in a year when profits are relatively higher.
“Year to fiscal year 2019 payout of 54% (of net profits) is far lower than that for the past three years when the payout exceeded 125% on every instance,"" said analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a report on 15 March.
According to Edelweiss, the company’s annual capital expenditure (capex) requirement of  ₹12,000–15,000 crore to maintain volume growth of 5% is likely to keep dividend yield muted hereon. Analysts are not excited about the growth prospects either.
“The benefits due to capex are not obvious as the incremental profit due to increased production is at best enough to cover cost inflation,"" wrote analysts from HDFC Securities Institutional Research in a report on Coal India in December.
So, unless the company makes up by paying a final dividend later, investors will feel let down.
Since FY14, which is when Coal India started making large payouts, dividends have always been announced before the end of the fiscal year. As such, chances of a final dividend being announced later are low.
This also affects the dividend yield expectations on the stock, which was one of the reasons some investors stayed put. Despite the recent recovery in the company’s shares, the Coal India stock has underperformed the Nifty 100 index so far this year.
Note that this is also a year when profitability has been strong. According to Bloomberg, Coal India is estimated to post a consolidated net profit of  ₹16,416 crore. This is more than double the FY18 profit. “If such a turnaround was witnessed in profits of a private sector company, you would have seen the stock fly high,"" said an analyst, requesting anonymity.
One of the reasons for the lack of excitement is the increase in the stock’s free float. The government’s offer to sell a 3% stake in the company, leading to an increase in free float, has weighed on investor sentiment. Further, Coal India is included in both the Bharat 22 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) and CPSE ETF, and there have been frequent sales of these funds.
As a result of all this, Coal India shares trade at an undemanding enterprise value to Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of 4.7 times for FY20, based on Bloomberg data.
Nonetheless, given the circumstances, merely being available at lower valuations isn’t enough to ignite a fire in Coal India shares."

71,2019-03-20,Coal India,"Coal stocks at 126 thermal power plants rose for a fourth successive month in February to 26 million tonnes, says Elara CapitalRise in coal inventory, however, coincides with a slump in power demand—electricity generation in Jan-Feb declined 0.9%

Coal inventory has been on the rise at thermal power plants. This improved from six days of consumption equivalent in October 2018 to 16 days in February 2019. As on 18 March 2019, it had inched up to 17 days, shows data from the Central Electricity Authority (CEA).
The recovery is notable, despite the inventory being lower than the normal requirement of 22 days. At present, no thermal power plant faces critically low coal stock levels of less than seven days. This compares well with nine plants facing low coal stocks as on end-December 2018.
Coal stocks at 126 thermal power plants rose for a fourth successive month in February to 26 million tonnes, says Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd.
However, the rise in coal inventories coincides with a demand slowdown. Electricity generation in the first two months of this calendar year declined 0.9%, reflecting prolonged winters and subdued demand.
Volumes on the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX), which primarily deals in short-term power contracts, dropped 15% in February. Shrinking demand from northern and western states weighed on volumes, according to IEX.
Also, the last two months have seen a reduction in conventional capacities. In February 2019, a 100 megawatt (MW) sequential dip in coal- and lignite-based power capacities has been seen.
These factors reduced fuel consumption, raising coal inventories. Besides, a rise in coal imports and better fuel quality supplied to the power sector has led to greater efficiencies. This may also have contributed to the improved inventory situation, says an analyst.
Nevertheless, unless Coal India Ltd keeps up the supply momentum, the current inventory could soon disappear. Further, as governments at both the state level and at the centre try to reduce load-shedding during the general election, demand could rise substantially in the coming months. There are indications that demand would continue to grow steadily, helped by more supplies and greater connectivity.
The demand for long-term power contracts are emerging after a four- to five-year hiatus, says Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd. A Gujarat power distribution firm has invited bids for procurement of 3,000MW on a long-term basis. As states continue to clinch ongoing short-term power contracts, coal requirements will increase, testing the present inventory levels."

Bhubaneswar: Facing certain amount of anti-incumbency after 19 years of power, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik is adopting innovative campaigns this election season to reach out to youth and build a conscious narrative that he is still the credible face for 4.5 crore Odias.
After a fitness video to quell the doubt over his ill-health, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has now come out with micro videos where he is interacting with youth of the state and discussing how the central government is not giving the state its due on coal royalty and neglecting it on railway connection.
He is heard telling that seven of the 30 districts of Odisha still do not have rail connection despite Railway earning nearly  ₹20,000 crore revenue from the state and the centre has been neglecting the coastal state. “Guess how much of that (Rs. 20,000 crore) is invested in Odisha…they spend Rs.1000 crore. After BJP came to power, they have increased it to just 1100 crore. Odisha is the most neglected state. Even after 72 years of independence, still seven of our districts are not connected by the railways. Injustice to Odisha is injustice to our youth and their future,"" he says.
Wearing a black trouser and white T-Shirt, Naveen is also seen talking about how the state is not getting its due in coal royalty and accuses the central government that while Odisha gets pollution from coal mines, centre enjoys the revenue.
A Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader in the state said the video and interaction with the youth is a conscious narrative that Naveen babu is building to ward-off aggressive campaigns by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) where the national party is trying to project the chief minister a spent force and losing grip over the state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his recent rallies in Odisha has said that the state government is being run by a coterie and the people demand a change of BJD run state government this time.
“The third phase election in Odisha is covering the urban votes. Hence the social media is a potent medium to reach out to the masses and especially the youth. These videos are projecting Naveen babu as someone who is still active, engaging, and enjoys the mass support,"" said a senior officer in state secretariat requesting anonymity. In the third phase of elections on on 23 April, urban areas of Odisha like Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Puri, Sambalpur etc will vote.
While Naveen Patnaik is busy doing roadshows and rallies, why has he chosen the social media to spread his youth outreach? “Social media gives a politician an advantage of one-to- many conversations. Earlier people used to consume political campaigns based on personal desire but in this election political parties are serving their agenda and messages right in the hands of people via social media like twitter, Facebook and Whatsapp. It’s a push method of making people believe what they want to say,"" said Nirali Bhatia, a cyber-psychologist.

New Delhi: State-owned Coal India Limited's coal allocation under spot e-auction scheme declined by 37.7% to 34.34 million tonnes in the last fiscal (2018-19).
The country's top dry-fuel miner had allocated 55.17 million tonnes (MT) of coal in FY 2018, according to government data.
However, the coal allocated by the PSU under the scheme in March increased by 10.2% to 4.18 MT, compared to 3.79 MT in the corresponding month of FY 2018, it said.
Coal distribution through e-auction was introduced with a view to provide access to coal for such buyers who are not able to source the dry fuel through the available institutional mechanism, as per the information available on CIL website.

Coal India accounts for over 80% of domestic coal output.
The company reported a growth of 7% in coal production to 606.9 million tonnes in 2018-19, a shade below the MoU target of 610 million tonnes with the coal ministry.

New Delhi: India’s thermal coal purchases are expected to surge to a record this year and remain robust through the next decade as domestic supply lags demand, according to the country’s largest importer.
Overseas shipments will climb almost 11% to 184 million metric tons during the financial year started April 1, and rise further to average about 200 million annually through the following decade, according to Vinay Prakash, chief executive officer for coal and mining at Adani Enterprises Ltd. Generators designed to run on imported coal will keep fueling demand, while consumers close to the coast are also likely to favor imports due to the higher cost of railing domestic supply to their operations, he said in an interview.
India is seen maintaining its reliance on coal-fired power, which accounts for 70% of its electricity generation, even as the fuel emerges as a leading cause for the country’s toxic air. The nation’s continuing demand provides a lifeline for global exporters as other markets gradually shift toward renewable energy, including China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer.
“Demand for imported coal will always be there, regardless of our domestic production,"" said Prakash. “Customers located near the coast may always find it cheaper to import because ocean freight is much cheaper than the railway freight they would need to pay if they get coal from Indian mines.""
India will be a key destination for coal from Adani’s Carmichael mine in Australia’s Galilee basin, Prakash said. The group’s planned 1,600 megawatt power plant in the eastern state of Jharkhand, may be supplied by the mine, along with customers in China, South Korea and Taiwan, he said.
Adani Enterprises rose 0.6% on the BSE on Friday. Shares have declined 25% this year, compared with a 4.1% gain in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.
Import recovery
India’s imports declined temporarily for two years during the early part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s five-year tenure after the government pushed state miner Coal India Ltd. to boost production. Slowing industrial demand also helped, creating hordes of coal inventories near mines and power stations.
Recently, the country’s commitment to reduce imports has been put to the test as demand rebounded. Consumers, many located close to mines, have been forced to revert to overseas purchases as domestic output and railway infrastructure failed to keep pace. India imported 166 million tons last year, Prakash estimated, the second consecutive gain after two years of declines.

Rothschild & Co has decided not to advise Adani in the financing or development of the $4 billion Carmichael coal mine in Queensland, Australia, a letter from the bank to an environmental group said.
The bank is also not advising the firm on the planned sale of stake in the Abbot Point Coal export terminal, said the May 12 confidential letter to Friends of the Earth, France.
A spokeswoman for the bank confirmed the authenticity of the letter but provided no further comment.
The decision comes as banks and other financial institutions are facing increasing pressure to cut investments in coal, blamed for adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than any other fuel, as the world moves to curb greenhouse gas emissions.
The Carmichael coal mine, which has been in planning since 2010, has become a lightning rod for debate on climate change ahead of Australia's May 18 election.
Friends of the Earth said in a statement on Tuesday that the decision by Rothschild came after several requests from Friends of the Earth and partner organisations.
It added that the announcement come two days before the release of a report that would reveal the bank's significant activities in the coal sector.
""While other French banks have restricted their coal advisory services, Rothschild & Co sees a financial windfall and is currently advising Uniper on the sale of its French coal plants to EPH,"" the NGO said in the statement.
It said the organisation will be present at Rothschild's general assembly meeting in Paris on May 16, and would ask management to put an end to all financial services related to the coal sector.

63,2019-05-16,Coal India,"Whether multi-party rule is good or bad for India depends on the prevalent political circumstances

The 2019 general elections seem to be headed for a fractured mandate which would renew the coalition era that began in the late 1980s, but was interrupted in 2014 by a Narendra Modi wave and the majority secured in parliament by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader M. K. Stalin’s statement not long ago that his party won’t abandon its Congress partnership in a coalition arrangement appears to have ended all prospects of a non-Congress, non-BJP coalition at the centre, for which Telangana chief minister K. Chandrashekar Rao has been on a mobilizing mission in recent days. But is a coalition government inherently bad for Indian democracy?
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has campaigned on security issues triggered by the Pulwama attack, perhaps to hide his regime’s performance on his 2014 vikas agenda. In contrast, Dr. Manmohan Singh, who led a coalition government of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) from 2004 to 2009, returned to power in 2009 on the back of its achievements. Many would argue that Dr. Singh’s record in his first term was way better than that of the Modi regime, despite the latter’s one-party majority government. In short, India’s experience does not support the thesis that coalition governments are innately bad. Critics of one-party majority governments often cite the excessive abuse of President’s Rule during Indira Gandhi’s time as one of its shortcomings, a practice that the coalition era has effectively ended.
At present, two possible scenarios exist for India after 23 May. The first is the return of Modi as the Prime Minister of a National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition. Given the firm grip that Modi and Amit Shah have over their party, a BJP-led NDA cannot have anyone other than Modi as Prime Minister. Alternatively, there is a possibility of a UPA coalition led by a leader of the Congress or some other party.
Modi and Shah have repeatedly appealed to voters not to vote for a UPA option, mocking it as a maha milawati (highly mixed up) alliance. Cited in support are the bickering and instability of past coalition governments that took office in 1977, 1989 and 1996. What, however, is never mentioned is that the BJP was part of two such unstable governments: the V. P. Singh-led National Front in 1989 and the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government in 1977. In 1975-77, the BJP, in its earlier Bharatiya Jana Sangh (BJS) avatar, had merged with a broad Janata coalition and was part of the Desai regime. Thus, the BJP has been part of a khichdi in the past and cannot brush aside its own contribution to instability.
Observers recognize Modi’s adamance as a vital attribute of his personality. Also, he is seen as decisive by some and vindictive by others. But the management of a coalition government calls for an accommodative spirit. This comes in handy in dealing with what Dr. Singh described as the compulsions of a coalition. Modi’s ability to cope with these remains untested. A similar possibility could arise in the case of a UPA government, though for reasons of the varying ambitions of regional leaders, as witnessed in 1977 or 1996. In both scenarios of either an NDA or UPA coalition, there is a fair chance of a mid-term election. If it happens on account of UPA instability, it would present Modi with the opportunity of claiming an Indira moment: recall the way she returned triumphant in 1980 after the Janata coalition collapsed. If it forms a government, the UPA would have to be careful not to allow such an outcome, for a mid-term poll under those circumstances could mean an ever-larger majority for the Modi-led BJP, because it would provide credibility to his mahamilawati accusation. At this point, however, Modi and Shah’s recent spat with Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati has created a favourable climate for the UPA as it has deepened anti-Modi and anti-BJP sentiments in their parties.
Regardless of the results on 23 May, the BJP will remain India’s most dominant party in the coming years. For the Congress, it is crucial to increase its tally to, say, 140 or 150 seats, if it is to sustain itself as the leader of the UPA. Only such a number would let it outweigh the claims of key anti-BJP regional players, such as the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Trinamool Congess (TMC), and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP). The Congress’s failure to stitch up a coalition in West Bengal, Delhi, and even Uttar Pradesh would have a direct bearing on its final tally this time. Comparatively speaking, the BJP can bounce back from setbacks far more easily than the Congress. Whatever electoral success the Congress has achieved lately in states such as Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan was driven more by anti-incumbency factors than the grand old party’s historical dominance. Yet, most regional parties are single-state based, with little prospects of further expansion, which works as a boon for the Congress in retaining its place as the UPA’s leader.
A stable government might have its own benefits, but less stable governments are not threats to democracy. The Desai government (1977-1979), for example, undid regressive laws enacted by the Indira Gandhi government during the Emergency. By the same logic, if a future UPA government were to address issues such as lynching or sedition laws, these would be crucial interventions in India’s governance, especially consequential for citizens ranged against the perpetuation of majoritarianism.

62,2019-05-18,Coal India,"Markets love continuity and that is the reason they are rooting for a return of the current ruling party'If it’s BJP, then we know obviously what the policies and how the budget will be like,' says a market strategist

Shimon Peres, the charismatic former foreign affairs minister of Israel had once said, “We should use our imagination more than our memory."" As India’s gargantuan national elections come to a conclusion, its financial markets are jittery, being held back by memories of surprises and shocks in the previous three general elections.
NSE’s volatility index (India Vix) has risen from around 17 in end-March to 28 currently. In the process, Indian markets have decoupled from other emerging markets in terms of volatility, analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofA-ML) point out in a note to clients. The Nifty 500 index has corrected by about 5% from its peak in mid-April, around the time nation began voting, and the rupee-dollar rate has breached the 70 mark. Foreign institutional investors, who were strong buyers earlier in the year, have turned net sellers in recent trading sessions, and some domestic mutual funds are sitting with higher than usual cash levels.
But most of this is normal ahead of elections. “Federal elections have historically resulted in short term volatility. MSCI India has moved 11-38% (trough to peak) in the 40 days around election results,"" analysts at BofA-ML wrote in a note to clients earlier this month.
If anything, there is a sense of cautious optimism on the Street about a return of the Bharatiya Janata Party led NDA government, albeit with a seat share that is slightly short of a clear majority. “Valuations (absolute and relative to emerging markets), flows (net $9.8 billion FII inflows in 2019 YTD) and our investor discussions suggest markets are factoring in a BJP-led NDA win,"" analysts at UBS Securities India Pvt. Ltd said in a note to clients on 16 May. “The markets are expecting a return of the NDA government, with a lower seat tally, but sufficient to cobble together a coalition,"" says the head of research at an institutional brokerage. Note also that the MSCI India index has risen about 3.5% since the air strikes against Pakistan on 26 February, while the MSCI Emerging Markets index has fallen 6.7% in the same period.
In this backdrop, if the NDA coalition falls well short of a majority, the markets can be expected to correct sharply, despite the caution among traders in recent weeks.
It is easy to see why markets are rooting for a return of the current ruling party. Markets love continuity and the NDA losing elections would mean growing uncertainty over policies. “If it’s BJP, then we know obviously what the policies and how the budget will be like. So, it’s not so difficult. The policies of the Congress may not be so different, but we don’t know what the budget will look like,"" said Andrew Holland, CEO, Avendus Capital Public Markets Alternate Strategies, LLP.
Fiscal policy is a key variable for the Indian markets, especially in the backdrop of a slowdown in consumption in recent months. Investors are hoping for a fiscal stimulus to get things going on the consumption side.
In fact, whatever the outcome of the elections, markets would move on to the more pressing macroeconomic issues.
As UBS’s analysts noted, “Nifty is trading at 20 times one year forward PE (on our top- down earnings forecast) and we think the risk-reward is unfavourable, looking beyond the immediate market moves next week. The reality check of fiscal slippage and/or a negative growth surprise, awaits markets post this binary event."""
61,2019-05-21,Coal India,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi has urged party members not to make statements against the coalitionThe BJP, according to an India Today-Axis My India exit poll, is set to grab 25 out of 28 seats in Karnataka

BENGALURU :
Sunday’s exit polls, projecting a surge of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka, has sparked off a blame game with the Congress as senior leaders of the party blame the top brass for the anticipated poor outing.
The BJP, according to an India Today-Axis My India exit poll, is set to grab 25 out of 28 seats in Karnataka.
Roshan Baig, a senior state Congress leader and former minister, lashed out at the state leadership for the ""flop show"" of the party in the Lok Sabha elections that concluded on 19 May.
""Congress has had a flop show in Karnataka and it is because of the flop show president. Dinesh Gundu Rao is a flop show president and the CLP (Congress legislature party) leader (Siddaramaiah) those who were flying should come back to earth,"" Baig told a local Urdu channel on Monday evening.
Baig also said Muslims should join hands with BJP if required as there was a good chance that the saffron outfit would remain in power for a long time. Baig said that it was likely that BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) will be in power for the next five years and possibly after that also. ""I don't want Muslims to be untouchables.""
He added that if the Congress wants, it should retain Muslims with respect and not like ""bonded labour"".
Baig's statements come at a time when several leaders within the Congress party have publicly expressed their displeasure over the functioning of the Karnataka party unit under Rao and Siddaramaiah.
The discord within the Congress ranks also threatens the year old H. D. Kumaraswamy-led coalition government that has battled more challenges within its ranks than external factors.
The BJP is pinning its hopes on this kind of dissent to destabilise the coalition government that was built on a shaky foundation ever since the two rivals came together in May last year.
Meanwhile, Congress president Rahul Gandhi has urged party members not to make statements against the coalition.
Though Baig was noncommittal about his future plans, the legislator from Shivajinagar said he would decide according to circumstances. ""I am firm on my decision that I will part ways with the party if required,"" he said."

""In absolute volume terms, China and India will have the largest impact on the global coal market balance,"" Fitch Solutions Macro Research said in a report.
It further said the surge in Chinese imports that occurred over 2015-2017 as a result of dramatic domestic production curbs was a temporary phenomenon.
""We forecast thermal coal production in China to stagnate at 0.5% growth per annum from 2019 onwards, but not decline, as new coal mines in Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces offset mine closures in the rest of the country,"" it said.
It further estimates that production by state-owned Coal India (CIL) -- which accounts for around 90% of domestic output -- will underwhelm the government expectations.
""We forecast India's thermal coal output to grow by an average annual rate of 4.3% over 2019-2028,"" it said.
Along with weaker Chinese and Indian demand, South Korea and Japan will also see coal consumption slowing down in 2019 due to heightening environmental concerns, it added.

59,2019-05-24,Coal India,"Gowda is among old-school politicians, well known for their coalition building skillsHe won seven terms as a legislator since 1962, and six terms as Member of Parliament since 1991 including one stint as Karnataka CM and another as Prime Minister of India

Bengaluru: Often referred to as ‘mannina maga’ or son of soil, former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda has always been grounded despite his steady rise in politics and admirers galore across party lines in his five-decade old career.
From being the glue that held coalitions together to help stitch alliances, Gowda is among the old school politicians, well known for their coalition building skills that has kept them in power and relevant despite the passage of time and numerous elections.
Few in the country can boast of his political acumen, that has seen the 87-year old win seven terms as a legislator since 1962, and six terms as Member of Parliament since 1991 including one stint as chief minister of Karnataka and another as the prime minister of India.
“From Haradanahalli to New Delhi"" was the caption given by many in the media when he became the prime minister, capturing his journey from a small village in Hassan in Karnataka to the political hotbed of the national capital.
But the political maestro hit a hurdle on Thursday, losing the third election of his career as he fell to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) wave in Karnataka and the rest of the country.
Deve Gowda, who gave up his bastion Hassan for his grandson, Prajwal Revanna, contested from neighbouring Tumkur. He lost to little known G. S. Basavaraju of BJP by a slender margin of 13,339 votes on Thursday.
“I thank the voters, leaders, party workers of both @JanataDal_S & @INCIndia and everyone who supported me. Our work towards betterment of the society will never stop. Congratulations to all the elected MPs. Congratulations to @narendramodi on the big victory,"" a gracious Deve Gowda wrote on Twitter.
Deve Gowda had stopped the Modi’s juggernaut from rolling into Karnataka in 2018 by stitching up an alliance with Congress and getting the better-half of the deal despite being the smaller partner.
But the Modi wave was stronger and bigger this time. Modi on Thursday created history by becoming the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru to come back to power for a second time with full majority, having served a full five-year term. The BJP won 303 of the 542 Lok Sabha constituencies, when most thought its 2014 tally of 282 was insurmountable
So it was not surprising that many veterans, including those of Congress, tasted defeats this general election. Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge was defeated for the first time in his entire political career since 1972 at the hands of his former aide, Umesh Jadhav of the BJP. K.H.Muniyappa, seven-time Member of Parliament lost by a margin of over two lakh votes against S.Muniswamy, a little known corporator from Bengaluru. Former Karnataka chief minister Veerappa Moily lost to B.N.Bache Gowda of BJP.
Former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said people of Tumakuru and Kalaburagi (Gulbarga) meted out justice by defeating Deve Gowda and Kharge.
Many in the Congress also believe that Deve Gowda should have contested from Mandya or Bengaluru North as the decision to field his grandsons might have gone against him. People of Tumakuru also alleged that the veteran had denied the district water for all these years only to divert it to his home district of Hassan.
Going back on his own decision, Deve Gowda contested the 2019 Lok Sabha elections because of the demand of leaders from other political parties.
“On 13 January, I said that this was my last speech in parliament where I had declared that it would be my last election,"" Deve Gowda had told Mint in an earlier interview. He said that leaders from other parties had insisted that he contest as his experience would be required to defeat the BJP.
But some believe that Deve Gowda may still have something up his sleeve.
“I can never write him off. He has come back so many times in the past,"" said Narendra Pani, political analyst and faculty at the National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS). Those half his age or younger depend on his wisdom to make it in politics even today.
But age may not be on Gowda’s side.
“I will be 91 by the time of the next elections, age may not permit me at all,"" he said in an interview to Mint in April."

PARIS :
India has firmly rejected attempts by the United States and several other industrialized countries for introducing “differentiation"" to deny policy space through special and differential flexibilities for India and other developing countries in the multilateral trade agreements, say trade ministers.
At a closed-door informal meeting of select-trade ministers in Paris on 23 May, India reiterated that it “cannot agree to any approach which undermines the centrality of the development dimension in the WTO"". South Africa, and the representative of the biggest coalition of developing and poorest countries called the ACP (Africa, Caribbean, and Pacific) group supported India's position to ensure the ""development dimension"" in global trade.
The US and other industrialized countries seem determined to bring about “graduation and differentiation"" among developing countries for availing of special and differential flexibilities in the current and future trade negotiations at the World Trade Organization.
The US deputy trade representative Ambassador Dennis Shea told his counterparts at the Paris meeting that Washington will pursue its proposal for differentiating developing countries to ensure that leading developing countries such as India from availing special and differential treatment flexibilities in the current and future trade negotiations, said a participant, who asked not to be quoted.
India, which is facing a barrage of trade disputes because of subsidies provided to its farmers and increasing import duties on information and technology products, is being told by the US and its partners that New Delhi cannot avail policy space that is made possible through special and differential treatment (S&DT) flexibilities for developing countries.
The Modi government which will retain reigns for the second time in New Delhi faces a grim battle on the trade front as the big boys in the global trading system led by the US are saying that New Delhi cannot avail policy space for industrialization in several sectors.
In response to the stand taken by the US and other industrialized countries at the meeting, India maintained “the reality remains that developing countries continue to face formidable challenges in integrating with global trade and in addressing their development goals"".
India urged the US “to refrain from this divisive debate now and instead focus on strengthening the WTO and reviving the negotiating agenda"". The reform proposals by US and its partners lack balance while pushing “for one-sided narrative with disregard for issues of importance and concern to developing countries"", Wadhawan maintained.
“WTO reform initiatives must keep development at the centre, promote inclusiveness and non-discrimination, build trust and address the inequalities and glaring asymmetries in existing agreements, which are against the interest of developing countries,"" India argued at the Paris meeting.
Moreover, the Indian official maintained, “the first priority for us should be to address the ongoing impasse in the Appellate Body with a sense of urgency to launch the process of filling up the vacancies before December 2019.""
According to the Indian official, “any new disciplines (for fisheries subsidies) must also consider the capacity constraints of developing countries in conducting regular stock assessment based on the best scientific evidence available to them.""
He warned against the recent US-Australia proposal for capping fisheries subsidies at the current level, saying “the proposed new approach of capping of subsidies will unfairly impact developing countries and it will reward the big subsidizers by giving them higher caps, and thus create a permanent asymmetry.""
“Further, the capping proposals do not have an S&DT component, thereby denying much needed policy space to developing countries to develop their livelihood oriented fisheries sector,"" the Indian official maintained.
According to the Indian official, “subsidies, both specific or non-specific, have the same adverse effect on sustainability of fish stock."" “The attempt by some members to discipline only specific fuel subsidies will result in a large proportion of operating cost subsidies being left out of the disciplines,"" he argued."

New Delhi: India's coal import increased by 13.4% to 20.72 million tonnes in April compared to 18.27 million tonnes (MT) in the same last year, according to a report.
Of the total imports during April 2019, non-coking coal or thermal coal shipments were at 15.08 MT, according to provisional data by mjunction services.
Imports of coking coal, used in iron and steel making, were 3.52 MT in April while metallurgical coke imports during the month were at 0.22 MT.
Mjunction, a joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL, is a B2B e-commerce company that also publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.
Coal and coke imports during 2018-19 increased by 9.66% to 235.35 MT as compared to 214.61 MT imported in FY2017-18, latest mjunction data showed.

56,2019-05-28,Coal India,"The company is sourcing more coal from imports, Coal India Ltd and from its own minesNTPC’s earnings can see significant expansion in FY20 due to new capacity additions

NTPC Ltd made good on its promise of reducing revenue loss due to fuel constraints. In the fourth quarter, revenue loss was reduced to  ₹800 crore from  ₹1,100 crore in the December quarter, implying a notable improvement. “Management delivered on its lower under-recovery target for FY19 of  ₹800 crore. We had expected this to remain high, at  ₹1,300 crore, with improvement built in only from FY20E,"" Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd said in a note.
The improvement triggered gains in the stock, which rose 3.14% on Monday. Expansion in its base capacity notwithstanding, the stock trailed the broader markets in the past year. Reported profit in the first nine months of FY19 largely remained flat, even as the stand-alone capacity base increased by 323 megawatts (MW). As cost recovery improved in the March quarter, profit jumped 48.7%.
Importantly, improving fuel supply trends means cost under-recovery can reduce further in FY20. The company is sourcing more coal from imports, Coal India Ltd and from its own mines. Incrementally higher coal supply is expected to improve NTPC’s plant availability, further reducing cost under-recoveries.
NTPC’s earnings can see significant expansion in FY20 due to new capacity additions. According to analysts, the company expects to commercialize 5,000MW at the group level in FY20. As commercialization of projects gathers pace, adding to NTPC’s regulated equity base, analysts expect the stock to further gain momentum. “Capitalization will outpace capital expenditure, boosting return on equity and driving re-rating of the stock,"" Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd said in a note.
While improving coal supplies and project addition trajectory should provide good support to the stock, much also depends on the demand and earnings quality. Slow progress on distribution reforms is exerting renewed pressure on state power distribution companies (discoms). They are large buyers of electricity from NTPC. This is reflected in rising dues from discoms.
Though NTPC is better placed to manage receivables through securitization and other methods, mounting dues can impact electricity offtake unless discoms streamline distribution reforms.
Power plant utilization trends are unexciting, though. The plant load factor of thermal units stood at 77.6% in the March quarter, down from 79% a year earlier. For the full year, it fell from 77.9% in FY18 to 76.7%. If financial troubles at discoms were to curtail electricity offtake, then utilization can see further softening. This can reduce the earnings gains of new capacity additions to some extent. While the new government at the centre is expected to step up distribution reforms, this is one key risk NTPC investors need to keep an eye on."

The risk aversion propped up global safe-haven assets such as government bonds, with yields on German benchmark debt approaching record lows.
The dispute between the world’s two largest economies showed few signs of abating, with Chinese newspapers reporting that Beijing could use rare earths to strike back at Washington after US President Donald Trump remarked he was “not yet ready"" to make a deal with China over trade.
Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.5% and Australian stocks shed 0.66%. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan stood little changed after slipping to a four-month low the previous day.
Back home, all eyes are on swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Investors will be keenly watching out key ministries like finance, corporate affairs, road, oil, home and defence among others. As many as 8,000 guests, including VVIPs, will attend the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Modi and his council of ministers. The ceremony will be about 90 minutes.
Key companies that will release their March quarter earnings on Thursday are Apollo Hospital, Coal India, HDIL, IDBI Bank, NALCO, PC Jewelller, Reliance Infrastructure, Sadbhav Engineering, SAIL, and Suzlon Energy.
Meanwhile, amid the flight-to-safety Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell to a three-year trough of minus 0.179% overnight. A drop below minus 0.200% set in 2016 would take the yield to a record low. Spanish and Portuguese 10-year yields fell to record lows as deeply negative German Bund yields have encouraged investors to look elsewhere for returns.
Elsewhere, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 2.267% after falling to a 20-month low of 2.210% on Wednesday. Lower Treasury yields not withstanding, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was steady at 98.139 following two straight days of gains, with the greenback serving as a safe haven.
The euro was a shade higher at $1.1141, pulling back slightly following three successive days of losses. The dollar was little changed at 109.615 yen after bouncing back from a two-week low of 109.150 brushed on Wednesday.

Asian shares extended a month-long slide and sovereign bonds surged on Friday after US President Donald Trump ramped up trade tensions globally by suddenly slapping tariffs on all goods from Mexico, sending the peso tumbling.
The US will impose a 5% tariff from June 10, which would then rise steadily to 25% until illegal immigration across the southern border was stopped.
Trump announced the decision on Twitter late Thursday, catching markets completely by surprise and sparking a rush to safe harbours as investors worried the escalation would upend an already fragile world economy.
Japan's Nikkei fell 1.2% in early trade, down 7% for the month so far. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.1% and was likewise off a hefty 7.7% for the month. Investors clearly feared that opening a new front in the trade wars would threaten global and US growth and pressure central banks everywhere to consider new stimulus.

Investors will be keenly watching out gross domestic product (GDP) data due on Friday. According to economic outlook survey of industry chamber Ficci, India's GDP likely grew 6.5% in the fourth quarter ended March 2019. Ficci said the survey has put forth an annual median GDP growth forecast for 2019-20 at 7.1% and the projection for fiscal 2020-21 has been put at 7.2%.
Meanwhile, yields on the 10-year treasury note quickly fell to a fresh 20-month low of 2.18%, while the dollar jumped 2.1% on the Mexican peso. Bonds extended their bull run with 10-year Treasury yields, now down a steep 31 basis points for the month and decisively below the overnight funds rate.
Such an inversion of the yield curve has presaged enough recessions in the past that investors are wagering the Fed will be forced to ease policy just as ""insurance"". Yet Treasuries are hardly alone in rallying, with bond yields across Europe either at or near record lows. Yields in Australia and New Zealand are also hit an all-time trough on expectations of rate cuts there.
Those declines have kept the US dollar relatively attractive from a yield point of view and it was trading near a two-year high against a basket of currencies at 98.147.
The euro was huddled at $1.1130, having shed 0.75% for the month. The safe haven yen has been faring better and was holding a small monthly gain on the dollar at 109.33.

51,2019-05-31,Coal India,"Inducted for the first time in the Union Cabinet, Pralhad Joshi was the president of the Karnataka unit of the BJPJoshi will have to work in close coordination with the ministries of power and coal to ensure that India’s plans to mine 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020 was achieved

New Delhi: Pralhad Joshi, the 56-year-old fourth-time Lok Sabha MP from Dharwad in Karnataka, has given charge of the ministries of coal and mines in the Narendra Modi government.
Inducted for the first time in the Union Cabinet, Joshi was the president of the Karnataka unit of the BJP. He will oversee the critical coal ministry that fuels India’s electricity needs.
The coal ministry was in the eye of the storm after the controversial coal-field allocations since the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) said in a report in August 2012 that the national exchequer had suffered a loss of  ₹1.86 trillion because of a flawed allocation process. The previous NDA government had set up the coal block allocation process as a successful template for allocation of natural resources in India.
Joshi, who was also made in-charge, Parliamentary Affairs, will have to work in close coordination with the ministries of power and coal to ensure that India’s plans to mine 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020 was achieved. Of this, one billion tonnes is from Coal India Ltd and 500 million tonnes from non-Coal India sources in line with the government’s push to raise natural resources production and kickstart economic growth.
With power sector being the primary customer of coal in India, Joshi will have to keep a close eye on the precarious finances of some state-owned electricity distribution firms, which prevents them from procuring power of the required quantum. As of September 2015, the total debt of all state-owned discoms was around  ₹2.45 trillion, with  ₹0.8 trillion serviced by states.
Interestingly, of India’s installed capacity of 349 gigawatts (GW), the peak demand is only around 177 GW.

50,2019-06-02,Coal India,"Coal india’s FSA volumes fared better year-on-year than e-auction coal in the March quarterFor Fiscal year 2019, the company’s overall volumes of the fuel increased by 4.8%

Sentiment on the Coal India Ltd stock may have perked up marginally on the back of an encouraging set of March quarter numbers, announced after market hours on Thursday. On Friday, while the broader markets were subdued, the miner’s stock closed slightly higher.
Still, over the medium-term perspective, muted outlook on coal sold through the e-auction route is likely to keep a lid on any meaningful expansion in valuations.
In the fourth quarter, e-auction volumes fell by 43% year-on-year. Although e-auction realizations are typically higher as they are linked to international coal prices, Coal India could not reap the gains from here.
Despite the fact that e-auction realizations increased by a strong 30% year-on-year, lower volumes translated into lower e-auction revenues.
Interestingly, coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route fared well. FSA volumes increased by almost 13%, whereas realizations increased by around 4%.
Overall, revenues increased by 7.5% over the same period last year to  ₹28,546 crore. This was helped by a modest 3% increase in sales volume (offtake).
Reported net profit showed an increase of over 360% on a year-on-year basis to  ₹6,026 crore. It’s worth noting here that this increase was helped by a favourable base.
“Headline growth was aided by non-recurring wage cost of  ₹74 billion (7,400 crore) in 4QFY18, as well as additional wage-linked provision of  ₹15 billion (1,500 crore) for full-year FY2018,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a 31 May report.
Still, according to Kotak, Coal India’s reported profits were higher than the brokerage firm’s own estimates of about  ₹4,700 crore.
As far as the stock is concerned, it is encouraging that valuations appear inexpensive. Currently, the company’s shares trade at 9.4 times estimated earnings for FY20, based on Bloomberg data.
However, these valuations are hardly exciting when the outlook doesn’t look bright. Specifically, the tepid outlook on the e-auction segment needs to be watched.
“Going ahead, we see mixed bag for the company as progressively, higher FSA realisation pursuant to better grade control is encouraging,"" wrote analysts from Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a report on 30 May. E-auction premium is expected to come off further, mirroring international coal prices, resulting in muted earnings growth, added the brokerage firm.
“Global thermal coal prices have been on a declining trend since Dec’18 as import demand from major importing countries like China and India have softened due to higher domestic production in the respective countries,"" said analysts from SBICAP Securities Ltd in a report on 2 May. However, the impact of lower global prices may be offset by higher volumes in case of Coal India.
As such, investors will watch volume growth as well. For FY19, Coal India’s volume had increased by 4.8%. In general, analysts are factoring in about 4-6% volume growth for FY20."
49,2019-06-23,Coal India,"Govt headhunter PESB on 17 June called ONGC MD Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new director (finance) of HPCLOil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11% stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore

NEW DELHI :
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) has for the last 15 months refused to recognise its majority shareholder ONGC as its promoter but the government has now for all practical purposes started giving the company its due recognition.
Government headhunter Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB) on June 17 called ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker to assist in selecting the new Director (Finance) of HPCL, a move seen as a stamp of approval for ONGC being the parent of HPCL, sources in know of the development said.
Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) in January last year bought the government's entire 51.11 per cent stake in HPCL for  ₹36,915 crore. HPCL thereafter became its subsidiary but HPCL management has continuously refused to recognise ONGC as its promoter.
In regulatory filings for five consecutive quarters, HPCL listed ""President of India"" as its promoter with ""zero"" per cent shareholding. ONGC was listed as ""public shareholder"", owning ""77.88 crores"" shares or ""51.11 per cent"" shareholding of the company.
Sources said the chairman of ONGC, as a result of it being the holding company of HPCL, by rule was invited to be on the interview panel to select the director and that would in a way end all the wrangling over the promoter issue.
HPCL Director (Finance) J Ramaswamy retired on February 28 and interviews for the post held by PESB on June 17 selected R Kesavan, who currently is an executive director in HPCL, according to a notice put out by the government headhunter.
For selecting the director of a company where the government or its controlled company has more than 50 per cent stake, a PESB panel interviews shortlisted candidates. The panel is assisted by the Secretary of the administrative ministry and the chairman of the company concerned.
The Department of Personnel guidelines state that ""in the case of subsidiaries, the full-time Chairman of the holding Company is invited to assist the Board.""
Sources said going by these guidelines, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director was invited to sit on the interview panel to select HPCL Director (Finance). HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana, who till now used to sit on the interview panels to select directors of the company, was not called.
They said Coal India Ltd's governance structure, which the HPCL management has so often cited, clearly provides for the holding company chairman to sit on the panel for selecting directors of subsidiary companies.
Coal India Ltd is a holding company and has seven subsidiaries. The board of each of the subsidiaries is headed by a chairman and Coal India too has a chairman and managing director to head the board. But on PESB interview panels to select a director or chairman of subsidiary companies, Coal India CMD is invited.
Sources said the government had earlier this year asked HPCL to add ONGC as its co-promoter but the oil refining company sought to delay it by seeking further clarifications.
While the promoter tag does not bring any specific privileges to ONGC, a lack of it keeps it out of insider trading regulations as it get full agenda of every board meeting of HPCL and can be aware of price sensitive information.
ONGC, which had to borrow  ₹24,876 crore for the acquisition that helped the government meet its disinvestment target for the 2017-18 fiscal, first raised the issue of being formally recognised as a promoter of HPCL in August last year.
When the issue first arose in August 2018, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had clearly stated that ONGC is the new promoter of HPCL.
ONGC, he had said, had invested in acquiring a majority stake in the company and so it is the promoter. ""ONGC is the promoter of HPCL,"" he had said.
According to the Securities and Exchange Board of India's rules, the entity that owns the controlling stake should be listed as promoter even if it was not the original promoter of the company.
When Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had bought the government's stake in fuel retailer IBP Co Ltd, it was listed as the latter's promoter in every instance after the deal. The same was the case when IOC acquired a majority stake in Chennai Petroleum Corp Ltd (CPCL).
HPCL Chairman and Managing Director M K Surana has retained the title of CMD despite corporate governance structure require a group having just one chairman and subsidiaries being run by managing directors and CEOs.
ONGC's overseas subsidiary, ONGC Videsh Ltd, is headed by a Managing Director and CEO. Its refinery subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL), which is listed on BSE, too is led by a Managing Director and CEO. ONGC Chairman is the head of boards of both the companies.
Since acquiring a majority stake in HPCL, ONGC has only been able to appoint one director to that firm's board.

48,2019-06-24,Coal India,"It took the company three years to increase production from around 500 mt in FY16 to 606 mt in FY19To meet its FY25 target, annual incremental production would need to be almost twice that rate at 66 mt a year

While the start to the fiscal year has been sluggish, Coal India Ltd (CIL) has not shied away from setting ambitious production targets. It expects to ramp up production to one billion tonnes by FY25. In FY19, it produced about 606 million tonnes (mt).
This implies an annual production growth target of about 8.7% for the next six years. Will the coal miner be able to achieve that?
Recall that CIL had initially set the one-billion-tonne target for FY23. However, due to production and dispatch bottlenecks, such as lack of rake availability, this has now been reset to FY25. Recall also, that it took the company three years to increase production from around 500 mt in FY16 to 606 mt in FY19. To meet its FY25 target, annual incremental production would need to be almost twice that rate at 66 mt a year.
Demand for coal, however, is expected to come from the power sector, particularly thermal power. The management noted that India will continue to rely on thermal power generation for the foreseeable future. CIL is aiming to replace the near 140 mt of imported non-coking coal with local output.
Toward this end, the management has talked about producing 660 mt in FY20, implying 8.9% year-on-year growth. Production in May has, however, dipped, and the full-year production target appears a shade stiff. The management clarified that the sluggish start was due to the cyclone in Odisha and weakness in the economy due to the recent general election.
However, to meet its target CIL will have much catching up to do. “In the light of the flat YTD May production growth, we believe achieving 8.9% YoY production growth could be challenging as: 1) four of seven subsidiaries, including the biggest, SECL, are lagging and 2) evacuation infrastructure in key subsidiaries, SECL, MCL and CCL (contributing 70% to additional production), is still ramping up,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note to clients. SECL is South Eastern Coalfields Ltd, MCL is Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd and CCL is Central Coalfields Ltd.
“CIL plans to invest  ₹10,000 crore in the next few years to procure heavy earth-moving equipment, i.e., excavators, dumpers, etc. Of this,  ₹4,000 crore is expected to be spent in FY20. Apart from equipment, capital expenditure for FY20 is estimated at  ₹10,000 crore,"" said Kotak Institutional Equities in a note to clients.
While all this sounds good, production challenges may keep a lid on valuation upsides."

New Delhi: Supply of coal to the power sector by state-owned CIL declined by 2.6% to 80.9 million tonnes in the first two months of the ongoing fiscal, government data showed.
This comes amid coal imports rising 12.9% to 235.2 million tonnes (MT) in FY'19 over 208.2 MT imported in FY'18.
The country's top dry-fuel miner Coal India Ltd (CIL) had supplied 83.1 MT of coal in April-May period of FY'18, according to government data.
In May, coal dispatch by CIL dropped 4.9% to 40.6 million tonnes from 42.7 MT in May 2017-18.
Coal supply by SCCL also dropped by 2% to 9.4 MT in April-May 2018-19, from 9.6 MT supplied in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.
SCCL is a government coal mining company jointly owned by the Centre and Telangana.
The Centre had earlier said that no power plant was facing fuel shortages, adding that none of the thermal power plants have reported any loss of generation due to supply constraints.
Coal India, which accounts for more than 80% of domestic coal output, is targeting more than 8% growth in production at 660 million tonnes in 2019-20 compared to 607 million tonnes in the last fiscal.

46,2019-07-02,Coal India,"The report highlights that there’s a mismatch between peak periods of demand and output from renewablesThe report says India may be able to exceed one of its 2015 Paris Agreement commitments — reaching 40% of installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources

New Delhi: Coal may account for half of India’s power generation in 2030 despite a boom in solar and wind energy projects, according to analysis by the country’s power-planning body.
The assessment, released on Monday by the nation’s Central Electricity Authority, highlights that the nation has a large existing fleet of coal plants and that there’s a mismatch between peak periods of demand and output from renewables. That will leave a big role for the most-polluting fuel in the nation’s future electricity mix.
The CEA’s analysis shows that India may be able to exceed one of its 2015 Paris Agreement commitments — reaching 40% of installed capacity from non-fossil fuel sources. But the report also sees annual carbon emissions from the power sector rising about 12% from levels expected in 2022 to 1.154 billion tons. The report didn’t include an assessment of what that means for another key India goal — cutting emissions intensity of gross domestic product by as much as 35% from 2005 levels.
The report, which is an attempt to model the lowest-cost capacity mix to meet expected future demand, identifies the intermittent nature of renewables as a limiting factor for its use and advocates adopting grid-scale battery storage.
Non-fossil fuel power sources, led by solar and wind, are seen generating 48% of gross generation, more than double what it was at the end of last year, while accounting for 65% of installed capacity, according to the report. India had 80 gigawatts of renewable capacity at the end of May and has set a goal to install 175 gigawatts by 2022.
Cost trends
“The recent cost trends of renewable energy generation sources have given them the footing to compete with conventional sources of electricity generation,"" according to the report.
India is projected to overtake the US as the world’s second-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide from the power sector before 2030, as the nation’s electricity demand skyrockets, the International Energy Agency said in its World Energy Outlook last year.
While coal’s share in capacity is likely to drop to one-third, it will account for 50% of electricity generated, according to Monday’s report. It was about 72% of generation at the end of March, according to separate CEA data."
45,2019-07-11,Coal India,"The state government will invite private power producers to bid for the right to build these assetsCoal India has already given in-principle agreements to supply coal for the new 2,640MW of power supply

MUMBAI :
The Madhya Pradesh government is planning to set up 2640MW of greenfield coal-fired power plants, a top government official said.
The state government will invite private power producers to bid for the right to build these assets and the power will be sold exclusively to the state, he said.
The proposal, by the Madhya Pradesh Power Coordination Committee, is awaiting approval from the state cabinet. If this goes through, this will be one of the handful of new fossil fuel-based power plants to come up in the country, at a time when about 50GW of thermal power plants are stranded and non-operational because of a lack of fuel supply or long-term purchase contracts from government.
The committee has proposed procuring 2640MW through competitive bidding (2 plants of 1320MW each) while another 1320MW of capacity will be added to the state by MP Power Generating Co Ltd plants at two locations, 660MW at Satpura and Amarkantak each. The target for the additional capacity to come on stream is FY2024-25, according to the minutes of the committee meeting that Mint has viewed.
“Coal India has already given in-principle agreements to supply coal for the new 2640MW of power supply that we want to add to the state,"" ICP Keshari, additional chief secretary, Energy, Government of Madhya Pradesh, said in an interview. “This will be from Western Coalfields and South Eastern Coalfields. Because the supply will be from within the state, we expect the transportation cost to be minimal.
“If you look at recent public sector bids in thermal, the power purchase agreements are signed in the range of  ₹4.60-4.80 per kWh. With transmission costs lower because the power will be generated and consumed within the state, we expect the bids to come in below this,"" Keshari said.
Keshari believes that private companies such as Adani Power, Hindustan Power, Reliance Power, Diligent Power, NewGen Power will be interested in bidding for the projects.
Emails to Adani Power and Reliance Power went unanswered while calls to offices of the other three went unanswered. Adani Power is currently working on the financial closure to set up a 1600MW coal-fired plant in Godda, Jharkhand.
“For the past four years, Madhya Pradesh supplies 24x7 power to non-agricultural users and 10 hours a day to agricultural users,"" Keshari said. “We cannot cut down on supply. On the other hand, we expect the power demand in the state to grow at a rate double of the national average. In fact, the Central Electricity Authority has predicted a shortfall of 5GW by 2026-27. Madhya Pradesh needs to add 600-700MW every year, through thermal and renewable power. We want to be future ready.""
In an October 2018 report, credit ratings agency Crisil estimated that capacity addition in thermal power generation will slow down over the next five years to less than half the current pace.
It expected that only about 35 gigawatt (GW) of new coal-fired power plants would be added to India’s power generation portfolio from FY19-23, against the 88GW of capacity added in the preceding five years.
Lenders have proved reluctant to extend further capital to fire-up stuck power projects as the future of several of these is uncertain and many risk liquidation and with the industry reporting  ₹1.74 lakh crore of non-performing assets, lenders are unwilling to extend capital for new projects as well. “Power plants in India are stuck either because of a lack of fuel supply or governments unwilling to sign long-term PPAs. We are assuring private bidders coal supply and we have applied to the state electricity tariff regulator to clear PPAs for these projects. So I believe banks will be willing to lend to build these plants,"" Keshari said."
44,2019-07-17,Coal India,"Govt plans to list four of Coal India’s biggest production units, as well as its exploration arm, said sources Four units — Mahanadi Coalfields, South Eastern Coalfields, Northern Coalfields and Central Coalfields — account for more than three-fourths of the company’s output

India may spin off units of Coal India Ltd., the world’s largest coal miner, into separate listed companies to boost competition and raise government funds, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The state-run company and the coal ministry are studying a proposal by the finance ministry’s Department of Investment & Public Asset Management to list four of Coal India’s biggest production units, as well as its exploration arm, said the people, who asked not to be named as the plan isn’t public. The development is in an early stage and it was unclear how long it may take, the people added.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has sought to sell some state assets to raise funds, and these divestments will continue to remain a priority, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said July 5, setting a record target of raising 1.05 trillion rupees ($15 billion) in the current fiscal year. Spinning off Coal India subsidiaries would also lead to greater competition in the domestic coal market and improve corporate governance, the people said.
A spokesman at Coal India didn’t respond to requests seeking comment, while press officials at the coal and finance ministries declined to comment.
The four units -- Mahanadi Coalfields, South Eastern Coalfields, Northern Coalfields and Central Coalfields -- account for more than three-fourths of the company’s output, while constituting less than half of its workforce. The fifth unit would be Central Mine Planning & Design Institute.
India’s state run coal giant has been unable to meet growing demand despite abundant resources. Coal India produced a record 607 million metric tons in the last fiscal year to March, falling short by 22% of a target proposed in 2017. The goal has been revised a few times since then, but output was still just below a revised target. Meanwhile, imports of the fuel surged to a record over the same period.
Shares in the miner, which has a market cap of about $20.7 billion, are heading for a fifth straight year of declines. The government holds almost 71% of the company.
India, the world’s second-largest coal consumer after China, depends on Coal India for about 83% of the domestic production. The miner has consistently fallen short of production targets, while an overworked railway network has hampered transport of the fuel.
The government’s top planning body, NITI Aayog, proposed in 2017 that Coal India be broken up so its units can compete against each other. It was dismissed at the time by Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, who said the plan doesn’t reflect government policy.

43,2019-07-18,Coal India,"Donald Trump has been putting pressure on European and Asian allies to shoulder security responsibilities and not depend on the United States aloneIndia is the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China

NEW DELHI :
Indian warships escorting merchant vessels in the Persian Gulf will remain deployed for the longer term, officials with direct knowledge of the matter said, as tensions between Iran and Western powers rise.
But the two ships, backed by surveillance aircraft, will not be part of a military coalition that the United States is assembling to safeguard the waters off Iran near the Straits of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's oil moves, the two officials said.
Since June following attacks on tankers that the United States blamed on Iran and Iran-aligned fighters, a charged Tehran denies, the Indian navy ships have been escorting Indian-flagged vessels in and out of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.
""This is not going to stop, the situation being what it is, we will be there for the foreseeable future,"" said an official with knowledge of naval deployments.
India's navy, which has traditionally operated closer to home waters, has over past year or so begun deployments across the Indian Ocean stretching from the Malacca Strait in Southeast Asia to waters off Africa, largely as a response to China's expanding weight across the region.
But the maritime operation in the Gulf is also to heed U.S. President Donald Trump's call that major buyers of Middle East oil protect their own tankers, a second Indian official with knowledge of India's policy on the region said.
The issue figured during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting with Trump on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Japan last month and Modi told the U.S. leader he had sent ships to protect Indian-flagged vessels, the official said.
Trump has been putting pressure on European and Asian allies to shoulder security responsibilities and not depend on the United States alone.
Deepening regional tensions, Iran said on Thursday it had seized a foreign tanker smuggling fuel in the Gulf, and the U.S. military commander in the region said the United States would work ""aggressively"" to ensure free passage of vessels.
REFUELLING
On Friday, U.S. officials will speak to members of the Washington diplomatic corps about the new initiative to promote freedom of navigation and maritime security around the Strait of Hormuz, the State Department said.
New Delhi will not be formally joining such a force, in large measure because that would pit it directly against Iran, with which it has had historical political and energy ties. It also has never been part of foreign military task forces, preferring to work under the United Nations flag instead, the first official said.
India is the biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China.
""We will be carrying out the force protection measures on our own for Indian-flagged vessels. So far, nearly two dozen ships have been provided security,"" the official said.
But there is coordination with the U.S. military with which India has a logistics support agreement, the official said.
Indian naval ships operating in the Gulf have been fuelled by the large fleet of U.S. tankers and such assistance will remain because of the indefinite length of operation, the official said.
There have been no incidents so far involving Indian commercial shipping in the vital waterways.
""I surmise in a conflict we will be neutral. We will be drawn into it only if our shipping is hit,"" said former Indian naval officer Abhijit Singh, who heads the Maritime Policy Initiative think-tank at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.
Singh said Indian navy ships had sailed in the Persian Gulf earlier though never exclusively to escort merchant marine.
About 15 Indian ships - destroyers, frigates, corvettes and large patrol vessels - are operating at the entry and exit points of the Indian Ocean, stretching from the Malacca Strait, through which much of China's trade and fuel is routed, to the Gulf of Aden in the west."

41,2019-07-29,Coal India,"With govt insisting on discoms speed up payments to power generators, consumers may end up with higher billsGovt directed all discoms should open and maintain sufficient LCs as payment security under PPAs signed with generation companies

Starting next month, consumers may see inflated electricity bills and/or frequency of power cuts increase, as part of a chain reaction set off by the government that ordered stopping supply to state electricity distribution companies (discoms) that don’t pay their bills on time.
On 28 June, the Ministry of Power directed all discoms to open and maintain sufficient letters of credit (LCs) as payment security under power purchase agreements (PPAs) with generation companies. The rule comes into effect in August. The government took this measure as discoms’ dues to generators have mounted, placing the latter and their lenders under stress.
Thermal power generators are now required to pay in advance for coal procured from Coal India Ltd and have to make upfront payments to the Railways for coal transportation. On the other hand, discoms continue to procure power from generators without paying for 3-5 months. Forcing discoms to acquire LCs will bring discipline to this part of the chain. If a discom doesn’t pay, the generator can enforce the LC, collect payment and discontinue power supply to the discom.
However, in a report released on Monday, credit ratings agency Crisil has said several discoms will struggle to get their LCs in order. “Discoms have to provide LCs equivalent to their monthly power-purchase bills. This will be a herculean task for many discoms, given their precarious financial positions,"" the report said.
CRISIL Research has estimated that additional working capital requirements for discoms -- to speed up bill payment -- may lead to a further rise in interest burden of  ₹400-500 crore for state utilities, particularly those in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana. These states also have high fiscal deficit -- ranging between 2.8% and 3.5% -- which makes state grants to shore up finance of discoms difficult.
This leaves discoms with the choice to either depend on bank borrowings to meet LC requirements, resulting in further rise in debt, and consequently, increase in interest costs, or recover higher costs from consumers. “This could be through tariff hikes or creation of regulatory assets that enable recovery of carrying costs through tariffs in subsequent periods,"" the report said.
Alternately, discoms may choose to procure power through central and state-generating units that are currently under-utilised. Discoms may also opt for partial load-shedding to keep their costs under control."
40,2019-08-01,Coal India,"Coal imports are seen falling to below 150 million tons by the year ending March 2024, down from 235.2 million tons in the last fiscalTo meet the import reduction goal, Coal India will aim to raise its annual output to 880 million tons by fiscal year 2024

New Delhi: India’s coal ministry is preparing a plan to cut imports of the fuel by at least a third over the next five years, counting on an increase in domestic production and a jump in renewable output, according to people familiar with the plan.
Imports are seen falling to below 150 million tons by the year ending March 2024, down from 235.2 million tons India got from overseas in the last fiscal year, the people said, asking not to be named as the five-year plan is still being finalized. To meet the import reduction goal, state miner Coal India Ltd. will aim to raise its annual output to 880 million tons by fiscal year 2024, a compounded annual growth of 7.7% through the period.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants to expand the country’s economy to $5 trillion by 2024, from $2.8 trillion currently, and reducing energy imports and harnessing domestic resources are key to meeting that goal. The import reduction plan also points to the South Asian nation’s gradual shift away from coal to fight deadly air pollution that millions of Indians battle with.
Imports will be dominated by coking coal purchases by steelmakers because domestic supplies are limited, the people said. Power stations that are designed to run on higher-quality imported coal would be the other major buyer.
Officials at Coal India and the coal ministry didn’t immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
Surging imports
Besides increasing output at state miners Coal India and Singareni Collieries Co., captive coal miners, who extract the fuel for their own use, will also need to produce more to substitute imports, the people said. The country’s overall demand for the fuel is seen rising to about 1.2 billion tons by fiscal 2024, they said, from about 970 million tons in the year ended March.
To be sure, curbing imports has been on India’s agenda for some years. Yet, difficulties in purchasing land for mining, delays in environment approvals and a clogged railway network have combined to dampen those plans, with imports surging to a record last year. To add to that, Coal India has missed its production target every year since at least 2011. The miner missed its target of 610 million tons by less than 1% last fiscal year.
Still, the goal to reduce imports looks more achievable than before, as Indian Railways plans an overhaul of its British-era network and tracks reach new mines to enable output growth.
A record addition of green power capacity is also seen weighing on demand. Coal’s share in India’s electricity generation is estimated to come down to 50% by 2030 from about 72% now, according to the power ministry’s Central Electricity Authority."
39,2019-08-14,Coal India,"Part of the reason was a dip in realizations in the preceding quarter, which muted revenue growthThankfully, a control on costs and lower raw material consumption increased Ebitda by 16% year-on-year in the June quarter

Coal India Ltd’s first-quarter numbers were decent, but still fell marginally short of the Street’s expectations. This resulted in the stock correcting about 1.6% on Wednesday when most front-line metal and mining stocks staged a smart recovery.
Part of the reason was a dip in realizations in the preceding quarter, which muted revenue growth. However, compared to the year-earlier quarter, realizations were higher by about 4%. On the other hand, realizations from e-auction sales were lower by about 10% year-on-year.
This kept revenue growth soft at about 3.6% year-on-year. Thankfully, a control on costs and lower raw material consumption increased Ebitda by 16% year-on-year in the June quarter. Ebitda stands for earnings before, interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Coal India shut down some of its old mines to improve productivity and also cut back on additional expenses.
As a result, Ebitda margins received a fillip coming in at 26.5% in the June quarter, as against 23.5% in the year-ago period. However, point to note, that this is lower sequentially than the 28.8% margins seen in the preceding March quarter.
The Street has been looking for signs of improvement in the miner’s coal production and sales numbers. On that score, production of raw coal in the first quarter remained the same as last year at 137 million tonnes (mt). Sales volumes, too, were a drab at 153 mt.
The management had indicated earlier that production volume would be around 660 mt in FY20. Going by the current run rate, Coal India will need to produce about 169 mt of the fuel per quarter over the next three quarters, which means a significant ramp-up.
Going ahead, though, Ebitda growth, and cash flows could remain steady. “Ongoing efficiency measures and continued growth in volumes (our estimates 5-6%), should drive 5% EBITDA compounded annual growth rate over FY19-21, despite the high base of FY19,"" said a Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd note.
Yet, the Coal India stock has been struggling. Since the beginning of the year, the stock has corrected about 17%, despite carrying a dividend yield of about 8%. The company, though, continues to generate good cash flow.
However, earnings growth expectation remains soft. An overhang has been government divestment, which will increase the available free-float.
Not surprisingly, analysts have trimmed their valuation expectations. “Taking cognizance of divestment risk and muted earnings growth, we trim exit multiple to 8.5x (earlier 10.0x FY21E EPS),"" said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a recent note to clients.
Though, any ramp-up on production and sales by Coal India will be seen as a positive."

Bengaluru: India's July crude oil imports declined from a year earlier, while petrol imports climbed to their highest since at least April 2011, data from the oil ministry's Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) showed on Wednesday.
Crude oil imports into the world's third-largest consumer declined 1.2% from a year earlier to 19.34 million tonnes, but increased 14.6% from the previous month.
Petrol imports rose to 230,000 tonnes in July, the highest since PPAC data going back to 2011.
Government data published earlier this month showed sales of gasoline, or petrol, were 8.8% higher from a year earlier at 2.52 million tonnes.
LNG imports, meanwhile, fell to their lowest since February 2018 at 850,000 tonnes.
India's imports of crude oil have stalled in recent months, with both coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) also soft. This could be attributed to Indian refiners adjusting to the loss of cargoes from Iran after the United States did not extend waivers to buyers of Iranian crude beyond the beginning of May.
Meanwhile, imports of oil products rose by about 9% from a year earlier to 2.81 million tonnes. Year-on-year exports fell 5% last month to 5.07 million tonnes, the data showed.
Exports in Naphtha fell to their lowest since October 2015 at 400,000 tonnes."

KOLKATA :
A senior Australian minister is likely to meet Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani during his trip to India beginning Monday.
The meeting is expected to discuss Adani's Rs10,000 crore Carmichael coal project where Australian authorities will try to persuade the Indian investor to begin construction at the earliest.
The 10 MTPA coal mine project in Queensland drew protests from environmentalists who are claiming that it will cut into the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area.
""Australia's Minister for Resources and Northern Australia Matthew Canavan will be meeting Adani during his three-day visit in India visit that begins on August 26,"" an Australian diplomat told PTI.
He said the coal project had received all approvals of the state and Central government and now it is up to the Adanis.
The project which was facing resistance for nine years had received environmental approvals recently needed to begin work on its Carmichael mine in Queensland.
On the opposition of environmentalists, the diplomat said a project of such a scale will have some impact and bound to get opposition. ""The government gave its nod after evaluating such threats.""
Adani Australia on Wednesday said, ""There has been a concerted campaign by extremists against our Carmichael Project and businesses that partner with us.
""It has not succeeded and construction of the Carmichael Project is well and truly underway,"" it said."
36,2019-08-28,Coal India,"Other sectors where FDI rules would be eased are coal mining and contract manufacturingFDI in India dipped 1% to $44.36 billion in 2018-19

New Delhi: The Union Cabinet today will consider relaxing foreign direct investment (FDI) norms in several sectors, including single-brand retail and digital media, to attract overseas players, sources said.
Other sectors where FDI rules would be eased are coal mining and contract manufacturing.
The government may approve proposal to allow 100 per cent FDI in contract manufacturing, they said.
In the existing foreign investment policy, 100 per cent foreign direct investment is permitted in the manufacturing sector under the automatic route.
A manufacturer is also allowed to sell products manufactured in India through wholesale and retail channels, including through e-commerce, without the government's approval.
But, the policy does not talk about the contract manufacturing and it is not clearly defined in the policy.
""Big technology firms across the world are going for this, so there is a need for clarification on the matter,"" the sources said.
Commenting on the proposal, L Badri Narayanan, Partner, Lakshmikumaran & Sridharan Attorneys, said that the move if approved would give an impetus to the manufacturing sector, which is riddled with grey areas.
""If the manufacturing entity is proposed to be allowed to have foreign investment, the same appears to be in line with the principles already set out in the FDI policy,"" Narayanan said.
Similarly, the government is looking at coming out with a clarification on applicability of the foreign direct investment policy on the digital media sector.
The present FDI policy is silent on the fast-growing digital media segment.
In the print media sector, 26 per cent FDI is allowed through government approval route. Similarly, 49 per cent is permitted in broadcasting content services through government approval route.
In the single-brand retail sector, the Cabinet will consider a proposal of relaxing rules for complying with the mandatory 30 per cent local sourcing norms by foreign single-brand retailers.
As per the proposal, single-brand retail firms would also be permitted to open online stores before setting up brick-and-mortar shops.
Currently, online sale by a single-brand retail player is allowed only after the opening of physical outlets.
Relaxations are expected in a provision where foreign retail traders are presently allowed to adjust procurement of goods from India for their global operations for meeting the mandatory local sourcing requirement.
However, ""incremental"" sourcing of goods from India is only taken into account presently, and is allowed only for five years.
""Amendments and easing are also likely in this provision,"" a source said adding, foreign single brand retailers may be allowed to adjust all of their procurement of goods from India for their global operations for meeting the local sourcing norms.
In the coal mining sector, according to the proposal, foreign players would be allowed to mine coal and sell it.
Currently, FDI is permitted for captive coal mining only.
The move comes in the backdrop of announcements made by the government in the Budget.
Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her Budget speech in July had said that the government would examine suggestions of further opening up of FDI in aviation, media (animation, AVGC) and insurance sectors in consultation with all stakeholders to attract more overseas investment.
FDI in India dipped 1 per cent to $44.36 billion in 2018-19.
Last year, the government had relaxed FDI rules for several sectors, including single-brand retail, non-banking financial companies and construction.
Foreign investments are considered crucial for India, which needs billions of dollars for overhauling its infrastructure sector such as ports, airports and highways to boost growth.
FDI helps in improving the country's balance of payments situation and strengthen the rupee value against other global currencies, especially the US dollar.

35,2019-08-28,Coal India,"Moves a bid to become part of global supply chain amid trade war disruptionsAll procurements made from India by an entity for a single brand will now be counted towards local sourcing of 30%

New Delhi: The Union cabinet cleared a raft of changes in foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations, including easing rules for overseas single-brand stores and permitting FDI through the automatic route in contract manufacturing and all areas of coal mining.
“The changes in FDI policy will result in making India a more attractive destination, leading to benefits of increased investments, employment and growth,"" a cabinet statement said on Wednesday.
The Indian economy had decelerated to a five-year low of 5.8% in the March quarter, while high-frequency indicators, including automobile sales, have signalled a consumption slump.
Most analysts expect the economy to slow down further in the June quarter, GDP data for which will be released on Friday. Last week, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a number of measures to boost investor sentiment and spur economic growth.
“This government since 2014 has kept reforms as a part of the agenda. It is an ongoing process for us. It is not as if in this tenure, post 2019, we have forgotten the reform agenda. Not at all. Reform is a continuous process and we are treating it as a continuing endeavour,"" Sitharaman said on Friday.
The reforms are part of India’s strategy to become part of the global supply chain amid its disruption due to the US-China trade war.
In her maiden budget speech on 5 July, Sitharaman had proposed to examine suggestions of further opening up FDI in aviation, media and insurance sectors in consultation with all stakeholders.
In single-brand retail, the government on Wednesday allowed companies to conduct online retail trading prior to opening of physical stores, subject to the condition that brick-and-mortar stores come up within two years from the date it starts online operations. “Online sales will lead to creation of jobs in logistics, digital payments, customer care, training and product skilling,"" the press statement said.
To provide greater flexibility and ease of operations to foreign single-brand retail entities with more than 51% FDI, the cabinet decided that all procurements made from India by the entity for that single brand shall be counted towards local sourcing of 30%, irrespective of whether the goods procured are sold in India or exported. Further, the current cap of considering exports for five years only was removed, to give an impetus to exports.
So far, only incremental sourcing of the single brand entity was taken into account while current sourcing was not considered. From now on, total sourcing, including by group companies, will be considered for meeting the 30% local sourcing norm.
The cabinet on Wednesday allowed 100% FDI in contract manufacturing, allowing large foreign electronics and pharmaceutical companies to directly invest in local or foreign contract manufacturers. This will give a big boost to the government’s Make in India policy.
“Manufacturing activities may be conducted either by the investee entity or through contract manufacturing in India under a legally tenable contract, whether on Principal to Principal or Principal to Agent basis,"" the statement added.
So far, 100% FDI under the automatic route was allowed for coal processing plants as well as for coal mining for captive consumption by power projects, iron and steel and cement units.
The Union cabinet on Wednesday allowed 100% FDI under the automatic route for coal mining as well as sale and export of coal. This is expected to end the monopoly enjoyed so far by Coal India Ltd (CIL), which is often considered lacking capability to mine the coalfields.

34,2019-08-29,Coal India,"The Centre had set a mining target of 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020The move will also help India gain access to high-end technology for underground mining used by global miners

NEW DELHI :
The Union cabinet on Wednesday announced 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) under the automatic route in coal mining for open sale, besides creating associated infrastructure, such as washeries.
While the move will help create an efficient energy market, usher in competition and reduce coal imports, it may also put an end to state-run Coal India Ltd’s (CIL’s) monopoly. India’s coal sector was nationalized in 1973.
New Delhi’s move comes at a time when the window for fossil fuels is rapidly closing, and the global energy landscape has been rapidly evolving, with fundamental changes to the investment culture amid growing climate concerns.
“In the coal sector, for sale of coal, 100% FDI under automatic route for coal mining, activities including associated processing infrastructure will attract international players to create an efficient and competitive coal market,"" the government said in a statement.
Experts gave a thumbs up to the move. “While opening up coal mining for competition through commercial mining, with participation of foreign companies, may bring in innovative and sustainable technologies and practices. It is certainly a step in the right direction,"" said Dipesh Dipu, partner, Jenissi Management Consultants, Hyderabad.
The move will also help India gain access to high-end technology for underground mining used by global miners.
However, concerns remain. “Additionally, this may be right-timed when coal miners elsewhere have been closing mines, and yet, due to the structure of auction, the foreign companies may find it difficult to compete. There are other challenges, too, such as smaller resource-bases in coal mines and production capacities, and risks in land acquisitions and other permits, which may prevent their entry,"" Dipu added.
Last year, the NDA government had allowed commercial mining by private entities. “As per the present FDI policy, 100% FDI under automatic route is allowed for coal and lignite mining for captive consumption by power projects, iron and steel and cement units, and other eligible activities permitted under and subject to applicable laws and regulations,"" the statement said.
The Centre had set a mining target of 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020. Of this, one billion tonnes is to be from Coal India Ltd and 500 million tonnes from non-Coal India sources in line with the government’s push to raise natural resources production to kickstart economic growth."
33,2019-08-29,Coal India,"South Asian economy will allow 100% foreign direct investment in mining and sale of coal, said trade minister Piyush GoyalCoal India rose as much 2.5% today 

The world’s biggest coal miner is likely to hold on to its crown for now even as competition increases in India, which opened its doors to foreign miners to boost output and curb surging imports.
The South Asian economy will allow 100% foreign direct investment in mining and sale of coal, trade minister Piyush Goyal told reporters in a briefing Wednesday, giving final shape to a reform he introduced as minister for coal in 2014. While that opens up the sector to private companies, both Indian and foreign, it will be a while before it reduces the dominance of monopoly producer Coal India Ltd., according to analysts with Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd.
Record Imports
India’s coal demand is expected to rise with the addition of new thermal power plants and steel mills, making the nation a bright spot for coal miners in a world that is turning away from the dirty fuel. Still, difficulties in getting regulatory clearances, delays in land acquisition and shortages of railway rakes to haul the commodity may be a deterrent for foreign miners.
“We are still some time away from merchant coal mining given the overarching presence of Coal India,"" Emkay analysts including Vishal Chandak said in a note Wednesday. “Once coal is mined, the new miner will have to compete with Coal India prices to sell or enter into long-term contracts for sale.""
The state miner has a competitive advantage over other companies as it gets the mines for free, while others will have to participate in auctions to get access, raising their costs. Coal India rose as much 2.5% to 189.65 rupees and was trading at 188.75 rupees as of 1:56 p.m. in Mumbai on Thursday, outperforming a 0.6% decline in the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex.

32,2019-08-29,Coal India,"100% FDI under automatic route in coal mining and associated infrastructure has been approvedAllocation of coal mines will only be done through auctions and even after winning the auction, a miner has to acquire the necessary land for operations

MUMBAI :
Even as India takes its first steps towards privatizing coal mining in India, it might be a while before the country sees active participation in the sector.
On Wednesday, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said 100% foreign direct investment (FDI) under automatic route in coal mining and associated infrastructure has been approved. This comes after a decision that the Modi government took in February 2018 that would allow auctions of coal-bearing blocks to private parties for commercial mining. Coal mining has so far been the exclusive domain of public sector Coal India Ltd.
Before this, FDI was allowed only in captive coal and lignite mining by power projects, steel and cement companies. In addition, coal washeries were allowed to be set up, subject to the condition that these washeries would not either mine coal or sell washed coal in the open market. Now, 100% FDI is permitted under the automatic route to set up such washeries, subject to provisions of a) Coal mines (special provisions) Act, 2015 and b) MMDR Act, 1957.
In response to the government’s decision, Anil Agarwal, chairman of metals and mining conglomerate Vedanta, said: “100% FDI in mining is another progressive step announced by the government. This will send a positive signal to global investors and will give a significant push to the economy to reach the $5 trillion mark."" The current decision will allow global miners like Rio Tinto, Glencore and BHP Billiton to enter the Indian coal mining space.
However, analysts point out that there still will be some initial hindrances to private investment taking place. The allocation of coal mines will only be done through auctions and even after winning the auction, a miner has to acquire the necessary land for operations. The miner is also responsible for obtaining the environment and forest clearances and a host of other clearances needed before mining can begin. “The new miner also needs comfort on availability of rakes, which is in short supply,"" an analyst said. “Once coal is mined, the new miner will have to compete with Coal India prices (likely e-auction prices) to sell or enter into long-term contracts for sale.""
A report by Emkay Securities said: “Although the initiative is a welcome move, we are still some time away from merchant coal mining given the overarching presence of Coal India, shortage of rakes, time taken for land acquisition and various approvals from local/state/central governments. We do not see any near-term risks to Coal India because of this decision.""
However, the thermal sector is likely to benefit from this move. Acuité Ratings and Research said in a note that the “government’s decision to permit 100% FDI via automatic route in coal mining and allied activities will facilitate higher investments in the thermal power sector and arrest the increasing dependence on coal imports over the medium term. A study by Acuité Ratings indicates that coal imports by private sector independent power producers have leapfrogged to 14.5 million tonnes from 10.3 million tonnes i.e. over 40% year-on-year increase in April-June 2019."""
31,2019-09-05,Coal India,"These stocks have been hammered ever since the govt announced plans to raise over  ₹1 trillion through divestmentsDivestments tend to cause a spike in free-floats

Low valuations and high dividend yield did not quite prove to be the mantra to generate returns for investors in stocks of state-run companies. On the contrary, public sector unit stocks have been facing rough weather. The Nifty PSE index has lost 15.6% in the last two months. During that time, the Nifty 500 index fell about 9.6%. PSE is public sector enterprise.
In that backdrop, the rebound in these shares on Thursday is a welcome development. A news report that the government is reviewing divestment through the exchange-traded fund (ETF) route provided the much-needed breather for public sector unit stocks. The Nifty PSE index gained 3.1% on Thursday. Some of the gainers in the index were the stocks of Coal India Ltd (7.3%), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (5.3%), and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (4.5%).
These stocks have been hammered ever since the budget announcement that the government plans to raise more than  ₹1 trillion through divestments—one of its largest divestment programmes. In fact, in the last four fiscal years, the government divested stocks worth about  ₹78,000 crore through several divestments in both the CPSE ETF and the Bharat 22 ETF.
As divestments go, the free-float of stocks increased. Divestments tend to cause a spike in free-floats. Both institutional and retail investors lap up the offerings made through the ETF route because of arbitrage opportunities. As public sector unit divestments have often been made at a small discount to prevailing market prices, they generate considerable interest from investors. The retained oversubscription in such cases then eventually finds its way into the equity market.
Public shareholding in Coal India increased from 21.6% in June 2018 to 29.04% in the same month of 2019. The public float of Indian Oil Corp. Ltd’s stock increased from 43.25% to 47.82% in the same period.
“PSU stocks’ free-floats have increased appreciably in the past few years as investors used to invest in ETFs and redeem the units in the market. PSUs have seen an increase in their public floats, and that has been weighing heavily on these stocks. Postponing the divestment in a weak market may bring some relief, though we have yet to see how much divestment will be done at a later stage,"" said a market strategist at a domestic brokerage firm, who did not want to be named.
As such, much would depend on when and which listed companies make the next tranche of divestments, particularly considering that the broader markets have been weak. Given enough time before the next divestment, perhaps some of these stocks may be able to outperform for now."

Coal is among the top five commodities imported by India, one of the world's largest consumers of the fuel. Coal imports are surging after the government failed to open the industry to competition, despite having passed a liberalization policy 19 months ago.
The coal block auctions are intended to attract global miners such as Glencore PLC, BHP Group, Anglo American PLC and Peabody Energy Corp.
The government aims to allow companies with winning bids to begin development of the coal blocks - which hold proven reserves - by early 2020, the three sources said.
It is not clear when the government expects to see first output from the coal blocks. India's Ministry of Coal did not respond to a request for comment.
Total imports of thermal coal - used mainly for power generation - rose by about a third during the quarter ended June 30 to 56.23 million tonnes as compared with the same period last year, according to government data reviewed by Reuters.
Coal India and a small stated-owned company are the only firms currently allowed to mine and sell coal in India. India does allow some power, steel, cement and aluminium companies to mine coal for their own captive use."
29,2019-09-24,Coal India,"Five federations representing over half-a-million workers of CIL and Singareni Collieries have called for the strikeThey are seeking withdrawal of the central government's move

Kolkata: Trade unions on Tuesday claimed that production and dispatch has come to a ""complete halt"" at the mines of Coal India Ltd and Singareni Collieries Company Ltd, owing to the one-day strike against the Centre's decision to allow 100 per cent FDI in coal mining.
Five federations representing over half-a-million workers of CIL and Singareni Collieries have called for the strike, seeking withdrawal of the central government's move.
""Strike is total with complete stop in production, transportation and dispatch of coal from all mines -- Assam to Singareni,"" All India Coal Workers' Federation General Secretary D D Ramanandan told PTI.
Coal India, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the total output of the dry fuel in the country, is likely to lose around 1.5 million tonne of production due to the stir.
Officials of the mining major were not available for comments.
Unions that served one-day strike notice are Indian National Mineworkers' Federation (INTUC), Hind Khadan Mazdoor Federation (HMS), Indian Mineworkers' Federation (AITUC), All India Coal Workers' Federation (CITU) and All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU).
Meanwhile, RSS-affiliated labour union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), which is not a signatory with other federations to the one-day strike notice, is observing a five-day ceasework from Monday till September 27 on the same issue.

27,2019-09-30,Coal India,"Coal, crude oil, natural gas, cement, and electricity recorded a negative growthThis data may spur the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates in its policy review later this week

New Delhi: Growth worries for the government escalated, with the output of India’s eight infrastructure sectors contracting for the first time in more than four years in August.
The index of eight core infrastructure industries declined 0.5% during the month, according to government data released on Monday. Production in five sectors, including electricity and cement, shrank. The development indicates that the recovery seen in July may have been a blip, as feared by many analysts.
Output of coal (-8.6%), crude oil (-5.4%), natural gas (-3.9%), cement (-4.9%) and electricity (-2.9%) contracted in August, indicating a broad-based slowdown, while production of refinery products (2.6%), fertilizers (2.9%) and steel (5%) increased.
Although the contraction in cement output was partly on account of the high base of last year and monsoon rain, in conjunction with the moderation in growth of steel output, this does not bode well for construction activity. The weakness in electricity output was driven by a contraction of 3.5% in thermal electricity generation, in contrast to the moderately healthy expansion of 6.2% in July.
The latest macro data may also force the monetary policy committee (MPC) of the Reserve Bank of India to cut interest rates at its meeting later this week.
Data released last month showed the index of industrial production (IIP) grew 4.3% in July from a downward-revised 1.2% the previous month, bringing some cheer amid mounting economic gloom. Core sector constitutes about 40% of IIP.
Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA Ltd, said the contraction in core sector growth in August confirmed that the modest pickup in IIP growth in July did not signal the start of an industrial recovery. “With the contraction in core sector output, auto production and non-oil merchandise exports, we expect IIP growth to print at a muted sub-1% in August. We continue to expect the MPC to cut the repo rate by 25 bps in the upcoming October 2019 policy review,"" she added.
Indian businesses have been battling a demand slowdown and liquidity crunch, resulting in economic growth rate cooling to a six-year low of 5% in the June quarter, while private consumption expenditure dropped to an 18-quarter low of 3.1%. While the government’s decision to cut the corporate tax rate is expected to boost sentiment, most analysts believe a recovery in either investment or consumption in the short run is unlikely.
Data separately released by the central bank showed non-food credit growth—a key indicator of consumption demand—decelerated to 9.8% in August from 12.4% a year ago."
28,2019-09-30,Coal India,"The PMC scandal risks dragging other institutions into the vortex of a messy real estate shakeoutThe moot question remains how did PMC’s board, its auditors and the central bank remain clueless for so long?

Just when you think banks in India can’t possibly deliver any more bad news, a near $1 billion scandal drops without warning. The alleged wrongdoing at Punjab & Maharashtra Co-operative Bank differs from previous Indian banking scams in that savers are on the hook this time around, a situation that can’t be allowed to continue without chilling consequences for an already-stressed financial system.
The problem at PMC Bank only became apparent when the Reserve Bank of India last week banned depositors from taking out more than  ₹1,000 ($14) for six months without offering any explanation. That was a mistake. 
Tiny and unlisted as it is, PMC is a popular option for small savers in the state of Maharashtra, whose capital Mumbai is the nation’s financial hub. With public and media pressure building, the RBI relaxed the withdrawal limit to 10,000 rupees. In doing so, the regulator also gave a reason for the withdrawal curbs. These “were necessitated on account of major financial irregularities, failure of internal control and systems of the bank and wrong/under-reporting of its exposure,"" it said.
Even so, the extent of irregularities came as a shock on Sunday evening, when Press Trust of India reported that as much as 73% of PMC’s  ₹8,800 crore  loan book – or almost $920 million – was tied to just one borrower group: Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd., a Mumbai-based shantytown developer that’s facing bankruptcy proceedings. The news agency cited a letter written by the bank’s now-suspended managing director to the RBI. The executive had told BloombergQuint on Friday that about a third of the bank's loans were given to HDIL.
Whether two-thirds or one-third, the size of the reported advance is far in excess of the bank’s capital. This goes beyond a failure of oversight, and would require top-level complicity. PMC’s annual report shows it to be a profitable lender with a capital adequacy ratio higher than the 12% minimum requirement and a bad-loan ratio of under 4% – almost respectable by the current standards of India’s banking industry. If the news reports are correct, the solidity portrayed by that document is a fiction.
How did PMC’s board, its auditors and the central bank remain clueless for so long? So far nobody has been charged; the entire burden has been placed at the door of depositors, who are innocent victims.
When state-run Punjab National Bank was scammed out of almost $2 billion, it emerged that the lender was incurring liabilities on behalf of an uncle-nephew jeweler duo. It was doing so by sending instructions to overseas branches of other Indian banks over Swift, the global system used by banks to transmit payments. But the liabilities weren’t getting captured in PNB’s internal accounts. By contrast, the PMC saga points to the possibility that the very core of the bank’s operations was rotten.
Ultimately, the RBI will find a way to merge or liquidate PMC and make the depositors whole. But a resolution has to come swiftly. In the case of Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative Bank, which collapsed in 2001 because of its exposure to a troubled stockbroker, some higher-value depositors were getting their money back as late as last year.
Given the extent of current nervousness in the financial system, it would be a bad idea to let this problem linger for even six months. And while they’re shoring up confidence, authorities also need to raise the  ₹1 lakh limit on deposit insurance. The PMC debacle could affect the ability of midsize lender Yes Bank Ltd. to raise or retain deposits, IDFC Securities said in a Sept. 29 note. Yes, too, has concentrated exposure to junk-grade firms, including a property financier. The bank’s shares fell as much as 15% in Monday trading.
The real-estate market in India is a mess. Property developers are leveraged to the hilt, and unable to complete and deliver apartments. Their troubles have, in turn, damaged shadow banks, which are finding it hard to refinance their loans to builders. With the PMC scandal, even deposit-taking institutions run the risk of getting sucked into a vortex of mistrust. The more reliable banks may see a rush of deposits away from second-tier lenders with  ₹9 trillion in deposits. This dislocation in liquidity could open up yet more fault lines at banks perceived to be weaker. PMC Bank is too tiny to pose a systemic threat, but a small, dead canary in a coalmine is still a large warning sign."
26,2019-10-02,Coal India,"Coal India stops work as locals spar over goat's death at Talcher coalfields in BhubaneswarCoal India has lodged a complaint at the local police station against the protesters

BHUBANESWAR: Protests by locals in eastern India over a trespassing goat killed in an accident halted operations and cost Coal India unit Mahanadi Coalfield Ltd (MCL) 26.8 million rupees ($377,000), a spokesman said on Tuesday.
""It's surprising, but true. A goat can also cost you,"" MCL spokesman Dikken Mehra's statement read.
Coal transportation at Talcher coalfields, one of India's biggest, came to a halt after locals from a nearby village protested against the killing of a goat in an accident in a prohibited mining zone.
Operations were halted for three-and-a-half-hours, and resumed only after police intervened, Mehra said. Coal India has lodged a complaint at the local police station against the protesters.
""People from the peripheral localities deliberately trespassing into the coal mine and overburden areas to pick coal, firewood and even graze their livestock remains a cause of concern,"" Mehra said."
25,2019-10-04,Coal India,"The continuous supply of Coal India paper due to government’s disinvestment programme is another overhangThe government’s recent tax cut could, however, improve its earnings marginally this year

Shares of Coal India Ltd fell by 3.4% on Thursday after the company reported a poor set of production numbers. Production shrank 23% in September, hampered by floods and rains. That has continued to keep a lid on its stock price, despite what appears to be an inexpensive valuation.
Overall, in the April-September 2019 period, Coal India’s production slumped 6% to 241 million tonnes. Analysts had pencilled in a target of 650-660 million tonnes for FY20. That means the coal miner needs to produce 410-420 million tonnes in the next six months to catch up, which clearly looks like a stretch.
Another worry for the company is the fall in coal prices in the international markets. The ICE Coal Futures price has dipped by 35% in the past one year to $62.5 per tonne. For Coal India, however, fixed-price fuel supply agreements with power producers will help cushion the fall in international coal prices. But the e-auction price could get impacted.
Another overhang is the continuous supply of Coal India paper due to the government’s disinvestment programme. Its public shareholding has increased from 21% in June 2018 to about 29% in June 2019.
The government’s recent tax cut could, however, improve its earnings marginally this year. Coal India paid the full rate of tax last year of about 35%. However, note that its tax liabilities will depend on wage revisions and the quantum of losses, if any, in some of its subsidiaries. Much also would depend on how production picks up for the rest of the year.
“We have reduced our effective tax rate for Coal India to 30% (from 35% previously) resulting in a 7% upward revision in earnings, though off-set by lower volume expectations of 2% for FY2020E from 4% previously,"" said Kotak Institutional Securities in a report to clients.
Valuations are currently hovering around 6.5 times its trailing 12 months earnings. Still, there is a huge overhang on the Coal India stock, notwithstanding a dividend yield of about 12%.
Any recovery in its stock price will hinge on production picking up considerably, as well as higher coal prices. That seems hard to come by in the near future."
24,2019-10-07,Coal India,"GMR Kamalanga Energy has a 1,050 megawatt operational coal-based power plant located at Kamalanga Village in Dhenkanal district of Odisha It has fuel linkages with Mahanadi Coal Fields, a subsidiary of Coal India Ltd, and a long-term power purchase agreement with Grid Corporation of Odisha

Mumbai: Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Energy Ltd, on Monday, said it has entered into exclusive talks with GMR Energy Ltd for buying out its thermal power plant GMR Kamalanga Energy Ltd.
“Both parties intend to conclude these discussions in an expeditious manner,"" JSW Energy said in a filing with stock exchanges, without giving any further details.
Located in Dhenkanal district of Odisha, GMR Kamalanga Energy is a 1050 megawatt (MW) coal based power plant that has fuel linkages with Mahanadi Coal Fields, one of the major coal producing subsidiaries of Coal India Ltd. The plant is strategically located close to the coal belt and has a 15% untied capacity to benefit from the merchant market, according to the company’s website.
The plant also has a long term power purchase agreement with Grid Corporation of Odisha, Uttar Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam, as well as Bihar State Electricity Board.
For the quarter ended 30 June, the Kamalanga plant had sales of  ₹554.3 crore, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of  ₹171 crore and losses of  ₹33 crore.
The development comes as the GMR Group is monetizing its assets in road and power sectors to reduce its debt. While the net debt of GMR Infrastructure Ltd. (GIL) stood at  ₹22,520 crore, its energy business (excluding the under construction Bajoli Holi Project) comprised  ₹8,400 crore of GIL’s debt, as of 30 June.
In August, Adani Power acquired 52.38% stake in GMR Chhattisgarh Energy Ltd from its consortium of lenders at an enterprise valuation of about  ₹3,530 crore. The plant owns and operates a 1,370 MW (2 X 685 MW) power plant at Raikheda village in Raipur.
In May, GIL got lenders’ approval for its debt resolution plan for the natural gas-based power plant subsidiary GMR Rajahmundry Energy Ltd. (GREL) with the IDBI Bank-led consortium of lenders. GMR Rajahmundry Energy operates a 768 MW natural gas-based power plant at Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh.
GMR Energy is a joint venture between GMR Group and Tenaga Nasional Berhad, wherein GMR Group holds a 52% stake, while Tenaga holds 30%. Tenaga is listed on Bursa Malaysia."

22,2019-10-14,Coal India,"For the fourth straight month, coal dispatches to the power sector have fallen in Aug, hitting thermal plants’ inventoriesEven as NTPC fully commercializes the new plants, red flags are emerging regarding its running plants

Over the past month, shares of NTPC Ltd have remained powerless, down about 7%. The company said last week that it added 1,320 megawatts (MW), which takes it closer to its annual capacity target of 5,000MW. The capacity additions augur well, though, and the firm’s regulated business model assures a fixed return on invested equity.
Still, the stock’s lacklustre reaction implies investor concerns about earnings. As pointed out in previous columns, NTPC’s earnings have in recent years barely kept pace with capacity additions.
Fuel security for one of the newly added plants (Unit-1 of the Khargone super thermal power station) depends on a production ramp-up at one of NTPC’s captive mines, points out Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd. If production does not scale up, the company will have to secure coal from other mines that are not so close.
In fact, even as NTPC fully commercializes the new plants, red flags are emerging regarding its running plants. Production at Coal India Ltd, the biggest producer of the fuel, has been hit by protracted rains. Production in September plummeted 23.5% from a year ago. In the six months to September this year, coal production was down 6%.
The drop in production has affected dispatches to the power sector. In August, for the fourth consecutive month, coal dispatches to the power sector have fallen, points out Elara Capital (India) Pvt. Ltd. The shrinking dispatches have been reducing coal inventories at thermal power plants, though the situation is not yet alarming.
Analysts fear that falling output at Coal India and dispatches to the power sector may hurt NTPC. Apart from impacting power plant utilization levels, insufficient coal can weigh on fuel availability at power plants. This fall in plant availability beyond a certain level impacts the incentive income of NTPC.
Recent data from the Central Electricity Authority shows a notable reduction in utilization and availability levels at NTPC’s power plants in August. Also, generation fell sharply (down 8%), though it is not yet clear how much of this is due to seasonal factors such as maintenance shutdowns.
If the trend in September continues beyond the current month, it would have a noticeable impact on the company’s earnings. “NTPC’s Q2 FY20 earnings may be subdued owing to lower coal stocks at its pithead plants given muted supply by Coal India. However, NTPC is planning to import around 2-2.5 million tons of coal even for its pit-head stations, etc., to avoid plant availability under-recovery in Q3 FY20. Thus, for the Corporation’s Q3 FY20 profit growth, coal supply growth (from Coal India) and imports are key monitorable,"" analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd said in a note."
21,2019-10-15,Coal India,"So far, only 59 nations have signalled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action planIndia’s per capita power consumption, about 1149 kilowatt-hour, is among the lowest in the world

New Delhi: India on Tuesday called for a reset on climate debate on coal as a fuel, in the backdrop of India becoming one of the top renewable energy producers globally with ambitious capacity expansion plans.
India’s position was articulated by power and renewable energy minister Raj Kumar Singh; commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal and coal and mines minister Prahlad Joshi at the India Energy Forum by CERAWEEK.
“The debate about coal needs to be restated or restructured. One should talk about emissions not not coal production. This whole premise needs to be re examined,"" said Raj Kumar Singh.
This comes in the backdrop of India’s growing requirement of energy as the National Democratic Alliance government has set a goal of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024. India’s per capita power consumption, about 1149 kilowatt-hour (kWh), is among the lowest in the world. In comparison, the world’s per capita consumption is 3600 kWh.
“It must be recognised that India has its own growth imperatives. The US today consumes twice of what India consumes even today,"" said Goyal.
India’s coal requirement is expected to go up to 1123 million tonnes (mt) by 2023 from the present levels of around 700 mt. The earlier plan was to mine 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020. Of this, one billion tonnes was to come from state run Coal India Ltd and 500 million tonnes from non-Coal India sources in line with the government’s push to raise natural resources production and kickstart economic growth.
India plans to reduce its carbon footprint by 33-35% from its 2005 levels by 2030, as part of its commitments to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change adopted by 195 countries in Paris in 2015.
India has reaffirmed its commitment even as the US withdrew from the Paris climate deal.
Of India’s installed capacity of 360, 456.37 MW, 54% or 195,809.50 MW is coal-fuelled. With India’s demand for electricity expected to exponentially increase, coal-powered generation will remain the mainstay in its energy mix. India is also planning to set up a bulk of its capacity on supercritical and advanced ultra-supercritical equipment, which are more efficient.
“For next 25-30 years to meet India’s energy needs, coal is needed,"" Joshi said and added, “Keeping environment in mind, we need to produce coal.""
This comes at a time when the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government has been trying to attract investments in the backdrop of the Indian economy battling a severe demand slowdown and liquidity crunch that resulted in the growth rate slowing to 5% in the three months ended June.
Explaining India’s position, Singh said, “No other country has increased renewable energy capacity the way we have done it,"" and added “Our concern to environment is second to none.""
India has been trying to rejig its energy mix in favour of green energy sources and has an installed renewable energy capacity of about 82,580MW, with about 31,150MW under execution. India is running the world’s largest renewable energy programme, with plans to achieve 175GW by 2022 and 500GW by 2030, as part of its climate commitments.
“We have laid down very stringent norms for our coal plants,"" Singh said.
So far, only 59 nations have signalled their intention to submit an enhanced climate action plan, and an additional nine have started an internal process to boost ambition and have this reflected in their national plans.
As per UN estimates, the world would need to increase its efforts five-fold to contain climate change to a 1.5°C rise at most. Any temperature rise beyond that would lead to major and irreversible damage. India on its part has maintained that it is doing its best to mitigate and adapt to climate change, but climate finance remains a concern.
“Providing power to all is the mandate. Having said that we are equally concerned about the environment issues as well,"" Joshi said."

NEW DELHI :
In what will help supply fuel to coal fueled power projects, a key railway link for moving coal from Chattisgarh mines has become operational, according to state owned Coal India Ltd (CIL).
“A 44-km long new railway line in Chhattisgarh under East Rail Corridor from Kharsia to Korichapar turned operational on 12th October which enables evacuation of coal from Mand-Raigarh and Korba coalfields of South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL), the largest coal producing subsidiary of Coal India Limited,"" CIL, the world’s largest coal miner said in a statement.
The critical rail link is part of the government’s plan of improving India’s coal connectivity and will help add incremental freight traffic to the railways. Coal accounts for around 65% of the freight moved by the national carrier. Of India’s installed capacity of 360,456.37 MW, 54% or 195,809.50 MW is coal-fueled.
“All the three important rail lines that CIL has been persistently pursuing have now materialized, that is, Jharsuguda-Sardega under MCL in Odisha, Tori-Shivpur under CCL in Jharkhad and Kharsia-Korichapar under SECL in Chattisgarh,"" the statement added.
These rail links will help evaluate coal from; North Karanpura in Jharkhand, lb-valley in Odisha and Mand-Raigarh in Chhattisgarh. India’s coal requirement is expected to go up to 1123 million tonnes (mt) by 2023 from the present levels of around 700 mt. The earlier plan was to mine 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020. Of this, one billion tonnes was to come from state run Coal India Ltd and 500 million tonnes from non-Coal India sources in line with the government’s push to raise natural resources production and kickstart economic growth.
“SECL is expected to play a lead role in Coal India’s 1 Billion Tonne coal production aspiration by 2025-26 with a contribution of around 26% at 262 Million Tonnes,"" the statement added.
With India’s demand for electricity expected to exponentially increase, coal-powered generation will remain the mainstay in its energy mix. India’s per capita power consumption, about 1149 kilowatt-hour (kWh), is among the lowest in the world. In comparison, the world’s per capita consumption is 3600 kWh. This comes in the backdrop of India’s growing requirement of energy as the National Democratic Alliance government has set a goal of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024.
“East Rail Corridor is developed by Chattisgarh East Railway Limited (CERL), a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) between SECL, Government of Chattisgarh and IRCON International Limited with a war chest of Rs. 3,055 Crores for laying down a 136 Km. rail line from Kharsia – Korichapar – Dharamjaygarh - Korba. While SECL holds a stake of 64% in this tri-partite SPV, Chattisgarh government and IRCON pitches in with 10% and 26% stakes respectively,"" the statement added."
19,2019-10-30,Coal India,"All-India electricity demand growth slowed down to 4.4% in the first six months of FY2020A lack of interest in acquiring stressed thermal assets comes at a time when thermal PLFs are falling

Only 10% of the 40GW of financially distressed coal power plants have been able to resolve their outstanding debt, an analysis by credit rating agency ICRA shows. Besides this, the resolution of 12 GW of gas-based capacity continues to remain uncertain, given the inadequate availability of domestic gas.
“The resolution of stressed thermal assets remains slow despite the various measures undertaken by the government and lenders, with only about 10% of the 40 GW stressed coal-based capacity achieving resolution, mainly through acquisition by a new sponsor,"" the report by ICRA said. “The balance capacity is under various stages of resolution, including through Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). In natural gas, the absence of any policy measures for use of imported R-LNG (re-gasified liquefied natural gas) with subsidy support makes the resolution for the sector uncertain.""
All-India electricity demand growth slowed down to 4.4% in the first six months of FY2020, from 6.0% growth witnessed in the corresponding period of previous year. This, coupled with healthy growth in generation from hydro, nuclear and renewable sources in the first six months of FY20, resulted in a decline in all-India thermal PLF (plant load factor) to 57.7% from 59.5% in 6M FY2019. The supply of coal to the power sector by Coal India Ltd also declined by 7% in the first half of the fiscal on a year-on-year basis, because of lower production and due to an extended monsoon season and the labour issues, the note said.
Girishkumar Kadam, Sector Head & Vice President, ICRA Ratings, said in the report: “The progress on stressed asset resolution (in the thermal sector) remains slow, because of the time taken to achieve sustainable resolution, regulatory challenges in securing approvals for projects with existing competitively bid-based power purchase agreements (PPAs), still limited progress in signing of new long-term PPAs and subdued thermal capacity utilization levels. Also, the improvement in the discoms’ financial position on all-India level remained lower than expected, which can hamper the sustainability of demand growth and signing of new long-term PPAs.""
A lack of interest in acquiring stressed thermal assets comes at a time when thermal PLFs are falling. The decline in thermal PLF is a reversal of improvement witnessed over the past two years. The decline in PLF was sharpest for the central sector coal utilities from 70.8% in 6M FY2019 to 64.2% in 6M FY2020. Apart from energy demand growth, the increase in production and supply of domestic coal also remains critical to improve the thermal PLF level in the second half of FY2020 and thereafter, ICRA said."
18,2019-11-01,Coal India,"All infrastructure industries, barring fertilizers, contracted in SeptemberCoal performed the worst, its output shrinking 20.5% in Sep, compared to a 6.4% expansion a year ago

NEW DELHI :
The bad news on the Indian economy just got worse. The core infrastructure industries’ output—measuring a basket of eight sectors accounting for two-fifth of India’s factory output—contracted to the lowest in at least 14 years, pointing to a deepening industrial slowdown.
The gauge contracted by 5.2% in September from a growth of 4.3% in the year- ago period, according to data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Thursday.
The development strengthens the case for the central bank to continue its monetary stimulus, experts said. With inflation likely to remain within the central bank’s target range in the near term, another rate cut in the December monetary policy review is a near certainty, said Sunil Kumar Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings.
“Such a low growth in core sector industries has not been witnessed so far in either the 2011-12 base or the 2004-05 base series. This clearly indicates the severity of the ongoing industrial slowdown,"" said Sinha.
Barring fertilizers, where the output improved by 5.4% in September, the other seven infrastructure industries witnessed a contraction. Coal was the worst performer on account of an extended monsoon, a surge in renewable energy supply and labour issues at state-run Coal India Ltd. Output contracted by 20.5% in September, compared to an 8.6% decline in the previous month and a 6.4% expansion in the year-ago period. Coal also accounts for a substantial share of the freight moved by the Indian Railways and the country’s power generation capacity. Of India’s installed capacity of 360 gigawatts, 54% is coal-fuelled.
Data showed that production of key primary sources of energy such as crude oil and coal as well as refined petroleum products and electricity took a beating.
Energy consumption, especially electricity and refinery products, is usually linked to overall demand in the economy. State-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) on Thursday reported an 83% drop in its second quarter profit at  ₹564 crore on the back of a slump in refinery margins and inventory losses.
IOC chairman Sanjiv Singh said diesel consumption grew by around 1% in the first six months of the current fiscal. This comes amid the worst slump in almost two decades in the automobile sector.
Earlier this month, official data showed that industrial output had contracted 1.1% in August, its worst performance in 26 months. India’s economic growth rate had slowed down to a more than five-year low of 5% in the June quarter.
The Narendra Modi administration has taken a series of steps to reverse the trend, including a cut in the corporate tax rate in September from 30% to 22% for companies not availing of any tax breaks and from 25% to 15% for new manufacturers.
On a cumulative basis for the first half of the fiscal too, the performance of the eight core sectors remained dismal, with a growth of 1.3% as against 5.5% during the corresponding period a year ago.
Experts agreed that seven out of the eight core industries showing a contraction was a worrying signal, but said the trend could be reversed in a few months.
“Electricity demand is linked to factory output. An improvement in industrial production will lead to a turnaround in electricity generation,"" said Debasish Mishra, partner at Deloitte India. “We expect a reversal of this trend by the middle of next year on account of the steps the government has taken so far.""
Data showed that crude oil production contracted 5.4% in September in continuation of the trend for the last one year, while natural gas output contracted for the sixth month on the trot in September to 4.9%. Electricity output contracted 3.7% in September, its second straight month of contraction. Cement production contracted 2.1% in September, indicating the continued weakness in construction activities. Refinery products contracted 6.7% in September after a 2.6% growth in the previous month. Fertilizer output showed steady growth for the fourth month to 5.4% in September. Steel output marginally shrank by 0.3% in September from a growth of 5.1% in the previous month.
India’s coal requirement is forecast to go up to 1,123 million tonnes (mt) by 2023 from the present level of around 700mt, in line with the government’s push to raise natural resources production and boost economic growth."
17,2019-11-05,Coal India,"In October, coal production was about 28% higher than September, while dispatches rose around 15%Even as production has improved sequentially, it’s still about 21% lower than the year-ago period

After five consecutive months of decline in output, Coal India Ltd’s latest production figures came as a relief for investors. In October, coal production was about 28% higher than September, while dispatches rose around 15%. The news sent shares of Coal India up 3.8% on Monday. The stock gained about 14% in the past one month, though it slipped 1.6% in early trade today.
Erratic and unprecedented monsoon led to persistent contraction in production figures in the past few months, while flooding caused outage at some of its mines. However, with October production up about 9 million tonnes month-on-month, it seems like the worst is behind for Coal India. Besides, its subsidiary Northern Coalfields Limited posted highest mining volumes.
Analysts say, with the monsoon season now over, the fall in production has halted. “In our view, volume woes are likely over due to a stable demand outlook and improved rake availability,"" said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a recent note to clients.
Investors would do well to note that even as production has improved sequentially, it’s still about 21% lower than the year-ago period. Offtake also remains 19% lower year-on-year.
As such, Coal India has much to do to catch up on production if it has to meet its FY20 target. In this fiscal so far, coal production has been about 280 mt. The company had set a target of 650 mt for FY20. Back-of-the-envelope calculations show Coal India will have to produce about 73.6 mt a month against the current production rate of 40 mt over the next five months to hit its target, a tall order.
Not surprisingly, analysts have lowered coal production estimates for FY20. “Ahead, we expect lower volumes though FY20 offtake is likely to be constrained at 595-600 mt,"" said Edelweiss.
However, the demand outlook is improving with production infrastructure such as rake availability looking better. This gives the company greater earnings-growth assurance for FY21. For this financial year, however, analysts have cut back earnings and expect it to be lower than FY19. This could prove to be an overhang on the stock. It may still have the benefit of lower valuations on its side, trading as it does at a price-to-earnings multiple of about 7.7 times FY20 estimated earnings."

New Delhi: Thermal coal imports declined by 17.69% to 51.10 million tonnes at the country's top 12 major ports during April-October this fiscal, latest Indian Ports Association report has said.
The Centre-owned ports had handled 62.08 MT of the thermal coal in the same period previous year.
The Indian Ports Association (IPA), which maintains cargo data handled by these 12 ports, in its recent report said ""percentage variation from previous year"" in thermal coal handling was at 17.69%.
As far as coking and other coal is concerned, its handling recorded a rise of 6.88% at 33.43 MT during the seven months period.
These ports had handled 31.28 MT of coking coal in the corresponding period last fiscal.
Thermal coal is the mainstay of India's energy programme as 70% of power generation is dependent on the dry fuel, while coking coal is used mainly for steel-making.
Earlier, mjunction services -- a B2B e-commerce joint venture between Tata Steel and SAIL -- has reported 9.3% rise in India's coal imports to 126.91 million tonnes (MT) in the first six months of current fiscal.
The provisional compilation by mjunction is based on monitoring of vessels' positions and data received from shipping companies.
The country had imported 116.04 MT of coal in April-September period of 2018-19, according to mjunction - which publishes research reports on coal and steel verticals.
""On a progressive basis (April-September 2019) (provisional), total coal and coke imports were recorded at 126.91 MT, which is 9.36% higher than 116.04 MT imported for the same period (April-September 2018) last year,"" it had said.
India is the third-largest producer of coal after China and the US and has 299 billion tonnes of resources and 123 billion tonnes of proven reserves, which may last for over 100 years.
India has 12 major ports Kandla, Mumbai, JNPT, Marmugao, New Mangalore, Cochin, Chennai, Kamarajar (Ennore), V O Chidambarnar, Visakhapatnam, Paradip and Kolkata (including Haldia) which handle approximately 61% of the country's total cargo traffic.

NEW DELHI :
Key macroeconomic numbers are likely to drive stock in a holiday-shortened week ahead as quarterly earnings season is almost coming to an end and the Ayodhya verdict unlikely to have any major impact on overall investor sentiments, according to analysts.
Equity markets will be closed on Tuesday for ""Gurunanak Jayanti"".
Industrial production data on Monday, inflation rate on Tuesday and WPI inflation on Thursday would be keenly watched by market participants amid economic slowdown concerns.
Coal India Ltd, Hindalco Industries and NMDC are among the major companies set to announce their earnings this week.
Santosh Meena, Senior Analyst at TradingBells, said Ayodhya verdict would not have any impact on equity market until any social unrest arise in the country.
""It could have sentimental positive impact for incumbent BJP government. Otherwise, it won't have any major impact on the political front as well.
""Market is in bullish momentum where this momentum will continue,"" Meena added.
In one of the most important and much-awaited judgements in India's history, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi put an end to over a century-old dispute that has torn the social fabric of the nation.
The apex court said the mosque should be built at a ""prominent site"", allotted either by the Centre or the Uttar Pradesh government, and a trust should be set up within three months to build the temple at the site that, many Hindus believe, Lord Ram was born.
""Equity markets which are trading near all-time highs will be facing two important data this week which can act as a catalyst for an upside breakout or further pressure,"" Mustafa Nadeem, CEO of Epic Research said.

Besides, trend in rupee-dollar, crude oil and investment pattern by overseas investors will also be crucial for markets, they added.
Equity benchmark BSE Sensex tumbled 330 points on Friday after Moody's Investors Service cut the country's credit rating outlook to negative.
During the last week, the Sensex advanced 158.58 points or 0.39 per cent.
""While the lowering of rating outlook is negative, we believe that the government has been trying to stimulate growth... Government has taken various measures including one of the boldest reforms in the form of corporate tax cut,"" Siddhartha Khemka, Head of Retail Research at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Private Ltd, said.
He noted that these measures would take time to work on the ground and that the near term concern is on the fiscal front, with lower tax incomes and higher spending leading to a ballooning deficit."

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Monday:
Britannia: The fast-moving consumer goods company will announce its earnings for the quarter ended September today. Investors will watch this space as the company had missed the Street’s estimate in April-June amid consumption slowdown in the country. Britannia Industries Ltd, the maker of Good Day and Tiger biscuits, had posted a 3.5% year-on-year fall in net profit in the June quarter to  ₹249 crore.
Motherson Sumi: The auto component maker will release its earnings for the quarter ended September today. Last week, Moody's Investors Service had downgraded the rating outlook of the company to negative from stable due to slowing global auto sales leading to its weak financial performance. Shares have also been under pressure due to uncertainty around Brexit.
Yes Bank: The bank has lent over  ₹2,000 crore to several companies linked to Indiabulls Group that either have negative net worth or an average equity capital of  ₹1 lakh, an affidavit filed by Citizens Whistle Blower Forum in the Delhi High Court said. According to the documents submitted by the NGO as part of the affidavit, the private lender loaned  ₹2,183 crore to eight unlisted firms of Indiabulls Group.
IOC: The ministry of environment has granted clearance to Indian Oil Corporation Ltd to set up a 2G ethanol plant worth  ₹766 crore in Haryana’s Panipat district. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar announced the news on micro-blogging website Twitter. The minister said the plant will not only promote the use of environment-friendly fuel but also help in doubling farmers’ income.
Coal India: The state-owned coal mining company will report its earnings for the quarter ended September today. Another company in the metal and mining sector Hindalco Industries Ltd will also announce its numbers for July-September. Shares of companies in the sector, including that of Tata Steel Ltd and JSW Steel Ltd, are on the rise due to optimism over a trade deal between the US and China.
BPCL: The state-run fuel retailer on Friday clarified that it has not received any official communication from the government about a plan to sell its 53.3% stake. Investors have cheered news reports on privatisation of the firm. According to a Mint report, Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Kuwait Petroleum, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total SA and Abu Dhabi National Oil Company have had talks with the Centre regarding the matter.
Eicher Motors: The manufacture of Royal Enfield brand of premium motorcycles on Friday reported a 4.4% year-on-year rise in net profit for the September quarter to  ₹573 crore led by a reduction in corporate tax rate. This despite the company’s revenue having declined in the said quarter. The government had in September slashed corporate tax rate to 22% from 30%.
Aurobindo Pharma: The pharmaceutical company on Friday said it is making progress on its acquisition of dermatology and genetics operations of Sandoz amid concerns that the deal was being held up due to certain queries sought by the US Federal Trade Commission. The company, however, did not give details about the negotiations with the anti-trust watchdog.
Bank of Baroda: The bank, after market hours on Friday, reported a five-fold jump in net profit to  ₹736 crore for the quarter ended September due to higher other income. The public-sector bank’s other income was buoyed by trading gains of  ₹942 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal compared with  ₹138 crore a year ago.
IDBI Bank: The state-owned lender on Friday said its net loss narrowed to  ₹3,458.8 crore on the back of higher net interest income, other income and fall in provisions for bad loans. The bank had posted a net loss of  ₹3,602.5 crore a year ago. Earlier this year, Life Insurance Company acquired a 51% controlling stake in the bank, which now operates as the subsidiary of the insurer."
13,2019-11-11,Coal India,"Shares of Britannia, Coal India and Hindalco will be in focus as the companies will announce their Q2 results todayAsian shares edged higher on Monday on trade talk optimism between the US and China

Mumbai: Stock markets may continue to keep their momentum intact on Monday following firm global cues. Last week markets consolidated, barring Friday when investors rushed to sell shares due to concerns after rating agency Moody's lowered India's outlook.
Asian shares edged higher on Monday after US President Donald Trump said over the weekend that trade talks with China were moving along ""very nicely"", though uncertainty remained over whether a deal would be signed this year.
Japan's Nikkei was up 0.2% to inch closer to a recent 13-month high. Australian shares rose 0.5% to a two-week high while South Korea's KOSPI was off 0.2%. That left MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan firmer at 534.63, testing a recent six-month peak.
Trump told reporters on Saturday that talks with China had moved more slowly than he would have liked, but added that Beijing wanted a deal more than he did. That was a more upbeat tone than just a few days earlier when Trump stressed that the White House would not agree to a full rollback of existing tariffs, remarks that hit stock prices and the dollar.
By the close of Wall Street on Friday, optimism had returned to the market as investors bet that Washington needs a deal and it is in the interests of China, too. All three major US indices eked out record closing highs. The Dow inched up a tad while the S&P 500 climbed 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.5%. The record closing high by the S&P 500 was the fourth in six sessions as US stocks rallied on hopes of a trade deal.
The US officials said a lot of work remained to be done when Trump announced the outlines of an interim deal last month, and Beijing has since pushed back on US’ demands for big agricultural purchases, among other issues.
Analysts said the outlook for equities was highly dependent on US economic data as a US-China trade agreement would help bolster manufacturing and industrial sectors.
Data on October US industrial production and retail sales, along with the National Federation of Independent Business's monthly small business survey, are scheduled for release this week.
Back home, markets regulator has written to the finance ministry over its recent circular tagging foreign-controlled mutual funds as investment vehicles, two people familiar with the matter said. The regulator’s intervention comes amid fears that the new rules could force several equity asset managers to freeze investment activity and even sell their holdings. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) made its representation after mutual funds made their case to the regulator. The anomaly arising from the circular is that retail domestic money invested in the schemes of foreign-owned mutual funds will be counted as foreign money.
Shares of Britannia Industries, Coal India and Hindalco Industries will be in focus as the companies will announce their September quarter earnings result today.
Reflecting growing economic optimism, the benchmark 10-year US treasury yield moved well off its early September lows, and the yield curve between 3-month bills and 10-year notes steepened.
Safe haven gold was near a three-month low touched on Friday after posting its biggest weekly decline in a year. It was last up a touch at 1460.77 an ounce.
Benchmark Brent crude fell 9 cents to $62.42 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude slipped 10 cents to $57.14 a barrel.
In currencies, action was muted with the dollar index mostly flat at 98.346 as was the euro at $1.1023. The Japanese yen held at 109.19, while the Australian dollar remained stuck at $0.6859.

12,2019-11-11,Coal India,"Seshan played a key role in changing the way the poll body functionedDuring his six years in office, politics in India was undergoing a major change and coalition politics had just started to take shape

NEW DELHI :
Tirunellai Narayana Iyer Seshan or TN Seshan, the election commissioner of India who transformed the way polls were conducted and contested in the country passed away on Sunday night in Chennai. He was 86.
Seshan played a key role in changing the way the poll body functioned, and was instrumental in implementing the model code of conduct to curb booth capturing and bogus voting which were considered normal before he took charge as the 10th Election Commissioner of India on 12 December, 1990.
The former civil servant remained at the top post till 11 December, 1996. During his six years in office, politics in India was undergoing a major change and coalition politics had just started to take shape. The tenure of Seshan was also interesting because it was during the early 1990s when caste and religion decided politics and elections. Before becoming the election commissioner, Seshan was the 18th cabinet secretary of India.
""TN Seshan was an outstanding civil servant. He served India with utmost diligence and integrity. His efforts towards electoral reforms have made our democracy stronger and more participative. Pained by his demise. Om Shanti,"" tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
During his term, Seshan witnessed implementation of the Mandal Commission, giving reservation to other backward classes (OBCs) in government jobs, demolition of Babri Masjid and the entire Ram Janamabhoomi movement. These developments dominated politics and elections in India for nearly a decade.
Born in the Palakkad district of Kerala on 15 December 1932, Seshan joined the Madras Christian College for a Bachelors degree in Physics. He joined the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) in 1955. The former EC was also awarded the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award in 1996 for his contribution in government administration.
During his tenure, India had four prime ministers -- Chandra Shekhar, PV Narsimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpyee and HD Deve Gowda. During this time, the government introduced the concept of a three-member election commission headed by a chief election commissioner.
""TN Seshan has passed away in Chennai. He was my father’s classmate at VictoriaCollege Palakkad — a courageous &crusty boss who asserted the Election Commission’s autonomy& authority as no CEC before him had done. A pillar of our democracy,"" tweeted Shashi Tharoor, former union minister and senior leader of Congress."

New Delhi: State-run Coal India on Monday reported a 14 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at  ₹3,522.7 crore for the quarter ended September.
The company's net profit stood at  ₹3,084.54 crore in the year-ago period, it said in a regulatory filing.
Its total income, however, declined to  ₹22,012.94 crore in the July-September quarter of financial year 2019-20 from  ₹23,486.35 crore in the corresponding period of previous fiscal.
Despite the fall in total income, Coal India's net profit increased as its tax outgo declined significantly to  ₹754.25 crore from  ₹2,031.71 crore in the year-ago quarter.

10,2019-11-13,Coal India,"Realizations on coal sold via fuel supply agreement route have risen by nearly 10% over the same period last yearFSA realization at  ₹1,438 per tonne, is the highest-ever on sharpening focus on non-power consumers, said analysts

Nobody expected the moon from Coal India Ltd’s September quarter results. A key reason was that its production was hit last quarter by extended monsoon in certain regions, besides labour strikes. Production and offtake (or sales volume) dropped 13% and 11% year-on-year, respectively.
Even as this was expected to cast a shadow on the coal miner’s performance, higher realizations from coal sold through the fuel supply agreement (FSA) route helped the company’s profit beat expectations. Plus, depreciation costs declined marginally and tax outgo was substantially lower, boosting net profit.
FSA realizations have increased by nearly 10% over the same period last year and 5% compared to the June quarter. FSA realization at  ₹1,438 per tonne, is the highest-ever on sharpening focus on non-power consumers, said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a report on 11 November. “FSA realisation is expected to sustain at the current level owing to change in product mix,"" they added.
Since FSA volumes account for a large share of Coal India’s volumes, better realizations helped partially compensate for the overall muted show on the volume front.
On the other hand, realizations from coal sold through the e-auction route, which typically follow global coal prices, declined by about 20% year-on-year. The upshot: the coal miner’s consolidated reported revenue declined by about 7% to  ₹20,383 crore. Net profit stood at  ₹3,524 crore, representing a 14% growth from the previous year.
The September quarter results may well put some fire into the Coal India stock, which is feeling rather unloved at the moment. So far this fiscal year, shares of the country’s largest coal producer have fallen by about 12% on the National Stock Exchange. This is at a time when the broader Nifty 100 index has risen by 2.2% during the same time frame.
Investors worry about government stake sales, say analysts. Plus, production and offtake over April-October 2019 have declined by 8.5% and 7% year-on-year, respectively. Growth revival in volumes along with better volume mix remains crucial for the Coal India stock. On the bright side, this year may turn out to be better on the dividend front.
“Considering H1FY20 capex of about  ₹2,000 crore, we believe bulk of the spending will be in H2FY20. In our view, while capex towards equipment is likely to be incurred, the one for land acquisition may be slightly delayed. On the other hand, cash balance of  ₹37,000 crore will enable Coal India to give healthy dividend in line with recent past at  ₹20 per share,"" pointed out analysts at Edelweiss."
9,2019-11-14,Coal India,"Out of the 5 lakh premature deaths, over 97,000 died after being exposed to pollutants from coal burning, said the Lancet Countdown report on health and climate change The impact of air pollution in India will worsen if the country does not shift from coal-based energy, said the report

NEW DELHI :
More than five lakh people died prematurely in India in 2016 due to dangerous levels of outdoor air pollution and over 97,000 of the them died after being exposed to pollutants from coal burning, a new report revealed on Thursday.
The Lancet Countdown 2019 on health and climate change also cautioned that the impact of air pollution in India will worsen if the country does not shift from coal-based energy.
It emphasised on rapidly decreasing coal use to zero, saying it was crucial to meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement.
""Total energy supply from coal increased by 11% in India from 2016 to 2018 and out of over 5.29 lakh premature deaths in 2016 due to dangerous levels of outdoor fine particulate air pollution (PM2.5), over 97,400 deaths were from coal.
""The energy landscape will have to change drastically, and nothing short of a 7.4% year-on-year cut in fossil carbon dioxide emissions from 2019 to 2050 will limit global warming to the more ambitious goal of 1.5 degree Celsius,"" the report, authored by 35 institutions worldwide, said.
It said coal phase-out is essential, not only as a key measure to mitigate climate change, but also to reduce morbidity and mortality from air pollution.
""Coal continues to be the second largest contributor to global primary energy supply (after oil) and the largest source of electricity generation (at 38%, compared with gas, the next highest at 23%),"" the report said, adding that most of the growth in total primary energy supply (TPES) of coal has been in Asia, notably China, India, and Southeast Asia.
Overall, carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels have risen by 2.6% from 2016 to 2018, the report said.
Another global study from Switzerland, held earlier this year, revealed that China and the US may be the largest producers of coal power, but power plants in India take the highest toll in the world when it comes to health as coal-fired power plants produce more than just carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming.
Coal burning also releases particulate matter, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury -- thus damaging the health of many people around the world.
According to Lancet, ""Concerningly, the previous downward trend in coal supply has reversed, with a 1.7% increase recorded in total primary energy supply from 2016 to 2018."" The report also talks about heatwaves limiting the labour capacity of various countries.
""Temperature rise and heatwaves are increasingly limiting the labour capacity of various populations. In 2018, 133.6 billion potential work hours were lost globally, 45 billion more than the 2000 baseline, and southern areas of the USA lost 15-20 per cent of potential daylight work hours during the hottest month of 2018,"" the report said.
The 2019 Lancet report presents an annual update of 41 indicators across five key domains: climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability; adaptation, planning, and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement.
The report represents the findings and consensus of 35 leading academic institutions and UN agencies from every continent."
8,2019-11-21,Coal India,"While Coal India commits itself to human rights practice, its delivery lacks

Business and human rights can be like oxygen for a better world as well as an oxymoron of the most cynical kind. This column has tracked both realities for several years, including the Corporate Human Rights Benchmark, or CHRB, that seeks to raise the oxy from the oxymoron, as it were. The group’s 2019 global ranking for 195 businesses is just out. Two Indian companies, Coal India Ltd and Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd, feature in the list that has over the year added ICT Manufacturing to its bouquet of Agricultural Products, Extractives and Apparels.
In the 2017 pilot ranking, Coal India and ONGC came in at the lowest score band of below 10% across all parameters among 98 publicly traded companies around the world in agricultural products, apparels and extractives, the sectors that account for some of the worst human rights offences and offenders.
In 2018, with more publicly traded businesses ranked, Coal India scored in the 20-30% band while ONGC remained in the 0-10% band. In the 2019 rankings, Coal India has retained the band, and ONGC has moved up to the 10-20% band. Coal India’s band-mates include ArcelorMittal, McDonald’s, LafargeHolcim, Nokia, Walmart Inc., Exxon Mobil, and Hugo Boss. ONGC keeps company with other human rights laggards like Macy’s, Siam Cement, Posco, Amazon.com, LVMH, Yum! Brands, Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren. The ranking is available on CHRB’s website.
CHRB is a collaboration that now includes the Institute for Human Rights and Business, the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (both UK-based), Aviva Investors, VBDO (The Dutch Association of Investors for Sustainable Development), Eiris Foundation (which, like VBDO focuses on advising responsible investment), Stockholm-based Nordea Wealth Management, and the Netherlands’ APG Asset Management. Steve Waygood, Aviva’s chief responsible investment officer, chairs CHRB.
Governance and policy are given a score out of 10, “Embedding Respect and Human Rights Due Diligence"" is scored out of 25, remedy and grievance mechanisms top out at 15, the categories of “Performance: Company Human Rights Practices"" and “Performance: Responses to Serious Allegations"" are both at 20, and transparency is scored on a maximum of 10.
It may not surprise observers of human rights practices that while Coal India commits itself to human rights practice, its delivery lacks. There is abysmal display as to remedy, stakeholder engagement, and “zero tolerance"" for attacks on human rights defenders. The company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Policy “is overseen by the Corporate Social Responsibility/Sustainable Development Committee,"" notes CHRB. “However, this policy does not specify any human rights."" The aspect of human rights is also publicly absent in relation to the company’s business partners. “Not met,"" CHRB continues, to human rights “risks"" being “integrated as part of enterprise risk system Score"" and “Not met: Audit Ctte [Committee] or independent risk assessment."" Neither are personnel—regular and security—briefed or trained in human rights practices, nor are there indications as to “monitoring"" and “corrective actions"", according to CHRB.
Coal India also refrains from identifying human rights risks in its own operations. And, while it offers channels for “grievance mechanisms"", there is little indication of remedy or transparency. “Not met"" is a far more frequent comment in the assessment than “Met"".
And ONGC, whose assessment in the CHRB ranking is also publicly available, is in a band lower than Coal India’s, and fully 10 points behind Coal India’s overall score of 27.4%.
It’s hardly a matter of joy that these two businesses have some of the best-known names in the world for company. Indeed, it’s an abysmal picture overall. Of the 57 companies listed under Agricultural Products, only seven score over 50%, and none above 80%. In the Apparels segment, of 54 listed, only seven score above 50%. Extractives have 11 companies out of 56 scoring above 50%. And ICT Manufacturing, the newest segment on the block, none out of 40 score above 50%. More than half the companies in every segment account for the 0-30% band. “The CHRB scores reflect the market failures around human rights where some companies rely on business models and practices that abuse people’s rights and avoid scrutiny and accountability,"" Phil Bloomer, executive director of the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre and a board member of CHRB, declared in a statement.
A future column will discuss what businesses that score well seem to be doing right.
This column focuses on conflict situations and the convergence of businesses and human rights and runs on Thursdays."

SBI Cards and Payment Services Ltd, the credit card unit of the country’s largest lender, on Wednesday, filed initial share sale documents that could see the company sell shares worth around  ₹9,600 crore.
The share sale is poised to become the fifth-largest IPO in the country after Coal India Ltd, Reliance Power Ltd, GIC Re, and Oil and Natural Gas Corp and will help parent State Bank of India (SBI) raise funds to boost credit growth.
SBI, which holds 74% stake in the unit, along with private equity firm Carlyle Group, which holds the rest 26% through its subsidiary CA Rover Holdings, will together sell 130.5 million shares through the IPO.
“The secondary component of the IPO could be  ₹9,100 crore and will give a partial exit to both its shareholders. While Carlyle is looking to sell 10% stake via the IPO, SBI would sell 4% stake in the company,"" two people aware of the matter said, requesting anonymity.
The company is looking to list within the next 3-4 months at a pre-money valuation of  ₹65,000 crore, one of the two people said.
The initial share sale also includes a fresh issue of shares that will see the company raise  ₹500 crore to augment its capital base and for business growth.
“The secondary markets have seen bit of a recovery and that has also spurred some activity in the IPO market. But the positive response is still restricted to good quality companies that have a retail consumer franchise. Many small-cap companies are still finding it tough to get the desired pricing. That said, in the past nine months, the sentiment was really negative and IPO activity was consequently very slow, but it is likely to see some pickup in the coming quarters,"" said Mukund Ranganathan, executive director at Motilal Oswal Investment Banking.
The book running lead merchants to the issue are Axis Capital, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC, Nomura, Kotak Mahindra Capital and SBI Capital.
SBI Cards is the second-largest credit card issuer in the country with 9.46 million credit cards, and had a 18% share of the Indian credit card market as on 30 September. The company started operations in 1998 as a joint venture with GE Capital Corp. In December 2017, GE Capital sold its 40% stake in the company to SBI and Carlyle.
HDFC Bank has the largest credit cards business in the country with 13.3 million cards issued, while ICICI Bank stood third with 7.9 million credit cards, as of 30 September, according to data from the Reserve Bank of India.
For the six months to September, SBI Cards reported a revenue jump of 36% to  ₹4,363.9 crore from a year ago. Its profit jumped 78% to  ₹1,034.58 crore during the period."
6,2019-12-04,Coal India,"With volumes in e-auction sluggish and the immediate outlook for long-term sales not encouraging, analysts are paring down their expectationsFalling electricity generation is reducing the need for fuel

Production and sales picked up for Coal India Ltd in October and November, after several months of decline, growing 15-27% on a month-on-month basis.
Comparatively, production and offtake during the first half of the fiscal year was impacted by the prolonged monsoon and flooding at some of the company’s mines. The dry weather conditions during the winter months should help Coal India keep up the production momentum.
However, the weather brings limited cheer to investors. The stock has gained 6% since 1 October, more or less similar to the rise in the Nifty 500 index. What gives?
Clouding the outlook is weak demand from the power sector, which consumed 81% of the fuel produced by Coal India in FY19. Tracking the low demand from customers, power producers are limiting purchases from the company. While Coal India’s sales grew by an impressive 17% in November, month-on-month, volumes fell 7.6% from the year-ago levels.
Falling electricity generation is reducing the need for fuel. This is driving up inventories at thermal power plants. As on 1 December, power plants tracked by the Central Electricity Authority collectively had 15 days of fuel stock, up from 12 days in November and 8 days in December 2018.
The comfortable inventory levels provide no major reason for thermal power producers to stock up coal—something that otherwise would have been done after the monsoon.
“Coal offtake will now be a function of demand from power plants along with macroeconomic recovery as support from re-stocking demand would be limited,"" analysts at SBICAP Securities Ltd said in a note.
Adding to the concerns are subdued volumes and prices in the spot market.
According to SBICAP Securities, stable rates in global markets notwithstanding, the premium in Coal India’s e-auction has reduced considerably in October, implying weak demand from end users.
Apart from supplying coal through long-term agreements, the company also sells a portion of its produce in the spot market through the e-auction route, which generally fetches better realizations.
With volumes in e-auction sluggish and the immediate outlook for long-term sales not encouraging, analysts are paring down their expectations. Many on the Street doubt the company’s ability to achieve the 7-8% production growth target it had set for FY20, besides expecting a subdued earnings performance.
“We expect a lacklustre FY20E (volume expected to be down 3% YoY) on account of operating issues and inclement monsoon roiling Coal India’s plans for four months,"" analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note."
5,2019-12-11,Coal India,"Coal generation fell for a fourth month in November, the longest such streak in government data going back to 2005When demand is down, utilities end up reducing offtake from costlier coal plants, and buy more from other sources

NEW DELHI :
Coal’s use for power in India is set to shrink for the first time in at least 14 years as demand slows and cheaper and cleaner renewable sources of electricity erode the fossil fuel’s share.
Coal generation fell for a fourth month in November, the longest such streak in government data going back to 2005. That echoes a decline in consumption because of slowing industrial activity and prolonged rains that pushed up production from hydroelectric dams while curbing electricity demand for air conditioning and irrigation.
When demand is down, utilities end up reducing offtake from costlier coal plants, and buy more from other sources such as hydro, renewables and nuclear, said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner for power and utilities at PricewaterhouseCoopers India.
Power generation from coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, slumped 11% from a year earlier in November. Output in the year to November fell 2.4%, the first ever drop for the 11-month period.
India has a coal-fired generation capacity of almost 198 gigawatts, which accounts for about 54% of its installed generation capacity. That share has reduced over the past years and is set to come down further as the country adds more clean power to deal with air pollution and meet its climate goals. India’s coal fleet used barely 51.4% of its capacity in November, compared with 60.5% a year earlier, Central Electricity Authority data showed.

4,2019-12-11,Coal India,"Also, the air quality monitoring in three subsidiaries of CIL was found deficient as against 96 monitoring stations, only 58 were establishedIndia has called for a reset on climate debate on coal as a fuel, in the backdrop of India becoming one of the top renewable energy producers globally

NEW DELHI :
The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) has censured state-run Coal India Ltd’s (CIL’s) over issues of environment discipline, air quality monitoring and high pollutant levels at the world’ largest coal producer’s mines.
This comes in the backdrop of India expediting efforts for coal mining, even as the window for fossil fuels is rapidly closing, and the global energy landscape has been rapidly evolving, with fundamental changes to the investment culture amid growing climate concerns.
In a Performance Audit Report, the government’s audit watchdog said that while the guidelines containing the responsibility and delegation at different levels in environment discipline were formulated by CIL, but the same were not dovetailed in their operating manual by the subsidiaries.
Also, the air quality monitoring in three subsidiaries of CIL was found deficient as against 96 monitoring stations, only 58 were established. In addition, 12 mines didn’t comply with the state pollution control board’s directives for installation of Continuous Ambient Air Quality Monitoring Stations.
The issue assumes importance given that India’s coal requirement is expected to go up to 1123 million tonnes (mt) by 2023 from the present levels of around 700 mt. The earlier plan was to mine 1.5 billion tonnes of coal by 2020. Of this, one billion tonnes was to come from state run Coal India Ltd and 500 million tonnes from non-Coal India sources in line with the government’s push to raise natural resources production and kickstart economic growth.
“Over the last few decades in India, protection and conservation of the environment and sustainable development have become increasingly important, in the light of climate change which had devastating consequences on the survival of humanity. Effective environmental governance is, therefore, of utmost importance,"" the report said.
The CAG in its report titled Assessment of Environmental Impact due to Mining Activities and its Mitigation in Coal India Limited and its Subsidiaries also said that the pollutants exceeded the limits prescribed by Bureau of Indian Standards in eight mines. Also, 62 lakh Kilo-litre (KL) of untreated water was discharged to nearby water bodies by Lakhanpur and Basundhara (W) mines of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited during 2013-18, thereby contaminating ground water.
“Extraction of coal, therefore, involves serious environmental and social concerns, including, air, noise, water pollution, land degradation and far reaching consequences on local bio-diversity. Most of the coal reserves in India are located in river basins which are rich in forest cover and are habitats of precious wild life and indigenous tribal communities,"" the CAG report added.
India has called for a reset on climate debate on coal as a fuel, in the backdrop of India becoming one of the top renewable energy producers globally with ambitious capacity expansion plans. Also, India’s per capita power consumption, about 1149 kilowatt-hour (kWh), is among the lowest in the world. In comparison, the world’s per capita consumption is 3600 kWh.
A CIL spokesperson didn’t immediately comment on the CAG’s report.
The report also recommended that, “the companies under coal sector may put in place an Environment Policy,"" and “the capital works relating to pollution control measures may be completed expeditiously.""
This comes in the backdrop of issues of environment and air pollution assuming centre stage with air quality levels beginning to deteriorate in the National Capital Region (NCR) and other parts of the country.
Delivering India's statement at the 25th Conference of Parties (COP) currently underway in Spain, union Minister for Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Prakash Javadekar highlighted that only six countries are on track to meet their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) announced in Paris, and India is leading the pack.
As per UN estimates, the world would need to increase its efforts five-fold to contain climate change to a 1.5°C rise at most. Any temperature rise beyond that would lead to major and irreversible damage. India on its part has maintained that it is doing its best to mitigate and adapt to climate change, but climate finance remains a concern."

New Delhi: India’s trade deficit narrowed to $12.12 billion in November from $17.58 billion a year ago, according to commerce ministry figures released on Friday.
Merchandise exports contracted for the fourth consecutive month in November to $25.98 billion, while imports fell to $38.11 billion.
Out of the 30 major items in India’s export and import baskets, 17 export items and 21 imported goods contracted. Exports of cashew fell 33.9% and oil meals by 54.59%. Electronic goods exports, however, grew by 46.13%, drugs and pharmaceuticals by 20.60%, engineering goods 6.32% and marine products by 9%.
Among major imports, coal fell 23.6%, petroleum 18.6%, chemicals 15.11%, newsprint by 43.3%, non-ferrous metals by 12.3%, iron and steel 26.5%, and electronic goods shrank by 4.5%. However, gold imports picked up by 6%.
In November, oil imports declined by 18.17% to $11.06 billion, while non-oil imports contracted 10.26% to $27.04 billion.
Sharad Kumar Saraf, president, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said both domestic and global factors led to the decline in exports. “Prolonging trade tensions and protectionism, along with sluggishness in the economies across the globe, has further added to the woes of India’s exports sector. The slowdown projected across the economies for short-term and medium-term, and return to more normal trade relations among countries looks a mere probability.""
During the first eight months of the fiscal year, exports contracted 1.99%, while imports shrank 8.91%, leading to a trade deficit of $54.06 billion.
A weakening external sector is also expected to put additional pressure on India. “The currency volatility besides fluctuation in commodities prices, including crude prices, have also led to the decrease in exports of petroleum, which is a major constituent of India’s exports,"" Saraf added."

BHUBANESWAR :
State-owned NLC India Limited said on Sunday it is planning to invest more than  ₹17,000 crore for its thermal power projects and has embarked upon afforestation programme inside and outside the coal mining area in Odisha.
The Navratna company will produce 20 million tonne of coal per annum from Talabira II and III coal blocks to fuel its 4,200 MW of thermal power projects, an official of the company said.
The company is working closely with the Odisha forest department to make it a model mine by planting more trees than the mandated, under relevant policies, an NLC India official said.
The public sector undertaking has already deposited  ₹134.36 crore to Odisha Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA) account.
CAMPA fund is for compensatory afforestation and its maintenance for 10 years, catchment area treatment plan, wild life management plans and gap plantation.
""Our drive to plant and protect 25,86,700 trees inside and outside the mining lease area of Talabira II & III is higher than what is prescribed by the relevant regulations for protecting and nurturing the environment,"" an NLC statement said.
""Local plants such as sirisa, barakoli, ambada, mango, jackfruits and bamboo will be cultivated to develop vibrancy in the ecology,"" the statement said.
The per capita electricity consumption in India is estimated at around 1100 units a year, which is much lower than the comparable nations, the statement said.
NLC India's integrated project with huge green cover will ensure uninterrupted electricity to lakhs of households and commercial establishments through NLC's 3,200 MW Talabira Thermal Power Project in Odisha and NLC Tamil Nadu Power Limited's 1,000 MW project in Tuticorin district, it added.
This will attract thousands of direct and indirect job opportunities and the recruitments are already on, the official said.
NLC India will undertake compensatory afforestation. It will plant 13,27,702 saplings across 2089 hectare land in Sambalpur, Sonepur and Bolangir districts.
It will also plant nearly 12,41,000 trees inside the mining lease area. In addition, 18,400 saplings will be planted in the safety zone area and outer periphery of the mine.
Recently, NLC India had announced compensation for the project affected families with higher land prices, pakka houses in townships with supporting modern infrastructure besides monthly disbursements in lieu of employment for the youth to enable them to pursue vocations / professions of their choices.
The company also promised to support local communities through institutional support for capacity building.
As a gesture of gratitude towards the iconic freedom fighter Veer Surendra Sai, it will develop his birthplace as a tourist destination at Khinda involving Odisha Tourism Department, Sambalpur, he said."
1,2019-12-17,Coal India,"Rising demand in China and India is more than offsetting declines in the U.S. and EuropeWhile use of the most polluting fossil fuel had a historic dip in 2019, the International Energy Agency anticipates steady increases in the next five years

Coal consumption is set to rise in the coming years as growing demand for electricity in developing countries outpaces a shift to cleaner sources of electricity in industrialized nations.
While use of the most polluting fossil fuel had a historic dip in 2019, the International Energy Agency anticipates steady increases in the next five years. That means the world will face a significant challenge in meeting pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that cause global warming.
“There are few signs of change,"" the agency wrote in its annual coal report released in Paris on Tuesday. “Despite all the policy changes and announcements, our forecast is very similar to those we have made over the past few years.""
While this year is on track for biggest decline ever for coal power, that’s mostly due to high growth in hydroelectricity and relatively low electricity demand in India and China, said Carlos Fernandez Alvarez, senior energy analyst at the Paris-based IEA.
Despite the drop, global coal consumption is likely to rise over the coming years, driven by demand in India, China and Southeast Asia. Power generation from coal rose almost 2% in 2018 to reach an all-time high, remaining the world’s largest source of electricity.
The steady outlook for coal comes in spite of waning demand in industrialized nations. Europe has set a goal of zeroing out carbon pollution by the middle of the century, which would mean drastic reductions for coal. In the U.S., competition from natural gas has cut into demand for coal, despite President Donald Trump’s vows to revive the industry.
The story is different in Asia, which will more than make up for reductions elsewhere. India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion, will see coal generation increase by 4.6% a year through 2024 to help power its growing economy. In Southeast Asia coal demand will grow more than 5% annually. China, which accounts for almost half the world’s consumption, will also have modest growth with usage peaking in 2022.
“How we address this issue in Asia is critical for the long-term success of any global efforts to reduce emissions,"" Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, wrote in a foreword to the report.
Any new coal plants added to meet the growing power demand in these countries will likely be in use for decades. Even as China’s coal consumption slows and then declines after 2022, emissions from the fuel would need to rapidly decline in order to meet climate targets.
Under current policies, the world is set to warm almost 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century. That’s double the rate scientists say is needed to constrain the worst impacts of climate change. To prevent those increases, it would  be necessary to use technology that captures and stores carbon as it’s emitted from power plants, the IEA said. While the technology is expensive and untested at scale. But with coal here to stay, it may be the only option to reduce emissions

0,2019-12-29,Coal India,"Till December, the miner is expected to produce close to 390 MT of coal and will require another 270 MT in the last quarter of this fiscal to meet the annual production targetCurrently, Coal India produces 1.8 MT per day while the asking rate to achieve the target is 2.9 MT

Amid concerns that Coal India Ltd (CIL) may fall short of its 660 million tonne (MT) production target for the current fiscal, the miner has planned to ramp up daily output to meet the goal, officials said.
Till December, the miner is expected to produce close to 390 MT of coal and will require another 270 MT in the last quarter of this fiscal to meet the annual production target.
Currently, Coal India produces 1.8 MT per day while the asking rate to achieve the target is 2.9 MT, they said.
Internally, Coal India has planned to raise its production to 3 MT per day at least in February and March next year to inch closer to the target, Coal India officials told PTI.
According to the provisional data, the miner produced 330.38 MT of coal during April-November in the 2019-20 fiscal, down by 7.8 per cent from 358.30 MT in the year-ago period.
Unless the miner increases its daily production to 2.5 MT per day from January to March period, it will struggle to surpass the production figure of the last fiscal, company sources said.
In 2018-19, Coal India produced 606.89 MT while dispatch was at 608.14 MT.
Coal India's offtake at 363.63 MT during April- November period was down by 7.2 per cent from 392.02 MT supplied in the year-ago period.
CIL officials said the coal offtake was at 410 MT till December 27, 2019 as against a target of 467 MT.
In October, a rating agency had projected that the coal behemoth might miss the production target by 50-75 MT in the current fiscal.
Performance of Coal India's two key subsidiaries- Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) and South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL)- will be crucial in remaining three months of the current fiscal to meet its production target, the officials said.
Mining activities in the two subsidiaries had been hit severely during monsoon and also due to law and order issues, they said.
According to production data, SECL and MCL registered a negative growth of 14.5 and 9.8 per cent respectively as on December 27, 2019, a CIL official said, adding that these companies have been taking all measures to overcome hurdles and ramp up production.
CIL, however, is apprehensive about coal demand with declining electricity generation of thermal power plants in the country till November this year, officials said.
""If the current trend continues, it have an adverse impact on CIL's production and dispatch,"" they added."
