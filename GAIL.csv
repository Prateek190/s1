New Delhi: Amid reports of splitting GAIL India’s gas transportation and marketing business, oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Tuesday said the company should concentrate on laying gas infrastructure while marketing can be done by anyone. 
GAIL as a company should focus on providing infrastructure particularly in eastern India to aid the country’s transformation to a gas-based economy, Pradhan told reporters in New Delhi. 
Refusing to confirm or deny if the government was considering bifurcating GAIL’s business, the minister said, “it is important for GAIL to lay pipeline to connect eastern India. Gas has to reach all corners"". “GAIL is coming up to our expectations...marketing can be done by anyone,"" he added."
70,2018-01-16,GAIL,"GAIL (India) signed the deal with Gazprom in 2012 to buy 2.5 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years on a delivered basis

New Delhi: Gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd has renegotiated the terms of a long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchase deal with Russia’s Gazprom PJSC, the Indian company said on Tuesday, in third such negotiation by India to make the imported fuel affordable to its price-sensitive customers. 
New Delhi: Gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd has renegotiated the terms of a long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchase deal with Russia’s Gazprom PJSC, the Indian company said on Tuesday, in third such negotiation by India to make the imported fuel affordable to its price-sensitive customers.
India has been leveraging its position as one of the biggest energy consumers to strike better bargains for its companies.
India has in the past renegotiated LNG deals with Qatar’s RasGas and Exxon Mobil Corp., as spot prices declined substantially amid a supply glut.
GAIL signed the deal with Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore in 2012 to buy 2.5 million tonnes of LNG per year for 20 years on a delivered basis. The supplies are scheduled to start in the second quarter of 2018.
“The two parties have agreed to an adjustment to the price and the volume of LNG supply, thus enabling GAIL to develop incremental gas markets to offtake these volumes, thereby mitigating volume risk,"" GAIL said.
This is a step for GAIL to diversify its LNG portfolio by spreading price reference indexes across multiple geographies, so as to provide consumers a greater flexibility in service, said Chairman B.C. Tripathi.
The company has also signed contracts for sourcing up to 5.8 million tonnes of LNG from the US.
It is renegotiating its LNG purchase deals with US-based Cheniere Energy and Dominion Cove Point, Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told lawmakers last month. Reuters"
69,2018-01-23,GAIL,"ONGC holds a 13.77% stake in IOCwhich at Tuesday's trading price is worth over Rs26,200 croreand  a 4.86% stake in GAIL, which is worth over Rs3,847 crore

New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has received approval from the government to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and GAIL India Ltd to help fund the Rs36,915 crore acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL). 
New Delhi: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) has received approval from the government to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOC) and GAIL India Ltd to help fund the Rs36,915 crore acquisition of Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL).
ONGC holds a 13.77% stake in nation’s biggest refiner IOC, which at Tuesday’s trading price is worth over Rs26,200 crore. It also holds 4.86% stake in gas utility GAIL, which is worth over Rs3,847 crore.
Top sources with direct knowledge of the issue said the government gave ONGC nod to sell its shareholding in IOC and GAIL earlier this month but the company is waiting for the right price to offload the shares.
Currently, ONGC is funding the acquisition of government’s 51.11% stake in oil refining and marketing firm HPCL from the about Rs12,000 crore cash it has and short- term borrowing. Sources said ONGC is a zero-debt company and wants to retain that status.
The short-term loan it is availing have provision to pre-pay without any penalty. It plans to pre-pay the one-year tenure loan it is taking for HPCL buy by selling IOC and GAIL shares in due course, they said.
Sources said ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corp. of India (LIC) for selling IOC and GAIL shares but the state- owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10% discount to the prevailing price. So, ONGC has decided to offload the shares in open market.
ONGC’s purchase of HPCL would create India’s first integrated oil company. This would be ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout this fiscal after its Rs7,738 crore acquisition of 80% stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.’s KG basin gas block.
ONGC chairman and managing director Shashi Shanker had on Sunday stated that the company’s board has approved raising of the borrowing limit from Rs25,000 crore to Rs35,000 crore. This will be the company’s first ever debt.
“We will use our (Rs12,000-13,000 crore) cash first and then the liquid assets and debt will be last,"" Shanker had said. “This order can change, because we won’t sell the liquid assets in distress. Also, we have offers for over Rs50,000 crore debt at very competitive rates, both foreign currency and local.""
Shanker had said the company paid less than the acquisition price recommended by the company’s valuation adviser, Ernst and Young (EY). He, however, refused to share details.
The Rs473.97 per share ONGC is paying to the government is 14% higher than Friday’s closing price of HPCL and over 10% of the 60-day weighted average of the HPCL scrip. Sources said while the government was seeking as much as Rs69,000 crore for selling controlling stake in HPCL, EY had put HPCL’s valuation at Rs475 a share plus a premium for getting the controlling stake. The outside advice the company took from Citi put the price at Rs500 per share.
The stake sale will help the government cross its sell- off target for the first time and would help stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.2% of gross domestic product. The government had set a target of Rs72,500 crore from disinvestment proceeds this fiscal. Before the ONGC-HPCL deal, it had collected Rs54,337.60 crore.
HPCL will add 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after IOC and Reliance Industries Ltd. ONGC already is majority owner of MRPL, which has a 15- million tonne refinery.
At 2.03pm, ONGC shares traded 3.75% up at Rs207.45 on BSE, whereas HPCL shares fell 1.47% to Rs395.85. The Sensex was up 0.86% at 36,104.42 points."
68,2018-02-07,GAIL,"GAIL was established for transportation, processing and marketing of natural gas and for establishing and managing gas pipelines and related installations

New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on the issue of splitting gas utility GAIL on Wednesday said a decade-old policy provides for a natural gas transporter not having any interest in marketing of the fuel.  
New Delhi: Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan on the issue of splitting gas utility GAIL on Wednesday said a decade-old policy provides for a natural gas transporter not having any interest in marketing of the fuel. 
Pradhan gave the response in Rajya Sabha on a written reply to a question on splitting state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd by separating its gas marketing business from its primary role as a transporter of gas. Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000km of natural gas pipelines in the country.It sells around 60% of natural gas in the country. 
Pradhan said in 2006, the government issued the policy for development of natural gas pipelines and city or local natural gas distribution networks. “In the long run and with the maturing of gas markets, it is envisaged in the policy that the authorised entities will have transportation of natural gas as their sole business activity and will not have any business interest in the gas marketing or city or local gas distribution networks,"" he said. 
Also, the policy and the provisions of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) Act, 2006 provide for all entities authorised to lay pipelines including GAIL to provide mandatory open access to their gas pipeline infrastructure on common carrier principle at non-discriminatory basis. 
This open access to third parties should be given at transportation rates determined by PNGRB, he said. The minister, however, did not say either ways if the government was considering splitting GAIL. GAIL, he said, was established for transportation, processing and marketing of natural gas and for establishing and managing gas pipelines and related installations. 
At present, GAIL has about 11,000km long gas pipeline network and is also developing about 3,500km long pipelines projects in the country. Last month, Pradhan had stated that the state-run firm should focus on building natural gas pipelines as marketing can be done by “anyone"". 
He had stated that creating infrastructure to take environment friendly natural gas to uncovered parts, particularly eastern India, is a priority for the government. Several meetings have been held in the ministry on splitting GAIL by spinning off its marketing business into a separate company and selling it to a state-owned firm. 
Pradhan had stated that the government has been taking steps to make India a gas-based economy. As part of this plan, it has even provided budgetary support of Rs5,176 crore, or 40% of the project cost, for laying of a gas pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha. “This is the first instance of government funding a project from its budget,"" he had said. 
GAIL, he said, should focus on creating infrastructure that would help take natural gas to all parts of the country, especially eastern India which has so far been unconnected. “Marketing can be done by anyone,"" he said, responding to a question on whether government proposes to split the state-run company’s pipeline and marketing businesses. 
People in the know said refiners Indian Oil Corp. (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) have evinced in acquiring GAIL to expand their gas marketing business. One of the two companies could be sold the marketing business while GAIL asked to concentrate on just laying pipelines. 
GAIL also owns a petrochemical plant at Pata in Uttar Pradesh which too could be sold along with the marketing business to either IOC or BPCL. The company had in the past resisted the split on grounds that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm’s length, and hence do not need to be separated. 
GAIL’s marketing business formed 71% of its 2016 -17 total sales, and 25% pre-tax profit. The government has a 54.89% stake in GAIL India."

New Delhi: Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to sell its holding in two state-run energy companies within a year to repay debt it raised to fund the purchase of the Indian government’s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), according to people with knowledge of the matter. 
New Delhi: Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) plans to sell its holding in two state-run energy companies within a year to repay debt it raised to fund the purchase of the Indian government’s stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd (HPCL), according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The state-run explorer may sell shares of Indian Oil Corp. and GAIL India Ltd in multiple transactions on the open market through the year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information isn’t public. ONGC has already received the approval of the government and is waiting for the right price to begin offloading the shares, they said.
The sales can help ONGC return to its debt-free status, give it greater flexibility to acquire overseas oil and gas assets and invest in projects to boost output. ONGC holds 13.77% stake in Indian Oil, the nation’s biggest refiner, and 4.83% in its largest gas utility, GAIL. The holdings can fetch over $4.8 billion at current market rates, covering almost 90% of the loans taken by the New Delhi-based driller.
ONGC raised one-year bridge loans worth Rs35,000 crore ($5.4 billion) from seven banks to partly fund the Rs36,900 crore purchase of the government’s holding in HPCL. It tapped the debt market for the first time last month and can pay off its entire loan if it uses part of its Rs13,000 crore of cash reserves.
ONGC rose as much as 3.3% and traded 2.9% higher at Rs190.80 as of 2:55pm in Mumbai on Wednesday. Indian Oil climbed as much as 2.2% to trade 0.9% higher at Rs405.
An ONGC spokesman declined to comment on Wednesday. Finance ministry spokesman D.S. Malik wasn’t immediately available for comment.
“We will use our cash balance first and then liquid assets. Debt will be last,"" ONGC chairman Shashi Shanker had said on 22 January, while announcing the HPCL deal that was completed on 31 January. “We will take a call on selling if the market is favourable, but we won’t sell anything in distress.""

63,2018-03-15,GAIL,"PNGRB terminates GAIL's licence to build a Rs10,000 crore natural gas pipeline from Surat in Gujarat to Paradip in Odisha, saying it hadn't started work even after six years

New Delhi: The Petroleum And Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has terminated GAIL India Ltd’s licence to build a Rs10,000 crore natural gas pipeline from Surat in Gujarat to Paradip in Odisha, saying the state-owned firm hadn’t started work on the project even after six years. 
New Delhi: The Petroleum And Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) has terminated GAIL India Ltd’s licence to build a Rs10,000 crore natural gas pipeline from Surat in Gujarat to Paradip in Odisha, saying the state-owned firm hadn’t started work on the project even after six years.
The oil regulator PNGRB also ordered encashing the company’s entire performance bank guarantee of Rs20 crore, according to the regulator’s 13 March order.
GAIL had in November 2011 bid an astonishingly low pipeline tariff of Rs0.01 (one paisa) per million British thermal unit to bag the project. It was formally awarded the licence in April 2012. It had beaten Gujarat government firm GSPC India Transco Ltd to bag the Surat-Paradip project. This was the country’s first pipeline originating and terminating at a port. The 2,112-km long pipeline was to have a capacity to carry 74.81 million standard cubic meters per day of gas.
Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan had on numerous occasions told Parliament that the work on Surat-Paradip and other such pipelines had not started because of several reasons including non-availability of anchor load customers.
Other gas lines that have been delayed for a similar period include Mallavaram-Bhopal-Bhilwara, Mehsana-Bhatinda and Bhatinda-Jammu-Srinagar pipelines. Gujarat government entity GSPC India Transco Ltd is the licence holder of these lines since 2011.
The termination of GAIL’s licence is the first such action by PNGRB since June 2012 when it had asked the government to cancel a licence granted to Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd (RGTIL) to lay four gas pipelines over delays in implementation of the 2,175km lines. Relogistics Infrastructure Ltd (Relog), a subsidiary of Mukesh Ambani’s RGTIL, had in 2007-08 won government authorisation to lay Kakinada-Basudebpur-Howrah pipeline, Kakinada-Chennai line, Chennai-Bangalore-Mangalore pipeline and Chennai-Tuticorin line, but physical work on these pipelines hadn’t started.
In its 13 March, order, PNGRB said it had encashed 25% of GAIL’s bank guarantee in September 2015 as the company hadn’t met timelines and not even achieved financial closure (arranging of funds) for the project.
PNGRB said the 22 September 2015 order was to provide “natural justice"" to GAIL to explore possibilities to come up with viable strategies on project implementation. The state-owned firm’s challenge of that order was dismissed by Delhi high court in April 2017, following which Rs5 crore of bank guarantee was encashed.
PNGRB then directed GAIL to replenish this amount as bank guarantee and quickly submit financial closure plan for the project. GAIL then submitted a financial closure report, which was accepted by PNGRB, but refused to refurbish the bank guarantee.
PNGRB on 18 January wrote to GAIL intimating that its financial closure plan had been accepted and asked it to replenish within 15 days the Rs5 crore guarantee already encashed, failing which the balance amount of Rs15 crore would also be encashed and licence to lay the Surat-Paradip pipeline terminated.
GAIL, however, responded seeking refund of the encashed Rs5 crore bank guarantee or restoring it to the core bank guarantee. PNGRB did not agree to it and sent it a show cause and went ahead with the cancellation of the licence after failing to elicit a desired response from GAIL.
“The board has come to the conclusion that the authorised entity has failed to perform its obligations under the terms and conditions of authorisation with respect to refurbishment of the encashed performance bank guarantee amount of  ₹ 5 crore. Thus, action under the provision of Regulation 16(1)(c) be taken for encashment of the balance performance bank guarantee of  ₹ 15 crore and authorisation of GAIL (India) Ltd for Surat-Paradip natural gas pipeline project be terminated,"" PNGRB said in the order."
62,2018-03-18,GAIL,"Indian Oil and BPCL may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms

New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms.  
New Delhi: State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) may buy 26% stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms. 
Following finance minister Arun Jaitley’s February 2017 Budget announcement of creating integrated oil majors, IOC and BPCL had submitted separate proposals to buy the government’s 54.89% stake in India’s biggest gas marketing and transportation firm, GAIL. 
A top source said since the government is not looking at actual merger of oil companies but only transfer of its ownership to a cash rich PSU, the best option would be to split the 54.89% holding in GAIL equally between IOC and BPCL. At Friday’s closing price of Rs440.85 a share for GAIL on BSE, the stake is worth close to Rs41,000 crore. 
In January this year, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought out government’s 51.11% stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs36,915 crore. But HPCL hasn’t been merged with ONGC and continues to remain a separate listed company with the same board. After the buyout, HPCL has become a subsidiary of ONGC, which gets up to two seats on the company board. 
The source said IOC and BPCL too can follow the same model and split the government’s stake equally among themselves. GAIL will become their subsidiary and will continue to operate as a listed company with an independent board. 
IOC and BPCL would get to appoint one director each on GAIL board. Like in case of ONGC’s acquisition of HPCL, the government would get to encash its holding in GAIL yet retain control over the company through IOC and BPCL. The source said the government has so far not taken any view on the proposals made by IOC and BPCL. 
How and to whom the stake would be sold will be decided after inter-ministerial consultations, he said adding that the option of splitting the stake equally among the two firms is one of the options that would be considered during such deliberations. 
Jaitley in the 2017-18 Budget had unveiled government’s plan to create integrated public sector oil majors “through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions"" so as that the merged company has “capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions"" and is “able to match the performance of international and domestic private companies?. 
Following this, ONGC expressed interest in taking over HPCL while IOC and BPCL said they keen on taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty. The government took up ONGC’s proposal first and the transaction was completed at January-end this year.
IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL. The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction liquefied natural gas terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. 
And GAIL, the nation’s biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that. BPCL, on the other hand, too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd, the nation’s second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice. 
The government holds 66.13% stake in OIL, which at current market price is worth about Rs18,000 crore. Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60% of natural gas in the country. The source said the government has not taken any decision on the proposals sent by other PSUs."
61,2018-03-25,GAIL,"GAIL had picked up 19% stake in OPaL in Gujarat's Dahej but the project faced major cost overruns which forced it to restrict its equity contribution to Rs996.28 crore

New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant.  
New Delhi:State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) may buy out gas utility GAIL India Ltd in its Dahej mega petrochemical project in Gujarat to take full control of the recently commissioned plant. 
GAIL had in 2008 picked up 19% stake in ONGC Petro-additions Ltd (OPaL), which was then building the mega petrochemical complex at Dahej in Gujarat. 
But the project, which started in 2006, faced major cost and time overruns, which forced GAIL to restrict its equity contribution to the original Rs996.28 crore. 
This investment in the expanded project cost meant that the gas utility’s stake dropped first to 17%, then to 15.5% and now about 9%, sources privy to the development said. 
“It doesn’t make any business sense to hold such a small percentage stake and it is best that ONGC buys out GAIL in the project,"" they said. 
The 1.1 million tonnes plant, which at the time of conception was projected to cost Rs12,440 crore, got completed only last year for about Rs30,000 crore. 
After GAIL in 2008 agreed to pick up 19% stake in OPaL, the project cost was in 2010 was revised to Rs19,535 crore. It was couple of years later further revised upwards to Rs21,396 crore with December 2013 set as the commissioning date. 
People privy of the development said when project cost was revised to Rs19,535 crore, GAIL decided to restrict its participation to 17%. This was done because the company’s board had powers to approve an investment of only up to Rs1,000 crore. 
Consequently, it decided to make an equity contribution of Rs996.28 crore towards the 17% stake, they said. But when the project cost went up further to Rs21,396 crore, the promoter’s equity contribution increased from Rs5,860.5 crore to Rs6,418.8 crore at 70:30 debt-equity ratio. 
GAIL, sources said, is not inclined to make any additional equity contribution and has decided to cap its investment in OPaL at the capital it has already approved—Rs 996.28 crore. This, in the revised project cost, fetched it only 15.5% stake. Now that the project cost almost touched Rs30,000 crore, that investment is equivalent to only about 9% stake. 
Sources said GAIL would, however, continue to hold rights to market 38% of the polymer and other chemicals produced by OPaL even at the reduced equity stake. ONGC has funded almost all of the enhanced project cost after GAIL as well as Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC), which was to originally hold 5% stake, did not make more equity contributions. 
ONGC had attributed the increase in project cost primarily to additional cost of Phase-II captive power plant and increase in cost of building the Phase-I electricity generating unit."

New Delhi: In a milestone for India’s new energy sourcing strategy, the first long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) US cargo from the Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc. arrived at the Dabhol LNG terminal in Maharashtra on Friday. 
New Delhi: In a milestone for India’s new energy sourcing strategy, the first long-term liquefied natural gas (LNG) US cargo from the Houston-based Cheniere Energy Inc. arrived at the Dabhol LNG terminal in Maharashtra on Friday.
Of the 9 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of LNG contracted by India from the US, state-run GAIL (India) Ltd accounts for 5.8 mmtpa, at an estimated value of $32 billion.
This will translate to 90 cargoes every year from Sabine Pass and Dominion Cove Point LNG terminals.
“GAIL signed two 20-year LNG supply agreements, potentially worth $32 billion, for US LNG exports from the Dominion Cove Point project in Maryland and the Sabine Pass project in Louisiana. Today’s shipment is the first of the contracted loads under the agreement,"" the US embassy in New Delhi said in a statement.
These contracts assumes importance given Indian firms having inked long-term LNG contracts totalling 22 mmtpa.
Also, India, the world’s fourth-largest LNG importer, has been trying to leverage the glut in global LNG supplies to renegotiate its contracts. Indian firms have been exploring strategies such as time swap of volumes, destination swaps and contract on free on board basis to reduce the final fuel price. India imported 19 million metric tonnes of LNG in 2016-17.
Some of the successfully negotiated contracts are new deals with Qatar’s RasGas Co. and Exxon Mobil Corp. Apart from the US, new natural gas suppliers such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Egypt, Israel, Canada and Cyprus are expected to enter the LNG market, helping consumers get better prices.
“India’s first LNG Cargo from the US under long-term contract of GAIL (India) Limited was received at Dabhol, today. This marks a new beginning in the Indo-USA energy partnership and trade. Commencement of LNG supplies under the Henry Hub indexed contracts is significant for GAIL and the Indian markets as well,"" GAIL added in a separate statement on Friday.
According to the state-run firm, it will have an optimum portfolio mix of LNG indexed to Henry Hub (HH) and crude oil and the customers will benefit from such a unique price blend. 
US Henry Hub is among the three major international gas trading hubs, the others being the UK National Balancing Point and Japan’s custom-cleared rate.
Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday said LNG contracted from the US is “very economical"" and “highly profitable for India.""
“The US has abundant supply of shale gas and the long term LNG contracts signed by Indian companies with US provide India with an access to secure supply source at stable prices which will result in geographical diversification and energy security,"" the GAIL statement added.
Bilateral trade between the US and India is around $126.1 billion.
Gas accounts for around 6.5% of India’s primary energy mix as compared to a a global average of 24%, The National Democratic Alliance government plans to increase its share to 15% by 2030. India’s gas demand is expected to be driven by the fertilizer, power, city gas distribution and steel sectors.
India has also been recalibrating its crude sourcing strategy and sourcing heavy crude from Latin America as part of its strategy to become a preferred refining hub. It also sourced crude oil from US last year.
“The US continues to partner with India across the broad range of energy collaboration, whether through traditional energy sources like oil—the first crude oil shipment from the US to India arrived in October 2017 in Odisha—or LNG, or through other sources like coal and renewable energy,"" said minister counselor for commercial affairs Patrick Santillo in the US embassy statement."
58,2018-04-27,GAIL,"By splitting GAIL, Petroleum and Natural Gas Board hopes to increase the number of gas consumers and attract the investments needed to expand the pipeline network and build more LNG terminals

Mumbai/New Delhi: India plans to split state-run gas utility GAIL by March next year to create two companies: one marketing gas, and another operating pipelines that can be used by consumers who buy direct from producers, the head of the sector’s regulator told Reuters.  
Mumbai/New Delhi: India plans to split state-run gas utility GAIL by March next year to create two companies: one marketing gas, and another operating pipelines that can be used by consumers who buy direct from producers, the head of the sector’s regulator told Reuters. 
GAIL (India) Ltd is the country’s biggest gas marketing and trading firm and owns most of the nation’s pipelines, giving it a stranglehold on the market for the fuel. 
By splitting GAIL, the regulator of India’s oil and gas sector hopes to increase the number of gas consumers and attract the billions of dollars needed to expand the pipeline network and build more liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. 
“All this un-bundling should be done within this fiscal year (to 31 March 2019),"" D.K. Sarraf, chairman of India’s Petroleum and Natural Gas Board, told Reuters. 
GAIL already keeps separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses, making it easier to split them into two entities before a change of ownership, he said. 
Sarraf did not say which business GAIL would retain. Oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan in January said the company should focus on laying pipelines, suggesting it is the marketing side that would be hived off. 
By unbundling GAIL and opening the sector, the government hopes to increase gas use and meet its objective of raising the share of a cleaner, cheaper fuel as a part of the energy mix to 15%, from 6.2%, in the next 12 years. 
Many power plants and small industries like ceramic, glass and cement makers rely heavily on more expensive or dirtier fuels such as naphtha, diesel and coal. In future, though, even small companies will be able to buy gas via pipelines, without having to go through GAIL. 
Only a handful of companies — including Petronet LNG Ltd, Indian Oil Corp Ltd and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp —currently import and sell gas in India. 
The gas regulator hopes by July, however, to draft norms for allowing end-users to bid for using LNG terminals to import gas. 
“We are planning to put LNG terminals on public access to the extent of 20%,"" Sarraf said. 
The regulator was also looking at how to open access to the pipeline network for smaller buyers. 
India’s gas demand is constrained by low domestic output, a small number of LNG terminals - just four - and a pipeline network that does not reach enough customers. 
GAIL owns more than two-thirds of India’s existing 15,000 km (940 miles) of pipelines, but the government wants to more than double the network to expand gas deliveries. 
While the new pipeline company created by the division of GAIL would be expected to lead the way, the government also wants other companies to bid for rights to build and operate pipelines. 
Three LNG import facilities are also under construction, and there are proposals for many more. Domestic gas production is also expected to rise. 
Sarraf estimated an investment of nearly $20 billion would be needed over the next several years for laying pipelines. 
Only the western state of Gujarat has an extensive city gas distribution network, though some other major cities, including New Delhi and Mumbai have been hooked up to gas. Reuters"

New Delhi: State-owned gas utility GAIL India on Tuesday said it has borrowed Rs2,000 crore loan from State Bank of India (SBI) to meet its general capital expenditure requirement.
The loan is for a 15-year tenure, the company said in a statement without saying what interest rate it would pay on the borrowing.
GAIL said it signed with SBI “a rupee term loan agreement of Rs2,000 crore having a door-to-door tenure of 15 years. The purpose of the loan is for general capital expenditure of GAIL, mainly in the gas pipeline projects, in the forthcoming years.""
The pact was signed in the presence of GAIL director (finance) Subir Purkayastha and SBI general manager S.K. Pradhan.
“During their discussions, GAIL and SBI officials said that the loan agreement is an important milestone in the mutually beneficial relationship that the two organisations share in their path of growth,"" the statement added."

New Delhi: Facing a prospect of being split into two, GAIL India Ltd on Thursday said it supports reforms such as unbundling of gas marketing and transportation business but such a move globally has been done only after gas market has matured.  
New Delhi: Facing a prospect of being split into two, GAIL India Ltd on Thursday said it supports reforms such as unbundling of gas marketing and transportation business but such a move globally has been done only after gas market has matured. 
In a point by point rebuttal to critics, its chairman and managing director, B.C. Tripathi, said GAIL is the only company in the country that has built multiple gas pipelines in the past one decade while the private sector even after getting authorization has not laid an inch. 
Also, it has thrown open all of the 11,400-km of pipeline length to third parties for accessing on common carrier basis, he said. 
In mature markets, monopoly gas transporting and marketing companies have been unbundled or split after the share of natural gas in energy mix has reached at least 15% and a well-connected pipeline network built. 
Also, domestically produced natural gas forms bulk of consumption. 
In India, the share of natural gas in energy mix is 6.2%, its eastern and southern parts are not connected to any pipeline and domestically produced gas makes up for just 40% of the consumption. 
The petroleum ministry is looking at splitting GAIL into two firms to resolve the conflict of interest in it being both the transporter and marketer of natural gas.
While the ministry feels it hasn’t done enough to lay pipelines, some industry stakeholders have sought access to GAIL’s vast pipeline network for transporting their own gas. 
Tripathi replied to both the counts saying that “every inch of the pipeline built in the country in last few years has been by GAIL alone"" and 120 entities are already using 25% of the company’s pipelines on common carrier basis. 
GAIL also insists that it operates the two business at arms-length principle and hasn’t ever tried to use its monopolistic situation for undue commercial gains."
54,2018-05-31,GAIL,"GAIL (India)'s natural gas transmission volume in Q4 declined sequentially to 106 mscmd from 109 mscmd in the December quarter

GAIL (India) Ltd missed Street expectations in the March quarter (Q4), with its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of Rs1,695 crore falling short. This was primarily owing to disappointing numbers from the petrochemicals business and weaker performance of the gas trading segment. 
GAIL (India) Ltd missed Street expectations in the March quarter (Q4), with its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of Rs1,695 crore falling short. This was primarily owing to disappointing numbers from the petrochemicals business and weaker performance of the gas trading segment.
Sure, petrochemicals volumes increased year-on-year and sequentially as well. However, realizations were lower compared to last year’s March quarter and there were input costs pressures too. In fact, the gas trading business was also adversely affected due to higher input costs, leading to shrinking of margins.
The company’s natural gas transmission volume declined sequentially to 106 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) from 109 mscmd in the December quarter. Antique Stock Broking Ltd pointed out in a note to clients that volumes were negatively impacted by lower offtake from the power sector and a drop in domestic production (-3.5mscmd quarter-on-quarter), which got partially offset by higher liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports.
In comparison, liquefied petroleum gas and liquid hydrocarbons delivered a satisfactory performance.
Overall, pre-exceptional items and tax earnings declined 4.7% year-on-year to Rs1,577 crore. A sharp decline in other income also adversely affected net profit performance to that extent.
GAIL (India)’s shares fell 5% on 24 May in reaction to the numbers, although they have recovered since. Valuations seem inexpensive at about 14 times estimated earnings for this fiscal year.
What’s more, there are a few encouraging factors from a medium-term perspective. Higher crude oil prices are expected to offer some relief for the company’s US LNG contracts. Soft Henry Hub gas prices, higher Asian LNG prices and benign shipping costs imply, though, that these contracts are now profitable and remain so above $60 a barrel (Brent Crude prices), pointed out analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 25 May.
“The revenue drivers for GAIL are on a growth trajectory with transmission/ trading volume set to stay firm over coming quarters,"" said Antique Stock Broking. Petrochemical earnings too should improve, as utilization improves at Pata-2 (petchem expansion in Uttar Pradesh).
Considering valuations aren’t demanding and outlook on many segments is sanguine, if investors are patient, the wait might just bear some good fruit."

Ahmedabad: Gujarat Gas Ltd (GGL), India’s largest city gas distribution (CGD) company, is looking to pick up the entire 50% stake of GAIL Gas in Vadodara Gas Ltd (VGL), according to three senior government officials close to the development. The deal size is expected to be about  ₹ 200-250 crore for an enterprise valuation of about  ₹ 500 crore of VGL, two of these officials said. 
Ahmedabad: Gujarat Gas Ltd (GGL), India’s largest city gas distribution (CGD) company, is looking to pick up the entire 50% stake of GAIL Gas in Vadodara Gas Ltd (VGL), according to three senior government officials close to the development. The deal size is expected to be about  ₹ 200-250 crore for an enterprise valuation of about  ₹ 500 crore of VGL, two of these officials said.
GGL, controlled by Gujarat State Petronet Ltd (GSPL), was earlier looking to pick a minority stake in VGL from GAIL Gas. However, it has recently decided to pick up the entire stake of Gail Gas in the entity, the officials said.
GSPL is a subsidiary of Gujarat government owned-Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (GSPC). A few months ago, Gujarat Gas roped in SBI Caps for a valuation of the entity, said a senior GSPC official on condition of anonymity.
“The matter is between GAIL Gas and Gujarat Gas and it is for them to take a final call in the matter,"" said Shailesh Naik, commercial director, VGL.
While GAIL Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of GAIL (India) Ltd, has agreed to sell 50% stake to Gujarat Gas, a restrictive clause in the 50:50 JV agreement between GAIL Gas and local civic body Vadodara Mahanagar Seva Sadan (VMSS) does not allow either of them to sell more than 20% to Gujarat Gas.
As a result GAIL Gas has sought an amendment in the restrictive clauses of its shareholding agreement with VMSS. The matter is pending before a standing committee of VMSS which is to take a final call in the matter. The committee is headed by Vadodara mayor Jigeeshaben Sheth who was appointed to the post recently.
“The proposal that GAIL Gas wants to exit VGL by selling their stake to Gujarat Gas has come to us. They have requested for changing the restrictive clause to that effect. We are looking into the matter and within a month or so we will decide about it,"" Sheth said over the phone.
A senior executive of GAIL Gas and a Gujarat Gas spokesperson refused to comment on the matter.
Vadodara city has the oldest CGD network in the country that was set up by the local municipal corporation in 1972. In 2013, it formed a 50:50 joint venture company with Gail Gas called VGL as per the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board (PNGRB) Act 2006, with an authorized share capital of Rs.215 crore. VGL had outlined a capital expenditure plan of Rs.200 crore in the first five years wherein it would take the number of household connections from 75,000 in 2013 to 180,000 in 2018, according to information available on GAIL Gas’ official website.
“However, VGL has only added about 30,000 households in this period. Vadodara is a pioneer of pipeline gas distribution for cooking but it is far behind other cities of Gujarat in the development of CGD network. If you look at Rajkot which is comparable to Vadodara in size and population, 70,000 new connections have been added since 2013. In the last ten years since Gujarat Gas started operations in Rajkot, there are about 196,000 household connections in the city,"" said one of the three senior state government officials quoted earlier."

The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.
ONGC had held talks with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for selling Indian Oil and GAIL shares but the state-owned insurer insisted on buying them at 10% discount to the prevailing price. ONGC thus decided against the share sale.
ONGC’s purchase of HPCL created India’s first integrated oil company. This was ONGC’s biggest acquisition and second buyout of 2017-18 after its  ₹  7,738 crore acquisition of 80% stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corp.’s KG basin gas block.
HPCL added 23.8 million tonnes of annual oil refining capacity to ONGC’s portfolio, making it the third-largest refiner in the country after Indian Oil and Reliance Industries Ltd.

New Delhi/Mumbai: tate-run GAIL India Ltd, India’s largest natural gas pipeline operator, has invited users to book surplus network capacity online as the country prepares to create a distribution hub that sets benchmark prices.
GAIL India Ltd, which controls 70% of the nation’s network, on Monday launched a website for online bookings of pipeline capacity to ship gas across the country. GAIL, with 11,400 kilometres (7,084 miles) pipelines, is investing  ₹ 25,000 crore ($3.6 billion) to add another 5,000 kilometres, Chairman Bhuwan Chandra Tripathi said.
Greater sharing of infrastructure will allow quicker trading and movement of natural gas supplies and boost utilisation of GAIL’s pipelines. The government is looking to cut emissions and its oil import bill by doubling the share of gas in the energy mix to 15%.
“This is going to pave the foundation for the gas hub,"" Tripathi said. “The online booking allows transparent and hassle-free access and increases the ease of operations, and pushes the country toward a gas-based economy.""
GAIL already has more than a hundred customers using its pipeline network on an open-access basis. Once the gas hub is operational, it will increase utilisation of the company’s pipelines, which are operating at half capacity, Tripathi said.
The Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, which has been tasked with setting up the gas-trading exchange, expects the hub to be operational by December. The Cabinet is expected to approve the gas exchange plan “soon,"" Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said Monday."

New Delhi: The Finance Ministry is likely to replace GAIL, Engineers India Ltd (EIL) and Container Corporation with new PSUs in the CPSE Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) since the government holding in these companies has fallen below 55%.
CPSE ETF, which functions like a mutual fund scheme, comprises scrips of 10 bluechip PSUs namely ONGC, Coal India, IOC, Oil India, PFC, Bharat Electronics, REC, GAIL, EIL and Container Corporation of India.
Officials said three or more PSUs would be included in the CPSE ETF basket to replace GAIL, EIL and Container Corp and the number would depend upon the value of the scrip and the corresponding weightage in the ETF basket.
GAIL India, Container Corp and EIL have weightage of 11.25%, 5.08% and 2.28%, respectively in CPSE ETF.
CPSE ETF was set up in 2014 and the government has so far sold stake in the 10 companies in the basket in three tranches, thereby raising  ₹ 11,500 crore.
Currently, the government holds 53.34%, 54.80% and 52.02% stakes in GAIL, Container Corp and EIL, respectively.
When CPSE ETF was set up, a limit was fixed such that the stake sales could take place till the government holding in the 10 constituent companies reaches 55%. “Since the government holding in three CPSEs have fallen below 55%, we need to replace them with new scrips. The number of companies to be included in the basket would depend on the weightage these new scrips would carry in the CPSE ETF basket,"" an official told PTI.
ICICI Securities has been appointed as an adviser for the fourth tranche of the ETF, which will be launched once the Fund is reconstituted, the official said.
A final call on this would be taken by the inter-ministerial panel, chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley. Through the three tranches of CPSE ETF, the government has already raised  ₹ 11,500 crore -  ₹ 3,000 crore from the first tranche in March 2014;  ₹ 6,000 crore from the second in January 2017 and  ₹ 2,500 crore from the third in March 2017.

New Delhi:  State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) is not in a hurry to sell its stake in Indian Oil Corp and GAIL (India) and will wait for the right price before offloading the shares, a senior company official said.
ONGC holds 13.77% stake in oil refiner IOC and 4.86% in gas utility GAIL India.
“It is true that we are now a fully integrated company. We are India’s largest oil and gas producer and the acquisition of (oil refiner) HPCL has extended our presence in the downstream industries. “And so naturally, it now does not make sense for ONGC to hold stake in Indian Oil Corp (IOC). But, we will wait for the right price,"" said the official.
ONGC, he said, got over  ₹ 3,000 crore in dividend income from investments in IOC and GAIL in 2017-18 financial year.
“This is a decent return on capital and can help me hold on to shares for long,"" he said. “I am in no hurry to sell the stake. We will wait for the right price.""ONGC’s 13.77% stake in IOC at Monday’s closing price of  ₹ 153.80 apiece on BSE is worth over  ₹ 20,500 crore. Its 4.86% stake in GAIL is worth close to  ₹ 4,200 crore at Monday’s closing price of  ₹ 380.75.
“IOC shares were trading at around  ₹ 195 in January and are now at  ₹ 153-154. It doesn’t make sense to sell the shares at such a big loss,"" the official said.
ONGC, he said, is generating enough surplus mainly because of international oil prices spiking to four-year high and the rupee plummeting to an all-time low.
It is using these to pay off  ₹ 24,881 crore loan it had taken to buy Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for  ₹ 36,915 crore.
A third of the loan has already been pre-paid, he said.
 ONGC had borrowed  ₹ 24,881 crore on a short-term loan to fund buying of the government’s 51.11% stake in HPCL. The remaining came from its cash reserves.
The official said the pace of repayment may slow down in the third and fourth quarters owing to outgo on taxes and dividend as also the fact that capital spending would peak by then.
Initially, ONGC considered selling its stake in IOC and GAIL to fund the acquisition, but it has never found the right price to offload the shares, he said.
The short-term loan ONGC availed had a provision to prepay without any penalty.

Gail (India) Ltd’s September quarter profit surpassed analysts’ estimates by a wide margin. The gas transmission company’s net profit came in at  ₹ 1,963 crore, almost 50% more than a year ago. The consensus profit estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was  ₹ 1,518 crore.
There are some one-offs ( ₹ 210 crore staff costs,  ₹ 100 crore in transmission revenue,  ₹ 130 crore in trading) which broadly offset each other, with operating performance solid for most segments, analysts from Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd wrote in a 5 November report.
For the half year ended 30 September, net profit increased robustly by 38% from a year earlier, driven by good growth across businesses and a better operating environment.
Gail’s trading business performance was a positive surprise and helped its overall profitability meaningfully during the quarter. 
The trading segment’s earnings before interest and tax (Ebit) increased to  ₹ 1,045 crore from  ₹ 420 crore in the year ago period. Gail appears to have captured a substantial portion of the $2.35 per million British thermal unit spread in the US & Asian spot LNG prices, according to analysts from Jefferies. “Yet, this may be hard to repeat,"" added the brokerage.
Performance of the LPG and liquid hydrocarbons business was decent as well. On a year-on-year basis, Gail’s petrochemicals (petchem) business did not disappoint. The company reported a 89% increase in the segment’s Ebit. Higher sales volume helped. 
However, profits are lower compared to the June quarter. Separately, it came as a slight disappointment that gas transmission volume was lower than expectations at 106 million metric standard cubic metres per day. 
Nonetheless, better performance in other segments helped compensate transmission segment’s below-expected volume numbers to some extent.
IDFC Securities Ltd believes the momentum will be sustained over the second half of the year as well, with gradual growth in gas/petchem volumes, margin improvement in petchem and transmission and sustenance of earnings in the LPG and liquid hydrocarbons segment. 
This should propel a compounded annual growth rate of 27% in earnings per share over FY18-20E, with return on equity/return on capital employed expected to improve 390 basis points over the period, reckons IDFC Securities. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point. 
What of the stock?
So far this fiscal year, Gail India’s shares have appreciated 14%. Currently, the stock trades at 13.6 times estimated earnings for this financial year, based on Bloomberg data. That’s not too pricey. What’s more, the earnings outlook is bright."

New Delhi: State-owned gas utility company GAIL (India) Ltd is considering acquiring all of the wind energy assets held by subsidiary of debt-laden Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), according to people familiar with the matter.
GAIL India is looking to buy 775 megawatts (MWs) of wind energy assets from IL&FS Energy Development Co., a unit of IL&FS, and has approached investment bankers to advise on a possible deal, the people said, asking not to be named as the talks are private. The discussions are at a preliminary stage and a decision to bid hasn’t been made, the people cited above said.
A deal will give India’s biggest gas utility is an opportunity to add to its existing renewable energy portfolio of 129 megawatts (MWs) and help offset emissions. 
For IL&FS, the asset sales are key to revive the beleaguered shadow lender whose payment defaults have sparked fears of a contagion across the financial system in India.
People aware of the matter said GAIL would not consider buying the entire wind energy assets of IL&FS unless offered at a steep discount. 
“GAIL is not aware that IL&FS is in the market to sell its wind energy assets. When they come to the market and to us, we will have a look at it,"" said one of the officials aware of the matter.
An IL&FS spokesman declined to comment, while GAIL’s spokeswoman didn’t immediately respond to emailed queries.
GAIL had  ₹ 3,240 crore ($451 million) of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of 31 March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The wind energy assets held by the IL&FS unit are about 2% of the country’s installed capacity in the segment. 
IL&FS’s newly formed board said at the end of last month that resolution options could broadly involve significant capital infusion, asset sales and debt restructuring at group, business vertical or asset level. 
The government last month took control of the troubled shadow bank, promising to end the group’s string of defaults.

Mumbai: Joining the bandwagon of operational creditors unhappy with ArcelorMittal’s takeover plan of Essar Steel Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd registered its objection with the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 16 November. The state-owned gas utility has petitioned the bankruptcy court saying it would prefer a competing bid of Essar Steel Asia Holdings, representing the Ruia family, the former promoters of Essar Steel. 
Mumbai: Joining the bandwagon of operational creditors unhappy with ArcelorMittal’s takeover plan of Essar Steel Ltd, GAIL (India) Ltd registered its objection with the Ahmedabad bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 16 November. The state-owned gas utility has petitioned the bankruptcy court saying it would prefer a competing bid of Essar Steel Asia Holdings, representing the Ruia family, the former promoters of Essar Steel.
GAIL (India) Ltd had filed claims of  ₹ 907.2 crore against Essar Steel, of which only  ₹ 124.88 crore was admitted by the resolution professional.
ArcelorMittal’s Essar Steel bid offers no payment to GAIL for its outstanding dues, GAIL said in its application, while Essar Steel Asia Holdings Ltd promised the full payment of  ₹ 124.88 crore.
GAIL said ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan is “arbitrary, irrational, illogical and puts in jeopardy the interest of operational creditors of Essar Steel"". 
Mint has reviewed a copy of this application.
ArcelorMittal, for its part, has not indicated that it will increase its bid for Essar Steel to satisfy operational creditors.
A spokesperson for the Luxembourg-based steel company said: “We have followed the insolvency and bankruptcy code (IBC) process in good faith since first submitting our expression of interest (EOI) in 2017. The committee of creditors has clearly decided ArcelorMittal’s plan is in the best interests of Essar Steel and we are confident that the process will be implemented correctly and according to the law.""
Mint reported on Monday that the Gujarat Energy Transmission Corp. (Getco) has also challenged ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan, which has been endorsed by Essar Steel’s committee of creditors.

The Gujarat government-owned electricity transmission company has also approached the National Company Law Tribunal in Ahmedabad to recover its dues in excess of  ₹ 827 crore from Essar Steel.
With GAIL (India) Ltd application, the claims by Getco and a host of other operational creditors who had filed their objections to ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan, now amount to about  ₹ 1,600 crore.
ArcelorMittal’s Essar bid bid envisages an upfront payment of  ₹ 42,000 crore towards debt resolution and  ₹ 8,000 crore towards capital infusion into Essar Steel, while the Ruia-promoted Essar Steel Asia Holdings has offered  ₹ 54,389 crore to settle all financial and operational creditors.

On 25 October, more than 92% of Essar Steel’s creditors voted in favour of ArcelorMittal as it had placed the highest bid for the stressed assets.
However, on the same day, as a last ditch effort to delay losing possession of Essar Steel, the Ruia family had submitted a proposal to the committee of creditors (CoC) agreeing to pay  ₹ 54,389 crore to all creditors of Essar Steel, which included settling claims of operational creditors as well as of the employees in full—something that ArcelorMittal does not provide for.

The land will be transferred to GAIL India on the payment of  ₹ 46.40 crore, Cabinet Secretariat Department Principal Secretary Sanjay Kumar told reporters.
GAIL would be given 1.5 acres from the land belonging to the Bihar State Road Transport Corporation’s workshop located at Phulwarisharif, he said.
The move would help curb the air pollution of the state capital as CNG enabled vehicles would start plying on city roads, Kumar said.
The capital city, whose air quality has worsened in recent past, topped the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index on three consecutive day from January 1, 2019.
It also sanctioned  ₹ 8.20 crore for construction of temporary tent city at Kangan Ghat here on the occasion of Guruparv being organised between January 11-13 to celebrate the 352nd birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh, Kumar said.
Farmers would be given compensation for their crop damage due to the construction of tent city on their land, he said.

Ltd and Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets , are interested in acquiring the  ₹ 5,000- crore clean energy business of debt-laden Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS), said one person aware of the development.
The transaction for one of India’s largest wind energy platforms will rank among the marque deals in the space, given that IL&FS has operational plants aggregating 873.5 megawatts (MW) and 104MW under construction. This is part of the asset monetization programme being undertaken by IL&FS to reduce its debt burden of  ₹ 91,000 crore. 
“There is considerable interest in IL&FS’s wind energy assets with around half-a-dozen firms looking at it,"" said the person cited above, requesting anonymity. 
The other investors may include India’s largest power generation utility NTPC Ltd, GAIL (India) Pvt. Ltd and Solar Energy Corp. of India Ltd. According to a Bloomberg report on Tuesday, these companies have expressed interest in buying some of the renewable energy assets of IL&FS.
This follows the collapse of a plan to merge Orient Green Power Co. Ltd’s (OGPL’s) wind power business with IL&FS Wind Energy Ltd in 2017. The proposed sale also comes at a time when the wind energy sector has transitioned from a feed-in tariff regime, which ensures a fixed price for wind power producers, to tariff-based competitive auctions. In such a scenario, obtaining finance at the lowest cost has become key.
“The firms have been aggregating capacities through acquisition as part of their strategy,"" said another person who didn’t want to be named.
The asset monetization programme of IL&FS includes the sale of its securities business, green energy assets and road and EPC (engineering, procurement and construction) capabilities. All asset sales will be subject to approvals (including from the National Company Law Tribunal). The board has appointed Arpwood Capital Pvt. Ltd and JM Financial Ltd as financial and transaction advisers.
Mint reported on 22 November that Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and the Edelweiss Group, among others had been approached for the road assets of IL&FS Transportation Networks (ITNL), a unit of IL&FS.
ReNew Power counts Goldman Sachs, sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canadian pension fund CPPIB, Japan’s Jera Co. Inc. and Global Environment Fund among its investors.
IL&FS also has asset management services for wind energy and a business division conducting project development and implementation for the sector. It is also looking to sell solar power projects under development totalling 300MW capacity.
Spokespersons for Macquarie and ReNew Power declined to comment.
Queries emailed to the spokespersons of IL&FS, Arpwood Capital Pvt. Ltd and JM Financial Ltd on Sunday evening remained unanswered at press time.
The stake sale may be executed as a basket, or individually, or in any combination thereof. Serial debt defaults at IL&FS and its subsidiaries that triggered a liquidity squeeze in the non-banking financial sector prompted the government to supersede the board of the infrastructure lender on 1 October.
The news comes amid growing consolidation in India’s emerging green economy. Recently, Greenko Group—one of India’s largest renewable energy platforms—acquired Orange Renewable from Singapore’s AT Capital Group at an enterprise value of under $1 billion and another 385MW of renewable assets from Skeiron Renewable Energy.

NEW DELHI :
State-owned gas utility GAIL India Wednesday said it has terminated a  ₹270-crore pipe laying contract it had awarded to financially-troubled IL&FS and replaced it with another contractor.
The contract was terminated ""due to poor project progress driven on account of acute financial crisis,"" GAIL said in a statement here.
GAIL had last year awarded a portion of the 2,655-km of the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project to IL&FS.
The project, costing  ₹12,940 crore, originates from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia in West Bengal, with branch lines to Bokaro in Jharkhand and Dhamra in Odisha.
IL&FS Engineering and Construction Company, a unit of the troubled IL&FS group, had won two contracts last year to lay 160 km in the Dobhi-Durgapur stretch and 100 km in the Bokaro-Angul stretch of the project.
Other contractors have the mandate for the remainder of two stretches, which are together about 850 km long. The 260-km pipeline contract to IL&FS was worth about  ₹270 crore.
""The Bokaro-Durgapur section (124 km) is now re-tendered and awarded to three different contractors to expedite construction efforts for hooking up supply network to the fertilizer, city gas distribution and other industrial consumers,"" GAIL said.
The company said the project consultant, Engineers India Ltd, was replaced by MECON for overseeing the project activities under this crucial stretch.
Phase one of the project involving laying the pipeline to Dobhi, Patna, and Barauni in Bihar, will be completed this month. The pipeline will be also extended from Barauni to Guwahati in Assam, orders for which have also been placed.
As per the earlier plan, the project was targeted at meeting the energy requirements of 40 districts and 2,600 villages covering five eastern states -- Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, and West Bengal -- by 2020. The project was launched in October 2016 and is also known as Jagdishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL).
""In a swift move to safeguard project schedule of the Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga natural gas pipeline to eastern states, GAIL as the owner and operator of the prestigious project under execution has offloaded the pipe laying contract from IL&FS due to poor project progress driven on account of acute financial crisis,"" the statement said.
Post commencing supplies at Varanasi, the final leg of Phase-I (Phulpur-Patna section of about 585 km) of the 2,660 km pipeline project is now closer to readiness and natural gas supply to Bihar's capital Patna is expected to commence during the second fortnight of this month, GAIL said.
GAIL Chairman and Managing Director B C Tripathi re-affirmed the company's commitment to ensuring completion of Pradhan Mantri Urja Ganga project.
""Accordingly, Phase two of this project beyond Dobhi (Gaya) towards Durgapur-Haldia and Bokaro-Ranchi-Angul-Dhamra (1,900 Km) is slated for progressive completion by December 2020 whereas the 750 km pipeline from Barauni to Guwahati is expected to be operational by December 2021,"" it said.
The 750-km pipeline up to Guwahati will cost  ₹3,700-4,000 crore.
The project will usher in industrial development in the eastern part of India by supplying environment-friendly natural gas to fertiliser and power plants, refineries, steel plants, and other industries.
It will also provide clean energy to households and transportation in the cities en route the pipeline. The city gas network activities in Varanasi, Bhubaneswar, and Cuttack have already commenced. P"

Other constituents include Bharat Electronics, Engineers India, NBCC, NTPC, NHPC, SJVNL, GAIL, PGCIL and NLC India. Only three public sector banks — SBI, Indian Bank and Bank of Baroda — figure in the Bharat-22 index.
Also, the government’s strategic holding in Axis Bank, ITC and L&T, held through Specified Undertaking of Unit Trust of India (SUUTI), has been put in the ETF basket.
This would be the second ETF offering by the government in the current fiscal which ends in March. In November last year, the government had raised  ₹17,300 crore through a follow-on offer of another exchange traded fund — CPSE ETF, which comprises shares of 11 public sector enterprises. This was the biggest-ever fund raising from an ETF domestically."

Very soon Zomato will be delivering food at your doorstep using drones. The Gurugram-based company is building a hub-to-hub delivery network, which will use multi-rotor drones that can pick up a payload of under 5kg.
“We believe drones are an inevitable part of the future. Food delivery via drones will help reduce the last mile delivery leg and make the process more convenient and cost-effective,"" said Vikram Singh Meena, associate vice president, technology, Zomato, and founder of TechEagle.
Zomato is just a case in point. The drone space in India is on the verge of a major turnaround as a result of the green flag by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) in December 2018, and the yet to be released drone policy 2.0, which is expected to pave the way for wider application of drones in India. The domestic market for commercial drones will have a market value of $885.7 million, according to market intelligence firm BIS Research. With clarity on regulations, Indian companies are increasingly turning to drone-based solutions.
According to reports, Tata Steel is working with Skylark Drones, a Bangalore-based data analytics startup, to deploy drones at their Noamundi iron ore mines in Jharkhand, for compliance reporting and monitoring volumetric production. Skylark is also working with a major bauxite company, which is using their drone-based monitoring solution to ensure all equipment and manpower is being deployed at mines, according to plan, and is safe.
According to Skylark, it helped the company identify illegal mining during off season. Chennai-based DeTect Technologies has developed its own positioning system that works like an internal GPS of sorts, allowing its drones to monitor structures like a boiler inside a plant, autonomously. DeTect is working with Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil and GAIL.
“The amount of inspection done over several days can be heavily optimized and completed in a few hours with the use of drones and the analysis of that,"" says Daniel Raj David, CEO and co-founder, DeTect. Under the new policy, drones will need permission via the Digital Sky platform before they can take off. The new regulations, despite being somewhat more stringent than in other countries, have been received well by drone companies in India.
Mughilan Thiru Ramasamy, CEO Skylark Drones feels this is just the beginning of a new era and in the next two to three years more such use cases will come up, where drones will be deployed by enterprises for monitoring far-off sites and infrastructure that are not easily accessible such as a reservoir or a cell tower."

New Delhi: State-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd Friday said it has signed an agreement with Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) for cooperation in the development of solar power projects.
""GAIL shall be the project developer and BHEL shall act as an engineering, procurement, construction and project management contractor,"" the company said in a statement.
BHEL shall also provide operation and maintenance services during the initial period upon becoming successful bidder.
""This development will help both the companies to leverage their competitive strengths to build a substantial portfolio in solar power projects.
""The memorandum of understanding (signed Friday) aims at building a closer strategic partnership between the two Maharatna PSUs for jointly pursuing commercial solar power projects through participation in tariff / Viability Gap Funding (VGF) based competitive bidding process,"" it said.
GAIL is India's biggest natural gas company with diversified interests across the value chain of trading, transmission, LPG production and transmission, LNG re-gasification, petrochemicals and city gas.
It owns and operates a network of around 11,400 kms of high-pressure trunk pipelines. It is working concurrently on multiple pipeline projects, aggregating over 5400 kms at an investment of about  ₹24,000 crore, to operate over 16,000 kms by 2021.
GAIL commands 75% market share in gas transmission and has a gas trading share of over 50% in India.
""GAIL is also expanding its presence in renewable energy like solar and wind. It has India's second-largest rooftop solar PV power plant at its petrochemical complex at Pata, Uttar Pradesh,"" the statement said.
BHEL is one of the few companies in the world, and only company in India, having the capability to manufacture the entire range of power plant equipment.
It has also been in the field of design, engineering, manufacturing, installation and commissioning of solar power plants over three decades and has a portfolio of more than 700 MW.

Mumbai: In its first asset sale since going bust last year, Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) on Monday said it has agreed to sell its 874 megawatts (MW) operational wind energy portfolio to state-run gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd for  ₹4,800 crore. The sale will close in three weeks, IL&FS said in a statement on Monday.
Significantly, GAIL’s offer of  ₹4,800 crore at 100% enterprise valuation implies that the accumulated debt of  ₹3,700 crore on the wind power special purpose vehicles (SPVs) will be fully repaid. The equity value on these assets will be  ₹1,100 crore.
The sale is subject to various approvals, including from a foreign equity partner in the assets and company law tribunals. Another 104 MW of under-construction wind power project, a solar power portfolio of 300MW and renewable energy EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) business will not be part of the deal. A spokesperson for IL&FS said a separate sale process is on for the residual renewable energy businesses.
The sale process kicked off in November with an invitation for expressions of interest (EoIs). Although the wind portfolio received 22 EoIs, there were fewer binding bids. At the end of the bidding process, GAIL emerged as the highest bidder for seven operating wind power plants with a total generation capacity of 874MW at an average tariff of  ₹5 per kilowatt hour (kWh).
The proposal was unanimously approved by the committee of creditors of IL&FS Wind Energy Ltd (IWEL), the majority owner of the SPVs. The company said it is engaged with ORIX Japan, which owns 49% stake in the wind portfolio and has a first right of refusal on the sale if valuation doesn’t match previously agreed expectations.
The sale proceeds, as and when realized by IWEL, will be held in a trust for distribution to the relevant stakeholders, as per the resolution framework filed with the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal, the statement said. A conclusion of the sale process will also be subject to approval of Justice (Retd.) D.K. Jain and the National Company Law Tribunal as per the resolution framework.
With debt of over  ₹1 trillion, the government replaced IL&FS’ previous management with an Uday Kotak-led board of directors to oversee the company’s resolution process. IL&FS is implementing various asset monetization programmes to recover what it can and repay debt. This includes the sale of its securities business, renewable energy assets, roads portfolio and EPC capabilities. So far, binding bids have been received for the securities business and the renewable energy arm, the management had said a few weeks ago, although no buyer has been named."

NEW DELHI :
ExxonMobil Corp., the world’s most valuable energy company, may shortly form a partnership with state-owned GAIL (India) Ltd to set up a green energy platform in India.
The US oil firm’s increasing focus on India is an acknowledgement of the growing importance of the world’s third largest energy consumer. The proposed joint venture (JV) to be announced shortly by the Irving, Texas-based firm also marks a change in the global energy architecture, with India at the centre of oil majors’ future growth plans.
The proposed ExxonMobil-GAIL tie-up comes against the backdrop of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS) agreeing to sell its 874 megawatts (MW) operational wind energy portfolio to the state-run gas utility for  ₹4,800 crore in its first asset sale since it started defaulting on payments last year.
“The discussions are on. We are likely to make an announcement in a fortnight or so,"" said B.C. Tripathi, chairman and managing director, GAIL (India) Ltd.
Oil giants are looking to diversify and invest in India’s green economy as the conventional hydrocarbon space undergoes technological disruption. For example, Malaysia’s state-run oil and gas company, Petroliam Nasional Bhd or Petronas has acquired Amplus Energy Solutions Pvt. Ltd, one of India’s largest rooftop solar power producers.
“Gail will tie up with ExxonMobil for a new energy venture. They will set up a joint venture for green energy sources. ExxonMobil will invest in it. The idea is to expand their clean energy presence,"" said a second person aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
With the biggest expense being the cost of capital in the green energy business, the financial heft of global oil majors will help India’s clean energy sector. India has been working on the largest clean energy programme and has an installed renewable energy capacity of 74.79GW. Of this, solar and wind power accounts for 25.21GW and 35.14GW, respectively. India’s energy demand is expected to grow at 4.2% over the next 25 years.
An ExxonMobil spokesperson said in an emailed response on 10 May, “We do not have any information for your story."" The spokesperson instead recommended Mint to contact the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (ISPF) and the Federation of Indian Petroleum Industry (FIPI), an industry coalition.
A USISPF spokesperson in an emailed response said, “We’re reaching out to Exxon."" Queries emailed to FIPI on Saturday remained unanswered till press time.
Russia’s Rosneft, Norway’s Statoil ASA, France’s Total SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have also been exploring opportunities in India’s clean energy space. Some of these global majors already have a presence in the Indian conventional hydrocarbon space. While BP Plc partners Mukesh Ambani-controlled Reliance Industries Ltd in exploration and production ventures, the two are also partners in an equal joint venture for sourcing and marketing gas.
Also, Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s largest oil producer, is looking to reportedly buy a stake in RIL’s refining and petrochemicals businesses and has partnered with Indian oil PSUs for setting up the world’s largest oil refinery and petrochemical complex in Maharashtra. Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. (Adnoc), the state-run oil firm of the United Arab Emirates, has also picked up a part of Saudi Aramco’s stake in the $44 billion refinery.
The Adani group also recently entered into an agreement with France’s Total to jointly develop multi-energy offerings in the Indian market which include fuel retail and liquefied natural gas."

New Delhi: The storm unleashed by Avengers: Endgame has settled and Bollywood is slowly upping its game this summer.
Romantic comedy De De Pyaar De directed by Akiv Ali starring Ajay Devgn, Tabu and Rakul Preet Singh barely works as an age-gap saga but is more effective as a comedy about moving on and finding new soulmates, says Scroll. The writers heavily pad up material that is just about enough for an extended sitcom episode with songs (too many and all of them distractions), uneven comedy and needless melodrama. However, De De Pyaar De’s biggest achievement is that it might actually compel filmmakers to ask whether their leads are appropriately matched wrinkle for wrinkle rather than forcing chronological acrobatics on viewers.
The Indian Express calls the film a mixed bag. Starting off as a breezy older man-younger woman sex comedy, tipping over into an emotional family drama, and trying to sustain a progressive stance while keeping up the randy quotient: it’s both hit and miss.
For the Hollywood fans, American neo-noir action thriller John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum starring Keanu Reeves directed by Chad Stahelski comes to India this week. Variety magazine calls it an action spectacular as dazzling as it is deadening. As masterfully executed as the action is, watching two-plus hours of mayhem without any palpable dramatic stakes, or nuance, or any emotion at all save bloodlust offers undeniably diminishing returns. There are only so many times you can see a bullet pass through a skull before it gets deadening, and then almost dull.
Comedy drama, A Dog’s Journey, directed by Gail Mancuso starring Josh Gad, Dennis Quaid, Marg Helgenberger, Betty Gilpin, Kathryn Prescott, and Henry Lau is a corny canine caper, says The Guardian. A sequel to A Dog’s Purpose (2017), on a second runout, that USP seems less eccentric, but equally some of the oddball novelty has worn off. Four credited screenwriters merely use that astral projection to usher another conveyor belt of pooches through much the same cornily conservative scenarios the studios churned out in Rin Tin Tin’s heyday.
The Hustle, a comedy directed by Chris Addison starring Anne Hathaway, Rebel Wilson, Alex Sharp, and Dean Norris flutters and sputters and all too quickly goes splat, says Rolling Stone. The setups are flat, the jokes don’t land and the actors don’t — or won’t — connect.
Telugu film ABCD – American Born Confused Desi starring Allu Sirish and Rukshar Dhillon directed by Sanjeev Reddy fails to entertain, says telugu360.com. While there is little to engage with in the first half, the second half is more story-oriented.

Mumbai: Japan’s Orix Corp., which owns a 49% stake in each of the seven operating wind power plants of debt-laden IL&FS group, has expressed its intent to buy out the remaining 51% stake held by IL&FS Wind Energy Ltd (Iwel).
Orix will exercise its right under the terms of an existing pact with IL&FS (Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Ltd) wherein Orix can match the price offered by the highest bidder to buy Iwel’s stake in the wind power plants, IL&FS said in a release.
In April, state-run gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd had offered to pay  ₹4,800 crore (as enterprise valuation) for the 874-megawatt (MW) wind portfolio, subject to Orix agreeing to the sale. Orix, however, has now decided to buy out the remaining 51% stake by matching GAIL’s offer.
The sale process to Orix is expected to be completed by June, subject to necessary approvals, according to the statement.
The IL&FS group had amassed a debt of more than  ₹99,358 crore as of September 2018. Its default on debt payments caused a liquidity crisis in non-banking financial companies in India.
The completion of sale of special purpose vehicles to Orix will be subject to satisfaction of all compliances and approvals required under applicable laws—including approval of justice (retd.) D.K. Jain and the National Company Law Tribunal—in accordance with the proposed resolution framework, IL&FS said.
The sale proceeds, as and when realized by Iwel, shall be held in trust for distribution to the relevant stakeholders.

Mumbai: State-run Gail India plans to list its subsidiary Gail Gas and is aggressively investing in city gas distribution to create volumes before it takes the company to the market, a top company official said.
The Maharatna firm has planned a capital expenditure of  ₹54,000 crore, which it will spend over the next two-three years in laying of gas pipeline network that will feed households and industries such as fertiliser plants.
Out of this, Gail plans to invest  ₹12,000 crore in city gas distribution networks to retail CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to households in towns such as Varanasi and Patna.
""Listing Gail Gas is in my mind and we had earlier thought about it. As of now, the subsidiary has reported a topline of  ₹5,300 crore and  ₹120-130 crore of profit.""Last couple of years we have invested heavily in creating infrastructure alone and we believe we need to invest even more to get to the volume level,"" Gail India Chairman and Managing Director B.C.

MUMBAI :
State-owned GAIL India Wednesday approached the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking admission of its  ₹390 crore claim from Videocon Industries, which the resolution professional (RP) rejected earlier.
In an application, the counsel for GAIL said the state-owned gas utility, which is an operational creditor of Videocon, should be included in the list of creditors.
""We want to file an application seeking a claim of  ₹390 crore which the RP had rejected,"" the counsel told the tribunal.
The counsel based the application on a similar matter where GAIL, being an operational creditor, was allowed to be in the list of creditors for Essar Steel and Alok Industries by the Ahmedabad bench of NCLT, even as the RP had rejected both the proposals.
The NCLT's Ahmedabad bench has directed the RP to include GAIL in the list of creditors for both the companies.
The single bench of NCLT presided over by M.K.Shrawat, Wednesday fixed the next date of hearing on the matter for July 8.
Videocon Industries' total debt stood at  ₹19,506 crore as of March last year.
The tribunal had admitted the insolvency petition against the Videocon Industries on June 7 last year.

The Gail (India) Ltd stock was the top loser among the Nifty 50 stocks on Thursday, declining over 10%. Not without reason. A slew of brokerages have cut the company’s earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 3-4% for 2019-20 and 2020-21. These cuts were prompted mainly by the disappointment in tariff revision for its HVJ or Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline and HVJ upgradation of network pipelines.
The Street was factoring in higher tariff revision. Incorporating PNGRB’s tariff orders, Kotak Institutional Equities expects a 6% increase in Gail’s blended tariffs for gas transmission segment to  ₹1.57 per standard cubic meter (scm) for 2019-20. This is lower than the broker’s earlier expectation of  ₹1.62 per scm. Note that the measure stood at  ₹1.47 per scm in 2018-19.
PNGRB or the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board is the country's oil & gas regulator. Additionally, PNGRB has also revised tariffs for the Mumbai regional network.
“Contrary to wider expectations of increase in tariffs of HVJ system, thereby leading to substantial improvement in Gail's revenue (given HVJ system carries 60% of GAIL's volume), the tariff determined by PNGRB are a letdown,"" according to analysts from Antique Stock Broking Ltd in a report on 6 June. According to Antique, the Mumbai network carries just 3-4% of Gail's total volume.
Kotak cut its standalone EPS estimates to  ₹30.7 (-3%) in FY2020 and  ₹32.9 (-4%) in FY21 factoring in lower-than-assumed regulated tariffs for HVJ network, higher tariffs for Mumbai regional network and other minor changes.
After Thursday’s decline in share price, the Gail stock trades at around 10 times estimated earnings for the current financial year, based on Bloomberg estimates."
25,2019-06-12,GAIL,"GAIL said it will take over Konkan LNG’s entire debt of  ₹4,000 crore at a 15-20% discount on the total outstandingThe talks are at a nascent stage since the proposal requires an independent valuation of the stakes

State-run gas utility GAIL (India) Ltd has proposed to assume the debt of about  ₹4,000 crore of Konkan LNG Pvt. Ltd in lieu of receiving the lenders’ stake in the company for free, said two bankers aware of the discussions.
The talks are at a nascent stage since the proposal requires an independent valuation of the stakes held by the lenders in Konkan LNG, said the first person cited above.
“GAIL has said that it will take over the entire debt of Konkan LNG at a 15-20% discount on the total outstanding, but our equity in the plant should be transferred for free,"" the banker said, requesting anonymity.
Gail owned 25.5% in unlisted Konkan LNG in March 2018, according to a shareholding document from the registrar of companies (RoC). Another RoC document showed more than 260 million shares were issued to GAIL in August last year. The offer for issue of these shares on rights basis was made to existing shareholders on 24 July 2018. Only GAIL subscribed to 260 million shares, the document showed.
An undated shareholding pattern of Konkan LNG, available on its website, showed that GAIL now owns 56.71% of the paid-up share capital. The lenders—IDBI Bank, State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, Canara Bank and IFCI—collectively own 20.62%. Others include NTPC Ltd (14.82%) and Maharashtra State Electricity Board Holding Co. (7.85%). If approved by lenders, GAIL’s stake in Konkan LNG will increase to 77.33%.
Another banker, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that taking a 15-20% haircut on their loans will be feasible; however, they are not too sure about the free equity transfer proposal. “Following fresh equity infusion last year, GAIL has now become the largest shareholder in Konkan LNG and since banks are anyway exiting non-core businesses, the transaction will make sense if we are paid in exchange of our shares,"" he added.
Emails sent to GAIL and the lenders remained unanswered till the time of going to press.
An analyst tracking GAIL said that one possible reason for the company to take over the extra debt from lenders is to get full control of the plant and complete the breakwater facility pending for several years. With lenders, being part of the consortium, it would have been difficult to achieve a consensus on the financial closure of the project, the analyst said. “The offer to get the equity for free would not have been feasible without the offer to take over debt,"" he said.
The demerger of the LNG business of Ratnagiri Gas and Power Pvt. Ltd (RGPPL) into a new company, Konkan LNG, was filed for approval with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on 23 December, 2016. It was finally approved by the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on 11 March, 2018.
The debt restructuring proposal of RGPPL included bifurcation of existing loans of  ₹9,000 crore into RGPPL and Konkan LNG. About  ₹5,000 crore loans to RGPPL was then split into sustainable ( ₹2,000 crore) and unsustainable debt ( ₹3,000 crore) with the latter being converted into cumulative redeemable preference shares.
The sustainable loan was given a longer repayment term and interest rates cut from 13% to 9%. Meanwhile, Konkan LNG received additional loans of  ₹1,200 crore to build the breakwater facility. At present, the LNG facility is not an all-weather terminal since there is no breakwater, because of which, no cargoes are received during the monsoon period. The LNG terminal is designed to supply 2.1mmtpa of re-gasified LNG to RGPPL and the balance 2.9mmtpa is for re-gasification and transportation to catchment gas markets through a pipeline network.
RGPPL, earlier known as Dabhol Power Co., was conceived in the 1990s and originally promoted by the now-bankrupt US energy firm Enron Corp. The asset was transferred to the government in mid-2005, and the project was fully commissioned on 31 March 2010."

The planned tranche of CCDs issued in 2016 is part of a  ₹7,286-crore CCD programme of OPal, a joint venture between ONGC (49.4%), GAIL (India) Ltd ( 49.2%), and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (1.4%). OPaL used the proceeds to partially finance project expenditures and repay loans.
CCDs are financial instruments that have the feature of compulsory conversion into equity as per terms and are treated as quasi-equity.
The CCDs have an unconditional and irrevocable mandatory put option on OPaL’s sponsors, ONGC, for the buy-out of the CCDs at the end of the 35th month from the deemed date of allotment, as well as the undertaking to fund the coupon payment, according to the terms of issuance.
The sponsor would also have the right to buy out the CCDs at the end of the 24th, 30th, and 35th months from the deemed date of allotment, according to corporate filings. The CCDs have a tenor of 36 months from the deemed date of allotment and do not have any conversion option for the period it is held.
The ONGC board could, however, also consider extending the tenor of the CCDs, said the people cited above.
“Extending the tenor of the CCDs is also being deliberated upon. In case it is not approved by the board, ONGC may have to exercise the put option. CCDs will allow OPaL to maintain status quo on its equity structure and equity investor process induction process bringing in an investor by selling stake in the company will smoothen,"" said one of the persons mentioned above on condition of anonymity.
For more than three years, ONGC has maintained that it is in talks with interested potential petrochemical companies to sell a 25% stake in OPaL. The process has, however, faced unexplained delays.
“The potential investors are carrying out due diligence, including site visits and management interactions with OPaL and ONGC. However, the equity induction transaction may take time because of which ONGC has to buy back the CCDs,"" said an official from a professional services firm, requesting anonymity.
ONGC did not reply to an email sent on 19 June. An ONGC official dealing with the matter did not comment.
“There could be concern regarding valuation. Plus for Indian petrochemicals companies cost of capital is high and there is a lack of adequate infrastructure which puts our petrochemical manufacturers at a significant disadvantage compared to their counterparts in other countries,"" said the second person cited above, requesting anonymity.
OPaL is a $4.5 billion mega petrochemical project located at Dahej, Gujarat. It started production in 2016-17 and has been ramping up its production in phases. OPaL’s petrochemical complex houses India’s largest greenfield single-location, dual-feed cracker unit.
It has a capacity of cracking gaseous and liquid feed to produce 1,100 kilo tonnes of ethylene per annum (ktpa), which can produce a wide spectrum of chemicals.
OPaL competes with Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Reliance Industries Ltd, ONGC Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd (OMPL), and Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, which export petrochemical products in the international market. Reliance Industries is among the world’s largest producers of petrochemicals.
Petrochemicals account for nearly 30% of the Indian chemicals industry. An increase in consumption of plastics has lifted domestic demand in the past decade with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-9%.
In the past five years, domestic demand has logged a 7-8% CAGR amid healthy demand from end-use applications such as packaging, automobiles, and electricals and electronics.
India needs to actively encourage foreign direct investment in the petrochemical sector instead of free trade agreements to utilise growing domestic demand to create value within the country, according to a white paper titled Impact of Free Trade Agreements on Indian Petrochemical Industry, released in May by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry,"

NEW DELHI :
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is considering a plan to spin off the gas transmission business of GAIL India Ltd., the nation’s largest gas utility, into a separate unit, according to people with knowledge of the matter.
The oil ministry is seeking approval from the cabinet for splitting the transmission business from the gas marketing operations, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter is not public. GAIL has appointed an international consultant to determine tax implications after the restructuring, they said. Oil ministry spokesman declined to comment, while a GAIL spokeswoman didn’t respond to email seeking comment.
The plan to carve the pipelines business into a fully-owned unit will bring greater transparency between the two businesses and may allow the government to sell shares at a later date. GAIL owns two-third of India’s operating gas transmission network, and the pipelines operation accounts for close to 40% of its earnings.
The government is seeking to keep the pipeline business separate for GAIL to help the company focus on expansion of its network and, at the same time, be transparent in offering the infrastructure to all.

NEW DELHI :
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has opened an investigation into Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc, alleging the UK-based engine maker and its Indian arm improperly used a third-party to conduct business with three Indian state-owned companies.
In a report published on Tuesday, the CBI also said officials from the Indian companies - Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), ONGC and GAIL - may have been involved in improper procurement from Rolls-Royce.
Rolls-Royce provided engine spare parts to HAL for servicing gas turbines used by GAIL and ONGC, both of which are involved in the oil and gas sector, the report said.
The report said Rolls-Royce's appointment of Ashok Patni, director at a Singapore-based firm called Aashmore Private Ltd, as a commercial adviser in dealing with the three government-owned firms violated regulations and the arrangement may have been used for paying kickbacks to officials.
In an emailed statement, a Rolls-Royce spokesperson said that the police report related to the use of intermediaries by company’s erstwhile energy business in India, and that no current employee had been involved in those deals.
""We await contact from the CBI and will respond appropriately,"" the spokesperson said.
Spokesmen for GAIL and ONGC did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. Gopal Sutar, a spokesman for HAL, declined to comment.
Aashmore and Patni could not be immediately reached for comment.

MUMBAI :
Shell India, the local arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, on Tuesday sold its 10% stake in the city gas distribution business of Mumbai-based Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL) for  ₹770 crore.
According to stock exchange data, BG Asia Pacific Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of Shell, sold 9.98 million shares through block deals at  ₹780 each.
In 2016, Shell took over BG Group Plc and, subsequently, acquired its assets worldwide.
On 4 March 2019, Mint had reported about Shell’s plan to exit MGL.
When Mahanagar Gas was listed on 1 July 2016, Shell acquired a 34% stake in the company through BG Asia Pacific.
Last year, it offloaded 24% of its shareholding in two tranches—8.5% in April and 14% in August—in the open market through bulk deals.
This reduced Shell’s holding to 10%. With the latest stake sale, the company has exited the city gas business in India.
Guidelines issued by capital markets regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) stipulate minimum promoters’ contribution shall be locked in for three years from the date of allotment in a public issue.

VLADIVOSTOK :
India and Russia are targeting $30 billion of annual trade by 2025, India's foreign secretary said on Wednesday as a string of energy deals deepened economic ties between the nations.
Seeking to boost bilateral trade from its current $11 billion, the two countries announced deals in sectors including energy, defence and shipping after a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an economic forum in Vladivostok.
India, the world's third-biggest oil consumer and importer, aims to raise the proportion of gas in its energy mix to 15% in the next few years and diversify its energy supply to hedge against geopolitical risk.
""We have had a major breakthrough in the energy sector. This is a sector where we are looking to diversify our sources of supplies and we are increasingly finding it attractive to buy oil and gas from the Russian federation,"" India's foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, told a news conference.
Modi, who wants to cut India's oil imports by 10 percent by 2022, is steering efforts to buy foreign energy assets, taking advantage of low global oil prices and a slowdown in China's overseas acquisitions.
""We are looking at investing in additional oilfields in Russia ... we are also looking at sourcing LNG,"" Gokhale said.
Indian companies have stakes in Russian hydrocarbon assets including the Sakhalin-1, Imperial Energy, Vankor and Tass-Yuriakh fields, but it rarely imports oil from there because of logistical constraints and higher freight costs.
Gokhale said Putin wants safe, secure and cost-effective supply channels for India.
Among the deals announced on Wednesday, India's top gas importer Petronet LNG agreed to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Novatek and invest in the Russian company's future projects. The two companies will also look at joint marketing of the gas as a motor fuel in India.
Indian coal producer Coal India, meanwhile, signed a deal to mine coking coal in Russia's Far East, while private company H-Energy is looking at buying LNG from Novatek on a long-term basis.
Besides investing in each other's future LNG projects, Novatek and H-Energy plan to set up a joint venture to market Russain LNG in India, Bangladesh and other markets.
Indian gas company GAIL (India), which has a 20-year contract to buy LNG from Gazprom, is looking to acquire a minority stake in the Arctic LNG-2 project led by Novatek, Vedomosti business daily reported on Wednesday, citing India's oil minister.

15,2019-09-08,GAIL,"ED said the Rolls Royce made a payment of over  ₹77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from PSUs HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11The CBI complaint alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around  ₹4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013

New Delhi: The ED has filed a criminal case to probe money laundering charges in an alleged corruption case involving London-based Rolls Royce that is said to have made a payment of over  ₹77 crore as commission to an agent to win contracts from PSUs HAL, ONCG and GAIL during 2007-11, officials said on Sunday.
The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has booked the case under provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after going through a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) FIR, which was registered in the case in July this year, they said. 
Rolls Royce and its Indian subsidiary, Singapore-based Ashok Patni and his company Aashmore Pvt Ltd, and Mumbai-based Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd, besides unidentified officials of public sector units (PSUs) Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and GAIL were booked by the CBI for criminal conspiracy and bribery.
The CBI complaint alleged that the total business of HAL with Rolls Royce was around  ₹4,700 crore between 2000 to 2013.
It is alleged that Rolls Royce paid  ₹18 crore to Patni as ""commercial advisor"" in the 100 supply orders of Avon and Allison engines' spare parts to HAL between 2007-11, the bureau's FIR stated. The CBI action came after a five-year-long inquiry conducted by it. The inquiry was initiated on the basis of a complaint from the defence ministry that had received a letter about the engagement of Patni and his company by Rolls Royce. The ED will probe if these alleged corrupt practices led to the generation of slush funds which were laundered to create personal assets, the officials said. It will also investigate if the integrity pact was violated and kick backs were generated, they said. Rollys Royce, after registration of the CBI case, had said it will not tolerate business misconduct of any sort and it is committed to maintain high ethical standards.
""No one currently working for Rolls-Royce in India played any part in these energy deals. ""India is an important market for Rolls-Royce and the company has a valued workforce of skilled people in the country,"" a company spokesperson had said.
The CBI has charged that Patni was also engaged in direct contracts of Rolls Royce with ONGC and GAIL for the supply of spare parts.
Although contracts with ONGC and GAIL allowed services of an agent but it was mandatory to declare the name at the time of bidding, a condition violated by Rolls Royce, it said.
The company declared the name of its agent to the oil and gas sector behemoths in 2013, CBI alleged.
It is alleged that Roll Royce paid  ₹29.81 crore in 73 purchase orders from 2007 to 2011 for procurement of material and spare parts pertaining to the engines for ONGC, but the company declared it in 2013, it said. Roll Royce also paid one million British pounds with regard to 68 purchase orders from GAIL for spare parts from 2007 to 2010, it said.
The company entered in an arrangement with Turbotech Energy Services International Pvt Ltd and another company, Infinity, also owned by Patni, to which extra commission was paid, but not declared to GAIL, the CBI said.
The total commission paid by Rolls Royce comes to the tune of  ₹28.09 crore during the period 2007-10 for supplies to GAIL, it alleged.
There was an alleged conspiracy by Rolls Royce Plc and its subsidiary Rolls Royce India Pvt Ltd to misrepresent the facts before HAL regarding the engagement of the agent in order to win contracts with the public sector unit with ""deception"", it said.
The Indian Marine Gas Turbine unit of the HAL provides support in areas of inspection, spare parts, maintenance, equipment overhaul and assembly for industrial and marine gas turbines under licence from reputed manufactures.
The unit provides overhaul and repair of Avon and Allison engines for ONGC and GAIL for which spare parts are supplied by the energy division of Rolls Royce, it said.
The contract between Rolls Royce Power Engineering Plc and HAL was signed in June 2007, which was valid till December 2011, to provide maintenance, repair and overhaul services for units owned by the GAIL and ONGC under above licence from Rolls Royce.
""The purchase order condition specifically mentioned that Rolls Royce is not supposed to appoint any agent in India to promote this contract and no commission is payable to such agent,"" the CBI FIR has alleged.
It is alleged that Rolls Royce violated the condition of purchase order and integrity pact by engaging Patni and his company as commercial advisor from 2007 to 2011, and paid a commission ranging from 10 per cent to 11.3 per cent for supply of spare parts for the Avon and Allison engines.
The commission amount comes to the tune of  ₹18.32 crore during the period from 2007 to 2011 for the 100 purchase order, the CBI FIR alleged."

MUMBAI :
Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management and Singapore’s Temasek Holdings Ltd have joined the race to buy the gas pipeline assets of state-run Gail (India) Ltd, three people aware of the matter said.
A potential deal would be a vital win for Brookfield, which recently bought the gas pipeline assets of Reliance Industries Ltd. Gail owns more than two-thirds of India’s 12,000-km pipeline network.
Gail, which is in the process of divesting its pipeline business, has already received interest from state-run Indian Oil Corp. Ltd (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd (BPCL) for the gas transmission assets.
“Prospective bidders have begun initial discussions with Gail and are expected to put a formal offer once a formal sale process begins post the demerger,"" said the first of the three persons cited above, all of whom requested anonymity.
Brookfield and Temasek declined to comment emails sent on Friday.
The government has been planning to split Gail by hiving off its gas marketing and pipeline business into a separate entity and selling a majority stake in it to strategic investors. The government holds 52.68% in Gail, which had a market capitalization of  ₹59,195.61 crore as on 6 September 2019.
Gail’s marketing business brought in more than three-fourths of its total revenue in the last fiscal.
Gail, India’s biggest natural gas marketing and trading firm, is also adding another 9,000km of pipelines. The company dominates India’s gas marketing landscape with a 59% share.
Gail did not reply to an email sent on Friday on details of the stake sale process.
An IOCL official said the company sees huge value in Gail’s transmission assets as it plans to expand its own gas distribution network. IOCL, the second-largest gas marketer in India after Gail, has lined up aggressive expansion plans for city gas distribution.
A BPCL official said Gail’s transmission network will give a fillip to its plans of expanding in the gas distribution business. Last fiscal, BPCL hived off its gas business into a separate wholly-owned unit so that the company can sharpen its focus by bringing all natural gas-related businesses into one fold.
Spokespersons at IOCL and BPCL did not respond to emails sent on Friday on whether they plan to bid for Gail’s pipeline assets.
A second person, an investment banker aware of the talks said, “The RIL-Brookfield pipeline deal has set a precedent for such asset monetization. Gail too has been exploring this option. They have held talks with several investors including, Brookfield and Singapore’s Temasek"".
This March, Brookfield’s India Infrastructure Trust, an InvIT, bought RIL’s loss-making entity East-West Pipeline for  ₹13,000 crore. The InvIT took 100% stake in Pipeline Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd that owns and operates the East-West Pipeline.
Though Gail has argued that its gas marketing and transmission businesses operate at arm’s length and hence splitting them is of little significance, the government, in order to meet part of its  ₹1.05 trillion target for raising revenue from disinvestments this fiscal, is keen on the bifurcation.
To achieve its disinvestment target last fiscal, the government has sold its entire 51.11% stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd to state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) for  ₹36,915 crore.
Gail, which took shape in August 1984 after it was spun off from ONGC’s gas business, has multiple long-term contracts to import gas in its liquid form (LNG) from countries such as the US.
It is currently unclear if the strategic buyers would be given the responsibility of retaining these contracts. One option is to allow Gail to continue with the marketing business that would include all the sale contracts and the city gas retailing.
Since Gail has been maintaining separate accounts for its gas pipeline and marketing businesses, analysts said this makes it easier to split them into two entities. Gail’s networth rose to  ₹39,062 crore last fiscal from  ₹35,142 crore in the previous year."

West-Bridge Capital is in discussions to take majority control of Vini Cosmetics, valuing the maker of Fogg deodorants at about  ₹6,500 crore, two years after it first backed the Ahmedabad-based consumer goods company, The Economic Times reported citing people familiar with the matter. The India-focussed fund plans to pick up an additional 30% stake in the company from early investor Sequoia Capital and the promoter group for around  ₹2,000 crore. If the transaction goes through, WestBridge will end up with a slightly over 50% shareholding in the Darshan Patel-founded company. Vini was valued at  ₹4,000 crore in 2017, when it last raised capital from WestBridge, which has invested in Star Health Insurance and diagnostics chain Dr Lal PathLabs, among others. The due diligence process is currently ongoing and is likely to conclude in a month’s time. While Sequoia is expected to make a complete exit, the promoters will shed about 15% of their holding. Patel co-founded Vini with younger brother Dipam Patel in 2009 and they together own more than 60% in the company. Sequoia and WestBridge hold 17% and 20%, respectively. WestBridge would want to build Vini into a large consumer goods company by acquiring brands and possibly tapping the public markets at a later stage.

A surprise corporate tax cut will lay groundwork for “second order benefits"" for India’s economy over the next several months or even years, while providing a favorable backdrop for broader stock selection, according to BNP Paribas Securities India Pvt.
The brokerage has re-balanced its “quality list"" of stocks again after having made adjustments a day before the Indian government reduced corporate tax rates on Sept. 20. This time around it added companies ranging from large-cap stocks such as Britannia Industries Ltd. to smaller names including Manappuram Finance Ltd., Abhiram Eleswarapu, head of equity research at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a note published on Sept. 24.
“The rally in stocks after the tax reduction has provided immediate money in the hands of investors,"" he said by phone. “It provides confidence that the government is willing to do whatever it takes and will provide equity investors a chance to broaden the basket of stocks.""
India’s surprise tax cut came after economic growth in the April-June quarter slumped to its lowest level in six years, hitting the nation’s smaller stocks the hardest. While the implied valuations of 10-15 Nifty stocks are still at a premium to historical averages, the medium and smallcap indexes are still below their means, according to the BNP report.
Since the tax cut, mid cap stocks have jumped 9% while small cap names gained 7%. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex has climbed 8.3% in the last three sessions.
The gains show that the “first round impact"" of the tax cut on company earnings has been factored in, according to Eleswarapu.
Here are the key insights from the report
-Overweight India; retain Sensex target of 40,500 by December which is 3.6% above Tuesday’s close
-Tax cut to widen fiscal deficit by about 0.75% of GDP though it could be partly recovered through higher collections, divestment

10,2019-10-13,GAIL,"ONGC may now charge buyers $6-7 per mmBtu as gas prices remain subdued due to a global supply glutONGC plans to begin natural gas production from the deepwater block KG-DWN-98/2 in about two to three months

State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC) may be forced to sell natural gas at a discount to its originally expected price from its newest deepwater block in the Krishna-Godavari basin as gas prices remain subdued due to a supply glut internationally, three people directly aware of ONGC’s discussions said requesting anonymity.
ONGC plans to begin natural gas production from the deepwater block KG-DWN-98/2 in about two to three months and is expected to finalize shortly agreements for the sale of gas from the asset.
The company, according to the people cited above, has been in talks since August to assess demand potential from buyers which include Gail India and several city gas distribution companies. “Several buyers who have met ONGC have expressed reservations at buying gas at the upper ceiling, which was initially proposed by ONGC,"" said the first person cited above.
KG-DWN-98/2 is an ultra-deepwater, high-temperature and high-pressure field and according to a pre-determined pricing formula, ONGC can charge customers up to $8.43 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) fixed for the second half of this fiscal. This current ceiling price is 9.5% lower than the ceiling price of $9.32 per mmBtu fixed for the first half of this fiscal. Situated 35km off the Andhra Pradesh coast in the Bay of Bengal, the block would cumulatively produce around 25 million metric tonnes (mmt) of oil and 45 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas with peak production of 78,000 barrels per day of oil and 15mmscmd of gas. ONGC expects to bring first gas from this project to market by December-end and oil in 2020. “Given the pricing constraints, ONGC may now price the gas at around $6-7 per mmBtu, factoring in the current LNG spot price plus a markup price,"" said the first person cited above.
For the second half of this fiscal year, the government has notified a domestic gas price of $3.23 per mmBtu, a decline of 12.5% from $3.69 per mmBtu applicable in the fiscal first half.
This is expected to dampen the profitability of the gas producers, rating agency Icra said in a note on 1 October. The decline in domestic gas price is in line with the decline in global gas indices primarily Henry Hub over the fiscal first half. Also, with prices of gas at various international hubs remaining low, domestic gas prices are expected to remain depressed.
“At such low gas prices, gas production remains loss-making proposition for most fields for the upstream producers notwithstanding some decline in oil field services or equipment. Nonetheless, the depreciation of Indian rupee against the US dollar in the past few months provides some support to the realisations of the gas producers,"" said K. Ravichandran, senior vice-president and group head, Corporate Ratings, Icra, adding that with several new gas liquefaction capacities coming online globally, the supply glut is expected to keep prices of domestic gas low in the near to medium term, leading to poor returns even as domestic gas producers such as ONGC and RIL-BP ramp up gas production significantly.
Lower gas prices at international hubs has been further accentuated by the commissioning of new gas liquefaction capacities with about 35 million tonnes coming online in 2018 and another about 30 million tonnes expected to come online in 2019. Moreover, shale gas production continues to be healthy in the US. Accordingly, Asian spot LNG prices which remained at $9-11 per mmBtu during the winters of 2018-2019 have already declined to $5-6 per mmBtu.
For ONGC, a gas price lower than the ceiling of $8.43 per mmBtu would mean it has to take a hit on its profitability as buyers may prefer lifting gas from the spot market at $4-5 per mmBtu.
“Even if ONGC gets buyers at $7 per mmBtu, it will be a decent price for the company. More than that, it will be a case of opportunity lost for ONGC,"" said one of the three persons mentioned above."

NEW DELHI :
Essar Steel, Adani Group and state-owned GAIL have bought majority of natural gas from Reliance Industries' newer fields in the KG-D6 block at an indicative price of USD 5.04 - 5.16 per unit, industry sources said.
Essar Steel picked up 2.25 million standard cubic meters per day or about half of the available volumes in the day long auction conducted on November 15.
Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) picked up 1.2 mmscmd while Adani Group, Mahanagar Gas Ltd and GAIL bought 0.3 mmscmd each, sources said.
Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) bought 0.35 mmscmd and the remaining 0.10 mmscmd went to GSFC/GNFC.
Reliance and its partner BP Plc of the UK had sought bids from potential users for the 5 mmsmcd of natural gas they plan to produce from the R-Cluster Field in KG-D6 block from mid-2020.
Bidders were asked to quote a price (expressed as a percentage of the dated Brent crude oil rate), supply period and the volume of gas required. Dated Brent means the average of published Brent prices for three calendar months immediately preceding the relevant contract month in which gas supplies are made.
Sources said Reliance had set a floor or minimum quote of 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price -- which meant that bidders had to quote 8.4 per cent or a higher percentage for seeking gas supplies.
In the November 15 auction, bidders quoted between 8.4 and 8.6 per cent slope to corner all of the 5 mmscmd supplies available. This translates into a price of between USD 5.04 per million British termal unit and USD 5.16 per mmBtu rate at Brent oil price of USD 60 per barrel.
Sources said while bankruptcy-hit Essar bought gas to feed its steel plants, other buyers including Adani Group picked up the volumes for their city gas operations of retailing CNG to automobiles and piped cooking gas to households.
The volumes are mostly planned for usage in western India particularly in Gujarat where the gas can be delivered through a single pipeline - East-West pipeline. The delivered price in Gujarat is likely to be around USD 6.50 per mmBtu, they said.
Initially, Reliance had set a floor of 9 per cent of dated Brent price, which translated into a gas price of USD 5.4 per mmBtu at USD 60 oil price. But consumers saw this as a very high price considering that imported LNG in the spot market is available at around USD 4 per mmBtu rate currently.
To pacify the consumers, Reliance lowered the floor/minimum quote to 8.4 per cent of dated Brent price.
The company did not immediately respond to an email sent for comments.
According to the bid document, the gas price will be subject to the ceiling price mandated by the government. The ceiling price for gas from difficult fields such as those in deep-sea currently is USD 8.43 per mmBtu.
The government-mandated rate for other fields currently is $3.23 per mmBtu.
Reliance and BP are developing three sets of discoveries in KG-D6 block -- R-Cluster, Satellites, and MJ by 2022.
R-Cluster will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd while Satellites, which are supposed to begin output from mid-2021, would produce a maximum of 7 mmscmd. MJ field will start production in second half of 2022 and will have a peak output of 12 mmscmd.
Reliance has so far made 19 gas discoveries in the KG-D6 block. Of these, D-1 and D-3 -- the largest among the lot -- were brought into production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production from April 2009 and MA, the only oilfield in the block was put to production in September 2008.
While the MA field stopped producing last year, the output from D-1 and D-3 has fallen sharply from 54 million standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) in March 2010 to 1.68 mmscmd in the July-September.
Other discoveries have either been surrendered or taken away by the government for not meeting timelines for beginning production.
Reliance is the operator of the block with 66.6 per cent interest while BP holds the remaining stake in the block.

7,2019-11-24,GAIL,"The government is looks to further consolidate operations of public sector enterprisesThe government is likely to ask all oil sector PSUs would be asked to exit from their investments made in equity shares of other state-owned entities

NEW DELHI :
The government may end the cross-holding structure existing in the oil sector as it looks to further consolidate operations of public sector enterprises and go ahead with its privatisation plan by getting a fair valuation of assets.
Official sources said that that all oil sector PSUs would be asked to exit from their investments made in equity shares of other state-owned entities. This could be done in phases, depending on the market conditions, so that the shares get maximum valuation.
The cross-holding structure among oil PSUs was built in the late 1990s as the government sold its shares in Oil India Ltd (OIL), Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in a bid to raise funds.
Consequently, while GAIL and IOC hold 7.84 and 2.45 per cent stake, respectively, in ONGC, ONGC and OIL hold 14.20 and 5.16 per cent stake, respectively, in IOC. Also, IOC and ONGC hold 2.44 and 4.87 per cent stake, respectively, in GAIL India, and BPCL (2.42 per cent), HPCL (2.47 per cent) and IOC (4.93 per cent) together own equity partial equity in OIL.
Estimates suggest that if the government divests its stake by taking the entire proceeds from sale of shares cross-held by oil PSUs, it could mobilise upwards of  ₹40,000- ₹50,000 crore. However, it is likely that companies may plough back the money raised through equity sale to the government by declaring a special dividend.
""The government wants to end cross-holding in the oil sector as its consolidation and privatisation roadmap would create two to three large integrated entities. This would create a situation where cross-holding could be seen as anti-competitive and aiding conflict of interest,"" said one of the source quoted above.
Analysts also believe that offloading listed investments could make sense even for strategic investors looking to buy into Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) as it would reduce the risk of any future government intervention. Since a listed investment is as good as cash equivalent, it can be sold before disinvestment and the proceeds given as one-time special dividend. Under the cross-holding structure, BPCL continues to hold 2.47 per cent stake worth around  ₹400 crore in OIL.
To its advantage, BPCL has no cross-holding by any other PSUs that could have created problems in its valuation and sale to a strategic investor. Similarly, HPCL also does not have a cross-holding structure, one reason why its acquisition by ONGC last year proceeded smoothly.
According to analysts, ""other income"" as a percentage of profit before tax of the oil marketing companies ranged between 13 per cent and 28 per cent last fiscal. And this high level of income could impact valuation of companies as markets usually discounts 20-30 per cent as holding company discount to the listed investment.
Sources said that the Oil Ministry has already indicated to ONGC to exit from its investments in oil refiner and marketer IOC and gas transportation utility GAIL India, while the other two would also sell all their equity in the upstream company.
""Each oil PSU has to take a call when the time is right to offload stakes held in others as cross-holding investments are dividend paying and exits should only be made at the right value and when market conditions are stable. Hopefully this call could be exercised in the last quarter of current fiscal,"" said a top official of a PSU oil company.
It is not that companies have made major gains from cross-holdings. In fact, with volatility in the oil market and the government's decision to seek OMCs take up some burden to soften the rise in petrol and diesel prices have taken a toll on OMC shares in the past and has thus reduced the value of their investments."
6,2019-11-28,GAIL,"If ONGC converts share warrants worth  ₹2,600 crore into equity, its share in the project could rise to 70%Petrochemicals make up nearly 30% of India’s chemicals industry

Unable to attract a strategic partner for ONGC Petro Additions Ltd (OPaL), Oil and Natural Gas Corp. has shelved its stake sale plans for the petrochemical unit, said two people aware of the development, requesting anonymity.
OPaL, a joint venture between ONGC (49.4%), GAIL (India) Ltd ( 49.2%) and Gujarat State Petroleum Corp. Ltd (1.4%), has set up a grass root mega petrochemical complex at Dahej, Gujarat.
For over four years, ONGC has maintained that it was in talks with Saudi Arabia’s Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (Sabic) and Saudi Aramco for selling a 26% stake in OPaL.
“The stake sale process is not going ahead as it did not yield any result. So, for the time being, ONGC has decided to make OPaL a subsidiary,"" said a banker aware of the development, adding that ONGC will now have to convert its share warrants and debenture into equity.
If ONGC converts share warrants worth  ₹2,600 crore into equity, its share in the project could rise to 70%. Besides, if it also decides to convert debentures worth  ₹7,778 crore into equity, its share could rise to about 93%. After turning OPaL into a subsidiary, ONGC could consider listing it in two years.
OPaL is a $4.5 billion petrochemical project.
It began operations in 2016-17 and has been ramping up production in phases. OPaL’s complex houses India’s largest greenfield single-location, dual-feed cracker unit. The company primarily manufactures polymer, a chemical compound used in various products ranging from textiles to plastics.
ONGC and OPaL did not respond to an email query sent on Monday.
However, a senior ONGC official said: “Offtake from OPaL is increasing and, even if OPaL is technically a separate entity, all feedstock is taken from ONGC. We see the contribution from petrochemicals to increase (in ONGC’s topline) and, thus, we may convert OPaL into a subsidiary."" Though OPaL was meant to export most of its products, it is currently exporting less than 15%. So, considering the increased domestic demand, ONGC had said in October that it was working towards getting the domestic tariff area (DTA) access against its present Special Economic Zone (SEZ) tag.
Petrochemicals make up nearly 30% of India’s chemicals industry. An increase in plastic consumption has led to domestic demand rising at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8-9% over the past decade."
5,2019-12-22,GAIL,"GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the governmentSources said dues being sought are more than three times the networth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned

New Delhi: The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has sought  ₹1.72 lakh crore in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's ruling on revenues that need to be taken into consideration for payment of government dues.
Sources with direct knowledge of the development said DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking  ₹1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence.
In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.
The firm told DoT that it had obtained ISP licence in 2002 for a period of 15 years, which expired in 2017. But GAIL never did any business under the licence and since no revenue was generated it cannot pay any amount.
On IP-1 and IP-2 licences, GAIL has told DoT that it generated  ₹35 crore of revenue since 2001-02 and not  ₹2,49,788 crore that has been considered for levying past dues, they said.
Sources said the dues being sought are more than three times the networth of GAIL and several times the actual revenue earned.
The Supreme Court had on October 24 ruled that non-telecom revenues earned by firms using spectrum or airwaves allocated by the government will be considered for calculating statutory dues.
While telcos such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea may have had non-telecom revenues generated from using the government licence and spectrum, firms such as GAIL had no such revenue.
DoT is seeking  ₹1.47 lakh crore from all telcos in past statutory dues.
Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking  ₹1.25 lakh crore from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence.
PowerGrid says it has an adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of  ₹3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to  ₹22,168 crore.
Infrastructure provider category- I (IP-I) are those infrastructure providers who provide assets such as dark fibre, right of way, duct space and towers to the licensees of telecom services.
GAIL has a vast network of gas pipelines and it laid optic fibre along it to provide bandwidth to third parties.
Issuance of IP-II licence was discontinued in December 2005.
Sources said DoT estimates that the telecom operators owe  ₹55,054.51 crore as spectrum usage charges (SUC) as on October 31, 2019, while the figure for licence fees stands at  ₹92,642 crore.

1,2019-12-29,GAIL,"DoT has made it clear that the AGR order will apply to all licencees, including companies such as GAIL, RailTel, and Power GridThe DoT has sought  ₹1.72 trillion in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India following the Supreme Court's AGR ruling

NEW DELHI :
After sending out notices to firms such as gas utility GAIL for crores of rupees in past dues, the Department of Telecommunications has said that any relief to non-telecom companies from payment of enhanced levies can come only from the Supreme Court.
The Telecom Department is current ""examining"" the replies given by the state-owned non-telecom corporations on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) dues, a senior official said.
""They have sent their replies, which we are examining. We believe that they will have to go to Supreme Court to seek notification or clarification on whether they are included or not included in this (Supreme Court order). That is for them to seek,"" the Telecom Department official told PTI.
There are certain cases where players were parties in the court and in those cases the companies are bound by the court order. Some parties have also filed review petition, the official noted.
""Then there were others who were not parties, they will have to take a call because our assessment is that it will be applicable...we are examining the issue but in our assessment they will probably have to go to SC to seek a clarification,"" the official added.
As it is, Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and other telecom companies owe the government nearly  ₹1.47 trillion in past statutory dues. These AGR liabilities arose after the Supreme Court in October this year upheld the government's position on including revenue from non-telecommunication businesses for calculating the annual AGR of telecom companies, a share of which is paid as licence and spectrum fees to the exchequer.
The apex court allowed three months to the affected companies to cough up the amounts due to the government.
The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) has meanwhile made it clear that the AGR order will apply to all licencees, including companies such as GAIL, RailTel, and Power Grid.
As things stand today, such players, despite a smaller telecom exposure, may have to pay liabilities computed on their entire revenue.
Non-telcos, such as internet service providers (ISPs), had argued that DoT has unnecessarily imposed the order on internet service providers, many of which are run by entrepreneurs in smaller cities and towns. It had also sought intervention of the Prime Minister's Office (PMO) to resolve this issue.
The DoT has sought  ₹1.72 trillion in past statutory dues from state-owned gas utility GAIL India Ltd following the Supreme Court's AGR ruling.
DoT sent a letter to GAIL last month seeking  ₹1,72,655 crore in dues on IP-1 and IP-2 licences as well as Internet Service Provider (ISP) licence. In response, GAIL has told DoT that it owes nothing more than what it has already paid to the government.
Besides GAIL, DoT is also seeking  ₹1.25 trillion from PowerGrid which had both a national long-distance as well as an internet licence. PowerGrid says it has an AGR of  ₹3,566 crore since 2006-07 and after adding penalty it comes to  ₹22,168 crore."
