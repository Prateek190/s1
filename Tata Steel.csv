128,2019-03-06,Tata Steel,"Titan’s present market cap at  ₹90,000 crore outweighs that of revenue giants like Tata Steel & Motors

In a $110 billion group, comprising 30 companies scattered across such diverse areas as steel and software, who would have thought that a small watch company would emerge as the second largest in terms of market capitalization and the fastest growing over the last three years?
Yet, this week, as a Business Standard story pointed out on Monday, Titan’s market cap scaled  ₹90,000 crore, well below that of software heavyweight Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), but nearly 60% more than that of revenue giants Tata Steel and Tata Motors.
Titan’s success is the story of steady and sterling leadership by two men, Xerxes Desai and Bhaskar Bhat, who helmed the company for all its 34 years in business. Desai, the man who wanted to be an Oxford don but came back at J.R.D. Tata’s bidding to set up a watch company, presided over the company’s first decade and a half of growth, in which time it established itself as India’s leading watch brand. Under Desai, the humble watch—till then symbolized by public sector entity HMT’s mechanical products or imports from abroad—became a fashion statement, a symbol of class best exemplified by its signature tune, an excerpt from Mozart’s 25th Symphony, personally picked by Desai.
However, by the end of the last century, as the watch business slowed, the company’s diversification into the jewellery business in 1995 was weighing heavily on its overall performance, already dragged down by debts following an ill-advised blitz into several European markets.
Enter Bhaskar Bhat as managing director in 2002. Tasked with engineering a turnaround of sorts, he faced a baptism by fire as a large-scale layoff was followed by a lockout at the company’s plant. After dousing those early fires, Bhat proceeded to execute a well-honed strategy of entering unorganized segments of the Indian market and gentrifying them. With this came crafted watches, jewellery, youth accessories such as bags and belts, eyecare products and, later, fragrances and saris.
The results have been spectacular. Titan is today one of the two jewels in the Tata crown. And, therein lies the problem, since its continuing success casts a questioning shadow over many of the other companies that are a part of India’s largest conglomerate and have, for years, been sucking up resources without really delivering results.
The conglomerate model, as rolled out by the likes of Harold Geneen and Jack Welch, was a consequence of the low interest rate regimes in the US following the Second World War, which in turn, helped finance a spate of leveraged buyouts. Conglomerates made sense till such time as capital markets lacked the depth and sophistication needed to back businesses at various stages of evolution and growth. They lost steam once those markets evolved to serve all comers.
Through the 1960s, Geneen made hundreds of acquisitions across a diverse collection of businesses ranging from telegraph equipment to insurance and hotels, to build International Telephone and Telegraph Corp., the company he headed, into a $17 billion conglomerate by 1970. Today, some four decades later, all that remains of that diversified portfolio colossus is a $2.5 billion business making specialty components for the aerospace, transportation, energy and industrial markets.
By the 1990s, most US corporations had come around to reaffirming their faith in specialization and focus, prompted in large measure by the teachings of management gurus like the late Coimbatore Krishnarao Prahalad, who in 1990 co-authored an article for the Harvard Business Review titled The Core Competence Of The Corporation, in which he urged executives to identify their organization’s core competencies that could foster growth.
It wasn’t as if the conglomerate idea fell off the cliff overnight. A 1994 study showed that for each of the years 1985, 1989 and 1992, over two-thirds of the Fortune 500 companies were active in at least five distinct lines of business.
Late last year, United Technologies, one of the best known industrial conglomerates after its acquisition of Otis Elevator in 1976 and Carrier Refrigeration in 1979, announced that it would spin off both those divisions into separate companies and focus on its core aerospace business.
This, coupled with the struggles of General Electric—once the world’s largest industrial conglomerate—as it looks to sell off pieces of its operations indicates that the era of conglomerates seems to have ended in the US.
In India though, conglomerates still rule the roost, accounting for nearly 50% of the corporate sector’s revenues. Yet, the success of focused companies in newer businesses such as IT, telecom, banking, auto, aviation and e-commerce shows that the conglomerate premium may be declining even in India. A study by Bain and Co. last year concluded: “Conglomerates in India and Southeast Asia no longer hold an advantage in total shareholder returns over pure plays and have begun to underperform in revenue growth and margin improvement.""
Significantly, the study’s list of conglomerates in the region that have continued to thrive despite the odds had a number of Indian groups, including Bajaj, Wadia, Murugappa, Lalbhai, Godrej, Emami and Torrent, but not Tata.

127,2019-03-07,Tata Steel,"Two of the people said the groups would argue that remedies in the areas of electrical and galvanised steel were not neededA spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said the company was in constructive talks with the Commission

Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel will not go very far in concessions to gain approval for a planned steel venture, four people familiar with the matter said, adding their offer might not be enough to satisfy the European Commission.
The two companies last year struck a landmark deal to combine their European steel units to create the continent's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, a move that must be cleared by the European regulators.
While Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are working on a remedy package, they are unlikely to make far-reaching concessions, three people familiar with the matter said, increasing the risk of a lengthy tussle with the Commission.
Two of the people said the groups would argue that remedies in the areas of electrical and galvanised steel were not needed.
A spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said the company was in constructive talks with the Commission and that it remained confident that the transaction could be completed in the spring. Tata Steel was not immediately available for comment.

New Delhi: The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) Friday directed the Delhi bench of the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to decide on JSW Steel Ltd's bid for the debt-ridden Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd by 31 March.
A two-member NCLAT bench, headed by chairman justice S.J. Mukhopadhaya, has also directed NCLT Delhi to hear the representatives of operational creditors, promoters as well as dissenting banks.
""We expect adjudicating authority (NCLT) to decide the case at an early date to ensure that the matter is decided before the end of this financial year,"" the appellate tribunal said. During the proceedings, Bhushan Power promoter Sanjay Singal through his counsel offered to settle all dues of the lenders.
On this, the appellate tribunal directed NCLT to also take a decision over Singal's offer to settle. ""Liberty is given to adjudicating authority to decide who should be heard as representative of operational creditors or promoters or dissenting financial creditors, if any,"" it said.
On 4 February, NCLAT dismissed Tata Steel Ltd's plea and upheld lenders' decision to approve resolution plan of JSW Steel for Bhushan Power and Steel.
Tata Steel had challenged an NCLT order that allowed Bhushan Power's committee of creditors to accept the resolution plan submitted by Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House. Tata Steel had contended that NCLT cannot provide numerous opportunities at the belated stage. The NCLAT had said the CoC's decision was well within its rights to negotiate better terms with resolution applicants.
JSW Steel had revised its offer for Bhushan Power from  ₹11,000 crore to  ₹18,000 crore and later to over  ₹19,000 crore, whereas Tata Steel's last offer was at  ₹17,000 crore and it refused to revise its bid."
126,2019-03-09,Tata Steel,"ArcelorMittal, which has been seeking to acquire Essar Steel since 2017, had made a  ₹50,000 crore bid for the bankrupt firmWhile ArcelorMittal welcomed NCLT Ahmedabad's order, Essar Steel says its settlement proposal of  ₹54,389 crore is 'most compelling'

Mumbai: More than a decade after his first abortive bid, steel baron Lakshmi Niwas Mittal moved closer to his plans to enter the Indian steel industry on Friday. Indian-born Mittal’s steel company, ArcelorMittal SA, is the world’s largest by volume but, ironically, doesn’t have a steel plant to its name in India.
After over a year of legal wrangles with bidders, courts and banks, the Ahmedabad bench of National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) on Friday approved ArcelorMittal’s resolution plan for debt-laden Essar Steel Ltd.
ArcelorMittal, in a joint venture with Japan’s Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp., has offered an upfront cash settlement of  ₹42,000 crore to lenders and a  ₹8,000 crore capital infusion. ArcelorMittal is also planning a  ₹18,697 crore capital expenditure programme for the asset till 2024, according to its 2018 annual report.
In its order, the NCLT, however, asked ArcelorMittal to offer 15% of the upfront cash settlement of  ₹42,000 crore, or  ₹6,300 crore, to operational creditors. The original resolution plan only offered  ₹196 crore to operational creditors against claims of  ₹4,976 crore. The NCLT order means financial creditors—the banks—will have to take a deeper haircut on the asset.
The approval comes after the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on 28 February directed NCLT Ahmedabad to take a decision on ArcelorMittal’s offer for Essar Steel plan by 8 March.
On 29 January, NCLT Ahmedabad had rejected a full debt settlement proposal of  ₹54,389 crore from the shareholders of Essar Steel. The tribunal ruled that the offer violates Section 12A of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), which says the promoters can retrieve a company from bankruptcy proceedings by paying full settlement but not after other parties have submitted their expressions of interest.
“We welcome today’s pronouncement by the NCLT Ahmedabad. While we will need to review the full written order once it becomes available, we hope to complete the transaction as soon as possible,"" said a spokesperson for ArcelorMittal.
An Essar spokesperson said: “We continue to believe that our settlement offer of  ₹54,389 crore is the most compelling one available to Essar Steel creditors and fulfils IBC’s declared overriding objective of value maximization, which has been established time and again by courts at all levels. We are also confident of the legal validity of our said offer made under Section 12A, which provides for the withdrawal from the IBC process by making full payment to the creditors. We are awaiting a copy of the NCLT order and will take a call on next steps after examining the same.""
The Essar Steel acquisition will give ArcelorMittal control of India’s largest single-location flat steel mill in Hazira, Gujarat, with a nameplate capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum. However, the plant is operating at much lower capacities and will need significant investment to run at full capacity. The asset also has two iron ore pelletisation plants, at Visakhapatnam and Paradip, and a downstream steel hub in Pune, close to a automobile manufacturing hub.
While ArcelorMittal has proven expertise in turning around sick steel units and driving down costs till the plants turn viable, Essar Steel's turnaround will be its most ambitious yet.
“The Essar Steel plant has always been the highest-cost flat producer in the country,"" Atanu Mukherjee, president at M.N. Dastur and Co., a global metals and energy consultant, said in an interview two weeks ago. “Its products are generally priced at $480-490 a tonne on the cost curve, while competitors JSW Steel and Tata Steel, with much lower costs of production, cash in on high margins as the highest cost producer sets the price ,"" he said.
If ArcelorMittal enters India and sets the sick Essar Steel unit right, it will “flatten the cost curve"" through investments and operations management, thus eating into the margins of competitors. That’s one reason steel producers would prefer a struggling steel plant on India’s western coast rather than one that is up and running, Mukherjee said. “The ensuing competition that ArcelorMittal is going to force on incumbent players could thus be intense,"" he said.

ArcelorMittal is the world’s leading steel and mining company, with a presence in 60 countries and an industrial footprint in 18 countries.
Mittal made several attempts to get his foot in the door in India, notably with projects planned in Odisha and Jharkhand in 2005 and 2006, but none took shape. In 2010, the company signed an agreement with the Karnataka government to set up a 6 million tonne per annum capacity, but the land acquisition process for this project has only just been completed.
The bulk of Essar Steel’s steelmaking capacity is built to run on natural gas. Operations at the plant ran into trouble in March 2011 when the then government changed its gas allocation policy and cut off the supply to the company after categorizing the steel sector to “non-core"" from “priority"". The company has said in the past that it had to bear a loss of approximately  ₹26,000 crore between 2011 and March 2016 due to non-supply of gas.
In May 2017, Essar Steel’s lenders—with the State Bank of India as the consortium leader—had come close to finalizing a restructuring proposal for the company. However, in June, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) identified the asset as among its ""dirty dozen"" for immediate resolution at the bankrutpcy courts."

NEW DELHI :
Tata Steel BSL said on Monday its board has approved an increase in the company's authorised share capital, and given nod for issuance of 11.09% shares to Tata Steel on a private placement basis.
The proposals were approved in an extraordinary general meeting, chaired by Tata Steel BSL Chairman T V Narendran.
The members of the board passed a resolution for an increase in the authorised share capital of the company and consequential amendment of the capital clause in the memorandum of association of the firm, the company said in a regulatory filing to the BSE.
Proposal to ""issue, offer and allot 11.09% non-convertible redeemable preference shares to Tata Steel Ltd, on private placement basis"" was also passed besides plan to ""issue, offer and allot 8.89%  optionally convertible redeemable preference shares to Tata Steel Ltd, on private placement basis"".

123,2019-03-12,Tata Steel,"Companies are complaining about the endless host of litigation that they face under IBC codeOperational creditors, who are unhappy with the settlements, often stall the insolvency process

Mumbai: Now that two years have passed since the first major acquisitions under Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), several players—buyers, investment bankers and dissatisfied creditors—are slowly opening up about what they see as chinks in India's bankruptcy law.
These include repeated litigation—both during and after the process—missing physical assets in plants, the lack of judges and questions over the integrity of promoters of distressed businesses and resolution professionals.
The cracks in the resolution process are evident from the following developments:
■ After acquisition of Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel Ltd in September 2018, operational creditor Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) and unsecured creditor IFCI Ltd have challenged the resolution plan.
■ The bidders for Amtek Auto and its unit Metalyst Forgings—London-based Liberty House and US-based hedge fund Deccan Value Investors, respectively—are challenging the information provided to them by the resolution professional during the bidding process. While Deccan Value Investors has asked NCLT to cancel its resolution plan, Liberty house has alleged in court that the contents of a forensic audit conducted by EY into Amtek Auto were not revealed to it.
“Often, resolution professionals are ill-equipped to fully oversee operations at companies. In other cases, there are serious integrity issues among resolution professionals and promoters,"" an investment banker said on condition of anonymity. “We know of cases where equipment has been stolen from plants during the resolution process. In some cases, promoters litigate to draw out the resolution process while we hear of money being siphoned away from the company during this period."" 
Mahesh Singh, founder and managing director, Singhi Advisors, said sometimes assets do go missing at the time of closure of the deal. “Buyers should get a chance to do the closing due diligence. Even so, there are legal remedies for when assets are missing because there is always a lag between selling a business and finally getting possession.""
Godrej Group chairman Adi Godrej said: “The bankruptcy code has been very poorly implemented because there have been so many cases of bankruptcy which have not been finalized. We allow them to go from one court to another and then we give them stay order. Our judicial process is very slow. “It (IBC) is not being implemented as well as it could have been. That is not perhaps for lack of trying but it is also our legal system and legislation.""
JSW Steel's joint managing director, M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao said in a recent interview: “Under IBC, once a case in admitted, whatever cases are pending against a company, there is a moratorium on them. But once the resolution plan is approved, all of these spring up again. We are seeing this in several forums, in all companies that have been acquired, not just ours. I think some clarity is required here so winning bidders feel more comfortable that once the settlement is paid, everything else is extinguished.""
The major acquisitions under IBC were those of Bhushan Steel by Tata Steel Ltd; Binani Cement Ltd by UltraTech Cement Ltd; and Monnet Ispat by JSW Steel-AION Capital.
Kalpesh Kikani, managing director and senior partner, AION Capital, said at the Mint Investment Summit in Mumbai on 1 March: “First, the challenge is getting to know what the true price for the asset is. Step 2 is who gets how much among various financial creditors, be it secured, unsecured, secured with guarantee, unsecured with guarantee, and then you have some operational creditors who believe they are equal to financial creditors and others who believe they are better than financial creditors in terms of supplying (goods to a company even during distress). This Stage 2 of who gets how much is an integral part of IBC and will be the subject matter of litigation—and as a bidder this is something we always factor into our bids."""
122,2019-03-13,Tata Steel,"A slowdown in steel demand from auto and real estate sector raises questions on sustained steel production growthThe slowdown in large user industries can make it tough for Indian steel producers to pass on price hikes

After a slow start to the year, steel production in India picked up in February, rising 5.7% from a year ago. Data from the joint plant committee compiled by SBICAP Securities Ltd also shows a healthy growth in steel demand, with consumption increasing by 8.6% last month. However, amid the mounting evidence of demand slowdown in user industries such as automobiles and real estate, questions about the sustainability of the rebound in steel production refuse to go away.
Towards the end of last year, customers had reduced purchases, anticipating a further fall in steel prices. Responding to this, steel producers had tempered production. However, as the turn of the calendar year triggered new purchase cycles at the customers’ end, companies stepped up production. The rebound this time is aided by a disruption in iron ore production in Brazil and a subsequent rise in steel prices. The price rise appears to have prompted restocking by customers.
However, beyond cyclical factors, such as inventory restocking and advance purchases to hedge against the likelihood of a price rise, there is little evidence of a firm rebound in demand. Rather, the slowdown in large user industries can make it tough for the steel producers to pass on price hikes.
The automobiles industry, for instance, is a major user of flat steel products and the slowdown in vehicle sales is resulting in discounts by auto firms to reduce inventories. “Passenger vehicles and two wheelers demand continues to remain weak. Hence, not surprisingly, incentives are back. Channel inventory, which also had been in correction mode, has jumped to 60 days,"" add analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd.
The slowdown in project launches in the real estate sector, a user of long steel products, will not help either. Launches in the 12 months to December 2018 are down 10% in the real estate sector, according to Kotak Institutional Equities Research.
The impact can be mitigated by sustained government-led spending in the infrastructure sector. Even so, the subdued demand conditions in key user industries remain a concern. Further, elevated prices of other raw materials such as coking coal, intensify profitability challenges, especially if cost increases are not fully passed on."

Mumbai: The Bombay High Court on Monday stayed till 27 March the proceedings before a magistrate court in a 2016 criminal defamation case filed by Nusli Wadia against Ratan Tata and some other directors of Tata Sons.
A single bench of Justice Mridula Bhatkar stayed the proceedings through an interim order.
Justice Bhatkar will now hear a petition filed by Tata and other directors of Tata Sons seeking to quash the defamation case against them on 27 March.
Therefore, Justice Bhatkar directed the magistrate's court to refrain from proceeding with the hearing on the defamation case until then.
In December 2018, the magistrate court had issued notices to Ratan Tata and other directors of Tata Sons in the criminal defamation case filed by Wadia and then posted the matter for further hearing on March 25, 2019.
Wadia had filed the case in 2016 after he was voted out of the boards of some Tata Group companies.
Wadia had claimed that Tata and the others had made defamatory statements against him after they removed Cyrus Mistry on 24 October 2016 as the group chairman of Tata Sons.
Wadia was on boards as independent director of group companies such as Indian Hotels Company that runs the Taj group of hotels, TCS, Tata Motors and Tata Steel, among others.
He was voted out by shareholders at a specially convened general meeting between December 2016 and February 2017.
He said he approached the magistrate's court as he was not satisfied with the explanation the respondents (Tata and others) had given him following his letters to them.
He therefore initiated defamation proceedings against the respondents under Section 500 of the Indian Penal Code.
Wadia is represented in the high court by advocate Abad Ponda.
Ratan Tata and others are represented by former Union Minister P Chidambaram, Congress party leader and senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, and others.
All parties present in the high court on Monday had urged the court to stay the proceedings before the lower court until the quashing plea was heard by the court.

FRANKFURT :
 Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel have agreed with the European Commission to extend a deadline to submit remedies in exchange for regulatory approval for a planned European steel joint venture, Thyssenkrupp said.
The deadline, which sources said was due to expire later on Wednesday, will be extended by eight working days, Thyssenkrupp said. This will move the overall deadline for a decision to May 13 from April 29, the Commission said on its website.
""In the ongoing merger control proceedings the deadline to submit a proposal, through which Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel will address the Commission's concerns, is imminent,"" a spokesman for Thyssenkrupp said in e-mailed comments.
""To adequately draw up the proposal the partners have agreed to apply for an extension by 8 working days as part of the constructive dialogue with the Commission.""
Thyssenkrupp confirmed it remains confident that the transaction, which will create Europe's second-largest steelmaker after ArcelorMittal, can be completed in the spring.
Sources told Reuters this month that the companies are unlikely to make far-reaching concessions that will jeopardise the economic and strategic rationale of the deal.

FRANKFURT :
Tata Steel is likely to offer to sell parts of its European packaging activities to secure regulatory approval for a planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
The two steelmakers on Wednesday agreed an eight-day extension to a deadline for submitting remedies to the European Commission, which has been concerned that the combined entity could hurt competition in some areas.
The people said no final decisions have been made and remedy proposals could still change or be amended before the new 1 April deadline. The Commission aims to wrap up its antitrust investigation into Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp's tie-up by 13 May.
Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel last year agreed to combine their European steel activities in a 50-50 joint venture to cut overcapacity and create a more powerful challenger to market leader ArcelorMittal.
Offering some packaging steel assets would address one of the areas that have been singled out by the Commission in its antitrust review. Under their deal, both companies would own about half of the European packaging steel market, industry sources have said.
Thyssenkrupp declined to comment. A spokesman for Tata Steel said it was not appropriate to comment or speculate on the process. ""Both companies are committed to working closely with all relevant regulators to ensure the success of this transaction,"" he said.
In the financial year 2017/2018, Tata Steel Europe made 1.03 billion euros ($1.2 billion) of sales from packaging steel for food, paint and aerosol cans, among others, accounting for about 13 percent of total revenues.
This is only slightly less than the 1.16 billion euros generated by Thyssenkrupp's packaging steel unit Rasselstein in 2015/2016, according to the latest available company data. This business will not be part of the remedy offer, the people said.
In packaging, Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel are both active in the production of tinplate and blackplate.
Another area of concern for the Commission is electrical steel, where Tata Steel last year put its Cogent business on the block. The companies hope that the disposal plans will be sufficient to avoid further remedies, the people said.
Sources told Reuters earlier this month that Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel would drive a hard bargain in their discussions with the Commission to not put at risk the strategic and economic rationale of the deal.

Brussels/Frankfurt: Thyssenkrupp AG and Tata Steel Ltd submitted concessions to European Union regulators in an effort to win antitrust approval for their steel joint venture.
The European Commission didn’t provide any details on what they pledged to do, but typically companies offer to sell overlapping units to allay concerns that the merged firm would have too much power to increase prices or curb supplies.
The companies are prepared to sell part of car body sheet production, including Thyssenkrupp’s Spanish unit Galmed, 'Handelsblatt' reported, citing anonymous sources. The newspaper said the proposal had packaging steel assets including plants in Belgium and the UK. They also offered to give customers access to raw steel production.
Asset sales outside of Germany would satisfy demands by Thyssenkrupp’s labor leaders that the joint venture won’t cause job losses in Germany. Union representatives at the company control half of all votes on the company’s supervisory board and would fiercely oppose concessions that cut German steelworkers.
The EU usually sends the proposal to rivals and customers for feedback. The European Commission extended its deadline to 5 June to make a decision, a spokesman said.
The plan to create a European steel company jointly owned by Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and Tata “raised several issues,"" the EU said last year when it opened an in-depth probe into the transaction. These were related to the supply of galvanized steel for cars and car parts, metallic-coated steel for food and aerosol cans and steel used for transformers and other engineering products.
Only four European companies currently provide steel to the auto industry: ArcelorMittal, Thyssen, Tata and Voestalpine AG.
The merged entity, under the proposed name of Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel B.V., would focus on high-quality flat steel production.

NEW DELHI :
S&P Global Ratings Tuesday said it has revised its outlook on Tata Steel to positive from stable.
The diminishing prospect of Bhushan Power and Steel Ltd's (BPSL) acquisition and the sustained high steel prices in India are key factors for the outlook revision on Tata Steel, S&P said in a statement.

DUISBURG,
		             GERMANY/MUMBAI :
Steel workers at Thyssenkrupp expect substantial guarantees for jobs and plants even if a planned joint venture with India's Tata Steel falls apart, the head of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe's works council said on Wednesday.
The two companies last year agreed to combine their European steel activities, a move that would create the continent's second-largest steelmaker but still needs European Commission approval.
Powerful steel workers at Thyssenkrupp, who have long been critical of the deal, last year gave their consent in exchange for far-reaching guarantees, including job and plant protection until 2026.
On Wednesday, they said that these guarantees should remain in place even if the joint venture fails, a real risk as it is unclear whether Brussels will agree to a list of remedies the two groups submitted earlier this week to gain approval.
""Should a joint venture - in theory - not happen we demand the same protection for our employees and our plants,"" Tekin Nasikkol, head of Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe's works council, said. ""Nine months after the signing there is still no clarity - that creates great uncertainty among employees.""
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that the companies saw limited scope in improving their remedy offer should the Commission, which has set a June 5 deadline to make a decision, deem it insufficient.
Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who is currently pursuing a plan to break up the elevators-to-submarines conglomerate, said in February that if the joint venture falls apart ""it won't kill us"".
Analysts at Jefferies have previously said that keeping Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe would be better for its parent from a credit rating perspective.
Nasikkol said he did not think that Thyssenkrupp's management was less committed to implementing the joint venture or the break-up: ""They are working flat out on it.""
A spokesman for Tata Steel said it too continued to support the logic behind the planned venture.
""We're committed to working closely with all relevant regulators and remain confident of the benefits of the joint venture to all our stakeholders,"" he said in an e-mail.

Tata Steel Ltd.’s Indian steel output rose to a record in its latest financial year thanks to its 2018 acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd. assets, potentially making Tata the country’s biggest producer.
Production rose 35% to 16.79 million tons in the year ended March 31, as Bhushan Steel added 4.2 million tons to output, the Mumbai-based company said in a statement Saturday. Tata’s volumes are a tad higher than the 16.75 million tons targeted by JSW Steel Ltd., which was India’s biggest steel mill in the previous fiscal year. JSW has yet to release its final number for the latest 12 month period.
Tata Steel has been shifting its focus to India, where demand is growing due to a government-led emphasis on building new infrastructure. The state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd. also reported a record production of 16.3 million tons earlier this week.
However, steel production at Tata’s Europe division fell 3.7 percent to 10.3 million tons during the 12 months to March, the company said. The European Commission is reviewing a plan by Tata to merge its European operations with those of Thyssenkrupp AG.L.P."

112,2019-04-11,Tata Steel,"Thyssenkrupp offered concessions to regulators earlier this month to win antitrust approval for a European steel joint ventureTata’s European Works Council said those proposals raise concerns the joint venture is not one of equals

Tata Steel Ltd.’s European workers said they’re unsure the company’s planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG should go ahead as the combination may favor the German firm’s operations.
Thyssenkrupp offered concessions to regulators earlier this month to win antitrust approval for a European steel joint venture, including selling plants in Belgium, Spain and the U.K. The two companies are trying to ease concerns flagged by European regulators that their combined steel operations would have too much control over market supply and prices.
Tata’s European Works Council, which includes U.K. and Dutch labor unions, said those proposals raise concerns the joint venture is not one of equals.
“The EWC will continue to support the joint venture only if we consider it to be in the best interests of the workforce at all our sites,"" Tata’s work council said in a statement. “Due to these recent developments, we are now unconvinced the joint venture is the best option for Tata Steel Europe.""
The works council said it was seeking an urgent meeting with Tata’s chairman to get assurances that would determine its support for the joint venture.

109,2019-04-12,Tata Steel,"JSW is raising $500 million through five-year overseas bonds to expand capacityJSW had expressed interest in buying Bhushan Steel and Usha Martin, both of which were snapped up by Tata Steel

Delays in the sale of assets under India’s bankruptcy law are becoming a key challenge for bidders who “cannot wait indefinitely"" because of funding constraints, according to JSW Steel Ltd.
The Sajjan Jindal-run mill, which has bid for many companies under the insolvency law since sales of distressed firms began in 2017, is among bidders who have faced repeated delays in their attempts to buy indebted assets. A bidder has to tie up the capital for investing in an asset when submitting a resolution plan and “it is not possible for any company, big or small, to keep the funding ready forever,"" said Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director of the steel mill.
“When I tie up the funding, I am incurring a cost,"" Rao said in an interview Wednesday. “That cost can’t be incurred indefinitely with so many uncertainties.""
Since the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was passed in the Indian parliament in 2016, the resolution process has been slowed as courts are inundated with appeals from founders, administrators, lenders and bidders. Lenders to the first 12 companies brought to the insolvency court have lost out on 40 billion rupees ($580 million) in additional income due to delays in the resolution process beyond the time mandated by law, according to rating company ICRA.
JSW took over Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. in July after multiple company law tribunal hearings despite being the only bidder for the asset. It has also emerged as the sole bidder for another stressed steel products maker Asian Colour Coated Ispat Ltd., but the lenders and the professional in charge of the sale process have reportedly sought an extension of the deadline for submission of bids.
“It is surprising to us that the date for submission of resolution plans was extended several times,"" said Rao. “We are not able to understand that when there is a valid resolution plan, what is the need for seeking extension?""
Reshaping the Steel Sector
The mill has also been selected as the preferred bidder for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. and is awaiting the final nod from the tribunal. JSW had expressed interest in buying Bhushan Steel Ltd. and Usha Martin Ltd., both of which were snapped up by Tata Steel Ltd. It also belatedly attempted to enter the race for Essar Steel India Ltd., when a second round of bids were called.
India’s insolvency process is reshaping its steel industry. Five companies from the sector were among the 12 large debtors -- the so-called dirty dozen -- ordered into bankruptcy court in 2017. Tata Steel’s bet on snapping up the assets of bankrupt mill Bhushan Steel has paid off as it overtook JSW as India’s biggest producer last year. ArcelorMittal is inching closer to opening shop in the South Asian nation as its offer to buy Essar Steel was approved after months of court battles.
Economic growth is driving steel demand and pushing producers to scale up capacity. India’s steel demand is forecast to grow 7 percent to 7.5 percent this year, Rao said, driven by government expenditure on metro stations, water pipelines, bridges and affordable housing.
Expanding Capacity
JSW expects to expand crude steel capacity to 24 million tons by March 2020 from 18 million tons now, and value-added capacity by 80 percent to 9 million tons, he said, adding that “we are in the market to raise money"" to complete all these projects.
JSW is raising $500 million through five-year overseas bonds to expand capacity. The company is tapping global markets as long tenure instruments in the Indian market are difficult unless the bond market matures, Rao said.
“It is a forced option,"" he said. As JSW continues to expand capacity, the company will keep tapping global markets either through external commercial borrowing, export credit agencies or bonds to meet fund requirements in future, he said.

110,2019-04-12,Tata Steel,"A 7.5% rise in FY19 sales has made India one of the fastest-growing steel markets among large economiesGlobal steel demand is projected to slow to 1.4% in 2019, more than halving from the 3% increase in 2018

Demand for steel has been resilient. Compared to the global slowdown, Indian demand has shown resilience. Provisional figures compiled by analysts show a 7.5% rise in FY19 sales, making India one of the fastest-growing steel markets among large economies. Even though this is marginally lower, it still compares well with a 7.9% rise in FY18. Contrastingly, global steel demand is projected to slow to 1.4% in 2019, more than halving from the 3% increase in 2018.
Data from Joint Plant Committee showed a 7.8% rise in steel consumption from April 2018 to January 2019. According to SBICAP Securities Ltd, demand in the subsequent two months increased 7.7% and 8.8%, respectively. This pegs consumption growth during January-March (Q4 FY19) at 6.4%, points out Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd, notably better than the December quarter when demand decelerated.
Inventory restocking and the seasonal upswing in demand have driven volumes in the last three months. Tata Steel Ltd’s India operations reported a 56% jump in sales volume last quarter. The growth was partly aided by capacity expansion following its acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd last year. Even so, higher volumes should help mitigate the impact of subdued prices.
The recent increase in prices notwithstanding, domestic hot-rolled coil prices on average were down around 4% year-on-year in the last quarter.
“After almost two years of a strong steel cycle, aided by disciplined Chinese production/exports, steel prices globally slumped toward the end of Q3 FY19, with impacts visible in Q4 FY19. However, producers took advantage of the seasonally strong demand to recoup part of the fall,"" Emkay said in a note.
Tracking the sales trends of notable steel producers, Tata Steel and JSW Steel Ltd recouped from their lows in January. But in FY20, all eyes are on demand recovery in China and India.
Demand in India is largely being driven by the infrastructure sector. According to SBICAP Securities, demand for long steel products increased 9.6% during the April 2018-February 2019 period. Comparatively, demand for flat products, which largely emanates from the automobile sector, is up 4.8%. With automobile sales decelerating further in recent months, the fear is that a prolonged slowdown could impact steel demand in the coming months. According to Edelweiss Securities Ltd, about 20% of total steel in India is consumed by the automobile sector.
Another challenge is the slowdown in China. This demand slowdown in China is driving imports to India. The sharp fall in international prices increased imports to India, weighing on domestic prices.
The rise in iron ore prices due to supply disruption in Brazil pushed up global steel prices, benefiting producers such as Tata Steel. But with iron ore supplies rising in the home market, this advantage is expected to erode, making demand recovery in global markets crucial for Indian producers.
“Though there has been some progress in trade talks between the US and China, global demand concerns still pose significant headwinds,"" said analysts at Edelweiss."

NEW DELHI :
Nearly half of their total admitted claims worth over  ₹1.42 lakh crore have been recovered by financial and operational creditors from as many as 88 debt-ridden companies under the insolvency law, according to official data.
The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) seeks to provide market-determined resolution for stressed assets in a time-bound manner.
Claims totalling a little over  ₹1.42 lakh crore were admitted in 88 cases under the IBC till February 28, data collected by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI) showed.
Of the total admitted claims, financial creditors sought to recover dues worth  ₹1.36 lakh crore and operational creditors  ₹6,469 crore.
Financial creditors recovered 48.24 per cent of their admitted claims and operational creditors got 48.41 per cent of their admitted claims. The figures are with respect to 88 cases, including those where resolution has been completed, for the period till February 28.
Creditors realised  ₹68,766 crore of the total admitted claims in those 88 cases.
The share of financial creditors and operational creditors stood at  ₹65,635 crore and  ₹3,131 crore, respectively, as per data.
The IBBI, a key institution set up under the IBC, provided the figures in an affidavit submitted to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) last week.
On March 27, the tribunal directed the IBBI to file an affidavit, with details about average percentage of distribution of realised amount between financial creditors and operational creditors subsequent to insolvency resolution process.
According to the affidavit, the realised amount was more than 100 per cent in some cases.
In the 88 cases, financial creditors got 100 per cent realisation of admitted claims in 11 resolution plans, while operational creditors got only full realisation in only 6 cases.
In three cases, financial creditors got more than 100 per cent realisation of admitted claims.
Among the 88 cases were big-ticket takeovers, including Tata Steel acquiring over Bhushan Steel and Vedanta's acquisition of Electrosteel.
In the Bhushan Steel matter, total admitted claims of operational and financial creditors amounted to  ₹57,505.05 crore. Of this, financial creditors received 63.49 per cent of claims, while the operational creditors' realisation stood at 80.94 per cent.
With regard to Electrosteel, total admitted claims for both financial and operational creditors were  ₹13,958 crore. In this resolution process, in which Vedanta group got control of the company, financial creditors got 40.38 per cent of admitted claims, while the operational creditors' share was nil.
In the matter of Monnet Ispat & Energey, total admitted claims were  ₹11,478.08 crore, of which financial creditors got 26.26 per cent and operational creditors received 5.40 per cent.
The NCLAT had asked IBBI to give data in the resolution process of Essar Steel, where operational creditors and some financial creditors are opposing the resolution plan approved by the Committee of Creditors (CoC) and are seeking a higher share.
As per the resolution plan approved by CoC, ArcelorMittal, the successful resolution applicant, would pay Essar Steel lenders  ₹41,987 crore for their total dues of  ₹49,395 crore. Operational creditors would get only  ₹214 crore against their outstanding of  ₹4,976 crore."

RIL’s gross refining margin (GRM), or the amount a refiner earns by refining one barrel of crude oil, narrowed to a 17-quarter low at $8.2 per barrel. On a sequential basis, GRM declined 7%.
“Management is constructive about refining margins as diesel spreads are likely to get a boost from implementation of IMO 2020, as 3.5mbpd marine fuel Sulphur standards are likely to come down. RIL is well positioned to benefit given their high complexity. However, gasoline spreads are likely to be under pressure from high new refinery capacity addition of 2mbpd against demand growth of 1.3mbpd,"" said Prabhudas Lilladher in a note on 19 April.

MUMBAI :
Tata Steel, India’s largest private sector steel producer, posted a 84% drop in fiscal fourth quarter consolidated net profit mainly because the year-earlier profit was boosted by a one-time gain.
Tata Steel’s consolidated net profit figure for Q4 FY19 is not directly comparable to Q4 FY18 as it does not include NATSteel Holding and Tata Steel Thailand as they are classified as Asset Held For Sales.
Net profit in the quarter ended 31 March fell to  ₹2,295 crore, from  ₹14,688 crore a year earlier. Consolidated net profit for 2018-19 declined 49% to  ₹9,098 crore.
Tata Steel had a one-time exceptional gain of  ₹11,376 crore in Q4 FY18 due to restructuring of a UK pension scheme, which boosted profit in the year-earlier period.
Consolidated revenue climbed 25% in the March quarter to  ₹42,424 crore, from  ₹33,705 crore a year earlier. Consolidated revenue for FY19 increased 27% to about  ₹1.57 trillion from  ₹1.24 trillion a year earlier.
In FY19, the company’s revenue from Indian operations increased by 47% year-on-year to  ₹88,987 crore, driven by higher volumes and better realizations, while the adjusted Ebitda for the year increased by 56% y-o-y to  ₹23,883 crore. Ebitda margin stood at 26.8% and adjusted Ebitda per tonne was at  ₹14,687. Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
It also said the boards of both Tata Steel and Tata Steel BSL (Bamnipal Steel), formerly Bhushan Steel, have proposed a merger. “The merger will drive operational synergies and efficiencies, reduce the regulatory burden and simplify the group structure. Both boards have relied on valuation reports and fairness opinions provided by independent experts, and recommend a merger ratio of 15 shares of Tata Steel BSL for every one share of Tata Steel. The merger is subject to shareholders and other regulatory approvals,"" the company said in a statement.
Last May, Tata Steel acquired bankrupt Bhushan Steel for  ₹35,200 crore.
FY19 consolidated steel production, as well as deliveries, rose 17% year-on-year to 27.11 million tonnes and 26.8 million tonnes, respectively. Local production alone surged 35% year-on-year to 16.81 million tonnes, while deliveries grew 33% year-on-year to 16.26 million tonnes following the acquisition of Bhushan Steel and ramping up of capacity at the Kalinganagar plant.
Sales were driven by industrial products which grew 42% year-on-year, while branded and retail products grew 30%.
March quarter production was up 26% from the year-ago period to 7.21 million tonnes.
On Tata Steel’s merger of its European operations with Thyssenkrupp AG, the company said it is working to secure the required regulatory approvals for the proposed 50:50 joint venture. The European Commission has issued its ‘statement of objection’ for which both Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp have submitted a “comprehensive package of proposed remedies"". In Q4, Tata Steel cut its consolidated gross debt by  ₹8,781 crore. Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer said: “Despite the liquidity issues in the domestic markets, we were able to extend our debt maturity profile by successfully raising  ₹4,315 crore through 15-year non-convertible debentures, and completing the long-term financing for Tata Steel BSL."""

102,2019-04-26,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel confirmed that the fire had been caused by a train carrying molten metal and that an investigation has been launched into the incidentNo serious injuries have been reported

Tata Steel Ltd. said it has extinguished all fires at its plant in Port Talbot after reporting an incident at the mill in South Wales early Friday.
The company said emergency services were assisting its workers and two employees were slightly injured when there was a spillage of liquid iron while it was traveling to the steel plant, according to posts on Twitter. No serious injuries have been reported, it said, adding that a full investigation has begun.
“Early indications are that the seat of the explosion was a train which carries molton metal into the works,"" the South Wales police said in a statement. ""The explosion caused some small fires which are all under control and damage to some buildings on the site.""
Emergency services remain on scene and all staff are accounted for, the police said. There is no need for concerns regarding hazardous effects from the smoke from the fire as per South West Fire and Rescue Service, it said.
Tata Steel acquired the Port Talbot facility in 2007 when it bought Corus for $12 billion. Weak performance of the UK business lead to Tata selling off some of its assets in the region and the Mumbai-based company is now in the process of merging its British and Netherlands operations with Thyssenkrupp AG.

101,2019-04-28,Tata Steel,"Consolidated adjusted operating profits increased 8.3%; sales volumes in India jumped 21% sequentially as the turn of the calendar year triggered fresh purchases by customersOperating profit at Tata Steel Europe jumped 66%, driving consolidated earnings

Mumbai: Tata Steel Ltd has done well in the March quarter, despite cost pressures and weak product prices. Consolidated adjusted operating profits increased 8.3% sequentially even as profitability per tonne dropped 6.9%.
The impact of lower realization at the India business was mitigated by higher volumes. Sales volumes in India jumped 21% sequentially as the turn of the calendar year triggered fresh purchases by customers. Delivery volumes at Europe rose 9.4%. And thanks to savings on maintenance costs and the restarting of a blast furnace, operating profit at Tata Steel Europe jumped 66%, driving consolidated earnings.
The earnings exceeded Street estimates, driving up the stock by 6.7% on Friday. Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd warns soft prices can weigh on Tata Steel Europe’s profitability. Even then, deleveraging, combined with the volume expansion in India, should hold Tata Steel in good stead. The company management expects volumes in FY20 to be higher by one million tonnes, primarily due to the production ramp-up at the recently acquired Bhushan Steel plant and the Usha Martin plant. Further, normalization of raw material costs and price hikes mean operating profits are projected to improve compared to Q4 FY19.
The current slowdown in user industries, especially in the auto sector, does pose some headwinds. Automobiles is a large business segment for Tata Steel, and it offers better realizations and margins. “Management believes that Indian operations will remain relatively unaffected even if domestic auto slowdown persists as market share of the company would go up. Tata Steel BSL (Bhushan Steel Ltd) has received approvals from Tata Motors and Ashok Leyland, among others, for automotive supply. Besides, the company is also making inroads in other high value-add segments like oil and gas,"" Edelweiss Securities Ltd said in a note.
The performance in the March quarter and the post-results commentary is aiding the Tata Steel stock. But what of the outlook? The subdued demand environment in developed countries, especially Europe, remains a challenge. Much of the recent increase in domestic prices is driven by cost push and seasonal restocking in China, and the sustainability of these hikes remains to be seen.
The company is trying to reduce the risk to earnings through cost rationalization measures and deleveraging. The merger of Bhushan Steel and de-bottlenecking measures are expected to drive greater synergies, providing savings on procurement and sales, and general administration expenses.
Further, it plans to strengthen the balance sheet by reducing gross debt by $1 billion by the end of FY20. The measures, coupled with the proposed demerger of the European operations into a separate joint venture, should help Tata Steel withstand product price volatility and unfavourable macroeconomic conditions. How well the company delivers on this front will be crucial."
100,2019-05-01,Tata Steel,"European Commission is likely to make a decision on Tata Steel-Thyssenkrupp deal by 17 JuneWorks council will call an emergency meeting on 10 May, while British representatives will also seek to meet

Berlin: European workers at India's Tata Steel no longer believe that a joint venture with Thyssenkrupp is in the best interests of the company, the European works council said in a statement.
The two companies agreed last year to combine their European steel activities, a move that would create the continent's second-largest steelmaker but still needs approval from the European Commission, which plans to make a decision by 17 June.
At a meeting with Tata chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, Works Council chairman Frits van Wieringen confirmed that workers do not support a package of remedies designed to win the support of the European Commission.
""We are now unconvinced the joint venture is in the best interests of Tata Steel Europe. We believe that the agreements we reached with Tata are not being honoured,"" the works council said in a statement issued on Wednesday.
The works council said Chandrasekaran told them Tata hopes to gain their support during a consultation period, but they told him that might not be possible due to the seriousness of the workers' reservations.
The works council added it will call an emergency meeting on 10 May, while British representatives will also seek to meet.
Workers at Thyssenkrupp, who have long been critical of the deal, last year gave their consent in exchange for far-reaching guarantees, including job and plant protection until 2026.
A source familiar with the matter told Reuters last month that the companies saw limited scope in improving their remedy offer should the Commission deem it insufficient.

DUESSELDORF (GERMANY) :
ThyssenKrupp said on Sunday it still saw scope for agreement with European antitrust regulators on a planned joint venture with Tata Steel despite a Financial Times report that Brussels was likely to block the deal.
Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp have proposed combining their steel operations in Europe to form the region's second-biggest steelmaker. However, the landmark deal has not yet been approved because of concerns about its impact on competition.
Earlier on Sunday, the Financial Times reported that EU antitrust regulators were concerned the deal would lead to less choice and higher prices for steel and were increasingly likely to block it unless the companies offered greater concessions.
A ThyssenKrupp spokesman said: ""The Competition Commission has taken the reworked commitments proposed by ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel as an opportunity to conduct another market test.""
""There are still a number of ways to adjust our commitments without compromising the commercial logic of the joint venture.""
Late last month, the European Commission extended the deadline for reviewing the planned joint venture by seven working days until June 17.
ThyssenKrupp said further talks were planned with EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager in the coming week.

97,2019-05-08,Tata Steel,"Reports that the regulator may block proposed European JV made no major impact on Tata SteelThe failure to form the European JV will come in the way of Tata Steel’s deleveraging plans

When in doubt, chill out. Investors in Tata Steel Ltd appear to be following this motto. Financial Times reported last weekend that the European Union (EU) authorities will likely block the proposed joint venture (JV) between Tata Steel Europe and Thyssenkrupp AG, citing threat to user industries. But Tata Steel’s shares haven’t shown any major sign of stress.
The stock has lost 4.6% so far this week, which is slightly more than the 4% drop in the Nifty Metal index. This is not the first time investors brushed aside possible risks to the JV.
The Street gave little weight to the management’s post-March quarter results commentary warning that further remedial measures may be needed to gain approval from the European regulators; and that this may require revisiting of the rationale of the proposed JV, as to whether expected synergies will be remunerative or not.
The reducing influence of the European operations partly explains this. When Tata Steel first announced the JV, the low-margin European unit generated 27.6% of the consolidated entity’s operating profit in the preceding fiscal year (FY17). In FY19, this dropped to 17.6%, reflecting the expanded capacity base in the better profitable Indian market.
The contribution from Europe will reduce further in FY20 as Tata Steel de-bottlenecks the capacity base in India. Of course, it has also made a large domestic acquisition to boost capacity.
Even so, if the EU throws a spanner in the works, the company’s European operations will come in the way of the company’s deleveraging plans. While the long delay in the completion of the proposed JV should have raised alarm bells already, the market still expects the European unit to move out of Tata Steel, says an analyst with a multinational brokerage firm.
If the deal falls through, it will lead to a reset in the Tata Steel stock price, warns an analyst at a domestic brokerage firm. The European unit has unsustainably high debt and lost money in FY17 and FY18. The losses are being made good by the consolidated entity, especially India operations.
While FY19 earnings are not available yet, analysts see no noticeable improvement from FY18 given the general slump in steel prices.
If the deal does not go through, then the investors will have to account for the “leaking bucket"" in the Tata Steel portfolio again, says the second analyst cited above. This will not only stall the balance-sheet deleveraging exercise but also impact future cash flow calculations, as Tata Steel will have to set aside money for Europe.
Some analysts expect the JV approval to come through possibly with more caveats and limited synergies. Even then, how beneficial this option will be has to be seen."

Indian markets fell today, extending losses to the eighth day, led by losses in metal and IT stocks. The US today hiked tariffs on more than $200 billion in goods from China, deepening a conflict that has roiled financial markets and cast a shadow over the global economy. However, global markets showed some signs of recovery on hopes that the two countries can still reach an agreement.

95,2019-05-11,Tata Steel,"Both Thyssenkrupp and Tata have declined to offer further concessions to BrusselsThyssenkrupp is now looking for a stock market listing of its elevators business

MUMBAI :
India’s largest steelmaker Tata Steel Ltd will explore new options after competition watchdog European Commission blocked its proposed joint venture (JV) with Germany’s Thyssenkrupp on Friday.
According to the agreements between the two sides signed last June, Tata Steel Europe was to offload close to €2.2 billion of debt on its balance sheet to the combined entity. The JV would have created Europe’s second-largest steel maker after ArcelorMittal by merging the two companies’ operations in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.
In statement on Friday, Tata Steel said that the JV was an important strategic initiative for the company to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, which would have also helped it de-consolidate the European business and deleverage its balance sheet. “Tata Steel remains committed to the above strategy and will explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future,"" it added.
Tata Steel has undertaken significant deleveraging in the last six months and will continue to pursue the strategy through internal cash generation and asset sales, the company said.
“Over the last six months, we have engaged with the European Commission in great depth. They had expressed concerns and objections on electrical steel, automotive steel and packaging steel, and we went back with remedies which they did not feel was sufficient,"" said T.V. Narendran, global chief executive officer and managing director, Tata Steel. “Being responsible owners of the European business, we will also focus on ensuring that the business remains sustainable.""
“The importance of the European business to Tata Steel is much smaller now than what it was in the past. Operations in the UK have improved while Netherlands is running stable, but the market in Europe is soft. We will focus on making the European businesses cash-positive this year,"" said Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer, Tata Steel.
“We now look at the way forward and possibilities. We continue to grow in India. As a proportion, India contributes to two-thirds of revenue and 90% of profit,"" Narendran added.
Tata Steel pared its debt by  ₹18,000 crore in fiscal year 2019, bringing its consolidated net debt to  ₹1 trillion.
In the March quarter results, the company said it had extended its debt maturity profile by raising  ₹4,315 crore through 15-year non-convertible debentures and refinanced outstanding debt of Bamnipal Steel (erstwhile Bhushan Steel), which it acquired via a bankruptcy sale. Tata Steel plans to deleverage debt by $1 billion this fiscal. Company officials claim the plan remains unaffected by the failure to secure an approval for the JV with Thyssenkrupp.
Corus Group plc was acquired by Tata Steel in 2007 for $12 billion, before it was renamed Tata Steel Europe in 2010. Over the years, Tata Steel has taken a $3 billion impairment on its European steel operations."
94,2019-05-12,Tata Steel,"Some Indian businesses are turning their annual reports into integrated reports. Here’s what it’s all about

It’s that time of the year when annual reports of corporate entities start streaming out. Profits will be dissected, share prices will rise or tumble, and catchphrases like value and growth will be thrown around. But what about purpose? What about the larger social and ecological footprint of a company?
Caught up in a season of fourth quarter results, it is worth remembering the words of Mervyn King, a celebrated academic and a former judge of the Supreme Court of South Africa. “Quarterly reporting drives short-term thinking . . . (and) short-term capitalism has failed,"" he said. “When you lose trust and confidence in the company, value is destroyed very quickly.""
King is the father of a radical new way of reporting a corporate entity’s performance—in fact his approach came to be termed as “King Reports"" (in the 1990s). And a small number of Indian businesses are turning their annual reports into integrated reports, jumping on board a progressive vision which first took root among companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).
Essentially, the heart of the idea behind an integrated report is this: mere financial reporting is no longer enough. Measuring an organization’s growth purely in terms of economic and financial value creation is a siloed and obsolete world view. Tata Steel Ltd was one of the earliest integrated report adopters in India, with its first integrated report in 2015-16. In 2017, the firm’s report was declared as “Asia’s Best Integrated Report"" by the Asia Sustainability Reporting Awards.
Businesses, after all, need to make money and register profits to sustain. So, what is the connection between financial growth and impacting socio-environmental change, if at all? Or is it a hyped up esoteric concept to move large organizations to do good and for society-at-large to feel better?
Take an industry example—insurance, for instance, which is a key part of any financial system. Globally, insurance companies manage over $30 trillion in assets, act as important guardians of wealth, and, in a lot of ways, fuel economic growth. The recent special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change states that the estimated net present value of damages from a 2°C of warming is expected to be around $64 trillion by 2100. This may be just a small indication of what the future may hold. You possibly cannot be the sufferer from and an investor in the same businesses!
Globally, asset managers are recognizing that financial returns and impact outcomes can go together and are increasingly embracing sustainable investing as a business building approach. Larry Fink, chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of BlackRock Inc., the largest money-management firm in the world, in a letter to the CEOs of S&P 500 companies and large European organizations had stated: “One reason for investors’ short-term horizons is that companies have not sufficiently educated them about the ecosystems they are operating in, what their competitive threats are, and how technology and other innovations are impacting their businesses.""
According to the World Investment Report 2018, about 50% of the funds in developed economies such as Europe and Australia factor in environment, social and governance practices for sound investment. In Asia, merely one per cent of the funds do so. To facilitate such decision-making, organizations need to put in place reporting frameworks that investors and other stakeholders can draw upon.
The story so far
While mere financial reporting has been the norm for decades, rising concerns from internal and external stakeholders needed to be addressed. Governments, local bodies and independent organizations put in place various frameworks and standards. As a result, social responsibility and sustainability reporting has seen a significant expansion over the last 20 years.
In India, the Companies Act, 2013, requires companies to formulate a corporate social responsibility policy and incur at least a certain percentage of their profits as expenditure on social activities. The business responsibility report (BRR) became a mandatory requirement for the top 100 listed entities, and then was subsequently extended to 500 firms in 2015. In addition, there are a number of voluntary and non-voluntary reporting initiatives that companies are undertaking to reach out to their stakeholders —Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, UN Global Compact guidelines, UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, and so on.
With a slew of guidelines and commitments that companies have suddenly begun to claim they are attached to, how does an average shareholder or consumer demand transparency and accountability?
And therein lies the key to the push behind integrated reporting (IR). Though not intended to replace any existing reporting frameworks, as the name suggests, the annual integrated report does purport to answer the big question of price of progress through “One Report"".
IR has gained sizeable acceptance since the inception of the Integrated Reporting Council (IIRC), a global coalition of regulators, investors, accounting professionals, companies, and non-governmental organizations. It was launched in 2013 as a global framework and as a more holistic form of reporting the value that businesses create. The IR model provides a great approach that adds five additional capitals to the traditional financial capital—natural capital, social capital, human capital, manufactured capital, and intellectual capital. Conscious consideration to the impact of these capitals on the business, society, and environment requires integrated thinking. And greater clarity of inter-linkages of business processes helps address larger challenges by demonstrating the place of each capital in strategic decision-making.
To that extent, IR is not an end, but a means to an end since it is an outcome of integrated thinking and sound management approach.
Two core concepts, therefore, in IR are “integrated thinking"" and “value creation""—both can be interpreted by organizations differently and adapted to suit the needs of individual organizations. Businesses perceive this subjective yardstick as both a boon and a curse. Early expounders of integrated reporting such as Robert G. Eccles and Michael P. Krzus have also suggested the use of internet to provide integrated reporting in ways that a paper-based report cannot—providing stakeholders an opportunity to sift through information that is of particular interest to them, and analyse financial as well as non-financial information, as users seem fit.
Where India stands
Recent studies have shown India as one of the top countries for reporting environment and social responsibility information in the annual financial reports of companies. Yet, only a handful have been able to publish what can truly be called an integrated report.
A few companies made a nascent attempt by adding a couple of pages that listed scattered information around the six capitals, missing by a mile what the report should actually be. This is because most companies don’t realize the significant difference between installing solar panels and planting trees to show reduction in carbon footprint and proactively recognizing and seeking business opportunities in a low-carbon world. To that extent, the integrated report is not a sustainability or corporate social responsibility (CSR) report attached to the financial report.
In a circular issued on 6 February 2017, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had recommended that “integrated reporting may be adopted on a voluntary basis from the fiscal year 2017-18 by (the) top 500 companies which are required to prepare BRR"". That year, around 30 firms in India published their integrated reports.
At the close of the second fiscal year of Sebi’s circular, more organizations are now contemplating the adoption of IR. The transition journey, however, is fraught with more questions than answers: Is there any value addition? How is it different? We already publish the BRR, we already have a sustainability report, so why should we do this? And so on.
How to go about it?
In South Africa and Brazil, IR is mandatory. Regulators and policymakers in the UK, the Netherlands, Australia, Spain, Singapore, Japan, and the US are promoting and giving a huge impetus to IR. The IIRC database shows that 20% of FTSE 100 companies in the UK refer to, or are influenced by, the International IR Framework.
So what part does regulation play? Studies from South Africa, the first country to mandate IR, have clearly indicated mandatory compliance as the primary driver towards IR. Most UK FTSE 100 companies moved towards IR driven by regulation. The IIRC, however, warns that the “compliance only"" mindset usually results in the real social benefits of business benefits being missed.
That being said, studies in South Africa, where overtime IR has matured, also suggest that early adopters have gained significant benefits from IR through effective decision-making and enhanced reputation.
The IR process is far from generic. It is anything but a one-fit-for-all framework and firms can truly take from it as they see fit. So, where do organizations begin? The following by and large covers the process, though not necessarily in that order, depending on the level of IR process the company is at.
■Take time to build a team (with internal and external support) and ensure “buy-in"" especially from top leadership. Good governance is the driver and always filter down.
■ Don’t develop the business and value-creation models in a hurry. When doing so begin by looking at micro aspects, while keeping in mind long-term vision.
■ Build on what you have done before.
■ Identify your internal and external stakeholder groups to determine the material issues and risks that your organization faces.
■ Start with fewer clear numbers across the six capitals and build it over time.
■ Continually check with the linking to business objectives and ensure process alignment.
■ Collect data on the identified material aspects and set clear timelines for data collection.
■ Try and tell clear stories of how you create value over time.
■ Build the report
■ Overtime, embed integrated thinking into the business (this will be highly beneficial not only to the process but also to the organization).
The abstract concept of integrated thinking in tangible terms implies bringing together all the resources that an organization depends on as well as the ones it impacts. That requires developing processes, tools and systems. This year, India enters the sixth year of CSR compliance. Though Indian business spent close to  ₹55,000 crore on development projects over the past five years, to a substantial number of stakeholders the larger picture is still a blur.
Two main components in IR are a business model and sustainability initiatives. While all businesses have a strong business model, the fact that a much smaller per cent report on or document their sustainability initiatives is a gap that needs to be filled. If available, the information is too scattered to make any difference.
Most organizations miss that IR is a process and the integrated report is the outcome. An understanding of what constitutes value is another barrier to implementing the IR framework. To expect all organizations endeavouring to report on value creation to clearly identify all of their “increases, decreases or transformations of the capitals caused by the organization’s business activities and outputs"" demands complete disclosure of not just value creation, but also the value destruction that firms cause. This is one of the primary reasons why so few companies bother to report on the six capitals.
Despite the seemingly sluggish adoption of the IR framework, the integrated report is that common language with the power to articulate the value creation story and make it comprehensible to investors as well as the other stakeholders. The India story on that front is only just beginning.

93,2019-05-12,Tata Steel,"Thyssenkrupp abandoned its long-planned merger of its steel business with the European operations of Tata SteelThyssenkrupp, which has warned it would report negative cash flow this year

FRANKFURT :
Thyssenkrupp will still seek partners for its steel operations after abandoning a European merger with India's Tata Steel, Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff said in comments published on Sunday.
Kerkhoff ditched a restructuring plan on Friday, in which the merger was a key part, and resolved instead to transform the steel-to-submarines group into a holding company and list its profitable elevators business.
He has since agreed on a way forward with labour unions for his new strategy, which foresees 6,000 job cuts, about 4% of the Thyssenkrupp workforce. The blueprint will go to a supervisory board vote on May 21.
Thyssenkrupp abandoned its long-planned merger of its steel business with the European operations of Tata Steel, which would have created the region's No.2 producer after ArcelorMittal, due to opposition from European Union regulators.
""Of course, with steel, we are looking to see what other consolidation options there are,"" Kerkhoff told the Handelsblatt business daily's online edition.
""But with the current position of the European Commission, I don't see the possibility of bigger mergers. As a result, we will remain the majority shareholder.""
Thyssenkrupp, which has warned it would report negative cash flow this year, is seeking a financial shot in the arm from the partial float of its elevators division.
""We will get cracking on that as quickly as possible and then see what the right moment is,"" Kerkhoff told Handelsblatt.
Asked whether investors could expect a special dividend from the float's proceeds, Kerkhoff said: ""We want to strengthen the balance sheet of Thyssenkrupp to gain more room for manoeuvre on the restructuring. That has absolute priority.""
Activist investors have been clamouring for Thyssenkrupp to monetise its elevators business, which analysts estimate could be worth as much as 14 billion euros ($15.7 billion), twice the market capitalisation of the parent company."
92,2019-05-13,Tata Steel,"Tata would likely continue to hold majority stake in Tata Steel Europe, according to a reportGlobally, steel prices have been trending down because of the US-China trade conflict

MUMBAI :
Another large-scale deal that would have helped Tata Steel hive off its European operations now appears to unlikely, analysts concurred after the thyssenkrupp-Tata Steel joint venture that was in the works for a year fell apart Friday.
A report by foreign brokerage firm Jefferies noted that Tata “will continue to explore all options including consolidation opportunities/portfolio restructuring, but large scale consolidation appears unlikely as while MT Ilva deal (by ArcelorMittal) went through, two recent deals, Aperam - VDM Metals and Tata-thyssenkrupp were canceled due to the European Commission’s requirement for substantial remedies. Tata would likely continue to hold majority stake in Tata Steel Europe (TSE) and likely focus on smaller asset sales/ performance improvement at TSE.""
According to agreements between the two sides signed last June, Tata Steel Europe was to offload close to €2.2 billion of debt (or nearly  ₹20,000 crore of its  ₹1 lakh crore debt) on its balance sheet to the combined entity. The JV would have created Europe’s second-largest steel maker after ArcelorMittal, by merging the two companies’ operations in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.
However, on Friday, both companies announced that the JV was unlikely to meet the European Commission’s anti-trust criteria and that both companies would look at other separate options for making their European operations stable.
With European steel outlook having softened given subdued demand in manufacturing led by autos, spot spreads in Europe are down US$45/tonne, the Jefferies note said. “We expect TSE margins to fall. We forecast FY20 TSE EBITDA/tonne of $51/tonne. A $10/tonne change in TSE EBITDA/tonne impacts valuation by  ₹32."" The note called for an “underperform"" rating on the stock saying that the markets were ignoring falling EU spreads and a potential hit to TSE margins given expected de-consolidation of TSE from the creation of the JV, but focus on European earnings would now return.
Analysts believe that with a large-scale deal on the scale of the Tata-thyssenkrupp likely to scuppered, Tata Steel may have to look at outright sales of its assets to de-consolidate debt.
“The importance of the European business to Tata Steel is much smaller now than what it was in the past. Operations in the UK have improved while Netherlands is running stable, but the market in Europe is soft. We will focus on making the European businesses cash-positive this year,"" Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer, Tata Steel, told journalists on Friday.
Additionally, the rise in tension between the US and China on trade talks will contribute to a renewed slowdown in the systemically important regions of the global economy, not only through the trade channel but also through the impact on sentiment and risk aversion, a Moody’s report said. “We expect the tariffs to have a negative effect on most Chinese companies either by the direct impact on their exports or the indirect impact through the domestic supply chain. China adopts a deliberate policy of trade diversion in response to the US tariffs. (Hence) the export-oriented economies of Asia may be particularly exposed to the risk of global and regional trade downturns. And given the importance of both the US and China as sources of export demand and investment, export-oriented Asian economies may find it challenging to navigate between two increasingly hostile trading partners.""
Globally, steel prices have been trending down because of the US-China trade conflict, because of which China has been flooding other export markets with its steel, impacting exports of global steel producers."
91,2019-05-13,Tata Steel,"The deal would have transferred some of the debt to the joint venture, allowing Tata Steel to sharpen its focus on ramping up its Indian businessTata has been trying to find a solution for its European business since being hit by the 2016 commodity crisis

MUMBAI :
The collapse of Tata Steel Ltd.’s planned joint venture with Thyssenkrupp AG has brought the Indian group’s more than $13 billion of debt in focus, with no immediate prospect of its European unit being hived off.
The deal would have transferred some of the debt to the joint venture, allowing the Mumbai-based company to sharpen its focus on ramping up its Indian business. Tata’s European operations have debt of 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) and the joint venture was an “important strategic initiative"" to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, the company said on Friday. The company’s group debt stood at $13.15 billion as of March end, the highest among Indian steelmakers.
“With the joint venture off the table now, the big story of deleveraging of the consolidated balance sheet will no longer be valid,"" Vishal Chandak, an analyst at Emkay Global Financial Services, said in a report. However, the end of the merger is not the end of the road for Tata as it will continue with its plans to repay $1 billion of debt announced last month and invest in growth in India, he said.
Tata has been trying to find a solution for its European business since being hit by the 2016 commodity crisis, though many of its troubles stem from before then. The Indian steelmaker bought Corus Group Plc for about $13 billion in 2007 to gain control of its European units, but has been closing and selling plants in the UK since the 2008 financial crisis to make the business more profitable. The collapse of the planned joint venture comes at a time when Europe’s steelmakers are facing headwinds from weak demand from carmakers and high imports.
Thyssenkrupp and Tata had offered concessions to regulators earlier this year to win antitrust approval for the European joint venture, including selling plants in Belgium, Spain and the UK. The companies said Friday that offering further concessions would have undermined the business case for the deal. With increasing likelihood of the venture not being approved by the European Commission, the two companies abandoned the merger.
‘Deleveraging Even More’
“We are going to focus on deleveraging even more,"" Chief Financial Officer Koushik Chatterjee said on Friday. “We are also going to look at other assets sales, whatever we have in the portfolio.""
Tata Steel is shifting its focus to India, where a government-led thrust on infrastructure is supporting demand. Plans are underway to double capacity in five years through expansions at existing mills and acquiring indebted domestic mills.
“The unwinding of a multi-year effort, leads back to the original questions of sustainability and leverage,"" ICICI Securities Ltd.’s analysts Abhijit Mitra and Rohan Jain said in a report. “Over the longer run, management perhaps can execute its India focus, but in the near run as European outlook weakens, the event will be a drag on group profitability as well as leverage.""
The brokerage downgraded the stock to sell from hold with a target of  ₹411 ($5.84). Shares of the company fell as much as 3.1% to  ₹471.60 following a 6.2% fall on Friday after the deal with Thyssenkrupp fell through.
“Tata Steel could find it difficult to divest Tata Steel Europe in the near term in view of the European Commission’s approach to same geography mergers of such a scale,"" Edelweiss Securities Ltd.’s analysts including Amit Dixit wrote in a report. Additionally, with the European business back in Tata’s fold, there is an expectation that the profitable domestic operations may have to support Tata Steel Europe.

90,2019-05-14,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel's Indian operation will largely be able to offset the impact of the collapse, S&P Rating saidThe breakup of the proposed JV may also restrict the steel major to go for further acquisition in India

KOLKATA :
The collapse of Tata Steel's proposed joint venture with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp is ""marginally credit negative"" for the Indian steel major, a global rating agency has said.
The steel major's Indian operation will largely be able to offset the impact of the collapse, it said.
""Tata Steel Ltd and Thyssenkrupp AG's decision to cease efforts on their proposed Europe joint venture is marginally credit negative for Tata Steel,"" S&P Rating said in a bulletin in the wake of the development.
This is likely to depress the ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt by about 100 basis points across our forecast horizon, it said. Tata Steel and the German conglomerate decided to call off their proposed steel joint venture (JV), expecting the deal to be rejected by the European Commission over ""continuing concerns"".
""The cancellation of the joint venture will also leave Tata Steel exposed to the weaker and more volatile performance of the European operations until the company identifies an alternative strategy to deconsolidate the European operations,"" the global rating agency said.
""However, sustained high steel prices and continued robust profitability of Tata Steel's India business remain the more important factors for our positive rating outlook on the company (BB-/positive),"" it said.
""We expect supportive steel prices and continued high utilisation in the India business to drive Tata Steel's FFO-to-debt sustainably above 15 per cent over the next six to 12 months. This is notwithstanding the drag from the retention of the Europe business and the lower-than-expected fourth- quarter profitability in 2019,"" S&P said.
The breakup of the proposed JV may also restrict the steel major to go for further acquisition in India.
""Any outsized spending by Tata Steel on new acquisitions would be a risk to our estimates, though we view this risk to be low-given that there are no large steel mills left to be auctioned in Indian bankruptcy courts,"" the bulletin said.
Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp had signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their steel businesses in Europe to create a 50-50 pan European joint venture company which could have formed the continent's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal.

New Delhi: Tata Steel has not given up on its plans of merging its business in Europe, a top company official said while terming the European Commission's feedback on the proposed joint venture with Thyssenkrupp as a ""speed breaker"".
The company's aim is to make European business stronger for which it will continue to explore various business options including merger, Tata Steel Managing Director T V Narendran told PTI.
""This was something we were working on for last few years but European Commission based on the market feedback decided that it can not recommend JV. So (its) fine. I look (at) it like a speed breaker. These things happen,"" Narendran said on the collapse of Tata Steel's proposed joint venture (JV) with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp.
On 10 May, Tata Steel and the German conglomerate decided to call off their proposed steel JV, expecting the deal to be rejected by the European Commission (EC) over ""continuing concerns"".
Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp had signed definitive agreements in June 2018 to combine their steel businesses in Europe to create a 50-50 pan European joint venture company which could have formed the continent's second-largest steel company after Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal.
Narendran said that Tata Steel Group has been performing well despite challenges in Europe.
Tata Steel termed the proposed JV as an important strategic initiative for the company to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, and now it being thrown off-track, it said, it would explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future.
""The journey of de-leveraging continues and creating structurally strong enterprise continues, (however) the JV could have made it a bit faster in terms of reducing our debt,"" he said.
He further noted that in Europe, the main players for the auto industry are ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp and because of this the EC got adverse feedback from the automobile majors about the merger, as instead of three strong suppliers the automobile majors would have had two strong suppliers.
""We have already made significant investments in Netherlands to supply to the auto industry. So we continue to be a strong player in auto industry,"" he noted.
While answering to a question on whether Tata Steel's options also include any acquisition plan like JSW Steel, which had acquired a plant in Italy, Narendran said, when the company looks at options, it will not be to grow its footprint in Europe, it would be to find a partner like Thyssenkrupp because Europe is not about growth, it is about making the business stronger.
Currently, around two-thirds of Tata Steel's business is in India. With the commissioning of the 5 million tone phase 2 of the Kalinganagar plant in the next 30 months with value added product mix, its share of business along with its profitability is expected to increase further.

Tata Steel Ltd, which has lost more than $700 million in market value after shelving merger plans with Thyssenkrupp AG, expects a tie-up with a non-European partner to clear the region’s regulatory hurdles more easily.
“It is obvious that in Europe we will have limited options because Thyssenkrupp was the best option in many ways,"" chief executive officer T.V. Narendran said in an interview.

Tata, which has about 21,000 employees in Europe with a capacity of 10 million tons of steel annually, will continue to operate its facilities as normal despite the idling of some capacities by major players in the region due to a weak market, he said.
Shares of the company fell 9.6% in the past three trading sessions since the breakdown of the Thyssenkrupp deal was announced. They pared some losses to trade 1.7% higher at 477.50 rupees at 9:41am in Mumbai on Wednesday.

MUMBAI :
With the proposed joint venture with German steel giant Thyssenkrupp now abandoned, Tata Steel will focus on making its European business self-sustainable. Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and chief financial officer of Tata Steel, said in an interview that the market can expect more clarity on the company’s European operations within 6-8 months. Edited excerpts:
Now that the joint venture with Thyssenkrupp has been abandoned, do you see Tata Steel being on the back foot in future negotiations with other potential partners?
Structurally, we’re in a much stronger position with 19 million tonnes (mt) capacity in India, which will become 24mt in the coming 24-28 months. We have a business in Europe that we will drive to self-sufficiency and cash profitability that will compete with European peers.
At a consolidated basis, our Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin is 18%, globally on the top end of the benchmark. We’re not in a weak position and neither are we looking at this from the short-term optimization point of view.
The long-term point of view is that we want to get to a structural outcome similar to that of the JV. As far as debt is concerned, that journey is irrespective. We would like to be debt at 3x Ebitda and so long as we are in the  ₹90,000 crore mark (of debt) we should be okay. We’ve announced that we will reduce debt by $1 billion this year. This is a question of becoming stronger to create more appetite for growth. We want to be leaner and once the 5mt in Kalinganagar is implemented, there will be a further increase in our earnings capability and opportunity to deleverage. That’s 24 months away. So from now on to then, this $1-billion-plus annual exercise will bring debt down substantially.
I don’t think that we are in desperation or in a weak position to negotiate. We’ve done huge restructuring in Europe and have invested in asset configuration in the Netherlands.
The very reason that the European Commission (EC) sees our asset configurations as strong, it means we can drive more value.
If you were to look at another partner for the European operations, could it be non-European, possibly Chinese, partner?
If we are building a similar framework that we developed with Thyssenkrupp, we would be more careful with a European partner and analyse the impact of what works and doesn’t . If it’s non-European, it would be easier, but I can’t discuss preferences in geography or names. We will keep all options open. The EC hasn’t given its final decision on the JV yet, so we are, in fact, still bound by confidentiality.
What timeline should the market look for a resolution on Europe?
This isn’t a fast-food product, it doesn’t happen overnight. The way to look at it is what’s fit for purpose. Of course, it’s not going to take 3-5 years, maybe more like 6-8 months. But we can’t talk about something where a lot of the control is externally dependent (ie from competition commissions). Even if we want it, we have to get the second leg to work with us.
While Tata Steel’s India operations are stable, how does the entry of a third private player affect you?
If you look at fundamentals, India’s steel demand is growing annually at 5-6%. With the kind of consolidation that has happened out of the IBC process, with existing under-utilised assets changing hands and a 5-6% base case in growth of steel demand, a good third competitor coming to the market provides a lot more maturity to the market in terms of product and offerings. This is far better than having unstable and weak competitors because then the market can sometimes behave irrationally. Market discipline is also important.
There are secondary steel units coming up for sale under IBC. Are you interested in them? Does debt on the book constrain further acquisition?
Our asset configuration is fairly well tied up. Secondary mills are typically stranded mills. We don’t want to buy capacity for its own sake. Our acquisitions and organic growth are quite nicely stitched up in terms of upstream, midstream, downstream, value-added products and market and we have the cold rolling mill and galvanizing line coming up in phase 2 of the Kalinganagar expansion. So (we) will not be looking at stranded assets.
How would you respond to the US-China trade wars leading to dumping of steel in India? Are you asking for retaliatory tariffs?
The heat (in the trade war) has come off in the last few days. With regard to import tariffs, as an industry what we worry about is unfair competition. In 2015-6, the price of steel coming in was significantly lower than the cost of steel. Competition is good so long as is on a level-playing basis. If we are used as a dumping ground, then action ought to be taken. The NPA numbers in steel became so large and the solvency of local steel companies were at risk because of this, vis-a-vis the fact that steel companies elsewhere in the world were able to employ people, use economic resources and export their products. That’s the overall unfair platform which needs to be tested and need measures to be taken accordingly."

Tata Steel’s India operations are stable; how does the entry of a third private player affect you?
If you look at fundamentals, India’s steel demand is growing annually at 5-6%. With the kind of consolidation that has happened out of the IBC process, with existing under-utilised assets changing hands and a 5-6% base case in growth of steel demand, a good third competitor coming to the market provides a lot more maturity to the market in terms of product and offerings. This is far better than having unstable and weak competitors because then the market can sometimes behave irrationally. Market discipline is also important."
85,2019-05-22,Tata Steel,"Tata snapped up JLR from Ford Motor Co., and steelmaker Corus Group Plc in 2007 for $12.9 billionOne problem is the small volume of JLR sales in China compared to the competition

Signs of a turnaround at its marquee Jaguar Land Rover unit may not be enough to ease the challenges facing India’s oldest and most-storied business empire.
The Tata Group bought the British luxury carmaker in 2008 for $2.3 billion, and it’s lately become a drag on the salt-to-software conglomerate, racking up losses in three quarters through December. Although Jaguar posted a net income of 119 million pounds ($151 million) this week, debt at owner Tata Motors Ltd. has grown to almost $14 billion, as it struggles to tide over a demand slump in China, the world’s biggest auto market.
JLR’s mixed fortunes have hit Tata — whose wider group debt load bloated to at least $40 billion, the largest among India’s conglomerates — just as it seeks to revamp the sprawling business. Making matters worse, a steel deal in Europe that would’ve eased the group’s liabilities unraveled this month. Tata Motors and Tata Steel Ltd. had a combined debt of about $27 billion, accounting for more than half of the total dues owed by the group’s top 18 units. Tata Steel Bsl Ltd. and Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd., which are in the process of restructuring, had $9 billion of debt at the end of March 31.
“Tata will have to take harsh decisions to mitigate the risk of debt in the long term for the conglomerate,"" said Arun Kejriwal, a director at KRIS, a Mumbai-based investment advisory firm. “For now, Tata Motors and Tata Steel are trouble spots.""
The twin developments mark the biggest challenge facing the 151-year-old group that ventured overseas with acquisitions more than a decade ago. Debt has become a defining issue for some of India’s biggest companies as the government cracks down on bad loans following a decade of expansion.
Tata snapped up JLR from Ford Motor Co., and steelmaker Corus Group Plc in 2007 for $12.9 billion in one of the biggest purchases by an Indian company, shedding the group’s once-staid image.
After years serving as a cash cow, JLR hit a bump in Europe amid concerns over a disruptive Brexit and the industry’s shift away from fossil-fuel vehicles. The diminishing cash flows have raised questions as to how long Tata will hang on to what was once its crown jewel. The steel business was slammed by the financial crisis in 2008 and a commodity crisis eight years later, prompting the group to look for ways to dispose of the assets.
Tata Motors isn’t looking to sell its luxury-car unit and expects a turnaround in China in the coming months, the automotive group’s Chief Financial Officer P.B. Balaji told reporters on May 20. The profit in the fourth quarter came after JLR announced 4,500 job cuts globally and a 2.5 billion-pound savings program. Shares of the parent rose 1.1% Wednesday in Mumbai after tumbling 7% in the previous trading session, the most since May 15.
What Bloomberg Opinion Says
Rather than generating gains from dramatic cost cuts and other measures to boost the bottom line, its meager earnings came on the back of spending less on non-core manufacturing and working-capital improvements.--Anjani Trivedi, columnist
Tata’s struggles echo some of those faced by other Indian conglomerates, including tycoon Anil Ambani’s group, which relied on high leverage to expand operations, only to see their business hit following a crackdown on bad loans by India’s government.
Highlighting concerns over rising debt, S&P Global Ratings cut the credit rating of Tata Motors’s long-term debt four times since July to B+, four notches below investment grade.
“We do not anticipate any more issues on debt,"" CFO Balaji told reporters on May 20. “We do not have any plans to raise funds for JLR to tide over the current debt.""
One problem is the small volume of JLR sales in China compared to the competition. In the first four months of 2019, JLR sold only 8,900 Jaguars and 20,400 Land Rovers, down from 15,100 Jaguars and 39,800 Land Rovers a year earlier, according to data collected by Bloomberg Intelligence.
That puts the Indian automaker at a significant disadvantage against luxury rivals that have much bigger scale in China, said S&P analyst Ashutosh Sharma. In April, for instance, BMW and Mercedes-Benz both sold more than 58,000 vehicles.
“Given their size, JLR is unable to match the price competition ensuing in China,"" Sharma said. “They are not trying to get into price competition, so they are facing steep volume declines."" The rating agency expects cash flow for Tata Motors will remain negative until at least next March.
Quality Perceptions
Even in its home market in the UK, the automaker struggles with the perception of poorly made cars. In the 2018 reliability ranking published by What Car?, JLR had four of the five worst performers among the 25 large and luxury SUVs surveyed.
The headwinds faced by JLR will also test the mettle of Chairman Natarajan Chandrasekaran, a 30-year veteran insider brought in two years ago to revamp the $110-billion group and fix faltering units. Patriarch and long-time chairman Ratan Tata handpicked him to succeed Cyrus Mistry, who was ousted in October 2016 from the top job following a board feud. The goal of the restructuring is to eventually whittle down the 100 operating companies to a more-manageable number under 10 verticals.
The bad news from JLR was compounded by Tata Steel’s decision to give up on a proposed joint venture with German rival, Thyssenkrupp AG, amid antitrust concerns. The deal would’ve helped transfer some of its debt to the joint venture, allowing the Mumbai-based company to sharpen its focus on ramping up its profitable Indian business. The group is still looking for a partner, possibly outside Europe, an executive said in an interview last week.
As part of his restructuring plan, Chandrasekaran achieved a breakthrough last week. Tata Global Beverages Ltd., which owns brands such as Tetley tea and Eight O’Clock coffee, announced plans to acquire the spice, salt and lentil brands of Tata Chemicals Ltd. The newly-enlarged food company will take on a new name, Tata Consumer Products Ltd., and will have sales of nearly 91 billion rupees ($1.3 billion).
“Tata Sons is simplifying businesses and such moves will unlock Tata Global Beverages’s valuations,"" said Chakri Lokapriya, chief investment officer at TCG Asset Management in Mumbai.
However, a fix for Tata Steel’s European business and its 2.2 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in debt is still on Chandrasekaran’s to-do list. For JLR, Tata is exploring strategic options, including a potential stake sale, Bloomberg News reported in March.
Recent channel checks in China indicated “progress on ground has been slow, with dealers still incurring losses on JLR sales,"" Jefferies analyst Arya Sen wrote in a note on May 20.

LONDON :
British Steel collapsed on Wednesday after the government said last-ditch talks with its owners failed to secure a financial rescue.
The High Court in London ordered British Steel Limited into compulsory liquidation, a statement said.
""British Steel Limited was wound-up in the High Court"" on Wednesday, meaning its assets would be sold to help pay debts.
""The government has worked tirelessly with British Steel, its owner Greybull Capital, and lenders to explore all potential options to secure a solution for British Steel,"" said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
""We have shown our willingness to act, having already provided the company"" recently with funds.
Tim Roache, general secretary of the GMB union, described the collapse of Britain's second-biggest steelmaker as ""devastating news for the thousands of workers"" in the UK.
Some 5,000 people are employed by British Steel and an estimated 20,000 more have links to the firm's supply chain.
Greybull has blamed Brexit strains for its financial collapse, while the steel sector faces other uncertainties.
""While Greybull cannot be allowed to walk away scot-free and must be held to account for its stewardship of Britain's second largest steelmaker, ministers cannot wash their hands of the Brexit farce and ongoing uncertainty that has placed the company in difficulty,"" Steve Turner, assistant general secretary of the Unite union, said Wednesday.
""To do so would be a betrayal of a loyal workforce that has made great sacrifices to make British Steel a success and send economic shockwaves throughout the steel industry, UK manufacturing and the households of 20,000 workers in the supply chain who rely on the steelmaker for their livelihoods.""
There are clouds also over the future of Tata Steel's main European operations based in the UK after German industrial conglomerate Thyssenkrupp recently scrapped merger plans with the Indian giant.
A deal was seen as positive for Tata's Port Talbot plant in Wales that employs more than 4,000 staff.
Following the merger collapse, Thyssenkrupp said it would slash 6,000 jobs worldwide in a structural shakeup.
British Steel is owned by investment firm Greybull Capital, who founded the long steel products maker in 2016 after snapping up assets from Tata Steel.
Long steel products include plates, rails for railways, sections used in construction, and wire rod. The latter can be used as steel rope for infrastructure like suspension bridges or filaments for car tyres to give rigidity.

Kolkata: Buoyed by the Central government's continued focus on infrastructure projects, India's steel demand is expected grow by about 7% during the current fiscal, experts said on Tuesday.
""The Central government has been focusing on infrastructure projects like Sagarmala, Smart Cities and the new government would stick to its focus. I think steel demand is expected to grow by 7- 8% in the 2019-20,"" Institute for Steel Development and Growth (INSDAG) Director General Sushim Banerjee said.
Echoing him, JSW Steel President (Operations) Partha Sengupta also said the sector remains bullish on its outlook and steel consumption during the current fiscal would grow in the range of 6-7%.
Addressing the Metals Conclave here organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Tata Steel Managing Director (Processing and Distribution) Abraham Stephanos said: ""The opportunity in India for steel has tremendous potential as we become more and more urbanised.""
""Steel industry in India is affected by structural inefficiencies,"" he added.
State-run NMDC's former Chairman Rana Som said steel companies in the country should expand and grow on the basis of equity capital rather than debt fund.
""The government should pull land available with public sector companies to set up steel plants, otherwise setting up of greenfield steel would be excessively difficult after the implementation of the current land acquisition act,"" he said,
Som also pointed out that many steel plants had been set up at locations from where imports became more feasible than sourcing raw materials from domestic mines.
""This is not a sustainable system as domestic raw materials are worked out to be cheaper than imported ones,"" he said, adding that the government should go back to the iron ore pricing system based on export parity and discard the existing import parity-based pricing system."
82,2019-05-30,Tata Steel,"Steelmakers’ strong performance was a result of relatively strong domestic finished steel consumption growthFitch expects lower margins may result into some increase in leverage ratios for JSW Steel and Tata Steel in FY20

Mumbai: After reporting robust operating margins in FY19, which allowed Indian steelmakers to maintain a healthy debt profile, margins are expected to contract this fiscal, Fitch Ratings said in a note on Thursday.
""Global steel prices have corrected again in May 2019 in the absence of a resolution in trade disputes between the US and China, after recovering since the start of the year. CRU forecasts further price declines with slower industrial growth and weaker underlying demand for steel in multiple regions. As a result, steel prices will continue to be unable to properly reflect higher-priced iron ore"", Fitch said in a report.
""However, we do not anticipate an abrupt squeeze for the sector such as that seen in FY16 with restrained exports from China likely to be a key support for the global steel sector"", the report said.
Fitch expects lower margins may result into some increase in leverage ratios for JSW Steel and Tata Steel in FY20. JSW's increase is likely to be higher due to the significant rise in its capital expenditure as capacity expansion and other projects near completion.
JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd reported 28% and 40% increase, respectively, in their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for fiscal 2019.
Fitch said Indian steelmakers’ strong performance was a result of relatively strong domestic finished steel consumption growth of 7.5% (6.8 million tonnes) during FY19. Imports increased by 4.7% (0.4 million tonnes), much slower than what the market had feared last year in the wake of the imposition of steel import tariffs by the US. However, domestic flat-steel prices followed the downward trend in global steel prices as the threshold at which anti-dumping duties kick in are lower."

New Delhi: Tata Steel on Saturday announced it had completed the acquisition of debt-ridden Bhushan Energy Ltd.
The announcement came after the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approved the resolution plan of Tata Steel to acquire Bhushan Energy for around  ₹800 crore.
""We wish to inform you that Tata Steel BSL Ltd has successfully completed the acquisition of Bhushan Energy Limited (BEL) in accordance with the Approved Resolution Plan under the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016,"" Tata Steel said in a BSE filing.
Pursuant to the acquisition, the company holds 99.99% of the total equity share capital of BEL.
""This disclosure is made in compliance with Regulation 30 of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015,"" the filing said.
The principal bench of NCLT Delhi on Thursday also rejected objections from Bhushan Energy's former promoter Neeraj Singal opposing Tata Steels' bid.
Bhushan Energy was a subsidiary of Bhushan Steel Ltd, which was also taken over by Tata Steel last year in May, and later renamed as Tata Steel BSL Ltd.
Tata Steel had offered  ₹35,200 crore in cash to acquire Bhushan Steel, besides  ₹1,200 crore to creditors and convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity.
Incorporated in 2005, Bhushan Energy is based in Dhenkanal, Odisha.
In 2015-16, Bhushan Energy had reported a gross debt of  ₹2,336 crore.
Earlier in June last year, in this matter, the NCLT had extended the insolvency resolution period for 90 days after the creditors failed to find a suitable buyer within the initial period of 180 days as mandated under the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code.

79,2019-06-04,Tata Steel,"Winning iron ore mines via auctions will be a relief for steelmakersSteelmakers are forced to import costlier ore in the absence of captive mines

MUMBAI :
Steelmakers are pressing the government to auction iron ore mining licences currently held by private miners when they expire in March 2020. Winning iron ore mines via auctions will be a relief for steelmakers, who are forced to import costlier ore in the absence of captive mines.
Over the last week, the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC), Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) and the Chattisgarh Sponge Iron Manufacturers’ Association (CSIMA) have written to NITI Aayog and the mines ministry, making a case for mine auctions. Mint has reviewed copies of the letters.
Welspun Steel, Tata Steel BSL (erstwhile Bhushan Steel), Jindal Saw, MESCO Steel, and Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) are members of Assocham, while Tata Steel, JSPL and Shyam Steels are members of the ICC.
Mint reported on 21 May that production at non-integrated steel companies, which do not have access to captive iron ore resources, will be disrupted in 2020 if auctions are delayed. It will affect companies such as Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd, Essar Steel and JSW Steel, which have inadequate captive iron ore resources and those that are either under stress or have been referred to the National Company Law Tribunal.
A 2017 report by the mines ministry found that licences for 334 mines, out of which 33 working iron ore mines with an annual production capacity of 55 million tonnes (mt), will expire in 2020. Odisha, Karnataka, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh are India’s ore-rich states.
In its letter to Amitabh Kant, CEO, NITI Aayog, ICC said accepting merchant miners’ request to extend their licence till 2030 would mean huge revenue loss by way of auction premium for the exchequer. A letter from Assocham claimed that in Odisha alone, with 16 working iron ore mines of combined capacity of 53 mt, extending the licence period by 10 years would lead to a presumptive loss of  ₹79,500 crore, based on auction premiums paid in the past.
A 2015 amendment to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, extended merchant miners’ licences to their mines by five years till 2020. By this time, the mines were expected to be readied for auction, with new environmental and forest clearances in place.
The initiation of the auction process was delayed till the latter half of 2019 because of the Lok Sabha elections. This could further delay timely auction, since the process takes three to six months to complete, leaving the steel industry in limbo. The iron and steel sector has a total fund-based banking credit of  ₹2.85 trillion and most companies do not have assured iron ore access.
The dearth of domestic iron ore supply will necessitate an increase in the import of iron ore mix, which costs 50% more than domestic ore. This will potentially lead to an increase in the cost of production, a May report by credit rating agency India Ratings said.
The delays in starting operations were primarily because of the delays in obtaining environmental, wildlife and forest clearances. The G2 resource prospection, the third stage of geological assessment, is a pre-requisite for auction.
The letters from the steel industry to the government suggested that to prevent further delay, existing environmental and forest clearances for operational mines can be extended by three years to the new licensee."
78,2019-06-11,Tata Steel,"The European Commission said concessions offered by the companies were not adequateImports from third countries would not be able to offset price hikes resulting from the deal

Brussels: EU antitrust regulators blocked on Tuesday a bid by Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel to form a landmark joint venture, saying the deal would have pushed up prices and reduced competition.
The European Commission said the companies, which had looked to the deal as one way to tackle overcapacity and other challenges in the steel industry, had not done enough to allay its concerns.
""Steel is a crucial input for many things we use in our everyday life, such as canned food and cars. Millions of people in Europe work in these sectors and companies depend on competitive steel prices to sell on a global level,"" European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement.
The Commission said imports from third countries would not have been able to offset potential price hikes resulting from the deal.
This is Vestager's third veto this year, after she blocked Siemens' bid for Alstom, and German copper company Wieland-Werke AG to buy a business unit from Aurubis, Europe's biggest copper smelter, in February.
Last month, Thyssenkrupp and Tata Steel said the deal would be rejected by EU competition enforcers after they declined to offer further concessions to address regulators' concerns.
German steel-to-submarines group ThyssenKrupp will now list its elevator business, its most profitable unit worth an estimated 14 billion euros ($15.9 billion) and twice the parent group's market value.
It may also consider new ownership structures for its car parts, plant engineering and marine systems units.

LONDON :
The European Commission has said it was forced to block a proposed merger between Indian steel major Tata Steel and German giant ThyssenKrupp over concerns that it would have led to a spike in the metal's prices.
The Commission, the executive arm of the 28-member European Union (EU), formally tabled its decision this week after ThyssenKrupp announced its decision to withdraw from the joint venture plans last month in anticipation of the EU ruling.
""Without remedies addressing our serious competition concerns, the merger between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp would have resulted in higher prices. So we prohibited the merger to avoid serious harm to European industrial customers and consumers,"" said Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, in charge of competition policy at the European Commission.
""Steel is a crucial input for many things we use in our everyday life, such as canned food and cars. Millions of people in Europe work in these sectors and companies depend on competitive steel prices to sell on a global level,"" she said.
The Commission concluded that under the EU Merger Regulation, a merger between Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp - to create the second-largest European steel entity behind Lakshmi N Mittal's ArcelorMittal - would have reduced competition and increased prices.
It also felt that the companies did not offer ""adequate remedies"" to address these concerns.
The decision followed an in-depth investigation by the Commission of the proposed joint venture (JV), which would have combined the flat carbon steel and electrical steel activities of ThyssenKrupp and Tata Steel in the European Economic Area (EEA).
ThyssenKrupp is the second-largest producer of flat carbon steel in the EEA while Tata Steel is the third-largest.
Both companies are significant producers of metallic coated and laminated steel for packaging applications and of galvanised flat carbon steel for the automotive industry.
The Commission said its decision preserves effective competition on European steel markets and the competitiveness of the industry, which employs about 360,000 people in more than 500 production sites in 23 EU member-states.
""It will also ensure that key customer industries, such as the European automotive industry and the packaging industry, continue to enjoy access to key inputs at competitive conditions,"" the Commission said.
""As a result, consumers in Europe can continue to rely on the affordability of canned food products and the European automotive industry is able to source steel competitively from the EEA and that product innovation in steel is preserved in support of the transition to more climate friendly and environmentally sustainable mobility,"" it said.
During the investigation, the Commission said it had received feedback from a large number of customers active in the packaging and automotive industries.
These companies depend on competitive steel prices to offer their products to customers at competitive prices and many were worried that the transaction would result in higher prices, it said.
Aware of the Commission's impending decision, the Indian and German companies had announced their respective plans after the proposed JV dating back to June 2018 was abandoned on May 10.
ThyssenKrupp had announced a focus on its elevators business as part of a massive restructuring strategy.
Tata Steel, while admitting that the proposed JV was an important strategic initiative for the company to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, stressed that it would explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future.
""Our strategy is to be the leading and most sustainable flat steel company in Europe with a strong focus on delivering value, especially for our customers, our employees and our shareholders, said Hans Fischer, CEO of Tata Steel's European operations.
""This strategy will continue to guide us and I’m confident we will chart a strong path forward for all our stakeholders,"" Fischer said.
Steel workers' unions in the UK, where Tata Steel has the country's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in Wales, have urged the Indian company to not make any ""kneejerk"" decisions on the workforce following the collapse of the merger.

74,2019-06-25,Tata Steel,"Investors are evidently turning wary of the sector’s immediate prospectsDomestic production remains firm in which will continue to keep the lid of steel price upticks

Mumbai: This year’s recovery in the steel sector is turning out to be short-lived. A recent correction in steel prices, which has seen hot rolled coils down about 10% this past year, has resulted in several steel producer stocks ending up in the red.
Stocks of Tata Steel Ltd, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd were down 1.9% to 4.4% on Monday, and have recovered only marginally on Tuesday. Investors are evidently turning wary of the sector’s immediate prospects.
Perhaps rightly so. The knock-on effect of the trade wars has been keeping pressures on steel prices across the globe. Global trade volumes have slumped for the first time in nine years. As a result, exports are slowing down leading to a rise in domestic inventory buildup.
“We see risks for steel players as 1) exports have declined by 30% YoY to 0.7mt due to a demand slowdown in traditional markets of South East Asia; 2) weakness in re-rollers’ segment owing to auto slowdown; and 3) inventory build-up of 0.5mt. We believe lower exports volume is likely to intensify competition in the domestic market and impact export-heavy companies,"" said Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Besides, domestic production remains firm in which will continue to keep the lid of steel price upticks. On the flipside, iron prices have remained firm due to supply disruptions. The rise in Chinese iron ore prices on a year on year basis of 85.27% to $110.44 starkly contrasts with the fall in Chinese hot-rolled prices by about 10% in the past year. This will add to the margin pressures on steel producers.
To top it, demand from one of the largest consumers of flat steel, the automobile sector, is likely to be curtailed going forward. Auto sales have been contracting which is leading to an inventory build-up in the auto sector.
“Weak automotive demand, coupled with a rising threat from imports and unattractive export markets have put flat steel producers at higher risk compared to long producers. TATA and JSTL – India’s top two flat producers accounting for the majority sales to the auto segment – are likely to be impacted negatively,"" noted HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India (Private) Ltd in a note to clients.
Besides, analysts also don’t rule out the possibility of higher imports which could further dampen domestic prices. “Despite relatively healthy domestic consumption growth, we see challenging times ahead for the steel sector due to potentially higher imports and pressure on domestic realisation,"" said Edelweiss.
For now, much of the sector’s prospects hinge on how the domestic market shapes up. In the near term, though, there’s not much of a steel demand recovery in sight."
73,2019-07-09,Tata Steel,"Steps such as sale of assets, going slow on some domestic capacity additions have kept the high debt levels in checkAll this meant that Tata Steel had to raise additional debt to fund these expansions

Lately, investors in Tata Steel Ltd are turning jittery about its high debt. In the last four years, the steel behemoth’s borrowings have risen by about a fifth, increasing its net debt in FY19 to over  ₹1 trillion. Naturally, then, the price of its stock has declined by more than a tenth this past year.
In the last few years, in a quest to retain market share domestically, Tata Steel has ramped up operations. Last year, through acquisitions such as Bhushan Steel Ltd and Usha Martin Ltd, the firm did well to take capacities up to about 19 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). Further, strategic expansions will take its total capacity to 30 mtpa by 2025. All this meant that Tata Steel had to raise additional debt to fund these expansions. “The strategic intent to attain industry leadership in terms of capacity remains at odds with deleveraging—and this is indeed a key concern,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities Ltd.
The management has said in its annual report released lately that it will focus on deleveraging as a primary strategic measure to rebuild muscularity. Specific timelines, however, to shrink those high debt levels have not been provided, point out ICICI Securities analysts. The question now for most investors is how the company will handle its high borrowings.
Thankfully, some strategic measures such as the sale of assets and going slow on some domestic capacity additions have kept the high debt levels in check. Besides, other strategic measures are also in play such as extending the debt maturity profile.
“FY19 net debt, as calculated from the annual report, works out to  ₹101,190 crore, against the  ₹94,880 crore highlighted by the company (hybrid perpetual bonds + creditors for capital supplies added). The company has extended the debt maturity profile by successfully raising  ₹4,315 crore in 15-year NCDs, and 12-year takeout financing for  ₹15,500 at Tata Steel BSL,"" said analysts at ICICI Securities.
The good thing is that Tata Steel’s Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) levels have been improving. Still, a sluggish European operation would mean that much overseas debt servicing would have to take place from its domestic business. To an extent, domestic Ebitda will foot about 85-90% of debt-servicing bills in the near term, note analysts.
Much will also depend on how the company pares down debt. Analysts expect debt to shrink by about  ₹3,000 crore in the coming year, although the management aims for higher levels of debt reduction. Still, much depends on steel revival at home. While the focus remains on deleveraging, a weakening steel cycle is a key hindrance to this endeavour, analysts at IIFL Institutional Equities said in a note.
There are risks from the slowdown in automotive sales, as sales to the sector stood at 2.12 mt out of total sales of 12.7 mt in FY19.
To top it all, valuations compared to global firms are discomfiting. “Indian steel company valuations are at a steep premium to global peers despite much higher leverage (net debt/Ebitda). EV/Ebitda multiples of global steel companies have come down from 5-6x in the past to about 4x now,"" said analysts at CLSA India Pvt. Ltd in a client note. EV stands for enterprise value.
So at least for now, shareholders of Tata Steel are not likely to reap the fruits of the expensive expansions."

MUMBAI :
ThyssenKrupp plans to develop an Indian procurement centre as a supply hub for its engineering business in its push to turn around the loss-making division.
The engineering business, which makes turnkey plants for the chemical, fertilizer, cement and mining industries, contributes up to 9% of the elevators-to-submarine group's net sales, but has been mired in losses due to a weak global environment.
""Our target is to achieve the needed turnaround next year,"" Marcel Fasswald, chief executive of ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions, told Reuters in an interview in Mumbai.
""India is already a global hub for some products and we are building up a global procurement centre here in India.""
He said mining and cement were going to be the major drivers of the business's growth in India and, aided by the country's cost benefits, it could become a hub for many more products.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's latest budget includes a major investment plan to boost infrastructure, rural consumption and foreign investment.
Fasswald said the continued emphasis on infrastructure such as roads, bridges and power would generate a bigger share of orders for the engineering business.
India currently contributes one-fifth of ThyssenKrupp's industrial solutions business and one-fourth of its workforce.
Unlike Germany, where Thyssenkrupp is cutting jobs and costs, Fasswald said in India the group would be increasing its workforce.
He said India had substantial cost benefits that made the country a preferred location as a hub to supply to other south Asian countries.

Mumbai: JSW Steel, India’s second largest private steel manufacturer, has redoubled efforts to boost tinplate manufacturing. The company said it has invested close to  ₹1,000 crore at its Tarapur unit in Maharashtra to roll out JSW Platina, premium tinplate, to tap the growing demand from the local packaging industry.
The investment is part of the group's ongoing  ₹45,000 crore capital expenditure programme.
“The demand for tinplate in India is at about 700,000 tonnes today,"" Jayant Acharya, director - Commercial, Marketing & Strategy, JSW Steel said. “It’s growing at 6.5% per year and I think this will rise as alternative packaging picks up. India has about 1 million tonne of installed capacity but less than half of it is operational. India imports about 300,000 tonnes a year, but 55-60% of this is secondary material that doesn’t qualify for use in the developed world. “
“For the first line at Tarapur, we’ve set up 250,000 tonne capacity with an investment of  ₹575 crore,"" Acharya added. “In the second line, we’re adding another 250,000 tonnes with an investment of  ₹490 crore. We expect the product to deliver better margins than general operations."" Once both lines are operational, JSW Steel will have installed tinplate capacity of 600,000 tonnes, including an existing 100,000 tonnes as part of a joint venture with Vallabh Tinplate in Punjab, called JSW Vallabh Tinplate Pvt Ltd. They will overtake Tata Steel as the largest tinplate manufacturer in India, with an existing capacity of 380,000 tonnes a year.
Domestic tinplate production has been growing so far at compound average growth rate of 7.4% since FY10, while demand over the same period has grown at 6.4%. Tinplate is used for packaging in the consumables industry for edible oil and fruit pulp, as beverage cans, and in cans for paint and solvent, as a replacement for plastic.
The domestic market for tinplate is estimated to be approximately  ₹5,500 to 6,000 crore in value terms, Acharya said. “Demand for this product will grow over a period of time in India. We anticipate a lot of aspirational demand from smaller cities, where there is a need for off-the-shelf products like this.""
Acharya said JSW is the first in India to manufacture tinplate through a continuous annealing furnace, that creates a better product in terms of “hardness and temper, which is needed for non-oil cans, and a smaller grain size that makes the material tougher""."

Mumbai: Tata Steel will raise $600 million, partly to refinance loans and partly to fund the capital expenditure of phase two expansion at its Kalinganagar plant, Koushik Chatterjee, CFO, Tata Steel, said. The company is focused on increasing free cash flow to reduce its debt burden, he added while addressing the media after the annual shareholders’ meeting here.
Chatterjee said the company has set a target of reducing gross debt by $1 billion in FY20, after Tata Steel's merger of its European operations with Thyssenkrupp AG fell apart following failure to meet Europe's antitrust requirements. Chatterjee said the company will aim to make its European operations self-sustainable.
Tata Steel has net debt of  ₹1 trillion, as of March 2019.

With global steel prices nosediving while production costs rise, Tata Steel, the country’s largest private steel maker, reported net profit of  ₹702 crore in the June 2019 quarter, falling 63% year-on-year. The company had reported consolidated net profit of  ₹1934 crore in the year-ago period.
Poor industrial sentiment overseas and with Tata Steel recently announcing its failure to sell its European assets weighed down on earnings. Consolidated revenue from operations remained flat in the quarter, at  ₹35,382.16 crore.
For India, the company reported standalone net profit of  ₹1567 crore, 15% lower than the  ₹1856 crore it reported last year. “In India, steel prices declined as subdued economic activity, seasonal slowdown and liquidity issues weighed on domestic consumption. Higher net imports further exacerbated the demand supply balance,"" the company said in a press release.
On Tuesday, Tata Steel said it had abandoned plans to sell its Southeast Asian assets to China’s HBIS group. On Wednesday, the company said it has executed a memorandum of understanding to divest 70% of its stake in Tata Steel Thailand to Synergy Metals and Mining Fund, a Dubai-based private equity fund. “As a next step, Synergy will carry out confirmatory due diligence and both parties shall engage to complete the definitive agreements in an expeditious manner.""

The luxury hotel chain controlled by the Tata Group is looking to sell some assets and avoid owning new properties in an effort to further pare debt, as it braces for a slump in consumer spending.
Indian Hotels Co, Tata’s listed firm that operates the Taj brand, plans to dispose of certain budget inns in the nation’s non-metro areas and lease them back for a fee, Puneet Chhatwal, managing director and chief executive officer said in an interview.
“We are moving our focus to more management contracts rather than constructing hotels of our own,"" Chhatwal said. “We have no plans to put our legacy and flagship properties under sale and lease back.""
The Mumbai-based company’s measures to cut costs and liabilities come at a time growth in Asia’s third-biggest economy has cooled to a five-year low, while a lingering shadow-bank crisis damps discretionary spending. The nation’s biggest carmaker, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, reported the worst sales drop since 2012 in July. Besides the slowdown, the grounding of Jet Airways India Ltd has also hit Indian Hotels, forcing it to write-off some dues.
The chain, which operates New York’s The Pierre and St. James Court in the UK, has been reducing debt in the past few years by selling assets including apartments purchased for Tata Group’s executives. Consolidated net debt stood at  ₹2,000 crore ($282 million) at the end of March, down from as high as  ₹3,100 crore two years earlier, according to the hospitality firm.
Indian Hotels is focusing on an “asset light model"" besides keeping costs under check and shedding non-core assets, Amit Agarwal, analyst at Nirmal Bang Securities Pvt. said over phone. All 12 brokerages, whose data Bloomberg compiles for this firm, have a buy rating on the stock.
The efforts to pare borrowings at the hotel chain are also part of a wider drive at India’s biggest conglomerate. Tata Motors Ltd, the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, has said it is looking at options for the struggling British luxury brands. Tata Steel Ltd is in the midst of a revamp of its European operations.
The hotel operator aims to reduce ownership of properties to 50% by 2022, from 70% at present, Chhatwal said. The sale and lease-back plans include as many as six hotels at the group’s Ginger budget brand and a similar number held by joint ventures and associate companies, he said.
Indian Hotels, currently operates 151 hotels, including the Taj Mahal Palace that became the target of terrorists during the Mumbai siege in 2008.

The prolonged slump in the domestic automobile industry has impacted the steel sector, Tata Steel CEO and MD T.V. Narendran said on Thursday.
The demand for steel in India has to pick up and that depends a lot on construction and automobile sectors, he added.
Narendran, also the vice-president of CII, was speaking to reporters after representatives of various industry bodies held a meeting with Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman here.
""I think steel touches all parts of the economy...It is 20% of the steel that gets consumed in auto and that has an impact. That is certainly something that has played out over the last three months,"" said Narendran, who is While auto industry has its own challenges, the government can do a lot in construction and infrastructure segments, but the rest depends on private capital and residential demand, he added.
""They (automobile industry) had a separate sitting with the (finance) minister yesterday (Wednesday)... So as far as international market is concerned, things are bit soft. The problem is less about international steel flows and more about domestic demand,"" Narendran said.
The domestic auto industry is witnessing an unprecedented slump in sales, with the passenger vehicles (PV) segment being the worst hit.
As per SIAM figures, vehicle wholesale across all the categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in April-June against 69,42,742 units in same period of last year.
On Wednesday, leaders of the auto industry met the finance minister and asked for a stimulus package, including GST reduction on vehicles."
60,2019-08-09,Tata Steel,"The stock fell as much as 4.03% on Thursday, before closing 3.77% lowerTata Steel’s Indian operations, though, held up somewhat, despite a slowdown in the domestic economy

Mumbai: A slowdown in its European operations dragged down Tata Steel Ltd’s overall operating margins, which in turn took a toll on its stock price. The stock fell as much as 4.03% on Thursday, before closing 3.77% lower. Given the weak outlook, analysts have not ruled out a further derating.
The double whammy of lower steel prices and higher raw material costs have been impacting steel producers. Steel prices have softened significantly in the past quarter leading to lower realizations. As a result, globally diversified firms such as Tata Steel have been hit.
Revenues from its European operations dipped by 11% year-on-year to  ₹14,495 crore in the June quarter. Volume growth was lower than what the Street had pencilled in. Operational issues further dragged down performance. In fact, the European operations face headwinds from lower economic growth and uncertainty around Brexit.
Tata Steel’s Indian operations, though, held up somewhat, despite a slowdown in the domestic economy. Steel production rose 23% year-on-year to 4.5 million tonnes (mt), while sales increased 18% year-on-year to 3.96 mt. As a result, domestic revenues rose by 12.7% from a year earlier. Higher operating costs, however, saw its domestic net profit shrink marginally, though subdued economic activity and liquidity issues will weigh on domestic consumption.
A rise in production could not perk up revenues because steel realizations were lower in the first quarter. Consolidated steel production rose 11% year-on-year to 7.15 mt, while sales increased 5% year-on-year to 6.34 mt. Domestic production surged 23%, while sales grew 18% from a year ago.
Nevertheless, lower realizations dragged down Tata Steel’s consolidated Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization). Ebitda margins came in at 15%, which saw a sharp contraction of 200 basis points year-on-year.
Tata Steel has cut back on its domestic expansion plans due to slowing demand. Capital expenditure plans have been cut by 20-25%. This is also to help the company keep its deleveraging plans on course.
“Tata Steel has reiterated its deleveraging plan of $1 billion in FY20 relying on cash flows from a) downward revising FY20 capex by 20-25%, b) working capital release of  ₹2,000 crore, and c) potential stake sale of south east Asia business,"" said analysts at JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd in a note to clients.
Still, its overleveraged balance sheet, coupled with a weak earnings outlook, could continue to weigh on the Tata Steel stock in the medium term."
59,2019-08-10,Tata Steel,"The company has revised the planned capital expenditure for 2019-20 to  ₹8,000 crore from  ₹12,000 croreThe steel sector is expected to see a pick-up in the second half of the year

Kolkata: Facing headwinds amid a slowdown in the economy, Tata Steel Ltd on Saturday said it is likely to revise the planned capital expenditure for 2019-20 to  ₹8,000 crore from  ₹12,000 crore.
The steel sector is expected to see a pick-up in the second half of the year, a top company official said.
""We have given a guidance that the capex will be 20-25% lower than the original plan between Europe and India (operations)... our original estimate was  ₹12,000 crore for the Tata Steel Group... it will now be around  ₹8,000 crore,"" Tata Steel CEO and MD T V Narendran said.
Of the  ₹12,000 crore, the steel major had initially planned to spend around  ₹8,000 crore on India operations.
""Both sides (India and Europe) will take a cut,"" Narendran told reporters here after the launch of the company's steel retail store, steeljunction.
He said the capex for India will largely be deployed for its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha."
58,2019-08-11,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel lost £371 million in Britain in the financial year until March end this year as a result of lower productionIts turnover from UK plant rose 1% to £2.4 million, but the production fell from 3.6 million tons to 3.2 million after one of the two blast furnaces was shut down for maintenance

LONDON :
Indian steel conglomerate Tata Steel lost more than £1 million a day in the UK last year, according to the company's annual report.
The Indian steelmaker, which runs the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot in south Wales, lost £371 million in Britain in the financial year until March end this year as a result of lower production.
The losses mark a hike from £222 million a year earlier, according to
The Sunday Times.
As per the annual report, the company's turnover from its UK plant rose 1% to £2.4 million, but the production fell from 3.6 million tons to 3.2 million after one of the two blast furnaces was shut down for maintenance.
Tata Steel spent £56 million during the year to extend the furnace's life by up to seven years.
""The losses for Tata Steel UK, disclosed in its annual report, come as the industry struggles to forge a future,"" the newspaper report said.
""Tata has spent the past few years unwinding its top-of-the-market £6.2 billion takeover of Anglo-Dutch steel giant Corus in 2007,"" it adds.
The Tata Group employs 8,500 staff in its UK steel business. The company's hopes for a turnaround in fortunes for its European arm with a merger with Germany's Thyssenkrupp collapsed in May this year, after it was blocked by the European Commission on competition grounds.
While admitting that the proposed JV was an important strategic initiative for the company to create a sustainable portfolio in Europe, Tata Steel had stressed that it would explore all options to achieve similar outcomes in the future.
""Our strategy is to be the leading and most sustainable flat steel company in Europe with a strong focus on delivering value, especially for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.
""This strategy will continue to guide us and I'm confident we will chart a strong path forward for all our stakeholders,"" Hans Fischer, CEO of Tata Steel’s European operations, had said at the time.
Tata Steel is one of Europe's leading steel producers, with steelmaking in the Netherlands and the UK, and manufacturing plants across Europe.
The company says it supplies high-quality steel products to the most demanding markets, including construction and infrastructure, automotive, packaging and engineering.
A few years ago in 2016 amid ongoing strains on the worldwide steel industry, Tata Steel had sold British Steel to Greybull Capital, but the private equity firm's attempt to revive the business failed as it collapsed in May this year. It is now in the process of being sold by administrators."
57,2019-08-15,Tata Steel,"Odisha will auction eight mines with total reserves of 573 million tonnes later this monthSteel companies unlikely to bid high for Odisha iron ore mines

MUMBAI :
Upcoming iron ore mine auctions in Odisha might see muted participation from steel makers worried about high bid expectations, company executives said. The state will auction eight mines with total reserves of 573 million tonnes (mt) later this month, according to reports.
Top steel makers will need additional ore since they are all expanding and buying insolvent assets, said Pankaj Satija, chief of regulatory affairs, Tata Steel, and chairperson, raw materials sub-committee, Indian Steel Association. Tata Steel itself is expanding its Kalinganagar plant in Odisha and needs more ore for Bhushan Steel Ltd that it recently acquired.
Odisha produced around 114mt of ore in 2018-19, more than half of India’s total output. “So, the Odisha auctions are going to play a major role in meeting the current and future iron ore requirements for the large steel companies. Going by the past records of auctions for iron ore blocks in India, we have seen the lease being acquired for a premium of 44.35% and the highest offer in subsequent rounds touching as high as 275%. The average bid price in 2016 for iron ore blocks in India was 86.5%, which increased to 93.6% in 2017 and 100.2% in 2018. In 2019, if you look at the recent auctions of Karnataka and Maharashtra, average bid price comes to 85.92%.
The impending auction of iron ore blocks in Odisha will not be much different and companies will try to ensure raw material security for long-term sustenance,"" Satija said. There are also concerns on how quickly the new lessee can start production, he added.
The bid premium is a percentage of the average monthly price of grades of iron ore, published by Indian Bureau of Mines. The mine is awarded to the highest bid premium offer.
“Steel demand has slowed down and the economy is on shaky ground,"" a JSW Steel Ltd official said on condition of anonymity. “JSW Steel will not be aggressively participating in the Odisha auctions and we are not willing to pay an excessive premium for the mines, unlike what we did for the Karnataka blocks. I don’t think we will cross at 25-30% bid premium threshold.""
The company recently acquired three mines in Karnataka, with an average bid premium of 78.88%.
A JSW Steel spokesperson declined to comment.
“When we bid, we only go up to an extent,"" said Manish Kharbanda, executive director, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL). “We make sure that whatever we take, we operate. We have 6mtpa (million tonnes per annum) capacity in Angul, which we want to scale up to 12mtpa. For this, we do require captive iron ore. We also have a 9mtpa pellet plant in Odisha and 3mtpa of integrated steel production. We will look at 2-3 large mines but we will be pragmatic in our bidding.""
“Mines in Odisha will attract higher bid premiums because of the state’s better quality of ore,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director, Crisil Research. “Since more than half of India’s crude steel-making capacity is based in the eastern belt, we expect significant participation from large steel makers in the region, smaller sponge iron and pellet makers and merchant miners. In the last two years, we saw Bhushan Steel pay a 100% bid premium in Odisha, Bhushan Power and Steel bid at 87% while Essar Steel won offering 44%,"" Gandhi said.
“The capital cost for developing iron ore mines in Odisha is much higher compared to other states due to the imposition of the recommendations by National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) which prescribes setting up of slurry pipeline or railway siding or conveyor for mines that produce more than 5 million tonnes,"" the JSW official cited earlier said. “Almost every mine in Odisha has a production capacity of more than 5 mtpa. This calls for not only huge capital investment but also execution risks apart from logistics constraints in Odisha.""
“We’re also concerned on how soon the new lessee can start production once the licence is awarded,"" Satija of Tata Steel said. “The current non-captive licences expire in March 2020, but what’s the guarantee that the new lessees can start production from April 1? You cannot start production unless you have environment and forest clearances. In the past, we have seen cases where production couldn’t start for at least four years after the licence was awarded. If this process takes as long this time around, we will see a quarter of the iron ore supply getting disrupted, impacting steel production. We are hopeful that the central and state governments would facilitate to the extent possible to make the transition as seamless as possible with positive policy interventions.""

56,2019-08-21,Tata Steel,"In the last month, the Nifty Metal index lost 14.3%, which was among the highest in the sectoral indicesSAIL has lost as much as 55% this past year, JSPL 49%, Tata Steel 40% and Vedanta 36%

Amber signs continue to flash for metal companies. Rising inventory levels in China and subdued metal prices are driving metal stocks south, which could drag the downturn for a long time.
In the last month, the Nifty Metal index lost 14.3%, which was among the highest in the sectoral indices. In the past year, against a fall of about 9% in the Nifty 500 index, the Nifty Metal index lost a whopping 32%. Stocks of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) Ltd, Jindal Stainless (Hisar) Ltd, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL), Hindustan Copper Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd and Vedanta Ltd figure among the top losers in the metal index. SAIL has lost as much as 55% this past year, JSPL 49%, Tata Steel 40% and Vedanta 36%.
Low global prices have hit domestic revenues. To top it, the slowdown in domestic demand further played truant, taking a toll on net profits. “Metal companies under our coverage exhibited muted performance in 1QFY20 with EBITDA/PAT declining 18% & 43% YoY. The subdued results were driven by lower prices amid global uncertainty, weak demand in India and lower to broadly steady volumes,"" said analysts at Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd in a client note. Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, and PAT is profit after tax.
For now, the recovery could take longer than anticipated. The auto sector continues to grapple with the slowdown, rising inventory and lower sales. Government spends on infrastructure have yet to show signs of improvement. Barring JSPL, other large companies have either reported lower or flat steel volume growth. In fact, steel makers are expecting prices to slip further by about  ₹3,000 per tonne.
Recovery could take as long as the second half to materialize. Production cuts, for now, are resulting in increasing working capital and costs. Additionally, a Chinese inventory build-up means prices will remain flat or lower for some time. Many metal firms have also expanded their capacities. That would translate into cost increases against a backdrop of lower volumes.
A few firms face the prospect of weakening debt servicing capabilities if the metal prices don’t improve. “Despite management guiding for debt to stay below  ₹44,000 crore, as at Q1FY20 end it stands at  ₹48,500 crore—the highest-ever level for SAIL,"" said analysts at Edelweiss Securities Ltd in a note on 14 August.
A good thing is that iron ore prices eased this past month by about 26% to about $89 per tonne, which can reduce costs for steel makers. However, the management commentary on the demand outlook continues to show weakness for most metal firms. Both prices and volume offtake are important for a full-fledged recovery. From the looks of it, both are some time away— which means the Nifty Metal index may remain subdued for some time."

BERLIN :
German industrial giant ThyssenKrupp said Thursday it has filed a complaint at an EU court against the European Commission for blocking its plan to merge with Indian group Tata Steel.
""We regret the European Commission's decision and regard it as too far-reaching and wrong. That is why we are filing a complaint,"" said Donatus Kaufmann, member of ThyssenKrupp's board.
The European Union's powerful anti-trust authority had in June vetoed the deal, finding that it would have ""reduced competition and increased prices for different types of steel"".
It also found that proposed solutions would not adequately mitigate the problem. But ThyssenKrupp has now turned to the General Court of the European Union, as it argued that the Commission has ""set out a restrictive market definition that unduly extends the scope of the existing competition law"".
The German company also claimed the European Commission had failed to take into ""adequate account the structural importance of imports into Europe"".
""Overcapacities and high import pressure from Asia create an environment in which the planned joint venture with Tata Steel would not have impaired competition,"" said Kaufmann.
The European steel industry has been hit by a wave of problems, including overcapacity, cheap Asian imports and punishing US tariffs.
ThyssenKrupp expects to post a loss for 2019.

53,2019-09-02,Tata Steel,"The company saw no prospects of the business returning to profitability in the coming yearsThe news comes weeks after Turkey's military pension fund OYAK reached a provisional agreement to take over British Steel

BENGALURU :
India's Tata Steel Ltd said on Monday it would shut parts of its non-core businesses in the United Kingdom, a move that could cost about 400 jobs.
The steelmaker proposed to close its loss-making Orb Electrical Steels site in South Wales, potentially affecting up to 380 jobs, as it was ""unable to find a way forward"" for the business, it said in a filing to Indian stock exchanges.
Tata put up five of its non-core businesses in Europe on sale in May 2018 as it looked to focus on its strip products business.
Orb is part of one of these businesses, Cogent, which makes electrical steels.
""Continuing to fund substantial losses at Orb Electrical Steels is not sustainable at a time when the European steel industry is facing considerable challenges,"" said Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steel's European operations.
The company saw no prospects of the business returning to profitability in the coming years, Adam said.
Tata Steel said it would cost the company more than 50 million pounds ($61.39 million) to upgrade the site to produce steel for electric vehicle production.
Unite, UK's largest trade union, said in a statement it has sought assurances that there would be no compulsory redundancies from Tata Steel after the steelmaker announced Orb's closure.
Tata added it had signed a deal to sell Cogent Power, another division of Cogent, to Japan's JFE Shoji Trade Corp.
It also plans to close another non-core business, Wolverhampton Engineering Steels Service Centre, as it did not find a buyer. This could cost up to 26 jobs, it said.
The news comes weeks after Turkey's military pension fund OYAK reached a provisional agreement to take over British Steel, which Greybull Capital bought for one pound from Tata Steel three years ago, potentially saving thousands of jobs.
British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation on May 22 after Greybull Capital failed to secure funding to continue its operations."

The National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) today approved JSW Steel Ltd.’s $2.7 billion bid for Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd., the second major steel asset the mill has bagged under the nation’s new insolvency process.
The NCLT approved the offer while stating that profits made by Bhushan Power during the insolvency period must be distributed to creditors, in accordance with a ruling by a higher tribunal in a case involving ArcelorMittal-Essar Steel India Ltd.
Bhushan Power will add 3.5 million tons a year of capacity to the Sajjan Jindal-led mill’s operations and establish the Mumbai-based company’s footprint in the eastern part of the country. JSW bid about  ₹19,700 crore, higher than rivals Tata Steel Ltd. and Liberty House Group.
JSW wasn’t dissuaded in its pursuit of Bhushan Power by a string of accounting frauds, including those totaling about  ₹5,600 crore reported by Allahabad Bank Ltd. and Punjab National Bank. The sale won’t be affected by criminal proceedings against the former founders of Bhushan Power on the alleged siphoning off of funds, the court said Thursday. The court also appointed a monitoring panel to oversee implementation of JSW’s resolution plan.
Steel Restructure
India’s steel industry has been a major beneficiary of a new bankruptcy process implemented by the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Global players like ArcelorMittal and domestic producers have bid aggressively for stressed assets hoping to gain plants that would immediately contribute to profits.
Apart from JSW, the bankruptcy process has aided the purchase by billionaire Anil Agarwal’s Vedanta Ltd. of Electrosteel Steels Ltd. and boosted Tata Steel Ltd.’s capacity with the acquisition of Bhushan Steel Ltd. ArcelorMittal has won the biggest steel plant under the insolvency process, Essar Steel India Ltd., but is yet to get control due to legal challenges.
Shares of JSW Steel pared gains of as much as 3.5% in Mumbai after the court’s decision and were trading 0.3% higher at 2:32 p.m. local time.
In July 2018, JSW and partner, the Apollo Global Management LLC-backed Aion Capital Partners, bought Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd. under the new bankruptcy process. JSW plans to look for a partner for Bhushan Power, as it did for Monnet, once the deal is completed. Bhushan Power owes financial creditors 471 billion rupees.
Adding Bhushan Power would allow JSW to reach its goal of increasing capacity to 45 million tons in India and have overseas capacity of 10 million tons by 2031.

Mumbai: The ongoing economic slowdown in the country has claimed the livelihood of lakhs of people. New projects and investments have been put on hold, while a revival could take longer as investor confidence in companies cut a sorry picture at the exchanges.
Data from the bourses suggest that in just the past one year, the automobile and manufacturing companies, have seen over one-third of their share value getting eroded, on average, indicating a sharp decline in these companies' abilities to raise capital in the market.
During the period in consideration, the Nifty metal index has lost the most among the 11 sectors constituting the benchmark index.
Manufacturing companies like SAIL and Jindal Steel, which constitute the metal index, declined by 35%, on an average.
Not a distant second was the auto index, which fell over 33%.
Among the 15 constituent stocks of the auto index, Tata Motors, Motherson Sumi Systems and Ashok Leyland have been worse hit, losing 55% , 66% and 51%, respectively. Bajaj Auto seems to have bucked the trend, coming down merely 2% amid companies severely hurt owing to the slowdown.
Latest data shows that automobile sales for the month of August hit the lowest since 1997-98.
Steel companies are witnessing a similar trend. The state-owned Steel Authority of India (SAIL) has lost over 57%, while Jindal Steel has also shed over half of its share value in the last one year.
Six of the 15 companies constituting the index have lost over 40% of their share value.
The state-run bank index — Nifty PSU Bank index — despite a slew of measures that have been announced for the sector, has yet to regain investor interest. The PSU (public sector undertaking) bank index has declined by 21% during the same period.
The Nifty pharma index — investment in which firms are considered to be relatively safe during downturns, and, therefore, called defensive investments — fell 22%.
The Nifty media index also also shed over 30%."
50,2019-09-15,Tata Steel,"Mining industry had sought extension of leases of all operational non-captive mines for a period of 10 years beyond 2020The move will impact about 334 mines belonging to companies such as Tata Steel, Vedanta Limited and others

New Delhi: In a setback for the mining industry, the government is set to reject a proposal to extend non-captive mining leases of companies that are expiring after completing 50 year period in March, 2020.
The move will impact about 334 mines belonging to companies such as Tata Steel, Vedanta Limited, Essel Mining, V.M. Salgaocar and Rungta Mines in 10 states that are facing expiry of lease and closure by March next year under current regulations. Of these 46 working mining leases have a significant contribution to the production of iron ore, manganese ore and chromite ore in the country.
Sources said a high level committee (HLC) set upon by Niti Aayog to identify key challenges of the sector and negate their impact has recommended that all existing mining lease of companies that have completed 50 years of operation will expire on March 31, 2020 and these would then be allocated through an auction process to be conducted in the January-March. Government is set to implement these recommendations, sources said.
""The committee took note of the fact that these mines have known reserves and their period of lease will come to an end on 31-03-2020 as per MMDR (Amendment) Act, 2015 was also known. The legislature had already given a time of 5 years to ward off any situation causing disruption in supplies to local industry. Therefore, extension of time for continued operation of these mines is not desirable,"" the committee has said in its report.
The mining industry had sought extension of leases of all operational non-captive mines for a period of 10 years beyond 2020 with another 20 years extension to be considered beyond this period. This, they felt, was necessary to prevent disruption in production while allowing full exploitation of resource available in a mine.
""Non-extension of lease of non-captive mines is a setback for the industry that is already facing a slowdown in demand and lower prices. This would also disrupt existing mining operations and put jobs of lakhs of workers under risk,"" said an executive of a private sector miner asking not to be named.
While disallowing extension of mining leases, the HLC has said that post auction new leaseholders could continue operating on approved mining plan of previous leaseholders and environment clearance (EC) for an initial period of 2 years.
This will help in preventing disruption in mineral production during the period of transition from one leaseholder to other. Moreover, this would provide time to new leaseholder to apply for fresh environment and forestry clearance without facing delays.
The government is studying the recommendations of the HLC and will soon come up with an action plan including further amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act. The HLC is chaired by Niti Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar and consists of the cabinet secretary and secretaries of mines, steel, coal, revenue and finance. The committee was set up in April on mines, minerals and coal sectors to identify key challenges and negate their impact. It has given its report to the Centre.

49,2019-09-25,Tata Steel,"Despite ongoing talks between the US and China, the situation at the metals exchanges is one of cautionIn the metal sector, the implications of the cut vary among companies

Stocks of metal companies undershot the Nifty 500 index last year. That may not change even with the recent corporate tax cut. The Nifty Metals index has been one of the worst performers so far in 2019, losing about 20%.
Last week, the government reduced the corporate tax rate from 30% to 22% on the condition that companies would avail no exemptions. The effective tax rate, along with surcharges, stands reduced to 25.17% from 34.94%.
In the metal sector, the implications of the cut vary among companies. Some avail additional state-level exemptions, depending on the states they operate in. Ergo, such companies may have to forgo these exemptions in order to qualify for the lower tax rate.
As such, companies with a more significant proportion of domestic earnings with lower exemptions stand to gain. Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel, NMDC Ltd and Nalco Ltd are expected to see an increase of 13-17% in their earnings per share. Others, such as Vedanta Ltd, Hindustan Zinc Ltd, and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd, will not see much change. Much of this will depend on how companies reassess their tax planning.
Considering that there won’t be a sizeable impact on earnings, metal stocks are expected to remain muted. “Lower tax is not a re-rating event as drivers lie elsewhere; the value lies only in selected stocks. Lower taxes will not drive significant change in the balance sheets of metals companies and concerns regarding high leverage persist,"" said analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities in a recent client note.
A bigger worry for companies is sluggish prices of metals and weakening demand, which endures.
Domestic steel prices have fallen 10% in the current quarter. Auto and construction sectors continue to see weak demand.
Internationally, copper and zinc prices have slipped about 7-8% each so far this year. Aluminium prices, though, are bucking the trend and have risen about 14% on the London Metal Exchange.
A slow-growing global economy is not helping. Despite ongoing talks between the US and China, the situation at the metals exchanges is one of caution. One positive is that central banks, globally, are loosening monetary policies, and this could contain downward pressure on metal prices."

45,2019-09-26,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel CFO Chatterjee said protection from litigations arising out of past liabilities will provide investors much needed comfort when acquiring these assets

Mumbai: Due diligence of stressed assets under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC) remains a big challenge, said Koushik Chatterjee, chief financial officer and executive director at Tata Steel, speaking at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) conference on mergers, acquisitions and restructuring held in Mumbai.
“In cases of IBC, due diligence is a challenge,"" said Chatterjee. “The issue in diligence of an IBC asset is that you will not get everything— all the information and all the access, and the resolution professional himself is struggling with managing that business,"" he said.
In May 2018, Tata Steel acquired Bhushan Steel for  ₹35,200 crore, besides  ₹1,200 crore it paid to creditors to convert the remaining debt owed to banks to equity. The acquired entity was renamed and renamed it Tata Steel BSL Ltd.
The transaction was done through corporate insolvency resolution process of the IBC. Later in June, it also completed the acquisition of Bhushan Steel’s subsidiary, Bhushan Energy for about  ₹800 crore, again, via the IBC process.
Chatterjee said protection from litigations arising out of past liabilities will provide investors much needed comfort when acquiring these assets.
“The other challenge is because these are stressed assets, it is but natural that they will not be compliant; either they wouldn’t have paid their taxes in many cases or they will have difficult lender relationships. So, one cannot assume the same mindset of a non-hostile M&A process in these kind of equations. In these circumstances, if a whitewash is not available then it would make the new investor fairly uncertain on how to deal with the asset,"" said Chatterjee.
This is specifically pertinent to JSW Steel Ltd.’s $2.7 billion acquisition of Bhushan Power & Steel Ltd. under the new bankruptcy process. In this case, Bhushan Power struggled with multiple accounting frauds including those totaling about  ₹5,600 crore reported by Allahabad Bank Ltd. and Punjab National Bank. But while approving JSW Steel’s resolution plan, the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) refused to grant immunity to the post-insolvency avatar of Bhushan Power from ongoing criminal investigations.
“As the resolution is happening, from the date of the approval of the resolution all the past liabilities should no more be applicable to the new company,"" said Chatterjee.
As of June 30, only 120 of the 2,162 cases under IBC were close to resolution. Similarly, of the  ₹2.53 trillion claims admitted under the IBC process, only 42.8% of claims worth  ₹1.08 trillion were recovered, according to a report by Bain & Co. released on Thursday."

A sale will help Tata Steel raise cash at a time the company is struggling with a fall in demand for the alloy as cooling economic growth dents consumption. The firm reported the lowest profit in more than two years for the three months ended June.
Discussions are at a preliminary stage and Tata Steel could decide against a sale, the people said. The manufacturer would need to get consent from SAIL should it decide to go ahead with a deal, the people said.
“As a part of our strategy, we continuously look at opportunities to rationalize our portfolio including divestment of assets and investments which are non-strategic and non-core,"" a representative for Tata Steel said in an email, without elaborating.

To a query from Mint, a spokesperson for Tata Steel said, “like all European steelmakers, Tata Steel Europe continues to experience challenging market conditions, made worse by the use of Europe as a dumping ground for the world’s excess capacity. We launched a transformation programme in Tata Steel Europe in June to strengthen our business. We are aiming to develop a simpler and leaner organisation, capable of sustainably financing high levels of investment which are essential to our long-term success.""
""This programme is gathering pace to urgently improve our performance. Proposals are being developed to improve our supply chain, our manufacturing performance and raw materials usage, as well as efficiency gains through digitalisation. We expect these to include a reduction in our employment costs which would be subject to the full consultation process with employee representatives,"" it said.
NH Niuews quoted a memo from Tata Steel Nederland to its employees. The agency reported that the cuts will be across Tata Steel’s Europe plants in the Netherlands, France, England and Belgium, citing Central Works Council’s vice-chairman Gerrit Idema.
The worker unions at the Netherlands plant are expected to protest, given that the plant is profitable.
Tata Steel is in a rush to stabilise operations in Europe after its proposed merger with the steel division of German manufacturing giant Thyssenkrupp was blocked by the European Commission this May. According to the agreements between the two sides signed in June 2018, Tata Steel Europe was to offload close to €2.2 billion of debt on its balance sheet to the combined entity. The JV would have created Europe’s second-largest steel maker after ArcelorMittal by merging the two companies’ operations in Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. However, with the JV failing, Tata Steel Europe needs to stabilise operations and yank down operating costs in a soft European steel market to make the business an attractive proposition to a new buyer."

Here is a list of top stocks that are buzzing in early trade on Tuesday:
Tata Motors: Shares extended Sunday’s gains during Diwali Muhurat trading, jumping nearly 14% in early deals due to the auto major’s strong September quarter performance. Improved operating performance and the impact of a better product mix on sales at its UK-arm Jaguar Land Rover Ltd, which has been a drag for last several quarters, also buoyed sentiment.

35,2019-10-29,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and others are wrestling with falling revenues amid high debt loadsExtent of the slowdown is prompting companies to revise capex plans and others to question the ability of companies to achieve debt reduction goals

Mumbai/New Delhi: India's biggest steelmakers may be suffering from buyer's remorse as assets they bought from bankrupt rivals stretch their bottom lines while market conditions have worsened.
Less than 18 months after scooping up these distressed assets in the hopes of extracting value and boosting market share, the steelmakers are struggling to meet sales and production targets because of a slowdown in the key construction and auto sectors.
Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and others are also wrestling with falling revenues amid high debt loads.
""The operating environment has changed from when they bid for these plants,"" said Amit Dixit, senior steel analyst with brokerage firm Edelweiss Financial Services. ""So their payback period obviously gets elongated now.""
Steel prices were high and demand was booming then. Now, confronted with falling prices and slower consumption, steelmakers are facing the risk of credit downgrades, job losses and cuts in capital expenditure.
Arnab Kumar Hazra, assistant secretary general at the Indian Steel Association, an industry group that also represents major steel producers, noted companies would take a longer time to turn their assets around in the current environment.
A deepening credit crunch in India's shadow banking industry following the collapse of a major infrastructure lender in 2018 has sharply dented spending on cars and real estate in India.
Domestic steel consumption in September was at its lowest since the start of the fiscal year 2019/20, according to official data.
A synchronised global economic slowdown amid the U.S.-China trade war has compounded the problem, quashing global steel consumption and intensifying competition among exporters.
JSW Steel Ltd, which bought Monnet Ispat & Energy Ltd in September last year, had promised to turn it around within a year but now says it will take another year.
The company will also miss its sales and production target for 2019/20 by 3% and has had to cut its capital expenditure by a third, said Seshagiri Rao, JSW's joint managing director and group chief financial officer.
""There is a credit squeeze, there is prolonged monsoon, a weaker government expenditure and fall in consumer demand,"" Rao said.
Tata Steel, which bought specialty steel firm Usha Martin Ltd in April, told Reuters the turnaround of the company would be delayed.
Tata Steel and JSW are not alone.
The world's biggest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and partner Nippon Steel and Sumitomo Metal Corp, which committed $6 billion to acquire a 10 million tonne steel plant in India, will face similar issues, analysts have said.
PRESSURE BUILDING
The problems afflicting the steel majors, which together control over half the country's total steel production, have already surfaced among mid-sized firms.
""Inventory is high, debtor days have extended, and most mid-level steel companies are now contemplating job cuts,"" said R.K. Goyal, managing director of Kalyani Steels Ltd which relies heavily on the automotive sector for steel orders.
The credit crunch and slowdown in autos and real estate pushed India's GDP growth to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter, in a troubling sign for the steel sector whose fortunes are closely tied to the broader economy.
The extent of the slowdown is prompting companies to revise capital expenditure plans and others to question the ability of companies to achieve debt reduction goals.
Despite Tata Steel's move to partially defer expenditure on expansions, IIFL analyst Anupam Gupta said its plans to cut debt by $1 billion this fiscal year look ambitious, given weakening profitability across India and Europe.
Brokerage firm Edelweiss expects both JSW Steel and Tata Steel to see increases this year in their debt to EBIDTA ratios - a metric that reflects the cash available to companies to pay debts.
And the downward pressure on steelmakers does not look set to reverse soon.
""We are just sitting idle and waiting for the tide to turn,"" Kalyani Steels' Goyal said.

Shares of Indian metal and mining companies—Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, Vedanta Ltd and Hindalco Industries Ltd—surged on Monday due to optimism over US-China trade deal. While JSW Steel was the top gainer among Nifty 50 constituents, climbing up nearly 6%, Tata Steel and Vedanta rose 4.5% and 3.5% respectively.
According to news reports, US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross on Sunday said he was “quite optimistic"" that challenges related to the first phase of the US-China trade talks will be resolved soon. Ross also said leaders of both the nations are still scheduled to meet later this month.
US president Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping are set to meet in November, Ross said, adding that the venue of the meeting was a “work in progress"". The clarification comes as the Chilean government last week cancelled the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, or APEC, summit amid political unrest in the country. The summit was scheduled for 16-17 November in Santiago.
The US is the world’s largest steel importer, importing more than 25 million tonne of the alloy. Though India is a minor exporter of steel to the US, a higher tariff is likely to have affected 50% of total imports to the US, triggering a global glut and slump in prices.
In the case of China, the largest producer and exporter of steel in the world, investors fear that the Asian nation would end up having excess capacity that would need a new market.
The US and China are the world’s largest economies and hence also the largest consumers. A protracted trade war between the two have already dented outlook for most commodities, including metals, and hence any likelihood of a breakthrough in talks is a welcome sign.
In July 2018, tensions between Washington and Beijing came to the fore when Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on China for its alleged unfair trade practices. The US so far has slapped tariffs on $550 billion worth of Chinese products. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $185 billion worth of US goods.
Both sides have also threatened qualitative measures that affect US businesses operating in China. Leaders of the two nations, in various attempts, have tried negotiating and reaching a common ground but have so far failed."

In the second quarter, the company spent  ₹2,325 crore and  ₹4,895 crore so far this fiscal.
However, it might consider scaling back capital expenditure if the market sentiment does not improve.

Here is a list of top 10 stocks that may be in focus on Thursday:
Yes Bank: Moody’s Investor Service on Wednesday placed the private lender’s foreign currency issuer rating of Ba3 under review downgrade following its weak performance in the September quarter, leading to concerns over the bank’s overall financial position and uncertainty around regulatory approvals for its plan to raise $1.2 billion in equity capital.
Tata Steel: The country’s largest steel maker reported a net profit of  ₹3,302 crore in the September quarter, up nearly 6% year-on-year led by a one-time gain and a favourable tax regime. The company had reported a consolidated net profit of  ₹3,116 crore in the same period last year. However, revenue from operations fell 15.45% to  ₹34,579 crore from  ₹40,807 crore a year ago.
Realty Stocks: The government on Wednesday cleared a plan to infuse  ₹10,000 crore in an alternative investment fund to revive stalled housing projects that could potentially benefit 4.58 lakh home buyers and revive the ailing sector.

SBI: India’s largest public-sector bank will infuse  ₹15,000 crore along with Life Insurance Corporation to complete held-up housing projects.

Infosys: The stock was among the top gainers among Nifty 50 companies on Wednesday after chairman Nandan Nilekani said the company will take necessary steps if probe into whistleblower complaints substantiated claims of corporate misgovernance by the management, adding that the firm has responded responsibly and complied with applicable laws and past practices.
BPCL: The state-owned fuel retailer will announce its earnings for the quarter ended September today. Shares have been on the rise with reports of the government planning to privatise the company.

Lupin: The pharmaceutical company posted a loss of  ₹1.3 billion in July-September compared with a profit of  ₹2.7 billion a year ago, as the company’s financials were hit by a provision for a settlement in a US court and the loss it incurred due to divestment of its Japanese subsidiary Kyowa CritiCare Co Ltd. The total one-time loss was  ₹5.5 billion in the said quarter.
Andhra Bank: The public-sector bank will report its earnings for July-September today. Separately, another state-run lender UCO Bank is also set to release its numbers for the second quarter of this fiscal. While Andhra Bank will be merged into Union Bank of India along with Corporation Bank as part of the government’s mega PSU bank merger plan, UCO Bank will remain independent.

Indian equities are seen higher on Thursday following the announcement of a slew of measures by the government to revive the realty sector. Among global peers, Asian shares paused near their multi-month peaks in early deals on Thursday, while bonds eked out a bounce as reports of a delay in sealing a preliminary Sino-US trade deal left investors frustrated.
MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a shade lower, just off a six-month high hit earlier in the week. Japan's Nikkei started in the red, having touched a 13-month top on Wednesday, while South Korean stocks were 0.3% down after hitting their highest since May.
Reuters reported on Wednesday that a meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping to sign an interim trade deal could be delayed until December as discussions continue over terms and venue. Among various suggestions was to one to sign the deal after a scheduled NATO meeting in early December.
Wall Street was underwhelmed by the news and the Dow ended all but flat on Wednesday. The S&P 500 was a tad higher, while Nasdaq dropped 0.3%.
Back home, the central government on Wednesday approved a plan to set up a  ₹25,000 crore alternative investment fund (AIF) to revive stalled housing projects, as it seeks to provide relief to distressed homebuyers and rekindle animal spirits of the ailing realty sector. While the government will invest  ₹10,000 crore in the fund, the remaining  ₹15,000 crore will come in from State Bank of India, Life Insurance Corporation of India, and other such institutions, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said.
Tata Steel, the country’s largest steelmaker, said fiscal second-quarter profit rose nearly 6% from a year earlier helped by one-time gains and a favourable tax regime. Net profit, including those of its units, rose to  ₹3,302 crore in the quarter ended 30 September from  ₹3,116 crore in the year-ago period. Consolidated revenue from operations fell 15.5% year-on-year to  ₹34,579 crore during the period.
Infosys Ltd chairman Nandan Nilekani on Wednesday said the company will take necessary steps if investigation into whistleblower complaints substantiates claims of corporate misgovernance, adding that the firm has responded responsibly and complied with applicable laws and past practices.

The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday declined to entertain a plea by Adani Properties, seeking to restrain South Africa’s Bidvest Group Ltd from selling its minority stake in Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) to a third party, and extending a payment deadline for buying the stake. In April, Bidvest agreed to sell its 13.5% stake in MIAL to Adani Properties for  ₹1,235 crore by 30 September.
Meanwhile, the pause in the risk rally helped bonds recoup a little of their recent losses. Yields on benchmark US 10-year notes fell back to 1.82% from a two-month top of 1.87%.
That in turn restrained the dollar, which eased to 108.94 yen from a weekly high of 109.24. The dollar was just a shade softer against a basket of currencies at 97.949. The euro struggled to bounce at $1.1068, perilously close to chart support of $0.1060. Spot gold was little changed at $1,490.23 per ounce and well within recent tight trading ranges.
Oil prices nursed losses after taking a hit from a surprisingly large build-up in US crude inventories. US crude was 2 cents lower at $56.33 a barrel.

Here is a list of top stocks that are buzzing in early trade on Thursday:
Indiabulls Housing: Shares surged more than 15% in early deals as the government cleared a proposal to infuse  ₹25,000 crore in an alternative investment fund to revive stalled housing projects that could potentially benefit 4.58 lakh homebuyers. This offset the company’s weak earnings in the September quarter, which saw a more than 32% decline in consolidated net profit to  ₹702.18 crore.
IndusInd Bank: Buoyed by gains in real estate companies, the stock of the private lender traded nearly 3% higher and was the top gainer among Nifty 50 firms. IndusInd Bank Ltd has a substantial exposure to the real estate sector, one of the worst hit sectors due to the economic slowdown. This has often put the shares of the bank under pressure. Yes Bank Ltd also has an exposure to the sector.
Tata Steel: The stock was the biggest laggard among Nifty companies, falling nearly 4%. The steel maker’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) margin slipped 56.6% to  ₹3,819.6 crore in the September quarter. A drop of 15.45% in revenue from operations to  ₹34,579 crore from  ₹40,807 crore a year ago also weighed on investor sentiment.
NBCC: The stock jumped over 11% on optimism around revival of stalled housing projects as the government approved creating an alternative investment fund. State Bank of India and Life Insurance Corporation will also contribute  ₹15,000 crore to the fund. Separately, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that only NBCC (India) Ltd and Suraksha Realty Ltd can bid for Jaypee Infratech.
Lupin: Shares slumped nearly 4% as the pharmaceutical company posted a loss of  ₹1.3 billion in July-September compared with a profit of  ₹2.7 billion a year ago. The financials were hit by a provision for a settlement in a US court and the loss it incurred due to divestment of its Japanese subsidiary Kyowa CritiCare Co Ltd.

25,2019-11-07,Tata Steel,"While tax write-backs aided net profit, operating performance reflects muted demand conditionsQuarter-on-quarter, revenues have dipped 3.8%. In fact, this is the second straight quarter of lower revenue for the company

It’s been a challenging quarter for Tata Steel Ltd. September quarter profit belied expectations, and a closer look at the numbers shows that economic conditions are bleaker than anticipated. While tax write-backs aided net profit, the operating performance reflects muted demand conditions.
Tata Steel’s second-quarter revenue fell 15.4% year-on-year. Weak steel demand, particularly from the automobile sector, hit revenues. Even quarter-on-quarter revenues dipped 3.8%. In fact, this is the second straight quarter of lower revenue for the company.
Besides, its Ebitda (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) fell a steep 56% from the year-ago quarter. Higher costs have been a burden on its operating parameters. While revenues dipped 15%, operating expenses were down only about 3.6%. As a result, the Ebitda margin slid from 21.7% in the year-earlier to 11.3% in the September quarter.
Given that the steel market recovery looks slow, Tata Steel has scaled back its capital expenditure plans. Initially, it had settled on  ₹12,000 crore capital expenditure, but has now reduced this to  ₹8,300 crore, reflecting the greater stress in the steel world.
Tata Steel’s net profit climbed 6% year-on-year, thanks to a sharp write-back in tax provisions of about  ₹4,233 crore. It wrote back a significant portion of deferred taxes, even as it made a significantly lower tax provision for the quarter. In FY19, the effective tax rate for its stand-alone operations was 35%. Analysts said gains from the recent cut in corporate tax could be substantial for the company.
A positive is that iron ore prices are now lower, while domestic steel prices are showing signs of stability. The government’s revival package for low-cost housing could improve conditions in the long-steel products market. Tata Steel, despite the challenging environment, has kept its domestic production at levels similar to those of the first quarter, at about 4.5 million tonnes. Another factor to watch out for is the China-US interim trade deal, the signing of which was deferred to December.
The nearly 31% fall in its stock price in the past one year may mean the negatives have been priced in, but a recovery in the shares will depend on a revival in domestic demand. Some of that will have to come from the auto sector, which remains in the grips of a slowdown. “We maintain our underperform rating as a) optimism around India margin expansion appears overdone; b) Tata Steel Europe margins should stay under pressure; c) net debt should stay elevated; d) we expect consensus Ebitda estimates to be downgraded,"" said analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a note to clients."

New Delhi: Steel stocks rebounded on Friday after the initial trades saw them falling sharply in the wake of the Supreme Court (SC) order that cleared the way for the world’s largest steel maker, ArcelorMittal, to acquire the insolvent Essar Steel. The SC set aside the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) order that had brought operational creditors on par with financial creditors in the matter.
The entry of the L.N. Mittal company, with access to global resources and technologies, is bound to create a flutter among the local companies.
Overall, BSE Metal index was trading 0.3% lower at 9,299.38 points while Nifty Metal was also down by about 0.4%. JSW Steel, company with the largest steel-making capacity domestically, slumped to  ₹242.40 before recovering to trade 0.7% down at  ₹244.10.
Jindal Steel and Power fell to  ₹139.95, only to retrace the losses and trade nearly 1% up at  ₹141. Tata Steel, India’s largest steel maker with both local and global operations, traded 0.3% higher at  ₹393 after falling to  ₹390.65.
The committee of creditors (CoC) had filed petitions against NCLAT’s judgment, challenging that they should recover more than operation creditors in the bankruptcy resolution process.
The SC decision overrules NCLAT’s July 5 judgment that operational creditors should be treated on a par with financial creditors for distribution of funds from ArcelorMittal’s bid in the Essar Steel insolvency case. As of July, total debt in the Essar Steel case had inflated to  ₹69,192 crore following fresh claims by some operational creditors, the court had said."

MUMBAI :
Top steel producers, including Tata Steel Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd and Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL), have cut capital expenditure plans, anticipating weak demand following a depressing second quarter, conserving cash for the long haul.
Tata Steel, India’s largest private steel maker, reported consolidated net profit of  ₹3,302 crore in the second quarter, thanks solely to a one-time favourable tax impact of  ₹4,233 crore. JSW Steel, the second largest, also benefited from a one-time deferred tax provision write-back of  ₹1,976 crore in the quarter.
Profit before tax, for its part, was  ₹688 crore for the quarter, falling 77.2% from a year earlier. Tata Steel, on the other hand, reported a pre-tax loss. JSPL posted a consolidated loss of  ₹399.31 crore for the quarter, against a consolidated net profit of  ₹279.17 crore a year ago.
Bhaskar Basu, an analyst at brokerage Jefferies, has maintained his underperform call on Tata Steel. “Any optimism around margin expansion in Indian operation appears overdone, while European margins will stay under pressure. We expect the net debt levels of Tata Steel to also stay elevated,"" he said.
Profitability plunged as steel prices fell. For Tata Steel India, Ebitda/tonne of steel fell to  ₹9,238 from  ₹16,368 in the year-ago quarter, while on a consolidated basis, it crashed from  ₹12,713 to  ₹6,156 crore. For JSPL, steel sales were down 7% from the preceding quarter, while operating profit per tonne fell by  ₹1,800 to  ₹9,437 per tonne. For JSW, the corresponding figure was  ₹7,768, down from  ₹12,118 per tonne from the last quarter.
Over the last four quarters, operating profit margin of the domestic steel industry have been slipping, narrowing steadily from 22.6% in Q1FY19 to 18.2% in Q1FY20, and production dropped steadily to match this. Sluggish domestic demand from end-user segments, including auto, consumer durable, capital goods, construction and realty sectors, has led to a slowdown in consumption growth.
A Crisil research report from September found that smaller steel mills have undertaken maintenance shut-downs ranging from one week to a few weeks through the second quarter. In a recent interview, R.K. Goyal, managing director of Kalyani Steel, which makes auto grade steel, said: “There are no buyers in the market today. It is not iron ore problems for us, but sales are not happening. We have cut production by 25-40% in the last 15 days.""
JSW has cut capex for 2019-20 from  ₹15,708 crore to  ₹11,000 crore while also trimming its sales forecast from 16.95 million tonnes (mt) for the year to 16mt. “We feel that we will be able to meet 97% of the guidance,"" said M.V.S. Seshagiri Rao, joint managing director and group chief financial officer (CFO), JSW Steel, said. “Even if we perform in the second half of this fiscal as well as we did last year, we will not be able to make up for the losses incurred in the first half.""
Tata Steel had set its FY20 capex at  ₹8,300 crore. In the second quarter, the firm spent  ₹2,325 crore and  ₹4,895 crore so far this fiscal. However, it might consider scaling back if sentiment does not improve. “We are focusing on unlocking value from our capital expenditure plans and not on increasing volumes,"" Koushik Chatterjee, executive director and CFO, Tata Steel, had said. This is the second time this fiscal that Tata Steel has cut its capex guidance, which had stood at  ₹11,000 crore at the start of the year."

20,2019-11-19,Tata Steel,"Britain last week said Chinese steelmaker Jingye has signed a provisional deal to buy British Steel, which went into compulsory liquidation in MayAround two-thirds of the job losses are expected to be office-based roles

AMSTERDAM/LONDON :
Tata Steel  plans to cut up to 3,000 jobs across its European operations, the company said on Monday, as the sector wrestles with excess supply, weak demand and high costs.
Earlier, a source close to the discussions told Reuters around 3,000 people would be affected after the group's European chief executive Henrik Adam said Tata was planning to announce job cuts across the European business without giving figures.
In a statement, Tata said it was urgently seeking to improve performance by increasing sales of higher value products, efficiency gains and reducing employment costs by cutting employee numbers by up to 3,000 across its European operations.
Around two-thirds of the job losses are expected to be office-based roles, it said.
Indian-owned Tata Steel, which launched a transformation programme in June to strengthen its European business, has operations including steelmaking in the Netherlands and Wales and downstream operations across Europe.
There will be no plant closures, Tata said, adding the aim was to shield Tata Steel Europe from challenges, such as weak demand, excess capacity and trade issues, and to become cash positive by the end of its financial year ending March 2021.
European steelmakers largely blame China for the extent of a surplus in the market, but the world's biggest steelmaker says it has made its own deep cuts to capacity.
Tata's quest to boost profitability follows a European anti-trust decision to block a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp .
Tata said in a statement challenging market conditions had been made ""worse by the use of Europe as a dumping ground for the world's excess capacity"".
In the first six months of its financial year starting April 2019, Tata Steel Europe reported a drop of 90% in EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation).
Britain last week said Chinese steelmaker Jingye has signed a provisional deal to buy British Steel, which went into compulsory liquidation in May.
The agreement is politically resonant ahead of British elections as job opportunities have become a major issue. If confirmed, the rescue could save thousands of jobs.
ArcelorMittal , the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe.
Eurofer, which represents the European steel industry, said in an email job losses were ""a worrying and upsetting trend"" caused by global overcapacity and hesitant demand.
It urged EU policy makers ""to help stabilise the EU market by warding off import surges and supporting vital steel sector workers during this challenging period"".

SINGAPORE :
Tata Steel Ltd. plans to axe about 3,000 jobs across its European operations to cut costs in the latest blow to the region’s industry.
About two-thirds of the estimated reduction in staff would be office-based, or white-collar, positions, according to a statement. The company didn’t give a detailed breakdown of where the job losses would take place
“Stagnant EU steel demand and global overcapacity have been compounded by trade conflicts, which have turned the European market into a dumping ground for the world’s excess steel capacity,"" Tata Steel said.
The European steel industry has faced growing headwinds this year amid declining demand, slowing growth and the consistent threat from supplies from overseas, including exports from Turkey, Russia and China. British Steel Ltd., the U.K.’s No. 2 steelmaker was put into liquidation in May, and has been taken over China’s Jingye Group Co. Apparent steel demand in the European Union will contract 3.1% this year, lobby group Eurofer warned last month.
The steelmaker’s European operations are facing “unprecedented severe market conditions,"" Henrik Adam, chief executive officer of Tata Steel in Europe, said in the statement. Other steps to pare costs included boosting sales of higher-value steels, increasing efficiency and cutting procurement costs.

Bharti Airtel: The telecom operator said it will raise call charges starting December. This comes after the Supreme Court ordered telecom companies to pay massive dues and penalties to the government in the adjusted gross revenue case. The sector, which has seen more than a decade of only price cuts due to hyper competition, has been dealing with mounting debt amid shrinking revenue.

Vodafone Idea: The company will also raise call charges starting next month. Price cuts due to hyper competition, stretched balance sheets, eroding profitability and the spectre of going bust have forced the company to reverse the trend and effect a price hike. It did not specify the quantum of price hike. Last month, the Supreme Court judgement had penalised telecom operators for what the department of telecommunications maintained as under-reporting of revenues.
Yes Bank: The private lender said it has acquired 20.61% stake in Tulip Star Hotels over invocation of pledge of shares. The bank has been in news due to its plans to raise capital, for which it announced last month that it has received offers worth $3 billion from potential investors for fund raising. Separately, ace investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala buying shares of the bank have also buoyed investor sentiment.
Zee Entertainment: Brickwork Ratings has downgraded the non-convertible preference share issuer to BWR AA+ from BWR AAA, with a credit watch negative implication due to deteriorating financial position of the group following increase in pledge of promoter holding. Shares of the media conglomerate have been under pressure due to concerns around the company’s ability to meet its financial obligations to lenders.
PNB: The state-owned bank said it has received board approval for the merger of Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India into Punjab National Bank. This merger is part of the government’s mega plan to consolidate weak and small PSU banks with healthy and bigger ones. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had made the announcement in August, with which India will have only 12 state-run banks.
SpiceJet: The low-cost carrier is in talks with Boeing Co to buy more 737 Max aircraft to feed its expansion plans, a deal that could mark a Dubai Airshow coup for the grounded narrow-body, according to a Bloomberg report. Chairman Ajay Singh said the carrier is looking at setting up a new hub in the Middle East and expand to eastern Europe. A global sales lull for the Max since March has allowed SpiceJet Ltd to acquire planes at a lower cost, Singh added.
OMCs: India’s oil imports from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) fell to 73% in October, its lowest monthly share since 2011, a Reuters report said, quoting tanker data from sources. Refiners in India imported fuel from the US and other suppliers. India usually imports about 80% of its fuel from OPEC members.
Wockhardt: The pharmaceutical company said it is looking at various options for sustainable growth of the company. Separately, Cipla Ltd clarified on the news of the company acquiring select business segment of Wockhardt Ltd, saying that it is exploring opportunities for growth and has nothing concrete at present."

MUMBAI :
Indian stock markets ended higher on Tuesday led by gains in index heavyweights Reliance Industries (RIL), Infosys and HDFC Bank.
The Sensex ended 185.51 points or 0.46% higher to close at 40,469.70, while the Nifty rose 0.47% to close at 11,940.10.

The hike in tariff from the two operators comes after a prolonged period of hyper-competition in India, where telecom tariffs are the cheapest in the world. The companies did not say by how much they plan to raise tariffs. The move follows an adverse Supreme Court judgement that dealt a  ₹92,000 crore blow to legacy telecom operators, including Airtel and Vodafone Idea, which have been struggling with mounting debt, declining revenue and record losses.
Reliance Industries shares hit a new all-time high of  ₹1514.95 to cross  ₹9.5 trillion market cap, a first by an Indian company. The stock closed 3.52% higher at  ₹1,509.80.

16,2019-11-19,Tata Steel,"The market has also already factored in the latest announcement of job cutsWhat is more important for investors is the road ahead on paring debt

Investors haven’t really warmed up to Tata Steel Ltd’s plan to rejig its European operations. The restructuring has been in the works for a while now. Besides, the market has also already factored in the latest announcement of job cuts. Shares of Tata Steel were down about 0.4% on Tuesday.
What is more important for investors is the road ahead on paring debt. The management has said it will reduce capital expenditure and unlock some of its working capital, and also sell part of its non-core assets. However, the company has been facing challenges here.
“While management has guided for USD1b net debt reduction every year, it acknowledged the difficulty in achieving the same this year as market conditions has not been favourable. It aims to curtail capital expenditures in 2HFY20 and expects the working capital release to support cash generation,"" said Motilal Oswal Financial Services in a recent report to clients.
The recent stake sale of its step-down subsidiary NatSteel Vina Co Ltd is a welcome move. This shows the company’s commitment to improving operations, which includes unlocking value from subsidiaries. Tata Steel has also announced the sale of four of its non-core assets in the European region. An early closure to such announcements can bode well for the market.
However, investors are even keener to see a revival in the domestic and international steel sector. To be sure, there has been an uptick in steel prices in November. Domestic prices are upwards of  ₹35,000 per tonne, while still below the anti-dumping parity levels, which is a welcome sign.
A global revival is much needed, though. The trade war between the US and China is not helping, though there are indications that global steel prices may be bottoming out. Prices of hot rolled coils (HRC) internationally have been inching up as well. HRC prices in China have inched up about 2.8% to CNY 3610 per metric tonne, Bloomberg data shows.
The Tata Steel stock has risen about 15% in the past month as steel prices have seemingly bottomed out. However, prices in the international market have to sustain higher for more benefits to roll down to investors."
15,2019-11-20,Tata Steel,"Tata announced the cuts late on Monday as part of wider efforts to boost profitability in EuropeTata says around half of the losses would be in the Netherlands and around two-thirds would be office-based roles

Steelworkers in Britain and the Netherlands said on Tuesday they would fight Tata Steel's  plans to cut up to 3,000 jobs across its European operations, as the sector wrestles with excess supply, weak demand and high costs.
Indian-owned Tata announced the cuts late on Monday as part of wider efforts to boost profitability in Europe, saying around half of the losses would be in the Netherlands and around two-thirds would be office-based roles.
Tata's announcement confirmed a number previously reported by Reuters.
In addition to its Dutch plant, Tata has a plant in Wales and downstream operations, including finished products, across Europe.
The group's quest to boost European profitability follows a decision by competition regulators in June to block a joint venture with Germany's Thyssenkrupp .
Unions in Britain and the Netherlands said that following the collapse of that deal, they had been given a jobs guarantee until 2021 and they would defend that.
President of Tata Steel's European works council Frits van Wieringen said it would take time to work out detail, but warned of ""a very serious confrontation in the Netherlands"".
""There is no justification whatsoever to cut over 1,500 jobs here, and it will be impossible to find any kind of compromise over that,"" he said.
Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of the British steelworkers’ union Community, said British workers would also be ""robustly defending"" the 2021 jobs agreement.
Tata on Monday said it was urgently seeking to increase sales of higher value products and improve efficiency, as well as reducing employment costs.
It has ruled out plant closures and said the aim was to shield Tata Steel Europe from challenges, such as weak demand, excess capacity and trade issues, and to become cash positive by the end of its financial year ending March 2021.
In the first six months of its financial year starting April 2019, Tata Steel Europe reported a 90% plunge in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
European steelmakers largely blame China for the extent of a surplus in the market, while China, the world's biggest steel-producing country, says it has made its own deep cuts to capacity.
ArcelorMittal , the world's biggest steelmaker, has idled a series of plants across Europe. It is also in conflict with the Italian government over its attempt to walk away from a 2018 deal to buy Ilva, Europe's largest steel plant.
Britain's biggest steel factory, British Steel, went into compulsory liquidation in May and is subject to a provisional agreement to be sold to Chinese steelmaker Jingye.
The deal will require regulatory and foreign investment clearance from European jurisdictions, including the European Union.
Ahead of British elections in December, the Jingye acquisition is politically resonant as job opportunities have become a major issue. If confirmed, the rescue could save thousands of jobs.

Positive statements made by officials (from both the countries) last week indicating that a trade pact is likely by the end of December 2019 are being welcomed,"" Sandeep Nayak, executive director and chief executive officer of Centrum Broking, said.
He added that foreign institutional investors are preferring emerging markets such as India as the recent easy monetary stance of US Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank has improved liquidity in world markets.

RBL Bank looks to raise up to  ₹2,000 crore via QIP route
Private lender RBL Bank Ltd is looking to raise up to  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, Mint reported citing three people aware of the development. The bank has appointed ICICI Securities, IIFL Securities and IDFC Securities as advisers to the transaction. The roadshows have already happened in the US, Europe and Asia markets and the timing of the QIP launch will be decided soon. The development follows RBL Bank announcement to shareholders at its annual general meeting on 9 July that it would raise equity capital not exceeding  ₹3,500 crore. The bank had a capital adequacy ratio of 12.3% as of 30 September, falling from 13.7% in the last fiscal. On 22 November, CNBC TV18 reported that RBL Bank was in talks with a strategic investor, Bajaj Holdings & Investment and two private equity firms- ChrysCapital and Blackstone, for the proposed share sale, which could help it raise about  ₹2,000 crore to shore up its capital base. In 2017, the bank had raised  ₹1,680 crore of equity capital by selling 32.6 million shares for  ₹515 apiece on a preferential basis to its existing investors, UK’s development finance institution CDC Group Plc, HDFC Standard Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, Steadview Capital Mauritius and Multiples Private Equity, among others.
Indigo Paints eyes listing, seeks to raise  ₹900 crore by next October
Indigo Paints Pvt. Ltd. has hired bankers to raise  ₹900 crore through an initial public offering (IPO) by next year, Mint reported citing two people aware of the development. The Pune-based firm has appointed ICICI Securities, Edelweiss Securities and Kotak Securities as advisers for the IPO, said one of the people cited above. “The company may be valued at over  ₹6,000 crore and is likely to file the draft prospectus with Sebi (Securities and Exchange Board of India) in the next 4-5 months. There will also be a component of fresh issue, which could be about  ₹300 crore. We are looking to do this IPO, sometime in the next year around October. The proceeds from the fresh issue would largely be used towards capacity expansion and brand building. While the company is controlled by Hemant Jalan, founder and managing director of the firm and his family, private equity firm Sequoia Capital owns about a 38% in the company. Sequoia Capital will sell a portion of its stake via the offer for sale route during the IPO.
ShareChat to monetize platform this quarter as funding downturn looms
Twitter-backed regional language social network ShareChat is engaging with advertisers to monetize its platform this quarter after its losses ballooned 12 times last fiscal, Mint reported citing three people aware of the matter. ShareChat, run by Mohalla Tech Pvt. Ltd, plans to open up advertising space on its platform as soon as next month, and is meeting food and beverage makers, cement and steel makers, among others, towards this end. Given that ShareChat’s user base is driven by tie- 2 and tier-3 consumers, it will look for advertisers—goods and services reliant on these areas. Despite its early user growth and heavy investor interest, ShareChat is under pressure to monetize its platform following the entry of Chinese rivals Helo and TikTok late last year. Both platforms, owned by China’s ByteDance—the world’s most valuable technology startup at $75 billion—have been aggressively marketing products here by spending millions of dollars a month to win users. So far, despite not making money, ShareChat has raised a significant amount of equity funding, though its last round took longer than expected to close. It raised $100 million in August led by Twitter, with participation from TrustBridge Partners, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and SAIF Partners, among others. Long term plans for ShareChat also include monetizing via social commerce by using its platform as a marketplace to sell goods.
Paytm raises $1 billion from SoftBank, Ant, others
One97 Communications Ltd, which operates Paytm, has raised $1 billion from new and existing investors, including Japan’s SoftBank Group and China’s Ant Financial, Mint reported citing a person familiar with the development. The funds will allow the digital payments firm to beef up its finances to make a deeper foray into India’s hinterland amid intensifying competition from Google Pay and Walmart Inc.-owned PhonePe Pvt. Ltd. The fundraising has lifted Paytm’s valuation to $16 billion, from the $15 billion it was valued at in August when some of its employees cashed out their shares in a secondary sale to unnamed New York-based investors. Paytm said on Sunday that it raised a fresh round of equity from existing shareholders such as Ant Financial, an affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, and SoftBank Vision Fund. They were joined by new investors, including T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. Discovery Capital, an existing shareholder of Paytm, also took part in the round. The company, however, did not disclose the quantum of funds raised. The fresh investments will be used for growing the payments and financial services business, said Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma. Paytm plans to invest  ₹10,000 crore over the next three years to bring financial inclusion to more under-served users across India.
Oyo, Apax join race for significant stake in CCD
SoftBank-backed hospitality chain Oyo and British private equity firm Apax Partners have joined the race to buy a significant stake in Café Coffee Day (CCD), The Economic Times reported citing two people close to the development. Both Oyo and Apax have signed nondisclosure agreements (NDAs) with Coffee Day Enterprises (CDEL) and have initiated discussions to buy the group’s coffee business. KKR, TPG Capital and Bain Capital have also signed similar agreements with CDEL and are in the race to buy CCD, ET had reported on November 15. There have been five bids and all are being evaluated and the company’s board had started negotiations with at least two of the interested parties. There is a lot to consider for the CDEL as all these potential investors have different plans for CCD. Some of those submitting bids were only interested in buying the CCD brand, while others were also interested in some of the other functions of the existing operations. Oyo is the only strategic investor — in a similar line of business — to have submitted a bid.
Tata Steel to raise $1.75 billion via European Unit
Tata Steel is raising up to $1.75 billion ( ₹12,563 crore) in syndicated offshore loans through its European unit to lower borrowing costs in the first mega fundraising at India’s biggest and the oldest maker of the alloy, which shelved a joint-venture proposal in the continent with Germany's Thyssenkrupp earlier this year, The Economic Times reported. Through this syndication, the company aims to reduce overall borrowing costs by 100 basis points. The debt will likely have five-year maturities and the loans will be priced after adding a mark-up, or spread, above the US dollar-based London Interbank Offered Rate (Libor). The spread may be in the range of 200-250 basis points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. Net debt at Tata Steel increased by almost 4% to  ₹1.07 lakh crore in the three months to September. The company is in the process of appointing up to a dozen investment bankers. The proceeds would be used for refinancing and other business purposes.

ECL Finance, the nonbanking finance arm of the Edelweiss Group, has raised  ₹515 crore by issuing retail bonds, the proceeds of which will be used to expand credit to mid- and small-sized companies, The Economic Times reported. This is one of the few successful public issues for NBFCs in recent times, with fund flows to the sector reducing in the aftermath of the IL&FS defaults. The public issuance, which was launched three weeks ago, closed Friday. “We are diversifying our liabilities profile,"" said Deepak Mittal, managing director and CEO at ECL Finance. “We aim to raise money equally from banks and retail investors, taking the share of bonds to 50% of our borrowing book."" Edelweiss is likely to do a similar bond sale next year, around May-June."
11,2019-11-26,Tata Steel,"The CCI said it analysed the emails, call records, executive testimonies of the firms and concluded that the bearings units contravened antitrust law by discussing, agreeing pricesThe investigation panel said it found no evidence against the fifth firm, ABC Bearings, part of US firm Timken Co

NEW DELHI :
An Indian antitrust probe has found that units of Tata Steel Ltd, Sweden's AB SKF and Germany's Schaeffler AG colluded on the pricing of bearings, according to an investigation report seen by Reuters.
The Competition Commission of India (CCI) began an investigation in 2017 after receiving allegations of five companies colluding on bearings prices from 2009-2014 to pass higher raw material costs onto customers in the auto sector.
Bearings reduce friction in moving parts, helping smooth the operation of vehicles. India's bearings market is dominated by SKF and Schaeffler and is worth $1.3 billion, showed data from ICRA Research.
CCI's investigations arm, in a report dated May 6 which has not been made public, said it analysed company emails, call records and executive testimonies and concluded that SKF India Ltd, Schaeffler India Ltd, National Engineering Industries and Tata Steel's bearings division contravened antitrust law by discussing and agreeing prices.
SKF, the world's largest maker of ball-bearings, in a statement said it aided the investigation, and that ""we dispute any claim of wrongdoing on the part of SKF"".
Schaeffler did not respond to a request for comment. Tata Steel and National Engineering Industries - part of Indian conglomerate CK Birla Group - declined to comment beyond saying the CCI proceedings were confidential.
The investigations arm said it found no evidence against the fifth firm, ABC Bearings, part of US firm Timken Co, the report showed. ABC Bearings declined to comment.
The report also showed the investigations arm considered the collusion lasted through the financial year to March 2011 but found no evidence to indicate when it actually ended.
The four firms, ""through personal meetings of key persons, on two occasions shared the strategic information regarding their future efforts to seek price increase from"" auto sector companies, the investigations arm said in its 106-page report.
The CCI did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. A person with direct knowledge of the matter said senior CCI officials are reviewing the report and that the antitrust body is able to dispute the findings of its investigation arm.
The CCI can fine firms up to three times the profit made in each year of wrongdoing or 10% of revenue, whichever is higher.
In 2014, European Union antitrust regulators fined SKF, Schaeffler and three Japanese auto parts makers $1.3 billion for taking part in a bearings cartel from 2004 through 2011.
""Incentive to collude""
The investigation report showed the four companies controlled nearly 75% of the domestic bearings market in the period 2009-11 - a time when prices of steel, the key raw material in bearings, were fluctuating sharply.
The steep steel price volatility, the CCI's investigation arm said, provided the companies an ""incentive to collude"".
There was consensus among the firms ""to seek price increase of 12% and settle at 6%"" with tractor and automotive manufacturers. With motorbike makers, there was a consensus to seek a 10% price increase and settle at 4%, the report showed.
The investigation arm also said Schaeffler and National Engineering Industries told the CCI that employees had participated in discussions with competitors ""mainly to seek coordinated price increase of bearings"". It did not elaborate on when the companies disclosed discussions to the CCI.
During the probe, ABC Bearings, SKF and Tata Steel's bearings division told the CCI they had no evidence of such discussions, the report showed.
""The conduct of the parties has resulted in appreciable adverse effect on competition,"" the CCI investigation arm said in the report. ""The sharing of price information is particularly sensitive from the competition law perspective."""
10,2019-11-27,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel shares have lost nearly half of their value since January 2018 to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 4.7Tata Steel has been closing and selling plants in the UK since the 2008 financial crisis

MUMBAI :
A revamp of its European operations, an improved product mix and a ban on cheaper steel imports to India may bolster the fortunes of Tata Steel Ltd.’s shares, the least valued stock on the South Asian nation’s benchmark equities gauge.
Tata Steel shares have lost nearly half of their value since Jan. 2018 to trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 4.7, the lowest on the S&P BSE Sensex Index. The company, which last year got more than 50% of its sales abroad, last week outlined job cuts and other measures aimed at cutting costs in Europe, which it called a “dumping ground"" for steel.
“Indian steel prices may have found a floor, thanks to the minimum import price, and have already started moving up,"" said Siddharth Gadekar, an analyst at Equirus Securities Pvt., “That kind of stability in prices gives investors confidence.""
Tata Steel has been closing and selling plants in the U.K since the 2008 financial crisis to make its business there more profitable. It’s now focusing on India, and aims to ramp up capacity as demand is set to expand by as much as 7% in 2020, according to the World Steel Association. That’s the most among the top 10 steel using countries.
While protection from cheaper shipments from abroad will also benefit Tata Steel’s domestic peers, its valuation advantage, product mix and debt reduction steps may increase its appeal to investors. India imposed a minimum import price for steel products in 2016.
“Tata’s volume of sales should beat the rest of the industry because of their value for money offering, and their entrance into the pipeline steel category,"" said Richard Leung, an analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence, “The rest of the industry may see muted growth next year because of reliance on legacy demand like automobiles.""
To be sure, Tata Steel’s debt-to-equity ratio is higher than most local peers, largely due to its 2007 purchase of Corus Group Plc for about $13 billion and its acquisition of Bhushan Steel for about $5.3 billion last year. Still, Moody’s Investors Service said in a Nov. 25 note that the company’s European cost cuts will support a turnaround in less profitable operations that have hurt the company’s overall credit quality.
“In a down cycle the companies that have higher debt tend to trade at a discount,"" said Equirus Securities’ Gadekar, “With their earnings profile and current steel prices, they can service their debt easily.""

9,2019-11-28,Tata Steel,"Tata Steel said it aims to build a financially strong and sustainable European businessThe job cuts had been announced by the Indian steel major last week as part of a wider transformation programme

LONDON :
Tata Steel Europe said it had begun consultations with the European Works Council (EWC) on Wednesday on restructuring plans for its business, which would include up to 3,000 job losses – 1,000 of which will be in the UK.
The job cuts had been announced by the Indian steel major last week as part of a wider transformation programme as it blamed ongoing losses and continued global headwinds faced by the steel industry.
“As part of the comprehensive set of proposals, Tata Steel Europe intends to lower employment costs,"" the company statement said.
“This is expected to lead to an estimated reduction in employee numbers of up to 3,000, about two-thirds of which would be management and office-based roles. Up to 1,600 are expected in the Netherlands, 1,000 in the UK and 350 elsewhere in the world,"" it said.
Tata Steel said it aims to build a financially strong and sustainable European business, able to make the investments required to accelerate innovation and the company's journey towards carbon-neutral steelmaking.
Tata Steel in Europe CEO, Henrik Adam, said: “I'm very proud to see the dedication of everyone in this business, determined to succeed even in the face of a very tough market. I also understand and appreciate colleagues’ concerns about these proposals.
“Change creates uncertainty, but we cannot afford to stand still as a company – the world around us is changing fast and we have to adapt. Our strategy is to build a strong and stable European business, capable of making significant investments needed for a successful future.""
During the meeting this week, which marked the official start of the employee consultation process with the EWC workers' unions, Tata Steel Europe said it had shared initial proposals about its transformation programme, focused across three other key areas besides lowering employment costs to improve the company's financial performance.
Increasing sales of higher-value steels by improving product mix and customer focus; efficiency gains by optimising production processes, supported by the application of big data and advanced analytics; and reduction of procurement costs through smarter sourcing and strengthening cooperation with companies within the Tata Steel group are among the other key focus areas of the company’s plans.
Tata Steel said it agreed with the EWC on a forward process and will meet again in the coming weeks to discuss further details, with employees and other stakeholders kept updated during the process."

3,2019-12-17,Tata Steel,"The ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel joint venture’s decision under Aditya Mittal’s leadership to ramp up Essar Steel’s capacity may turn out to be well timed if demand rebounds

As far as big decisions go, Aditya Mittal appears to have got off to a blistering start as chairperson of the new ArcelorMittal-Nippon Steel joint venture (JV) in India. The ink on the JV’s official acquisition of Essar Steel had barely dried when it announced a ramp-up of the domestic steelmaker’s capacity by 50%. Though the acquirer has had years to mull over its plans for the Indian market, given the long-winded and litigation-wracked process of bankruptcy resolution that followed its initial bid for the ailing Essar Group company, its push for such a major expansion so quickly still caught many by surprise. This is because of the gloom that seems to have settled over the industry in recent times. Steel consumption, after all, bears a strong correlation with a country’s economic performance, and India’s growth has been on a downtrend. Yet, a closer look shows that ArcelorMittal may not be off the mark in betting on rising sales. It could take a couple of years to expand operations and that is enough time for market demand to perk up.
While domestic steel prices have slid by around 10% since the start of this year amid slowing demand growth, which is estimated to fall to 4-5% this fiscal from the 7.5-8% growth recorded in the previous two years, according to Crisil, most observers expect the sector to at least attain stability next year. Further, if the government goes in for a big infrastructure boost as part of a larger package aimed at spurring economic growth, steel demand could easily rebound over the medium term, as construction uses up mega-tonnes of the metal. ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Ltd is currently operating well below its installed capacity, but it would expect to roar into the reckoning now that it is part of a global group that has proved how competitive it can be under diverse circumstances. If its furnaces are fired up to peak levels and the planned additions made, it could churn out 15 million tonnes a year. This would make it one of the country’s top steel producers.
India’s total steel capacity is around 140 million tonnes, with no more than 6-7 million tonnes expected to be added over the next two years. This should ensure that capacity utilization rates go up over the next few years from current average levels of around 80%. Tata Steel and JSW Steel have pushed their expansion plans farther down the road, which should again offer the new player comfort. For now, ArcelorMittal has short-term challenges to see off. While its acquisition has iron ore pellet facilities in Odisha as well as a slurry pipeline from there to feed its steel plant in Gujarat’s Hazira, it would probably need to supplement its ore supplies. Mine leases are an option, but given the uncertainty over lease renewals and environment approvals in Odisha, these won’t be easy. Local iron ore prices are expected to firm up. Imports could fill in, but while global prices are off their multi-year highs touched last year, they’re not low. In contrast, rivals such as Tata Steel and the state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd have the advantage of captive mines. As iron ore typically makes up around a third of production costs, it could take a while for the JV to achieve a price edge. How it goes about it would test its mettle."
2,2019-12-19,Tata Steel,"NCLAT also ordered that Cyrus Mistry be restored as executive chairman of Tata SonsIn a surprise move on 24 October 2016, Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons

Shares of Tata group companies traded mixed on Thursday following an appeals court holding illegal the appointment of N Chandrasekaran as chairman Tata Sons. The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) on Wednesday also ordered that Cyrus Mistry be restored as executive chairman of Tata Sons in lieu of Chandrasekaran although the implementation of this has been suspended for four weeks.
The company has the option to challenge the ruling in the Supreme Court.
While shares of Tata Motors and Tata Consultancy Services rose 1% each today, Tata Metaliks was up 0.7%, Nelco Ltd advanced 0.4%, Voltas, Tata Chemicals and Tata Investment Corp were 0.08-0.2% higher. On the other hand, Tata Steel Ltd fell 0.9%, Rallies India 0.6%, Titan Co Ltd was down 0.5%, Tata Power Co 0.5%, Tata Global Beverages ltd 0.3%, Trent Ltd 0.2%, Tata Elxsi 0.3%, Tata Coffee Ltd 0.3%.
According to a Mint report, with the appellate tribunal ruling in favour of ousted Mistry, the odds have changed dramatically for the diversified conglomerate. This is likely to show in weakened investor confidence and potentially higher cost of capital until there is clarity on the final outcome of the ongoing legal tussle.
The order casts uncertainty over Chandrasekaran’s plans to simplify the group’s structure, revive growth, cut costs and invest in future growth areas.
In a surprise move on 24 October 2016, Mistry was removed as chairman of Tata Sons and later also ousted as a director from the holding company's board."
1,2019-12-19,Tata Steel,"Any decision by majority investors will now have to be taken in the interest of all stakeholders, say analysts

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI :
An appeals court order reinstating Cyrus Mistry as Tata Sons Ltd chairman may have caused uncertainty about the management of the holding company of Tata group, but market experts say the net impact is likely to be positive for group companies.
Shares of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd, Tata Steel Ltd, Tata Motors Ltd and Tata Global Beverages Ltd—the key units of Tata Sons—gained on Thursday on BSE. TCS rose 2.83% to close at  ₹2,229.05, Tata Steel gained 0.45% to close at  ₹446.75, Tata Motors advanced 2.49% to  ₹179.15, Tata Global gained 0.51% to ₹313.95 while Indian Hotels lost 2.20% to  ₹142 per share.
The market sees the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal’s (NCLAT) order as positive for Tata firms as it amounts to saying that Tata Sons will be a deemed public company. This means there will be greater accountability ensuring that any decision by the majority shareholders will have to be taken in the interest of all stakeholders, including minority shareholders such as the Shapoorji Pallonji group, said lawyers and analysts.
“Once a company is public, all shareholders get more freedom in terms of exercising their rights by virtue of their stakes in the firm. There are better disclosures to all classes of shareholders and the company’s promoters are unlikely to take decisions detrimental to minority shareholders in a public company,"" said a fund manager at a large asset management firm, who declined to be named.
With Tata Sons being the holding company, the order is bound to have a ripple effect on governance of all group companies. The order on Mistry’s chairmanship will however take effect only in four weeks, which is the time granted if the Tata group wants to appeal the decision.
An executive in a Tata group company, who did not want to be named, said Tata Sons is likely to soon move the Supreme Court to get a stay on the judgement to make sure the order does not take effect.
The NCLAT also ruled Mistry can take over as director on three Tata group firms forthwith. These are TCS, Tata Industries and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.
However, Siddharth Mahajan, partner at Athena Legal, said as directors owe a “fiduciary duty"" towards the company and shareholders, they cannot do anything against their interests and “hence any significant disruption in day-to-day functions is unlikely.""
Also, as per Securities and Exchange Board of India’s listing norms, any change in the board of any listed firm due to any event can be effected only after informing the stock exchanges. So far, no Tata company has informed the exchanges about reinstating Mistry on their boards.
Mahajan, however, said the order “no doubt creates uncertainty for Tata group as many key decisions would have to be kept on hold unless there is clarity on position of chairman""."
