16,2018-01-12,Shree Cement,"Shree Cement  is expected to complete the acquisition of Union Cement  in nine months, subject to approval from UAE regulatory bodies

Kolkata: Shree Cement Ltd on Thursday said it had agreed to acquire a 92.83% stake in Union Cement Co. PSC, a United Arab Emirates-based firm, for an enterprise value of $305.24 million (Rs1,945 crore). 
Kolkata: Shree Cement Ltd on Thursday said it had agreed to acquire a 92.83% stake in Union Cement Co. PSC, a United Arab Emirates-based firm, for an enterprise value of $305.24 million (Rs1,945 crore).
Shree Cement has the option to take full control of the company’s shares, chief financial officer Subhash Jajoo said.
Union Cement, founded in 1972, has an annual production capacity of four million tonnes and operations in the Emirate of Ras Al-Khaimah. 
As its plant is located close to the Saqr port, the company exports to other countries in the Gulf region and East Africa, Shree Cement said in a regulatory filing. 
Half of the unit’s output is consumed locally and the other half exported.
This will be Shree Cement’s first venture outside India and its biggest acquisition ever. Locally, the company produces 29.3 million tonnes of cement a year. 
The transaction is expected to be concluded in nine months, subject to approval from UAE regulatory bodies. Jajoo said Union Cement, which produces 3.3 million tonnes of clinker—the key ingredient for cement—was available at a “competitive price"" of $75 per tonne of cement output. “Our competitors have acquired assets at higher prices of $110-120 per tonne,"" he added.
Shree Cement has a cash reserve of around Rs4,000 crore, according to Jajoo. 
But the company hasn’t decided if it will pay for the acquisition entirely from its own coffers, he added.
For the next fiscal year, Shree Cement has budgeted for capital expenditure of Rs2,500 crore, over and above the UAE acquisition, said Jajoo. Most of the amount will be ploughed into existing units in India. 
The company is looking to scale up its production capacity in India to 40 million tonnes within two years, he added.
Union Cement has a consistent track record, Shree Cement said in a statement. In 2016, it reported $153.4 million in revenue and an operating profit of $33.7 million, which translates into a high operating margin of 21.9%. 
In the nine months till the end of September, the company’s operating profit was at $25.97 million on revenue of $120.27 million.
Shree Cement’s shares rose 0.19% to Rs19,511 on BSE in a flat market. The announcement of the acquisition was made after stock markets had closed. On Thursday, Shree Cement reported a 41.5% increase in December quarter net profit from a year earlier thanks to an expansion in margins. Net profit for the quarter was Rs333.33 crore, compared with Rs235.43 crore a year earlier. Revenue was Rs2,383.53 crore, up 7% from a year earlier.

14,2018-01-15,Shree Cement,"Shree Cement has announced the acquisition a 92.83% stake in UAE-based Union Cement in a move aimed at boosting its cement capacity from 29.3 mtpa to 33.3 mtpa

The Shree Cement Ltd stock took a beating on Friday, correcting more than 3%. In the December quarter, the firm’s cement volumes grew moderately; realizations were weak and its power and fuel costs continued to surge. But these issues are not new and were already baked into Street expectations. So, what has weighed on the stock? It’s the cement maker’s first foreign acquisition. 
The Shree Cement Ltd stock took a beating on Friday, correcting more than 3%. In the December quarter, the firm’s cement volumes grew moderately; realizations were weak and its power and fuel costs continued to surge. But these issues are not new and were already baked into Street expectations. So, what has weighed on the stock? It’s the cement maker’s first foreign acquisition.
Shree Cement has announced the acquisition of a 92.83% stake in Union Cement Co. (UCC), a United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based firm. The move is aimed at boosting the former’s cement capacity from 29.3 million tonne per annum (mtpa) to 33.3 mtpa.
At an enterprise value (EV) of $305 million (around Rs1,940 crore), the implied EV on a per tonne basis works out to $76, which is nearly a 41% discount to replacement cost in India, analysts said.
While this makes the deal look lucrative, there are concerns that cannot be overlooked.
According to Kotak Institutional Equities, the history of Indian firms venturing into West Asia has not been very promising. “Ultratech acquired Star Cement for a consideration of $290 million in April 2010. In FY17, Star Cement had a revenue of Rs12 billion (Rs1,200 crore) with Ebitda of Rs2 billion and PAT of Rs718 million, with no significant growth in the past three years,"" it said in a report. 
Ebitda stands for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. PAT is profit after tax.
Others cautioned the UAE market is prone to price regulations and higher fuel cost, making it difficult to gauge the scope of improvement in margins for the acquired entity. The calculation of Edelweiss Securities Ltd shows UCC is likely to generate a low return on equity (RoE) of 6-7% at its current Ebitda margin of nearly 22%.
There is no risk of earnings per share, or RoE dilution, said the domestic broking house; but then, it doesn’t also see any great merit in the acquisition at current margins.
As the accompanying chart shows, most cement firm in UAE have similar Ebitda margins and a low RoE profile.
One may say the move is in line with the firm’s strategy of making acquisitions at lower costs and generating better return ratios. But how efficiently Shree Cement is able to meet its objective with this acquisition in a new geography is difficult to predict. “In our view, asset creation in India would have generated far higher returns for the amount invested and, hence, find it a sentimental negative in the immediate term,"" Edelweiss said.
UCC, which is currently a public joint stock firm listed on the Abu Dhabi Stock Exchange (ADX), will undertake the process of getting itself converted into a private joint stock company and delisting from ADX.
A slew of approvals are yet to be taken; hence, the transaction is expected to be completed in around nine months from now.
Meanwhile, the Shree Cement stock trades at a one-year forward price-to-earnings multiple of 35 times. It enjoys a premium over peers, given its ambitious target to become a pan-India firm by 2019 end and aims to surpass 40 mtpa cement capacity. The North-focused firm has been expanding domestically by adding capacities in other regions as well.
This means that to justify its rich valuations, domestic capacity additions have to be on schedule, and also this new acquisition has to prove lucrative. Without timely benefits of expansions reflecting in the company’s earnings, sustaining such high valuations will be tough."
15,2018-01-15,Shree Cement,"Shree Cement's shares on Friday fell Rs655.45, or 3.36%, to Rs18,856.50 on the BSE in a flat market, as analysts were worried about the management's ability to deal with local regulations

Kolkata: Investors and analysts are not impressed with Shree Cement Ltd’s plans to acquire a 4-million tonne cement plant in the United Arab Emirates for an enterprise value of $305 million, or Rs1,945 crore at current exchange rates. 
Kolkata: Investors and analysts are not impressed with Shree Cement Ltd’s plans to acquire a 4-million tonne cement plant in the United Arab Emirates for an enterprise value of $305 million, or Rs1,945 crore at current exchange rates.
A day after it announced the deal, Shree Cement’s shares on Friday fell Rs655.45, or 3.36%, to Rs18,856.50 on the BSE in a flat market, as analysts were worried about the management’s ability to deal with local regulations. Though the price to be paid by Shree Cement to acquire Union Cement Co. PSC—$76 per tonne—appears to have been “below replacement cost"", Indian companies have not had much success venturing into West Asia, said Kotak Institutional Equities Research.
Citing the example of Star Cement, which was taken over by UltraTech Cement Ltd in 2010, Kotak’s research report said the Abu Dhabi-based Star Cement has not had any “significant growth"" in the past three years.
Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd said in its report that though the acquisition is in line with Shree Cement’s strategy of adding production capacity at low cost, the management’s “execution capabilities"" in a new market are “yet to be tested"".
IDBI Capital Markets and Securities Ltd in its report said though it is being assumed the return on capital employed from the acquisition is going to be more than 10%, the UAE market “is prone to price regulations and higher fuel costs"".
Subhash Jajoo, chief financial officer of Shree Cement, said Star Cement under Ultratech hasn’t done too well because the local economy in West Asia went into a downturn after 2010. It continued until recently, but now the economy in West Asia is showing signs of recovery, according to Jajoo.
Oil prices have firmed up over the past 7-8 months, and if the current level is sustained, the economy in West Asia is in for a boom, he said, adding that several broking firms see Shree Cement’s acquisition as a “positive development"".
While announcing the acquisition on Thursday, Jajoo had said the price was attractive. Competitors had acquired units at much higher prices, paying even $110-120 per tonne. In addition, the Ras Al-Khaimah based Union Cement has access to a wide market in the Gulf region and in East Africa, its factory being located close to the Saqr port.
Besides producing 4 million tonnes of cement a year, the company produces 3.3 million tonnes of clinker, the key ingredient of cement. In 2016, Union Cement reported an operating profit of $33.7 million on a revenue of $153.4 million, which translates into an operating profit margin of 21.9%.
In India, Shree Cement produces 29.3 million tonnes a year, and is looking to scale up its production capacity to 40 million tonnes within two years. The company has a cash reserve of Rs4,000 crore, according to its chief financial officer."

 New Delhi: Shree Cement on Saturday reported an increase of 31.10% in its standalone net profit to Rs399.24 crore for the fourth quarter ended 31 March 2018. 
 New Delhi: Shree Cement on Saturday reported an increase of 31.10% in its standalone net profit to Rs399.24 crore for the fourth quarter ended 31 March 2018.
The company had reported a net profit of Rs304.51 crore in January-March quarter a year ago, Shree Cement said in a BSE filing.
Its total income was up 2.67% to Rs2,915.93 crore during the quarter under review as against Rs2,839.92 crore in the corresponding quarter last fiscal.
Shree Cement’s total expenses in Q4 FY 2017-18 were down 2.44% to Rs2,458.32 crore compared to Rs2,520.04 crore in the corresponding quarter.
For the financial year 2017-18, Shree Cement’s net profit was at Rs1,384.18 crore, up 3.36% from Rs1,339.11 crore in FY 2016-17. Its total income rose by 5.23% to Rs10,548.58 crore in FY 2017-18 as against Rs10,023.43 crore in the previous fiscal."
12,2018-04-30,Shree Cement,"Any ban on the use of pet coke is sure to hurt Shree Cement. This uncertainty is a looming threat for earnings, and consequently, valuations

Considering that the cement industry is battling multiple challenges of rising freight, fuel and power costs, the Bangur-owned Shree Cement Ltd put up a decent show in the March quarter. 
Considering that the cement industry is battling multiple challenges of rising freight, fuel and power costs, the Bangur-owned Shree Cement Ltd put up a decent show in the March quarter.
Investors, too, had subdued expectations. Hence, the 6% increase in cement sold and 9% increase in average realization when compared to the year-ago period is good news. It mirrors an uptick in demand in the northern and central regions that are strongholds of Shree Cement. 
Of course, one must take into account the low base that prevailed in the year-ago period, as the country was still reeling under the effect of the note ban. Further, a part of the increase in sales volume may have come from the Shree Cement’s aggressive increase in production capacity too. 
In any case, the 15% year-on-year (y-o-y) jump in net revenue to Rs2,811 crore beat Bloomberg’s average estimate. The cement segment drove up revenue, while the power segment that is less material to performance posted a revenue contraction. 
But the problem of rising costs is not yet behind Shree Cement. With a near 100% dependence on petcoke for its fuel, rising petcoke prices are weighing on profit margins. 
Fuel and power cost rose by 34%, while freight costs were up by 27% y-o-y, mainly due to higher diesel prices and overloading restrictions in some states. This was sufficient to dampen operating margin, which though was a tad higher than the year-ago level. Operating profit, although in line with the forecast, grew by 11.5%, lower than the revenue growth. 
But that’s not to say that Shree Cement’s premium valuations will ebb. The company is still among the lowest-cost producers of cement in the country with the best return ratios too. A report by Motilal Oswal Securities Ltd says that the brokerage expects a 29% compounded annual growth rate in operating profit led by healthy growth in sales volume and a steady uptrend in cement prices from here on. 
Brokerages are betting on higher government spend on infrastructure such as roads and recovery in the housing sector, both of which add up to be the largest consumers of cement. 
The dampener is the uncertainty around supply and price of petcoke, prices of which scaled new highs in the last few months. Meanwhile, any ban on the use of petcoke (to curb pollution) is sure to hurt Shree Cement. This uncertainty is a looming threat for earnings and consequently valuations."
11,2018-06-12,Shree Cement,"Shree Cement has budgeted for a capex of 3,500 crore in 2018-19, which includes 2,000 crore to be spent to conclude the acquisition of Union Cement

Kolkata: Shree Cement Ltd, one of India’s top three cement makers, has budgeted for a capital expenditure of  ₹ 3,500 crore in the current financial year, which includes  ₹ 2,000 crore to be spent to conclude the acquisition of a United Arab Emirates-based (UAE) firm. 
Kolkata: Shree Cement Ltd, one of India’s top three cement makers, has budgeted for a capital expenditure of  ₹ 3,500 crore in the current financial year, which includes  ₹ 2,000 crore to be spent to conclude the acquisition of a United Arab Emirates-based (UAE) firm.
The Kolkata-based company is looking to close the acquisition of Union Cement Co. PSC by July, a few months ahead of plans, according to Subhash Jajoo, Shree Cement’s chief financial officer. 
The Ras al-Khaimah-based company has concluded a buyback programme and is to be taken private.
The fully diluted cost of acquiring the overseas firm is expected to be around  ₹ 2,000 crore. But that wouldn’t hobble Shree Cement’s plans to scale up production capacity within India: the company will spend at least  ₹ 1,500 crore in the current financial year to acquire land and set up grinding units in Odisha, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and West Bengal, according to Jajoo.
An investment of  ₹ 1,300-1,400 crore has been budgeted to set up the grinding units in these states, which will ramp up Shree Cement’s production capacity by 7-8 million tonnes (mt) from 34.9 mt currently. 
These new facilities are expected to be commissioned in fiscal year 2020, said Jajoo.
In the current year, Shree Cement expects to commission its integrated cement plant in Gulbarga in Karnataka with a production capacity of 3 mt in October. The investment is  ₹ 1,800-1,900 crore to set up the unit, of which it borrowed  ₹ 1,600 crore. Shree Cement is currently indebted to the tune of  ₹ 2,200 crore.
Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd had in a recent report said that Shree Cement’s efficiency in managing costs, lower capital cost for expansion and plans for scaling up operations without leveraging its balance sheet are reasons for its being ahead of competition. 
The report also notes, however, that in the near term, the lack of pricing power remains a concern for the entire industry.
The management of Shree Cement, led by managing director H.M. Bangur, has historically avoided taking over existing capacity because it is of the view that it can set up plants ground up at a much lower cost.
But in January this year, it agreed to acquire the Ras al-Khaimah-based firm for an enterprise value of $305.24 million because it was available at a “competitive"" valuation of $75 per tonne of output, according to Jajoo. Union Cement produces 3.3 mt of clinker and 4 mt of cement.
Under the local securities market laws of Abu Dhabi, Union Cement had to be taken private by buying back shares from minority shareholder, Jajoo said. Whereas at the time of concluding the agreement to buy the unit, the controlling stakeholder’s ownership was 92.83%, it has now gone up 95-96% because of the buyback, Jajoo said.
The company had some 800-900 minority shareholders, who were offered 2.1 UAE dirhams per share for cashing out. The buyback price was significantly higher than the highest trading price of 1.85 UAE dirhams in the 12 months prior to the buyback, Jajoo said."

9,2018-11-19,Shree Cement,"Although Shree Cement continues to trade at a premium to ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements and UltraTech Cement, the company's performance is expected to remain challenging

Shree Cement Ltd’s September quarter (Q2) result was a mixed bag. 
Shree Cement Ltd’s September quarter (Q2) result was a mixed bag.
Cement sales volume grew 16% on a year-on-year basis aided by capacity expansions. Realization growth was muted, and operating margins contracted due to higher raw material and fuel prices.
Profit was dented by an exceptional loss of  ₹ 180 crore from investments in preference shares of Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS). The company also incurred forex losses.
Shree Cement also announced the setting up two greenfield projects in eastern India, which are expected to be operational by 2019-20. These projects include a 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) grinding unit in Cuttack and a 2.5 mtpa unit in Jharkhand.
Although the Shree Cement stock continues to trade at a premium to other large-cap cement producers such as ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd, the company’s performance is expected to remain challenging.
The trend of cement prices in its key markets including northern, central and eastern India remains volatile. In an environment of input cost inflation, the inability to take price hikes indicates further pressure on the margins of most cement producers, including Shree Cement.
The company’s decision to increase capacity comes at a time when there is already a situation of oversupply, and utilization levels are low, as demand growth is still not adequate. 
Some analysts are also wary that capital outlay of around  ₹ 900 crore required for these projects could strain the company’s balance sheet in the near term. 
Consequently, a slew of domestic brokerage firms including Edelweiss Securities Ltd, Reliance Securities Ltd and IDBI Capital Ltd have trimmed their target price on the Shree Cement stock. Some, such as Elara Securities (India) Ltd, have also cut the FY20 earnings estimates. 
As for the valuations, on a one-year forward price-to-earnings basis, the Shree Cement stock trades at a multiple of 35 times, which is expensive in the current scenario and needs to correct."
8,2018-12-14,Shree Cement,"Lack of clarity about growth plans of ACC and Ambuja Cements had investors worried, given competitors UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement had been aggressively adding capacities

After a hiatus of more than a year, pan-India cement producers ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd are expanding capacities. ACC will be incurring a capital expenditure of  ₹ 3,000 crore to add 5.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) cement capacity and 3 mtpa clinker capacity in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The company’s existing cement capacity stands at 33.41 mtpa.

ACC will be incurring a capital expenditure of  ₹ 3,000 crore to add 5.9 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) cement capacity and 3 mtpa clinker capacity in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. The company’s existing cement capacity stands at 33.41 mtpa. 
In a separate filing to stock exchanges, Ambuja Cements said that it will invest  ₹ 2,350 crore for a series of capacity additions. These include a clinker unit, a cement grinding unit, and a captive power plant and waste heat recovery system. Following these expansions, its total cement capacity will increase to 31.5 mtpa.
Lack of clarity about growth plans had investors worried, given competitors UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd had been aggressively adding capacities.
That explains the Street’s positive reaction to the expansion plans of ACC and Ambuja Cements. The two stocks have gained 4.8% and 2.6%, respectively, since the capacity expansion news became public.
Although the timeline of commissioning of capacities is not known yet, the worry of capacity overhang is behind these stocks.
“Capacity constraint was a key concern for both ACC and Ambuja. With these expansions, that overhang will be over. Going by ACC’s free cash flow at current levels, from FY2018-2020, the company could generate  ₹ 4,000-4,500 crore. So, internal accruals should be sufficient to fund the capex of  ₹ 3,000 crore. Capital is not a constraint for both these companies,"" said Binod Modi, senior research analyst at Reliance Securities Ltd. 
Since these companies had been abstaining from expanding capacities despite being flush with cash, some investors were worried that their parent firm LafargeHolcim might use these funds for further restructuring, points out another analyst.
He said because there was no plan on how their capital would be deployed, it gave peers UltraTech and Shree Cement an edge over them. On the valuation front, ACC and Ambuja Cements are trading at a discount to their peers.
However, analysts now expect these stocks to rerate and valuations to improve. 
Meanwhile, from the industry’s perspective, these expansions would weigh on the demand-supply scenario, especially in central India. Overall cement demand is yet to catch up with the spree of capacity additions that have happened recently. And that has kept the sector’s utilization levels below 70%. Secondly, higher supply in absence of adequate demand growth, would delay the sector’s price recovery, which is already subdued."
7,2019-02-22,Shree Cement,"Ambuja Cements' sales volume grew 4.4% y-o-y in the Dec quarter, much lower than peers' 8-10% volume growthNew capacities are likely to be commissioned only by 2020-end, capping sharp improvement in volumes until then

Some cement producers are relying on volume growth to drive earnings. Some others are sincerely hoping that recent cement price hikes will sustain, and will aid realizations. But Ambuja Cements Ltd doesn’t belong to either of these camps.
In the wake of capacity constraints, Ambuja Cements’ sales volumes grew 4.4% in the December quarter compared to the year-ago period. This is much lower than other pan-India cement makers who saw 8-10% volume growth. To be sure, the company’s plan to add capacities in Rajasthan should address this concern. But new capacities are likely to be commissioned only by the end of 2020, capping sharp improvement in volumes until then.
Secondly, Ambuja Cements has no presence in South India, where cement prices have been recently raised. So, investors shouldn’t expect much on the realizations front as well. The company has a large presence in the northern and western parts of the country, and dealer channel checks indicate that prices had declined by 1-3% sequentially during the quarter in these geographies.
Cement prices are expected to remain subdued in the run-up to the general election. Consequently, analysts have cut realization growth estimates for 2019 from 4-5% to 1-1.5%. Ambuja Cements follows a January-December fiscal year.
In short, the outlook on volumes and realizations for the company is muted. So, increased focus on cost optimization is the only feasible alternative that could aid its operating performance in the near term.
As the chart above shows, Ambuja Cements’ cost per tonne has been on the rise. Even though competitors—including UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd—have seen a rise in energy and freight costs, they are better placed compared to Ambuja Cements on volumes growth. ACC Ltd has managed costs more efficiently than the above-mentioned peers.
No wonder then that the Ambuja Cements stock is the cheapest among large-cap cement companies. The stock trades at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 7.8 times. EV stands for enterprise value, and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
Not many analysts are bullish on this sector due to the prolonged absence of price recovery. Still, if one has to choose from blue-chip cement companies, then Ambuja seems to be the least preferred."
6,2019-04-04,Shree Cement,"Over the past three months, nearly 7.5 million houses have been completed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY)While this may benefit UltraTech Cement and Shree Cement, it is not enough to move the needle on overall cement demand in India

A review of the government’s flagship scheme, Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, or Housing for All, shows mixed results. In fiscal year 2019, while the progress in rural India was fairly good, construction of homes in urban regions continued to lag.
Houses completed under the PMAY urban scheme stood at 1.9 million at the end of the March quarter, rising sharply from 1.26 million at the end of the December quarter, analysts at Antique Stock Broking Ltd said in a report on 1 April. Despite that, the government has been able to achieve just about 75% of the target.
Over the past three months, nearly 7.5 million houses have been completed under the PMAY. This seems impressive and should benefit central- and eastern-focused cement producers such as UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd.
But it is not enough to move the needle on overall cement demand in India. According to analysts, there are various estimates of incremental cement demand arising from this scheme. But even if one considers that the scheme has achieved more than 80% success, it won’t be sufficient to absorb the large supply that is available.
Secondly, housing demand—apart from the constructions under the PMAY scheme—remains subdued. Concerns over stress in rural India and a potential consumption slowdown could act as dampeners.
With a contribution of more than 60%, the housing sector is among the key drivers of overall cement demand. This is followed by infrastructure and commercial property.
“As per DIPP data, industry volumes increased by 11% year-on-year to 30 million tonnes in January 2019—we note that strong volume growth was despite a high base. Management narratives indicate strong demand from the infrastructure sector even though demand from the trade segment is relatively subdued,"" Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report on 27 March. DIPP is now department for promotion of industry and internal trade.
In short, given the inadequate demand growth, cement industry’s capacity utilization levels are unlikely to improve from the current 70% levels. As such, cement prices and profitability may remain under check."
5,2019-04-16,Shree Cement,"The to and fro on cement prices restricts clarity regarding better long-term realizations for cement firmsIt remains to be seen if govt-led infrastructure demand can compensate for overall housing demand

Mumbai: The good news for cement makers is savings from lower input costs, which would show from the March quarter. 
Imported petroleum coke (petcoke) prices declined by around 20% from the recent peak in August 2018. Similarly, domestic petcoke and international coal prices have eased.
As a result, power and fuel cost would soften by  ₹17.10 a tonne sequentially, according to JM Financial Institutional Securities Ltd. Year-on-year, savings for cement companies would be about  ₹54.50 per tonne, it said in a note on 15 April.
But the good news ends there. 
A larger concern is whether the revival in cement prices will persist.
As feared, the steep cement price hikes announced in early March failed to take hold in most parts of the country. Inadequate demand growth was no match for excess capacity and weighed on prices. Dealer channel checks by Kotak Institutional Equities showed cement prices dipped in many regions, barring the south and the east.
In March, all-India cement prices averaged  ₹334/bag. One cement bag weighs 50kg.
Still, cement companies continue to drive price increases in certain pockets. Media reports state that cement prices were hiked in some metros by  ₹25-30/bag in April as rural cement demand picked up. For now, realizations for cement companies may rise by 2-3% quarter-on-quarter, especially for south-exposed companies, said analysts.
But this to and fro on cement prices restricts clarity regarding better long-term realizations. Also, it remains to be seen if this government-led infrastructure demand can compensate for overall housing demand, they added.
Hopes aren’t too high, though. As pointed out recently, the mammoth Housing for All scheme has not been able to significantly absorb the excess capacity. And, unless the sector’s capacity utilization improves, a marked rise in profitability would be capped. In short, investors expecting blockbuster earnings from cement companies would be in for a disappointment.
Despite that, large-cap cement stocks continue to quote at multiples of 14-16 times one-year-forward EV/Ebitda. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. In the present context, these valuations appear rich and should now soften."
4,2019-05-20,Shree Cement,"The company stated that there could be some volume loss in the pursuit of value, indicating higher price realizationsThe Shree Cement stock hit a 52-week high of  ₹20,656.95 on the National Stock Exchange on Monday, though it closed lower at  ₹20,346.25

Shree Cement Ltd’s sales volumes grew 13% from a year earlier to 7.3 million tonnes in the March quarter, partially aided by capacity expansions. However, realization growth was unimpressive because the company’s sales were higher from the eastern region, where cement prices remained subdued.
The Shree Cement stock hit a 52-week high of  ₹20,656.95 on the National Stock Exchange on Monday, though it closed lower at  ₹20,346.25. According to analysts, the Street could be relieved that the company’s capacity expansion initiatives are now behind it. Shree Cement incurred  ₹6,000 crore in FY19 for this purpose. The focus is now expected to shift to improving utilization and profitability.
However, for cement producers, improving profitability or even utilization for that matter, would be easier said than done. That is because, though firms have been resorting to price hikes, it’s not clear whether these will be sustained. It is true that operating costs are moderating, but that alone is not enough.
A cement dealer channel check by Kotak Institutional Equities showed that price hikes, which started in the south in February, have become more broad-based since April.
All-India cement prices have increased from  ₹359 per bag, which weighs 50kg, in April to  ₹367 in May. Prices in the March quarter stood at  ₹328 per bag.
However, the survey also showed that demand in the June quarter of FY20, so far, has been stagnant in most regions. This means that, given the weak demand, these prices may not sustain, especially since the second quarter is a seasonally weak one because of the monsoon.
What could make the situation tricky is the company’s shift in strategy from volume to value. In a post-earnings conference call with analysts, the management guided for volume growth of 11-12% for FY20. However, it stated that there could be some volume loss in the pursuit of value, indicating higher price realizations. Further, the company has already launched two value-added products, including Shree Roofon in the south, in the last three months.
The Shree Cement stock trades at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of around 21 times. EV stands for enterprise value and Ebitda is short for earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. This makes it the most expensive cement stock among large firms. Given that some “ifs and buts"" still linger, these valuations are expensive and need to moderate."
3,2019-05-28,Shree Cement,"Better-than-expected March quarter earnings by companies are driving the rallyAccording to companies, input costs are likely to remain stable in the near term

A clutch of cement stocks touched their 52-week highs in the last two trading sessions. Stocks of large cement firms ACC Ltd, UltraTech Cement Ltd and Shree Cement Ltd, besides mid-caps like JKCement Ltd, JK Lakshmi Cement Ltd and Ramco Cements Ltd, made considerable gains.
A combination of factors is driving the Street’s sentiments towards these stocks. One, some firms have reported better-than-expected March quarter earnings. While capacity expansions aided volumes, softening input costs provided some relief to operating expenses. Managements of cement producers indicated that input costs should remain stable in the near term.
Two, the election is over. Given the lull in the real estate sector, spending on infrastructure and allied-activities have been the only support to cement demand in the recent past. Demand had weakened in the run-up to the general elections due to a combination of factors. Cement prices have increased, government projects have slowed down, and there was a shortage of labour and water in select states.
The hope is that the government’s increased thrust on infrastructure spending will revive cement demand. However, for the Street’s optimism to last, demand push won’t be enough. There has to be a meaningful improvement in cement prices.
A cement dealer channel check by Kotak Institutional Equities showed that price hikes, which started in the south in February, have become more broad-based now. All-India cement prices have risen from  ₹359 per bag, which weighs 50kg, in April to  ₹367 in May. Prices in the March quarter stood at  ₹328 per bag. That said, the survey also showed that demand has been stagnant in most regions in the current quarter so far.
Similarly, a sentiment survey of 250 entities across the construction value chain conducted by Crisil Research Ltd painted a grim picture of near-term cement demand.
“Pan-India cement demand shall post muted 3-5% growth in the current quarter-Q1FY20 with the states in East (Bihar, Odisha) and South (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu) moving at a snail’s pace of 2-4%. Northern and central states shall limit the fall by posting 6-8% growth in the ongoing quarter driven by institutional demand from roads, Metro, and affordable-housing. Further on the western side, while Maharashtra shall continue its healthy growth momentum in wake of upcoming state elections; Gujarat shall be laggard,"" said Hetal Gandhi, director at Crisil Research.
There is no harm in hoping that cement demand would pick up in the quarters to come. But existing capacity is quite large and demand growth has to be substantial to absorb it. Moreover, it needs to be accompanied by price hikes, which is doubtful for now because the June quarter is a seasonally weak one for the sector. Unless that happens, operating margins may not improve enough to justify the sector’s valuations."
2,2019-08-15,Shree Cement,"There are worries about a near-term capacity overhang in north and east India, from where the firm gets 80% of its volumesFrom its recent high of  ₹22,399 seen in July, the Shree Cements stock has fallen nearly 12%

Cement maker Shree Cement Ltd’s operating margin improved to a multi-quarter high of 29.7% in the June quarter. Like its peers, this was aided by a softening of input costs and better realizations. But the Street was far from excited. In fact, the stock has fallen 3% since the earnings announcement last week.
First, sales volume declined by 13% year-on-year to 6.1 million tonnes (mt). While sales of most cement producers fell in the June quarter, the fall in the case of Shree Cement was steeper than expected.
And given the weakness in the economy, the outlook on volume wasn’t bright. “We estimate weak sales in 1HFY20 to drag the company’s FY20 volume growth to 4%—its slowest growth in the last nine years,"" analysts at HDFC Securities Ltd said in a report.
Second, there are worries about a near-term capacity overhang in Shree Cement’s key operating regions of north and east India, where it gets more than 80% of its volumes. The company is adding 5.5 mt of grinding capacity in the eastern region, 2.5 mt of which has already been commissioned. The east is estimated to witness maximum capacity addition of more than 25 mt over the next two years, among any region. Channel checks by various brokerage firms showed that prices in the north and east have corrected by  ₹15-20 and  ₹20-25 per bag (each bag weighs 50kg), respectively, in July.
What’s more, as Kotak Institutional Equities pointed out that at a one-year forward EV/Ebitda of 20 times, valuations look stretched. EV stands for enterprise value, and Ebitda is earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. Some brokers have trimmed their target price on the stock, considering the above mentioned concerns.
From its recent high of  ₹22,399 seen in July, the Shree Cements stock has fallen nearly 12%. On the positive side, the higher benefits of falling power and fuel costs, along with softening of petroleum coke prices, are expected to flow in the forthcoming quarters. That said, one is unlikely to see a material improvement in the stock’s performance unless this is accompanied by robust volume and realization growth."
1,2019-11-19,Shree Cement,"Cement maker has appointed JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to the dealLarge firms such as UltraTech, ACC and Ambuja saw their sales volume decline in Q2

Shree Cement Ltd, India’s third largest cement maker, is at an advanced stage of raising more than  ₹2,000 crore through a qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering, two people aware of the development said.
“The money will be used for capex and debt reduction. They have been meeting investors for this purpose and are targeting to close this fundraise within this quarter,"" said one of the two people cited above. “They could raise anywhere between  ₹2000- ₹3000 crore depending on demand from investors.""
Shree Cement has hired JM Financial and ICICI Securities as advisers to manage the QIP, the people said, requesting anonymity. QIP is a tool, through which listed companies can sell shares, debentures, or any securities, other than warrants that are convertible into stocks, to a qualified institutional buyer.
While e-mails written to Shree Cement and JM Financial remained unanswered, ICICI Securities declined to comment on the matter.
Cement producers in the country have been hit by a prolonged monsoon season and falling cement prices amid an ongoing demand slump. While other large cement producers such as UltraTech Cement Ltd, ACC Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd saw their sales volume decline in the September quarter, Shree Cement was an exception.
In the quarter ended 30 September, the Rajasthan-based cement maker’s sales volume grew marginally at 1.5% to 5.72 million tonnes and net realizations rose 9% to  ₹4,654 per tonne from a year earlier. The company’s profit also rose over five times to  ₹309 crore, compared to the corresponding quarter in the previous fiscal.
On 19 October, the company’s board had said that it planned to raise as much as  ₹3,000 crore equity, in one or more tranches, through QIPs. It planned to use these funds for inorganic growth opportunities that may come up over the next 12-18 months, according to a 22 October note by HDFC Securities.
“Markets have done well recently and we have seen a few QIPs getting closed with Bajaj Finance raising almost $1.2 billion. In this environment, companies are eager to re-look at equity deals and we may see some more QIPs hitting the market,"" said the first person.
As of October, five companies have raised  ₹17,930 crore via QIPs, exceeding the  ₹10,489 crore raised by 13 firms in the entire fiscal year 2018, according to primary market tracker Prime Database.
Recently, consumer lending firm Bajaj Finance Ltd mopped up  ₹8,500 crore through private placements to qualified institutional investors. Subscribed over five times its size, the QIP got interest from foreign institutional investors including BlackRock, Nomura and Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund.
In September, private sector lender Axis Bank Ltd raised  ₹12,500 crore in India’s second-largest QIP from domestic institutions and large foreign investors, including GIC, Goldman Sachs, Fidelity, Nomura and American investors T Rowe Price and BlackRock. In August, another private lender, Yes Bank Ltd also raised  ₹1,930.46 crore through a QIP."
